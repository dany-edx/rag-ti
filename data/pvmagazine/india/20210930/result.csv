It led a $25 million Series A round that also saw support from Mayfield India Fund, 9Unicorns, and Survam Partners, alongside other existing investors.
BluSmart will use the capital to expand its fleet of electric vehicles and charging stations from its home city of Delhi to five additional Indian cities in the next two years. On the other hand, the investment will help bp move towards becoming a leader in India’s mobility market and to provide integrated energy and mobility solutions to help customers reduce their emissions across the world.
The electric ride-hailing industry in India is forecast to grow significantly, with mobility as a service projected to make up 15% of the 1.1 trillion kilometers to be traveled by passenger vehicles in India by 2030, compared to 5% of the 477 billion kilometers traveled today.
BluSmart aims to transform ride-hailing in India with the nation’s largest EV charging infrastructure and a growing fleet of electric vehicles to its advantage. The company’s business is quickly growing in Delhi NCR, which represents 20% of India’s mobility market. BluSmart estimates it to have already saved over approximately 1,500 tonnes of CO2, with more than 650,000 passenger trips completed to date.
Richard Bartlett, SVP future mobility & solutions, bp, said: “The electric mobility revolution will have a huge impact in reducing vehicle emissions in cities, which in India are growing quickly. BluSmart’s business model solves a number of key barriers to urban EV ride-hailing take-up, from the cost for drivers to the quality of customer experience. Our partnership is underpinned by shared values; caring for customers, colleagues and the environment, and with safety at the core of everything we do. We are excited to have made our first direct investment in India, to grow alongside the BluSmart business.”
Anmol Singh Jaggi, a co-founder of BluSmart, added: “We believe that electric mobility has huge growth potential, driven in part by the increasingly favorable economics behind electric vehicles. With that in mind, we want to redefine ride-hailing with electric vehicles, and our consumer focus has helped us to already establish a strong brand presence in our core market; to date, our vehicles have traveled over 21 million kilometers. This latest funding infusion will help us grow as we work with bp to help transform India’s high-polluting cities and redefine ride-hailing with electric vehicles.”
Sophia Nadur, managing partner at bp ventures, will join BluSmart’s board. To date, bp ventures has invested almost $800 million in more than 60 companies across seven geographies.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/30/renewables-vs-nuclear-256-0/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2021",Renewables vs. Nuclear: 256-0,"From pv magazine International
Global nuclear power capacity including grew by just 400 MW in 2020, according to the latest annual edition of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, published by French nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider. The lackluster results for nuclear compare to 256 GW of newly deployed renewable energy capacity last year, including 127 GW of PV and 111 of wind power.
“Nuclear power is irrelevant in today’s electricity capacity market,” the report’s main author, French nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider, told pv magazine, noting that power generation from nuclear power dropped by 4%, while non-hydro renewables increased by 13%. 
According to the report, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar PV dropped by approximately 90% over the past few years, while the LCOE of nuclear energy climbed by around 33%.
“We simply don’t have the time to waste attention, intelligence, manpower and funding for fantasy technologies that might or might not work, more likely, some time in the 2030s or 2040s, while affordable concepts from efficiency to renewables are readily available,” Schneider said, referring to the fourth-generation of nuclear power plants that several governments across the planet are presenting as a viable option. “Gen IV designs are PowerPoint reactors – they don’t exist. And the best example is Bill Gates, who started a company in 2006 to develop and promote a new design. Fifteen years later, he has nothing to show – no licensed design anywhere, no site, no prototype.”
Schneider claimed that the recent small modular reactor realizations in Russia and China are perfect demonstrations of the failure of the designs, as the floating reactors in Russia took 13 years to build – almost four times longer than anticipated. The small modular reactors in China also took a decade or more to be built.
“None of these designs are licensed in any Western country,” Schneider explained. “The only design licensed in a single Western country, NuScale in the U.S., is years behind schedule. Construction has not even started and a first unit is not expected to start operating before the end of the decade.”
Stagnating landscape
The report, which analyzes new-build programs in 33 nuclear countries and other potential newcomer countries, notes that 415 nuclear reactors were operating at the end of June throughout the world. That’s two less than by the end of June 2020, three less than in 2019, and 23 less than the 2002 peak of 438 GW. The operating plants have a combined capacity of 369 GW, which is 1.9% more than a year earlier. The authors of the report also noted that 278 reactors have been in operation for more than 31 years and that six of them have been operating for more than 50 years.
At the end of June, there were 53 new reactors under construction, totaling 54 GW and up 500 MW from the end of June 2020.
“All reactors under construction in at least 12 of the 17 countries have experienced, mostly year-long, delays,” the report said. “At least 31 of the building projects are delayed.”
The report shows that only five of the 13 reactors that had to come online last year were actually completed. Two of the projects under construction were started 36 years ago. 
Last year, construction began on five reactors – four in China and one in Turkey. In the first half of 2021, construction began on six units, of which three are located in China.
“Over the decade 2011-20, construction began on 57 reactors in the world, of which three have been abandoned. As of mid-2021, only 15 have started up, while 39 remain under construction,” the report said. “Between 1970 and mid-2021, a total of 93 or one in eight of a total of 783 constructions were abandoned or suspended in 19 countries at various stages of advancement.”
A total of 63 reactors were energized over the past decade. The average time between the start of construction and grid connection was 10 years.
The report also shows that total investment in  the construction of the 2020 projects was around $18.3 billion, but for only 5 GW of capacity. A total of $303.5 billion was invested globally in non-hydro renewables over the same time period, including 132 GW of PV and 73 GW of wind, it said.
The LCOE of PV in the United States dropped from $64/MWh in 2015 to $37 in 2020. By contrast, the LCOE of nuclear power rose from $117 to $163 per MWh, said the researchers.
“Over the past five years alone, the LCOE of nuclear electricity has risen by 39%, while renewables have now become the cheapest of any type of power generation,” the report said. “Globally the cost of renewables is now significantly below that of either nuclear power or gas.”
The authors of the report noted that the International Energy Agency (IEA) provides lower figures for nuclear power costs in 2020. However, it recognizes that there won’t be any improvements coming for nuclear, but major ongoing cost declines for offshore wind and solar.
“By 2050, solar PV costs are projected to be one fifth of those from nuclear power, across the EU, China, India, and US,” the report said. “In such circumstances, the building of any nuclear power plant would have to be driven by powerful non-market motivations.”
The report also provides insights on individual countries, including an update on the after-effects of the Fukushima and Chernobyl disasters, and the connection between nuclear energy and criminal activities. It also offers an overview of all decommissioning plans across the globe and potential newcomer countries.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/30/developer-calls-worlds-largest-solarstorage-project-the-first-of-many-to-come/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2021",Developer calls world’s largest solar+storage project ‘the first of many’ to come,"From pv magazine International
Singapore-based Sun Cable has revealed that the AUD 30 billion ($21.9 billion) Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPL) project, which will supply electricity to Singapore from a massive solar PV farm and battery energy storage facility in Australia’s Northern Territory, is the “first of many” mega-projects it aims to develop.
This week, Sun Cable announced the generation capacity of what is already shaping up to be the world’s largest solar and storage project, with the PV farm increasing from the original 10 GW to between 17 GW and 20 GW. The capacity of the battery energy storage system has also been boosted, from an initial level of 20 GWh to between 36 GWh and 42 GWh of storage.
The project, which is being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region, will supply power to Darwin and Singapore via a 4,500-kilometer high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750 km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800 km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore.
Sun Cable Chief Executive David Griffin told pv magazine on Friday that the project is not expected to be fully operational until 2028. However, he said that the group has already started preparatory work on other “similar size” projects, including some which would be based in Australia.
“We have already commenced work on subsequent projects,” he said. “This is the first of a kind in terms of the scale and intercontinental transmission, but we want this to be the first of many.”
Sun Cable said it recently cleared a key regulatory hurdle when the Indonesian government approved the route for the AAPL transmission cable, which will pass through the country’s waters. Indonesia’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, has confirmed that the country’s government has recommended the route of the submarine cable and has granted a subsea survey permit.
Griffin said the approval notice was a significant milestone that brought Sun Cable closer to generating and transmitting “affordable, dispatchable renewable energy to Darwin and Singapore.”
“Given how much of the route passes through Indonesian waters, securing the support of the Indonesian government is critical,” he said. “It means we can now undertake the rest of our subsea survey and that’s crucial to getting into the detailed design. We are developing the technology that integrates solar, storage and high-voltage direct-current transmission technologies, to meet the large-scale demand for renewable energy.”
Sun Cable said the project, backed by billionaires Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes, has the potential to export AUD 2 billion worth of solar electricity each year and deliver total carbon emissions abatement of 8.6 million tons of CO2 a year. The project will also supply up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs from 2028, reducing the city-state’s emissions by about 6 million tons per year.
Cannon-Brooks, the co-founder and CEO of software giant Atlassian, said that securing Indonesian support for the project was a major step toward realizing Australia’s potential to become one of the world’s largest renewable energy exporters.
“Australia can become a renewable energy superpower,” he said. “We can and should tap into our solar resources that could power the world five times over. Sun Cable is harnessing this at scale, and its Australia-Asia PowerLink will create massive local and international renewable energy opportunities.”
Griffin said the decision to increase the capacity of the project, flagged last month, had been driven by customer demand for more consistent renewable energy generation and improvements in solar PV and battery technology.
“It is the result of a couple of years of really deep analysis of where solar and battery storage technology is, optimising the system, and responding to a better understanding of what the market is demanding in terms of electricity supply,” he said. “Improved efficiencies, particularly around solar technology, means we can have higher installed capacity on the same land mass. The other part is responding to our customers who really want a flatter supply 24/7. To meet that we needed to increase the generation and we needed to increase the storage capacity as well.”
While a construction start date is yet to be set, Sun Cable expects to reach financial close at the end of 2023 with the first electricity supplied to Darwin in 2026. The first electricity is set to be exported into Singapore in 2027 ahead of achieving full commercial operations at the end of 2028.
