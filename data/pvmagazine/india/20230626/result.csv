https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/26/solar-passports-to-support-pv-waste-management-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RECYCLING,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 26, 2023",Solar passports to support PV waste management in India,"Researchers from the City University of Hong Kong have proposed a blockchain-based solar passports framework as an effective solution to monetize solar PV plant assets in India. It states such material passports will fill in the data gap during the entire life-cycle of PV modules—from raw material sourcing to manufacturing to dispose of—and aid in the reuse of raw materials and products in line with circular economy principles.
The framework would allow verification of the origin, quality, and quantity of materials used in PV panels, thereby boosting recycling investors’ confidence and facilitating the secondary market for PV assets. 
The researchers, Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar and Shauhrat S. Chopra, highlight the urgent need for integration of the proposed framework into existing or new policies and regulations in India. 
The researchers project India’s PV waste potential at 1.95 megatons resulting from the grid-connected solar PV facilities installed in the nation before January 31, 2019. 
The researchers modeled material recovery under three recycling techniques, namely, the standard industrial procedure as the baseline scenario, the thermochemical demanufacturing procedure, and the delamination procedure.
In the baseline scenario, the PV waste is directly subjected to shredding without removing a PV panel’s rear-side junction box. The shredded PV panels are then processed using metallurgical and induction sorting methods to recover materials. 
In contrast, in the thermal and chemical scenario, the end-of-life (EoL) PV panels are treated differently, where the junction boxes at the rear side of the PV module and cables are separated first. Thereafter, the remaining PV waste is subjected to thermal treatment followed by chemical treatment to recover materials. 
Similarly, in the delamination scenario, the junction boxes and cables are manually removed from EoL PV panels. The glass component is then isolated from solar cells during the cutting step of the recycling process, and thermal approaches are applied to recover useful materials from the residual waste.
The analysis indicates that the front glass of the PV module, which constitutes approximately 59.51% of its weight, is the most prevalent component for material recovery. Specifically, for every 1 tonne of PV waste, 595 kg of glass can be recovered, with the potential to recover around 89.6 to 98% of the glass under different recycling scenarios. 
[The recycling processes utilizing thermal and chemical treatments and the delamination exhibited similar yields of 583.23 kg per tonne, compared to 532.98 kg per tonne recovered under the baseline scenario.]
After glass, aluminum constitutes the second most proportion of a PV module’s weight, accounting for approximately 16.71% (with about 14.7% in the frame and nearly 2.01% in the solar cell). Considering the total estimated PV waste of 1.95 megaton, 286,937 tons and 3,904 tons are attributed to the aluminum in the frames and solar cells of the modules, respectively.
Steel, another material commonly used in PV panel frames, comprises around 8.65% of the module’s overall weight. The weight of EoL PV modules is 1.95 megatons with 168.84 ×103 tons of steel content in it. 
Copper, which is utilized in the junction box, electrical cables, and solar cells, constitutes about 1.90% of the module’s weight. The junction box and cables alone account for 37.09 × 103 tons of copper, while the solar cell contributes 38.84 ×103 tons, totaling 75.93 × 103 tons of copper used in PV modules. 
Silver represents 0.12% of the overall weight of a PV module.
The researchers found that total revenue of INR 284.48 billion (around $3.47 billion), INR 408.67 billion, and INR 435.40 billion is possible if the projected waste is recycled through baseline, thermos-chemical, and delamination procedures, respectively.

A research group in Japan has developed a new technique to repair failures of solder interconnections in photovoltaic panels.
“In the event of disconnection of busbars and solder ribbons in silicon solar modules, it will be possible to repair the faulty part on the spot,” the research’s corresponding author, Yu Kawano, told pv magazine. “We have developed a low-cost technology to extend the life of the solar cells, allowing them to recover their output directly at the outdoor installation site, without disassembling the solar module or removing it from the solar array.”
The novel methodology utilizes a portable induction heating system provided by Japan-based technology provider Toray Engineering Co., Ltd to repair the solder joint and interconnection failures. “It has a spot diameter of 2.0 mm and operates under a power of 3.5 kW, a frequency of 900 kHz, and a distance between the system and the PV module of 2.0 mm,” the researchers explained.
The team tested the induction heating system by applying it only to the region with the interconnection failures in damaged modules, with the heating time varying from 0.1 s to 10.0 s, and said that a heating time exceeding the 10.0 s threshold may result in further damage to the panels.
For the testing, the scientists utilized damaged and non-damaged modules with a back sheet/EVA/Si solar cells/EVA/cover glass structure, with the dimensions of 145 mm × 145 mm, and series interconnected solar cells with a size of 26 mm × 120 mm.
“According to the result, the optimized heating time of 2.0 s results in a more homogeneous bright across the entire module with high electroluminescence (EL) intensity lines in both horizontal and vertical lines,” they specified. “The too-long heating time of 10.0 s deteriorates the fill factor (FF) value to 0.765.”
The scientists said the system proved to be effective in decreasing the series resistance and recovering the performance of the damaged panels.
“It is noted that the more obvious recovery of the performance can be seen using this proposed repair method in the silicon PV module with the many failures of joints of solder and electrodes, solder, and interconnection ribbons,” they stated. “The optimized heating time for the disconnected Si PV module results in the recovery of the FF value close to that for the standard Si PV module, consistent with the recovery of the EL imaging.”
The new technique is described in the study “Development of repairing technique for interconnection of silicon photovoltaic modules using an induction heating system,” published in Solar Energy. The research group includes scientists from the Ritsumeikan University and Japanese copper wire manufacturer Showa Seisakusho Co., Ltd.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/26/china-solar-module-prices-keep-diving/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,PROCUREMENT,WORLD",,"JUNE 26, 2023",China solar module prices keep diving,"From pv magazine Global
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), OPIS’ benchmark assessment for modules from China, dived to $0.173 per W, falling for a fourth week running to its lowest value ever according to OPIS data. In the aftermath of Intersolar Europe, the market must reckon with clear signals that the region is oversupplied with modules, as well as how China polysilicon prices upstream are very close to their floor.
The 11.73% week-on-week plunge is also record-breaking in being CMM’s largest percentage drop ever.
It comes as OPIS contacts, during and since Intersolar, have almost unanimously highlighted that prices are falling fast and hard. The majority saw prices in the $0.170-0.175/W range, with numbers as low as $0.150/W heard. Some did not share prices as they assessed the degree of the drop.

With a similar unanimity, market players also lamented the overstocked state of Europe’s module inventories, which face falling values and which curtail further shipments. Europe installed a record 46.1 GW of solar power in 2022, according to a SolarPower Europe report. But around 85 GW of modules were shipped there last year, with the remainder ending up in warehouses owned by Chinese companies across Europe, according to a veteran market observer.
Given these modules represent 2022’s much-higher-than-present prices, it is better to get them sold now, before prices fall further and companies risk losing even more, the veteran added.
A continent away from Europe, China polysilicon prices have plummeted to CNY63.5 ($8.84)/kg, on the threshold of the CNY60/kg figure OPIS contacts generally consider the material’s cost figure. It is a “common consensus” that this market now faces overcapacity, said one source, who added that China’s tier-1 manufacturers alone have more than 100,000 MT of polysilicon stockpiled.
Looking ahead and in light of these bearish factors, module prices are expected to keep sliding, with one source expecting them to stabilize in the next quarter after the polysilicon and wafer segments have hit their cash cost.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
