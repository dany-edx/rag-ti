There is consensus among experts that this is primarily the result of human activities over the last 200 years.
Fossil fuel-based electricity generation is one of the largest contributors to climate change, it emits staggeringly large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Our dependence on fossil fuels started during the Industrial Revolution. Over the years, technology has now facilitated a gigantic increase in our electricity demand to support our lifestyle and industrial needs.
Renewable energy has emerged as a prominent solution to counter the challenge of climate change and depleting resources of fossil fuels. The number of countries committing to meet the net-zero CO2 emission goal by 2050 for the global energy sectors is increasing. Clean energy harvesting technologies, solar panels, and wind turbines are safe bets presently.
Since an early observation of the photovoltaic effect in 1839 by French physicist Becquerel and the first demonstration of the first solar panel at Bell Labs in 1954, a range of photovoltaic (PV) technologies have evolved.
The first silicon solar cells exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 6%, almost a quarter of current world record PCEs. The first solar cells were way expensive and had limited scope for commercialization.
Solar panel technology has advanced and rapidly matured in the last one and a half decades. A range of PV technologies, like crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafer-based, thin film-based, emerging solar cell concepts (examples, Perovskite solar cells and organic solar cells), and improved panel performance have driven significant cost reductions.
Advances in Si-based solar cell PCEs and production technologies have reduced PV electricity costs drastically from $2.1/Watt (2009) to $0.28/W (2019).
With the largest share (around 97%), crystalline polysilicon is the dominant PV technology in usage. The efficiencies of Si-based solar cells are approaching the theoretical efficiency limit of 29.3%.  Improving PCEs of solar cells and panels by using innovative materials and their processing will play a crucial role in lowering cost, eco-friendly production, and ways of PV installations in the future.
According to a recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar PV installed power capacity will become the largest by surpassing that of coal by 2027. In 2022, solar PV generation increased by 26%, reaching 1300 Terawatt-hour (TWh) and its growth surpassed wind for the first time in history. This generation growth rate is well on track as envisaged by the 2050 scenario for the net-zero emissions goal in 2023-30.
As in 2022, solar PV accounted for 4.5% of global electricity generation. India recorded an impressive growth by installing 18 GW of solar PV in 2022, which is 40% higher than in 2021. The solar power tariffs in India have seen a remarkable reduction from INR 17/kWh to less than INR 2.5/kWh.
Solar panels harvest freely available sunlight for electricity and can generate and deliver electrical energy locally. They also do not emit greenhouse gas (GHG) during their operation, although there are environmental concerns in the manufacturing processes. In the long term, the net impact on the environment is favourable.
Such characteristics make solar panels a potential green electricity generating technology committed to energy security with low CO2 emissions, and distributed PV systems deployment plays an increasingly important role.
The IEA report released in 2022 validates the importance of distributed deployment enhanced capacity in the commercial and industrial (25%) and residential (23%) segments. Alternatively, utility-scale plants shared half of the global PV capacity, the lowest since 2012.
The distributed small-scale rooftop PV deployment is favorable compared to establishing large-scale PV utility installations, which face the limitation of space and cumbersome sanctioning procedures in many countries. For future effective PV deployment, distributed and utility-scale installations of solar panels need to be developed in parallel, considering the requirements and space availability.
Given an exponentially increasing rate of PV electricity generation, solar panel installations will increase multiple times in the foreseeable future. The impact of such growth of solar panel coverage within cities on urban environment-buildings and the reciprocated effects of populated areas on the performance of solar panels are also subject to investigation.
Air pollution reduces the PCE of solar panel installations by 5-15%, and this effect is prominent in highly polluted urban environments. Solar panels mounted on the building roofs affect the energy balance of the building, influencing heating and cooling loads.
Despite a few limitations, PV installations in urban settings offer overall benefits. By an estimate, buildings in urban settings consume 30-40% of total electricity consumption, which crucially contributes to GHG emissions. A building-integrated PV (BIPV) to rooftops, windows, and facades converts buildings to zero-emitting systems.
In the fight against climate change, renewable energy in the next 30-50 years is desired. To meet this, PV technologies must increase their electricity-generating share to more than 23%. Such requirements present a mammoth challenge to the PV industry and research community.
Intensive research efforts are necessary for developing various types of PV technologies parallel to Si-based solar panels. Thin film-based PV technologies have great potential with the advantages of being flexible and lightweight. Future challenges to PV energy generation offer plenty of scope for emerging solar cell technologies to find application in niche markets of diversified new deployment for increasing solar energy uptake.

It stated the realization of past dues and regular payment of ongoing bills by discoms following the late payment surcharge (LPS) scheme also remain positives for the sector.
ICRA expects India to add 18-20 GW of RE capacity (from solar, wind and other RE sources) in FY 2024 and about 25 GW in FY 2025, compared to 15 GW in FY 2023. Much of this capacity addition will be from solar projects; new solar capacity addition in FY 2024 and FY 2025 is expected at around 17 GW and 20 GW, respectively.
“The sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices, abeyance of the order on Approved List of Models and Module Manufacturers (ALMM) till March 2024, and the timeline extension approved for solar and hybrid projects, are expected to lead to an improvement in RE capacity addition to 18-20 GW in FY2024 from 15 GW in FY 2023,” said Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president & group head – corporate ratings, ICRA Ltd.
“This, along with the growing project pipeline, is likely to support the scale-up in capacity addition to about 25 GW in FY2025, mainly driven by the solar power segment.”
However, Kadam said, challenges remain on the execution front concerning delays in land acquisition and transmission connectivity, which could hamper the capacity addition prospects.
Thermal power
ICRA projects the all-India thermal plant load factor (PLF) to continue to improve to 69.0% in FY 2025 from about 68% projected for FY 2024, led by the growth in electricity demand and limited thermal capacity addition.
ICRA’s outlook for the thermal power segment is Stable, supported by the healthy improvement in the thermal PLF, coupled with the reduction in dues from state distribution utilities (discoms) following the implementation of the LPS scheme since August 2022.
The rating agency projects the demand growth to moderate to 5.5-6.0% in FY 2025 from the 7.0-7.5% projected for FY 2024.
Kadam said, “The current under-construction thermal capacity is about 30 GW, which is predominantly in the Central and the state-owned generation segment and is expected to be commissioned over the next two to four-year period. In our view, there is a clear need for incremental capacity beyond this pipeline if the annual electricity demand growth continues to exceed 6.0% till 2030, after factoring in the renewable capacity addition. If annual demand growth is stronger at 7.5% till 2030, to meet the same, the incremental thermal capacity requirement will need to be as large as 70 GW.”
Coal has remained a dominant fuel source to meet India’s base load power demand, and its share in the overall energy generation mix is estimated to decline from 73% in FY 2023 to about 58-60% in FY2030, assuming 200 GW of renewable capacity addition between FY 2024 and FY 2030, as per ICRA estimates. Nonetheless, the share of coal in the generation mix is expected to remain significant till 2030.

Native grass and wildflowers were planted at the two solar facilities, operated by Enel Green Power North America, in early 2018. Between August 2018 and August 2022, the research group conducted 358 observational surveys of flowering vegetation and insect communities.
They found that total insect levels tripled, with native bees showing a 20-fold increase in numbers. The most commonly observed insect groups were beetles, flies and moths. An increase in native plant species was also noted, while pollinators from the solar sites were seen visiting and pollinating soybean flowers in adjacent crop fields.
Lee Waltson, a landscape ecologist and environmental scientist who was the lead author of the study, said the research “highlights the relatively rapid insect community responses to habitat restoration at solar energy sites.”
“It demonstrates that, if properly sited, habitat-friendly solar energy can be a feasible way to safeguard insect populations and can improve the pollination services in adjacent agricultural fields,” said Waltson.
The Argonne National Laboratory said the findings suggest that habitat-friendly solar sites could play an important role in conserving biodiversity and mitigating land-use conflicts associated with the conversion of farmland for solar energy production. It noted that this could be particularly beneficial for the future development of ground-mounted solar.
However, they warned that additional research is needed to understand the feasibility of habitat-friendly solar across different regions and to meet ecological goals such as conserving target insects or wildlife species.

Italian power utility Enel has secured a €560 million financing package for a 3 GW heterojunction solar module factory in Catania, southern Italy.
“The financing was made possible through a collaborative effort between the European Investment Bank (EIB), supported by InvestEU, and a pool of Italian banks, led by UniCredit and comprising BPER Banca  and Banco BPM, backed by SACE,” Italian bank Unicredit said in a press release. “The EIB financing also includes intermediated loans to commercial lenders for €118 million, which could be increased to up to €342 million in 2024, bringing the total EIB intervention in support of 3Sun to €389.5 million.”
The total investment in the module factory amounts to €600 million, with the European Union and the Italian government contributing up to €188 million to the TANGO (iTaliAN pv Giga factOry) project.
Enel’s unit Enel Green Power started building the factory in May 2023, with completion initially scheduled for summer 2023.
The company is betting on n-type heterojunction (HJT) cell with an efficiency of 25.5%. It said this could result in module efficiencies above 24%. From 2026, Enel plans to offer even more efficient solar modules based on tandem silicon-perovskite cells.

Analysis firm Wood Mackenzie forecasts the solar industry will shift from a high growth industry to a slower-growing, mature industry in 2024.
According to predictions in a new report shared with pv magazine, annual average growth will be flat over the next eight years, bucking a trend of rapid growth over the last decade. Between 2024 and 2032, global solar installations are expected to reach around an average of 350 GW each year, peaking at 371 GW of installed solar in 2025 and 2030.
“Starting in 2024, the industry is officially past the inflection point, characterized by a slower growth pattern. The global solar market is still many times larger than it was even a few years ago, but it’s natural for an industry’s growth to slow as it matures,” the report says. “In this new era of solar growth, companies will need to be more diligent and focused than ever. Competition amongst suppliers will intensify and efficiency improvements will be critical to remaining profitable”.
Wood Mackenzie says a few major markets are driving this new growth pattern. China’s solar market is expected to reduce slightly in 2024. While it will continue to be the world’s largest market, it is predicted to shrink due to grid infrastructure investments not keeping pace with project growth, changing revenue schemes for utility-scale solar reducing prices and distributed solar growth slowing.
Europe, which saw annual installation growth of 38% in 2022 and 26% in 2023, is expected to see an average annual growth of 4% over the next five years. The report cites a spike in retail rates as the energy crisis wears off, the slowing down of distributed solar growth and grid infrastructure capacity limits for the slowing down.
Average growth in the United States, which reached 27% between 2019 and 2023, is expected to fall to 6% between 2024 and 2028. But Wood Mackenzie expects the full breadth of the Inflation Reduction Act to materialize in 2024. It predicts this will lead to more contracted utility-scale solar projects, benefits for the distributed solar segment, and see the US domestic module manufacturing sector nearly triple in 2024, with 40 GW of capacity expected to be operational by the end of the year.
The analysis firm also forecasts solar manufacturing will face “a reckoning” in 2024.
Market expansion has been primarily driven by China, whose module manufacturing capacity alone is already nearly three times global demand. This oversupply is driving China to module price record lows and Wood Mackenzie says cheaper Chinese modules will challenge many countries’ plans to build out vertically integrated domestic solar supply chains. It predicts many planned facilities will fail to materialize, while existing facilities will be hard-pressed to stay in business as utilization rates decline.
“This is not new – solar manufacturing is known as being a notoriously challenging business. But the sector has also never been this large. With global demand growth slowing, manufacturers will have to be as innovative as ever to remain a going concern,” the report states.
