https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/02/luminous-unveils-integrated-lithium-battery-inverter/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 2, 2022",Luminous unveils integrated lithium battery inverter,"Luminous Power Technologies has unveiled Li-ON series inverters with integrated lithium-ion battery as a compact, safe and efficient power backup solution for retail and domestic segments. The new inverters provide high rated performance with negligible maintenance compared to conventional battery-based inverters.
The integrated lithium battery promises a three times longer life than conventional batteries. Additionally, the inverter supports fast charging and can completely charge the battery with grid electricity in just four hours.
Li-ON 1250, the first in the Li-ON series, features a battery management system (BMS) that manages the performance of both the inverter and the battery, thereby increasing its performance and life. The 1,100VA inverter can run a maximum of 880W of load and is ideal for running up to a three-bedroom house or a large showroom with a backup time of more than three hours at 50% load. An advanced LCD screen displays running statistics like battery charging time and backup time.
“The product supports energy efficiency with less power required to charge the lithium-ion battery than conventional batteries. In addition, the lithium battery provides a consistent backup over its lifecycle,” Amit Shukla, senior vice president and head (Power Solutions Business), Luminous Power Technologies, told pv magazine.
Space is not a constraint with Li-ON integrated inverters. “Customer need not look for a separate space to keep this inverter as it’s quite compact, approximately 60% lesser in size than conventional battery-based solutions,” added Shukla.
The Li-ON power backup solution is safe as it eliminates the risk of accidental contact by doing away with wires and terminals. Its pure sine wave output protects connected appliances from voltage surges and short circuits.
“Overall, the product is designed to offer new-age features which add value to the lives of the consumer. Three times longer battery life, three times faster charging, consistent backup time, maintenance-free and five-years warranty are real differentiators and drivers for any consumer to buy this product,” as per the company.
Loads supported by the 1100VA model include lighting, TV sets, refrigerators, audio systems, fans, and computers but not air-conditioners and microwave ovens.
“The electronics part, including the battery management system, is in-house designed and manufactured by Luminous. So, we are only outsourcing the battery component. Moving forward, we plan to start assembling batteries too in-house only,” said Shukla.
Luminous plans to launch more products in this particular segment with this technology by the end of this year. It is also working on other lithium technology products that are ready to connect to solar power too.
Luminous’ Li-ON integrated inverter is priced at approximately INR 50,000 and will initially be available across Metro and Tier-1 locations in India. The company plans to leverage its existing sales network of more than 35,000 distributors and dealers to reach households across the country.

Researchers at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have been seeking for several years to reduce silver usage — a main concern for the PV industry — in the metallization of TOPCon solar cells, for which relying on lower amounts of the precious metal is crucial to reduce manufacturing costs and gain further market share.
Recently, a group of scientists from the German institute used contacts based on galvanic nickel (Ni) copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) instead of common silver contacts to fabricate an n-type bifacial TOPCon cell that is claimed to achieve higher efficiency than its counterparts with printed silver contacts, while also reducing silver consumption by 90%. “Even in industrial production, this galvanic metallization enables significant silver savings without having to compromise on efficiency,” said researcher Sven Kluska.
Designed for screen-printed metallization, the cell was fabricated with an industrial-type boron emitter on the textured front side passivated by a stack made of aluminium oxide and silicon nitride (AlOx/SiNx). The rear side was made with a TOPCon layer with a tunnelling oxide and a highly n-type doped poly-Si layer which is covered by a SiNx layer.
“The plating process combines two single side electroplating steps of a Ni/Cu/Ag stack subsequently on each side,” the scientists said referring to the metallization technique used. “The Ni and Cu were supplied by Atotech Group, whereas the Ag electrolyte is identical as presented by Grübel.”
The rear TOPCon side is initially plated by performing a hydrofluoric acid (HF) pretreatment process intended to remove native and laser-induced oxide layers within the laser contact opening (LCO). In a second step, a Ni-Cu stack is deposited by light-induced plating (LIP) and finished by an Ag immersion plated capping.
The performance of the plated cell, which has a full area of 268 cm2, was compared to that of a similar device that went through screen-printed metallization. The champion plated device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.84%, an open-circuit voltage of 709 mV, a short-circuit current of 40.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.2%. The screen-printed cell showed an efficiency of 23.46%, an open-circuit voltage of 708 mV, a short-circuit current of 40.4 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 82.0%
Reducing the LCO width and adapting the number of fingers, the plated contacts benefit from narrower contact widths down to 5.5 μm, allowing a short-circuit current gain of nearly up to 0.5 mA/cm2, the academics explained. “There were no indications of the LCO width impacting the contact adhesion. Optimization of the HF pretreatment prior to the plating process showed an improvement of the contact resistivity allowing to stabilize the fill factor above 82% despite smaller contact geometries than the screen-printed references.”
The cell and the related manufacturing process are described in the paper Progress of plated metallization for industrial bifacial TOPCon silicon solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics. “Plating metallization reveals to be a suitable candidate to metallize i-TOPCon solar cells with high efficiencies exceeding the screen-printed baseline metallization,” the scientists concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/02/plug-play-electrolyzer-for-green-hydrogen-production-from-germany/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 2, 2022",Plug & play electrolyzer for green hydrogen production from Germany,"From pv magazine Global
Germany-based electrolyzer manufacturer Enapter has unveiled a new electrolyzer that is said to be suitable for projects of all sizes via “plug-and-play” operation.
The EL 4.0 electrolyzer is the fourth generation of the patented anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer that the company has been developing since 2017. According to the manufacturer, its technology relies on cheaper materials than the competing proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Enapter’s new product is lighter and smaller than previous models and is ISO 22734 certified. The standardized modules could be plugged together for projects of any size.
The AEM electrolyzer is available in four versions – AC, DC, air-cooled, or water-cooled. It is claimed to enable the production of 1.0785kg of high-purity hydrogen per day. The maximum power consumption is 3.0W with water consumption of 0.4 liters per hour. The device measures 482x635x266mm and has a weight of 38kg.
n response to an inquiry from pv magazine about the cost of the electrolyzer, Enapter said that the new electrolyzer is not yet in mass production but can already offer a price reduction of up to 35% compared to the price of its previous module.” With the ramp-up of mass production in Germany, the costs for the production of green hydrogen would then fall below those for hydrogen from fossil fuels,” the spokesperson from the company stated.
The plug-and-play products could be used in a wide variety of applications, thus promoting decarbonization in the energy, transport, industry and building sectors. In addition, it is quick to install. “The EL 4.0 will be a building block for system integrators, enabling them to quickly introduce hydrogen production and realize the market ramp-up needed globally. We are sure that the future mass production of these AEM electrolyzers will fundamentally change the production of green hydrogen,” said Sebastian-Justus Schmidt, co-founder and CEO of Enapter.
