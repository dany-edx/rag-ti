The chief minister said that Madhya Pradesh is achieving self-reliance in the energy sector due to the works being done in renewable energy, including setting up ultra-mega solar projects. 
The Rewa ultra mega solar project—one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects—has started generating power at its full capacity. It is generating 750 MW of electricity daily. Significantly, the power generated by it is also being supplied to the Delhi Metro apart from the state’s power distribution companies.
Among upcoming projects, a 600 MW floating solar project is being set up on the Narmada River at Omkareshwar. The World Bank has started a survey for the project. The project will cost INR 3000 crore.
Solar parks are being developed in the Neemuch, Shajapur, Agar, Morena, Chhatarpur and Sagar districts of the state. The parks, with a combined power generation capacity of 4500 MW, will be set up at about INR 18,000-crore investment.
Under the Atmanirbhar Madhya Pradesh roadmap 2023, the State government aims to install 45,000 solar pumps at subsidized rates in farmers’ fields. So far, 22,673 solar pumps have been installed.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/25/renew-power-to-merge-with-us-firm-for-nasdaq-listing/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",ReNew Power to merge with US firm for NASDAQ listing,"India’s ReNew Power has announced a merger agreement with a US-based special-purpose acquisition corporation as it seeks to become a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ.
The Goldman Sachs-backed renewable power producer’s transaction with NASDAQ-listed RMG Acquisition Corporation II (RMG II) implies an enterprise valuation of around $8 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. 
Upon completion of the transaction with RMG II, the combined entity would be named ReNew Energy Global PLC and expected to be listed on the NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol “RNW.”
“The pro forma consolidated and fully diluted market capitalization of the combined company would be approximately $4.4 billion at the $10 per share private investment in public equity (PIPE) subscription price, assuming no RMG II shareholders exercise their redemption rights. Gross cash proceeds are estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of $855 million from the PIPE and approximately $345 million of cash held in trust by RMG II, before any adjustments due to potential redemptions by RMG II shareholders,” according to a joint statement by Renew Power and RMG II.
ReNew’s management, and its current group of stockholders, including Goldman Sachs, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and JERA Co., Inc. (JERA), among others, who together own 100% of ReNew today, will be rolling a majority of their equity into the new company, and are expected to represent approximately 70% of the effective company ownership upon transaction close.
ReNew’s leadership will remain intact, with Sumant Sinha as Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, overseeing its strategic growth initiatives and expansion.
Plans
According to the joint statement, net proceeds of approximately $610 million would be used to bolster ReNew’s leading position in solar and wind energy generation for the Indian market, by funding medium-term growth opportunities, as well as pay down debt. 
Sumant Sinha, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of ReNew, said. “Over the next decade, ReNew plans to maintain its track record of market share growth, and contribution to the greening of the Indian power sector, and to help meet the Indian government’s ambitious renewable energy targets. Over time, we will expand our capabilities even further, with utility-scale battery storage, and customer focused intelligent energy solutions.” 
RMG II is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. It intends to capitalize on the ability of its management team to identify, acquire and operate businesses across a broad range of sectors that may provide opportunities for attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns.
Earlier this month, the company announced the closing of its initial public offering of 48,300,000 units, resulting in gross proceeds of $483,000,000. 
“When we closed our IPO in December, we were looking to partner with a company driving change on a global scale, with a proven track record, and best-in-class management,” remarked Bob Mancini, Chief Executive Officer and Director of RMG II. “We found that company in ReNew.” “Its commitment to measured growth through long-term partnerships with Indian central and state government agencies, scale, technological innovation, and strong financial position should enable ReNew to take advantage of the incredibly positive trends in the Indian power market over the next decade and beyond.” 
Founded in 2011, ReNew is India’s leading renewable energy independent power producer (IPP), and among the top 15 largest renewable IPPs globally by capacity, with a portfolio of more than 100 operational utility-scale wind and solar energy projects spread across nine Indian states. The company also owns and operates distributed solar energy projects for more than 150 commercial and industrial customers across India.
ReNew is presently the only company in the Indian renewable energy sector with over 5 GW of operational capacity. The company currently has an aggregate capacity of close to 10 GW (including capacity won in competitive bids).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/25/essar-power-to-set-up-90-mw-solar-plant-in-madhya-pradesh/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MADHYA PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Essar Power to set up 90 MW solar plant in Madhya Pradesh,"Mumbai-headquartered Essar Power has announced it will set up a 90 MW solar PV project in Madhya Pradesh. 
The board of Essar Power Ltd, an investee company of Essar Global Fund (EGFL), has approved an INR 300-crore investment in the PV plant, marking the fund’s foray into renewable energy.
Currently, Essar Power has a power generating capacity of 3185 MW across five multi-fuel plants in two Indian states (Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh) and one thermal power plant in Canada.
The proposed solar plant will come up across 105 hectares of land at Bhander in the Datia district and will be executed in two parts of 33.7 MW and 56.17 MW.
Electricity generated from this plant will be evacuated at 132 kV level and is proposed to be connected to Bhander 132/33 kV substation, which is located at approximately 5 km and will be supplied to industrial consumers within Madhya Pradesh. The project is expected to be completed by June 2022.
Shift away from coal
The entry into renewable energy is part of EGFL’s strategic decision to rebalance its power portfolio from coal-fired to green energy after investing in hydrogen power in the UK and coal gas in India.
The fund has overseen the completion of the deleveraging program of investee companies in next two quarters. It intends to repay balance debt INR 10,000 crore, which is largely in power portfolio.
“The strategic plan to rebalance our energy portfolio is in line with our move to an asset light structure. In a series of calibrated steps, this shift will allow the company to bring down its debt from the current level of INR 10,000 crore to INR 3,000 crore through restructuring and monetization of existing assets and further investments in this green portfolio,” said Kush Singh, CEO, Essar Power Ltd.
Essar’s foray into renewable energy can be seen as a precursor to an exit from coal following the success achieved in unconventional energy generation such as coal bed methane and the ongoing hydrogen generation programme in Stanlow refinery, UK.
 “Along with the ongoing hydrogen generation programme in our Stanlow refinery, UK, we have kicked off our transition to a new phase of investment led growth, with the energy portfolio taking the lead,” said Singh. “We have taken this step in line with the major thrust given by the government of India in promoting and achieving the ambitious target of an installed capacity of 450 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030.”
