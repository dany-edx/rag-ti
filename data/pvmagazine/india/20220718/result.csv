It will install polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis-based green hydrogen plants at various locations in Nepal over three years. The plants will have a green hydrogen output of 4,000 metric tonnes per year.
API Power will invest INR 1,000 crore in the project. It has proposed its existing hydro and solar project sites for the hydrogen plants.
The first in the series, a pilot green hydrogen plant of 1 MW, will come up at API Power’s 8.5 MW Naugarh Gad hydroelectric project site.
Sanjeev Neupane, managing director, API Power, said, “Nepal is rich in hydropower with 20 GW of projects under development. The seasonal nature of resources from the vast network of rivers necessitates hydrogen storage,” said Sanjeev Neupane, managing director, API Power.
Shreya Agarwal, Lead Strategy and Operations of GreenZo Energy, said the MoU will come into effect from July 18, 2022, and will remain active until the proposed projects are completed by 2025.

Before joining Pennar, Sangwan was the country head for China-headquartered Econess Energy, where he managed the company’s India business of solar PV modules and cells. 
Sangwan also worked with solar project developer ReneSola as India head from Dec. 2013 to Oct. 2019. ReneSola, earlier based in Shanghai, announced its decision to exit the India market in 2019, saying the profit margins were not high enough in this market. It now has its corporate headquarters relocated to the U.S. 
Pennar Industries has a state-of-the-art solar module manufacturing facility in the Sangareddy district of Telangana. The facility has a production capacity of 250 MW per year, which is equipped to produce polycrystalline, monocrystalline and bifacial photovoltaic solar modules ranging from 315 Wp to 400 Wp. Pennar claims to have manufactured and shipped more than 200 MW of solar modules.

The projects can be located anywhere in India. The selected developer shall set up RE power projects on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. The nominated zonal railway will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement with the successful developer.
The RE generation (solar, wind, and hydro) components and the ESS may be co-located or located at different locations. 
“Already commissioned projects will not be considered under this RfS. However, projects under construction or not yet commissioned will be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes,” states the tender document.
A single developer can bid for 250 MW up to the entire 1 GW capacity.
In a separate tender, REMC has invited bids to set up an aggregate 1.548 GW capacity of land-based solar plants near the traction sub-station (TSS) at 25 kV connectivity. The capacity is to be installed on a build-own-operate basis across different zonal railways.

The global average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from solar power fell 13% last year, despite the significant rise in materials costs and panel prices.
That was partly because so many of the world’s large-scale solar projects have a long lead in times and contractual clauses limiting cost increases, according to a new report published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) this week. The result was a global solar electricity cost of $0.048/kWh, according to the IRENA study. China once again posted the lowest solar LCOE at $0.034/kWh in 2021, but there were notable reductions in Australia, where solar was 21% cheaper than in 2020, at $0.042/kWh. Japan, meanwhile, recorded a 17% year-on-year decline to $0.086/kWh.
India offered the world’s second cheapest solar power, at $0.035/kWh, in part thanks to the world’s lowest PV project costs which, at $590 per kilowatt of generation capacity installed, were 6% lower than Chinese solar farm prices. Most of the world’s biggest markets saw their solar plant investment costs fall in 2021, but policy uncertainty in pre-invasion Ukraine drove up project expenses by 17%, year on year, resulting in a solar LCOE of $1.117/kWh.
Spain also saw project costs rise by 3%. That reflected the hyper-competitive, unsubsidized plants that came online in 2020, but did not appear on the same scale last year, when developments cost an average $916 per kilowatt and the LCOE was $0.048/kWh. Vietnam posted a solar LCOE of $0.046/kWh last year, with solar electricity costing $0.055 per unit of power in the United States, and $0.064 in Turkey.
The report’s authors suggest the solar price rises bottled up last year are likely to feed into the market this year in the shape of 3% to 5% project cost increases – of $20 to $60 per kilowatt installed – in the world’s 10 biggest solar markets. That would translate into a 2% to 4% rise worldwide for utility-scale solar and a 2% global rise in the cost of solar electricity.
The document pointed out, however, the soaring price of fossil fuels this year, in particular gas, means the solar capacity added last year – and accumulated to date – has brought huge savings. The report stated: “It remains remarkable that more effort has not been made to accelerate renewable power generation deployment in 2022, over the past nine months.”
IRENA estimated the solar capacity added last year reduced power generation costs by around $11.3 billion, compared with today’s fossil fuel costs, including a $1.3 billion saving in non-OECD countries. The solar added in such nations from 2010 to last year is saving around $2.7 billion per year at today’s fossil fuel prices, the report added.
For its headline figure, IRENA said almost two-thirds of the clean power generation capacity added in 2021 (some 163 GW) was installed at a lower cost than the cheapest fossil fuel-based alternative.

Researchers at Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH) are currently investigating the durability and performance of PV inverters and power optimizers from a total of 1,280 PV systems located in Switzerland.
In their survey, the researchers considered the type of power electronics, the year the PV system was commissioned and the year the first energy-related fault occurred. Their evaluation revealed an average time until the first energy-related error occurred. “The results of all the inverters and power optimizers examined show that over 50 percent of the power electronics do not show any yield-relevant errors up to the age of 15,” the researchers wrote in their preliminary findings.
The data also showed that lifespans depend on various factors. For example, more powerful PV inverters have shorter service lives, while the power optimizers considered individually lasted the longest. However, it should be noted that the overall reliability of a PV system increases with a smaller number of electronic power components.
The Swiss scientists further found that outdoor power electronics are more susceptible to interference than indoor PV inverters and power optimizers. At the same time, they discovered that the first fault occurs earlier in PV systems with inverters with power optimizers than in systems that do not have power optimizers. The service life of the devices also varies depending on the manufacturer.
The researchers specified, however, that the validity of their results is limited, as it is a non-representative cross-section of the power electronics used in rooftop systems in Switzerland or Europe. The PV inverters considered came mainly from the manufacturers Fronius, Sputnik, and SMA and most of the power optimizers examined came from Solaredge.
The causes of the failures and defects have not yet been precisely recorded. In general, the failure of a power optimizer usually results in a lower loss of yield in a PV system rather than the failure of an inverter. Nevertheless, both defects were rated in the same in the evaluation. A fundamental distinction should also be made in that defective power optimizers are usually replaced, while defective inverters are repaired.
Despite the limited extent of their work, the BFH researchers did dare to draw a conclusion on their previous data. They believe, in fact, that the “the rule of thumb that inverters should run without faults for around 15 years” is confirmed by their findings. The research project will run until the end of 2025 and the investigation will be repeated in the future and extended to other systems.
