The company attributed the growth to savings in finance cost and better performance in the renewables business.
Revenue from operations increased 18% to INR 9,810 crore from INR 8,290 crore in Q2 last fiscal year. Quarterly income stood at INR 10,187.33 crore compared to INR 8,441.60 crore in Q2 FY2020-21.
Commenting on the company’s performance, Praveer Sinha, CEO and managing director, Tata Power, said, “The robust performance during this quarter is a reflection of our continued focus on our well-calibrated business strategy. All our business divisions and subsidiaries have reported strong results. Our consolidated financial performance was exceptionally strong on the back of robust underlying business performance.”
Sinha highlighted Tata Power’s focus continues to be towards the expansion of its renewable and distribution businesses and go green in the existing generation business The company aims to scale up the share of renewable energy in its portfolio to 80% by 2030 from 32% currently.
Tata Power’s renewable portfolio grew by 10% in Q2 over Q1 FY 22, with the addition of 256 MW capacity and bids won for 580 MW.
Among major highlights for Q2 FY2022, Tata Power commissioned a 100 MW solar project at Raghanesda Solar Park in Gujarat and a 150 MW solar PV project at Lohakari, Rajasthan. It also landed a 330 MW solar project from Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Ltd (RUMSL) in Madhya Pradesh, in addition to receiving the ‘Letter of Intent’ (LoI) from Maharashtra State Power Generation Co. Ltd. (MAHAGENCO) to set up 250 MW grid-connected solar plant in Maharashtra. The company has also been awarded EPC work for India’s first-ever large-scale 50MWh battery energy storage system co-located with a 50 MWp solar PV plant in the Leh district of Ladakh.

Israel-based underground compressed-air storage specialist Augwind has finalized the construction of its first compressed air storage system for commercial application.
The 250 kW/1 MWh AirBattery system will be connected to a PV system located nearby and will be used for behind-the-meter services by the collective community of Yahel, in the southern, desert part of Israel.
“As part of the test run operations, all system components were activated independently and in sequence, a number of charge and discharge cycles were performed, culminating in electricity generation,” Augwind CEO Or Yogev told pv magazine. “This is the first time since the feasibility study at Yakum that the AirBattery system is being tested on a commercial scale of 1 megawatt-hour, this is a significant milestone for Augwind in its technological roadmap, ahead of the construction of high-voltage commercial projects in the future.”
The system works according to the same principles of Augwind’s large scale projects. It is based on two compression inflatable polymer tanks that are placed in the ground close to each other, in addition to a series of storage tanks. The tanks are covered by steel frames, which create a sort of cage around them, and these are then placed in holes at a depth of 4m.
Renewable energy is used to power standard water pumps, which inject water into the compression tanks. The tanks are sealed, so the air they contain starts to be compressed up to the top and then shifts to the storage tanks. With on-demand energy, the compressed air is released from the storage tanks to drive a powerful water turbine which is used to generate electricity.
“The 250 kW/1 MWh system is [a] first of its kind combination of pumped-hydro and compressed-air energy storage in a modular and scalable technical approach that can provide distributed, long-duration energy storage for a variety of applications,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The AirBattery is using circular water and air as raw materials, with pumps and turbine for power charge and discharge, and compressed-air as the storage element, implemented with Augwind’s proprietary underground tanks, enabling dual land use above the system.”
Compressed air energy storage (CAES) may become an interesting solution for countries such as Israel, with weak interconnection with their neighbors, according to scientists from Finland’s Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). Crucial for the identification of an ideal location for large scale CAES projects, should be the proximity to renewable energy infrastructure and the electric grid.

French start-up EODev has launched a new hydrogen power generator that is claimed to be suitable for isolated sites, emergency applications, protected areas, sensitive environments, events and construction sites.
Dubbed GEH2, the hydrogen system has a size of 1,150×2,200x3350mm and weighs in at 3.5 tons. It features IP43 ingress protection and is able to operate at temperatures between -5 and 45 degrees Celsius. Its output voltage is between 230 and 400 V. 
The generator has a power of 110 kVA and its lifetime is guaranteed for two years or 15,000 hours. Its autonomy at 50% of prime running power is around eight hours. It can be started instantaneously and also features a double adduction system that allows continuous operation.
The system is equipped with fuel cells provided by Japanese automotive giant Toyota, which became EODev’s largest shareholder in April. The heat dissipated by the fuel cell can also be used for cogeneration, the manufacturer said.
The GEH2 is produced by EODev in Montlhéry, in the Essonne department in Île-de-France, northern France, on the site of its industrial partner Eneria, which is a subsidiary of the Monnoyeur Group.
EODev recently announced it will provide GL events, a France-based global player in the event industry, with four GEH2 generators. The systems should be delivered in mid-2022.
