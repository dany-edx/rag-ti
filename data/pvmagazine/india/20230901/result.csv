https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/01/india-expected-to-add-a-record-4-gw-of-rooftop-solar-in-fiscal-2024/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2023",India expected to add a record 4 GW of rooftop solar in fiscal 2024,"India is likely to add a record-high 4 GW of rooftop solar capacity in fiscal year (FY) 2024, half of which has already been installed in the four months ending July this year, according to a new joint report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and JMK Research & Analytics.
The report finds that the capacity addition in the April-July period of FY 2024 was nearly 2 GW, slightly less than the amount added in FY 2023. Falling solar module costs will likely help sustain the growth momentum in the near-to-medium term.
“For India to attain its target of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030, solar and its verticals (including utility-scale, rooftop solar, and open access) will all have to play a crucial role,” said the report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, director, South Asia, IEEFA.
“As countries like Germany and Australia demonstrate, with the right policy and regulatory environment, rooftop solar can be a game changer for greening the overall national energy mix.”
Despite the recent growth, the report finds that the rooftop solar market faces significant regulatory challenges.
“Regulatory uncertainties and lack of support from local electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) have forced prominent developers to either focus on other segments or exit the rooftop solar business altogether,” said co-author Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.
Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and the union territory of Delhi have the most favorable ecosystems for commercial & industrial (C&I) customers setting up rooftop solar projects. But, several other states need to push rooftop solar. 
“Several states are moving away from net metering to lesser beneficial gross metering and net billing arrangements. This has led to C&I consumers shifting focus to other greening options, such as open access,” said co-author Kapil Gupta, Manager, JMK Research.
“The Green Open Access Rules, 2022 gave smaller C&I consumers access to off-site solar power. Going forward, consumers will prefer off-site open access, especially in states like Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu with net metering restrictions for C&I consumers,” he adds.
The report recommends that policymakers consider creating separate renewable purchase obligations for rooftop solar to boost the market. States should also allow behind-the-meter rooftop solar systems as they can help DISCOMs forecast their load schedule. The central government should issue uniform regulatory provisions, similar to the Green Open Access Rules.
The report authors expect the next growth phase in rooftop solar to come from MSMEs. While the market for large creditworthy commercial & industrial (C&I) customers for rooftop solar is saturated, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) offer a significant untapped potential of around 15 GW. 
Financers have only now started to develop products to cater to the MSME segment.
This year, the World Bank will likely approve and announce a credit guarantee mechanism to limit the risk exposure of financial institutions lending to MSMEs. The scheme will involve a $100 million payment guarantee fund covering up to 50% of the debt financing amount from participating financial institutions to a grid-connected rooftop solar project.
“Given the emerging financing avenues, we believe the next growth phase in the rooftop solar market will come from this segment,” says co-author Prabhakar Sharma, Consultant, JMK Research.
The report recommends strictly enforcing solar procurement targets for accelerating rooftop solutions with MSMEs.
The report also finds that adopting battery energy storage systems (BESS), virtual net metering and peer-to-peer trading will boost the rooftop solar market. As states start to adopt Time of Day pricing, coupling rooftop solar with BESS for the C&I segment will increasingly make more economic sense.
“Through virtual net metering, consumers at different locations can aggregate and source rooftop solar power from a single, large solar plant. This increases the effective site availability suitable for deploying rooftop solar. It also gives such projects access to better financing terms,” said Sharma.
In P2P trading, consumers in the same DISCOM jurisdiction can trade excess solar power. It is an alternative to net metering and allows energy consumers to become energy prosumers. For DISCOMs, it reduces distribution losses and excess solar power purchases and offers a potential new revenue stream through charges and fees for energy traded in P2P.

AEMO says “imminent and urgent investment” is required to improve the reliability of Australia‘s National Electricity Market (NEM), with a new report warning of potential supply shortfalls in the national power grid over the next decade.
The latest “Electricity Statement of Opportunities” (ESOO) report – which projects the market demand and supply over the coming decade for the eastern mainland states and Tasmania – flags supply concerns, heightened risks from coal outages and the need to incentivise continued supply in the NEM.
AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said the report “highlights the pace of Australia’s energy transition and the urgency needed to deliver new investment to ensure reliable, affordable and cleaner energy for consumers … Over the 10-year outlook, we continue to forecast reliability gaps, which are mostly due to the expectation that 62% of today’s coal fleet will retire by 2033. To ensure Australian consumers continue to have access to reliable electricity supplies, it’s critical that planned investments in transmission, generation and storage projects are urgently delivered.”
The ESOO forecasts that electricity consumption and peak demand will grow in the next decade due to population growth and the electrification across all sectors of the economy, including transport and residential sectors, and the electrification of traditional gas loads.
Considering only existing, committed and anticipated projects as per the ESOO’s “central scenario,” reliability risks are forecast to exceed the “relevant reliability standard” in Victoria from this summer, in South Australia this summer and then again from 2028-29, in New South Wales from 2025-26, and Queensland from 2029-30.
The reliability gaps are larger than were forecast in the February ESOO update but AEMO said government programs and a pipeline of proposed generation and storage projects – totaling 173 GW of renewable energy generation and 74 GW of storage – have the potential to address the identified risks.
“These forecasts highlight the high value of solutions in which resources owned by consumers, such as residential electricity generation and storage devices, and increased demand flexibility, can help meet power system needs,” AEMO said. “With a high level of consumer participation and coordination of consumer energy assets and demand to help meet power system needs, the need for utility-scale solutions would be much lower.”
Australian Energy Council (AEC) Chief Executive Officer Sarah McNamara said she expects the new report will act as a spur to the private sector to invest in new generation.
“It also reinforces the need for careful coordination and prioritisation of the necessary generation, firming capacity and transmission,” she said, noting that the electricity industry is well positioned to meet the challenges outlined in the report. “There is still time to meet these challenges and realize these opportunities if the market is permitted to provide the price signals necessary to bring forward investment. Even if new investment were not forthcoming, it’s worth noting that most of the near-term reliability shortfalls relate only to the ‘interim’ reliability standard, which is a very conservative measure, and not the traditional reliability standard.”

Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE) said it will support French startup Holosolis, a spinoff of EIT InnoEnergy, in building a module manufacturing facility in Hambach, near Sarreguemines, in northwestern France.
The site is at a now-abandoned factory project by REC. The Norwegian solar module manufacturer originally planned to build a 4 GW heterojunction panel factory there.
“HoloSolis’ approach of building a PV production line from solar cells to PV modules while further developing the technology convinced us from the beginning,” said Jochen Rentsch, head of technology transfer in the photovoltaics division at Fraunhofer ISE. “We are very happy to be able to accompany the young company on its way to become a major European-based producer of PV components.”
Three European players – EIT Innoenergy, French IDEC Group, and TSE – founded Holosolis. EIT Innoenergy is an EU co-financed cleantech investor based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. IDEC Group is a significant local real estate player in France, while TSE is a key producer of solar energy in France and a leader in agrivoltaics.
Holosolis stands as a flagship initiative under the European Solar PV Industry Alliance (ESIA), which aims to establish a European production capacity of 30 GW annually by 2025.
