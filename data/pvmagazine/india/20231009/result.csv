In 2021, India’s annual solar manufacturing capacity stood at 14 GW. While superficially an impressive figure, much of this capacity was sub-scale and technologically obsolete, with Chinese imports meeting more than 80% of Indian demand. Even though module manufacturing capacity has now grown to 26 GW, actual production remains low, at around 8 GW annually.
There are multiple policies that have driven solar manufacturing expansion. In April 2022, the Indian Ministry of Finance levied hefty 40% and 25% border customs duties – plus a 10% surcharge – on imports of all solar modules and cells, respectively. As a result, module imports fell sharply from a monthly average of slightly more than 1.6 GW, in 2021-22, to just 175 MW in the last fiscal year.
An additional policy, the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) has also had an effect. Under the ALMM, all grid connected projects, including rooftop solar systems, are required to use government-certified cells and modules, made by approved manufacturers. While the scheme does not formally discriminate between suppliers on the basis of nationality, approvals have so far only been granted to Indian companies.
The scheme was meant to be applicable from March 2021 but the implementation timeline was shifted to April 2024, due to lack of sufficient domestic capacity. By July of this year, 19.2 GW of module manufacturing capacity had been approved across 78 manufacturers.
The government has allocated capital subsidies of $2.2 billion to 12 companies setting up a total manufacturing capacity of 48.3 GW under its Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Subsidy amounts will be differentiated based on parameters such as the extent of upstream integration, local value addition, capacity, and solar module efficiency. It is estimated PLI funding will amount to around 25% of investment capital costs. Notable companies to win subsidies include Reliance, Shirdi Sai, Adani, First Solar, ReNew, Tata Power, Avaada, JSW, AMP, Waaree, and Vikram Solar.
The Ministry of Finance has also reduced the corporate tax rate from 25.2% to 17.2% for manufacturing companies incorporated after September 2019, provided they go into operation before April 2024.
The government is setting up three dedicated renewables equipment manufacturing zones with capital assistance of INR 10 billion ($121 million). These zones are being selected through a competitive bidding process based on the lowest power and land costs for the manufacturing businesses. The government of the state of Madhya Pradesh has been awarded the first tranche, with a capital assistance of INR 4 billion.
Local and regional funds are also available to manufacturers. Most states offer multiple benefits including capital and operating-cost subsidies, lower general sales tax rates, cheap land, and so on. The central government is also encouraging public and private lenders to support manufacturing projects.
The substantial policy thrust has resulted in a flurry of market activity. Bridge to India estimates total domestic polysilicon, cell, and module production capacities will reach 30 GW, 43 GW, and 110 GW, respectively, by 2026. That said, module supply is expected to remain constrained in the short-term until a significant chunk of new capacity comes online, by the end of 2024. Most manufacturers prefer to sell in the overseas market, particularly in the United States, where they can command up to 40% higher prices.
India is on the way to becoming the world’s second largest manufacturer of solar modules but there are still many issues and challenges to consider. There is lingering policy uncertainty as project developers are seeking another extension of ALMM and further import duty petitions are being considered by both upstream and downstream solar manufacturers. There is also the risk of World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes causing uncertainty. China has already flagged the ALMM mandate as a specific trade concern four times at the WTO.
The goal of becoming self-sufficient, as far as solar energy products are concerned, still appears elusive as upstream Indian polysilicon and wafer production capacity is expected to be insufficient to meet demand. Indian manufacturers are critically dependent on China for technology expertise, manufacturing machinery, component supplies, and even engineering skills. In the longer term, there are also concerns that the generous US Inflation Reduction Act may mean Indian modules are not cost competitive in export markets. Indian modules are expected to remain at least 25% to 30% more expensive than their Chinese counterparts.

Solar and wind energy, two clean and abundant resources in India, have emerged as the twin pillars that collectively account for over 50% of the total renewable energy capacity in India. As the nation moves forward toward its ambitious renewable energy targets, these technologies will carve the way for a sustainable future. 
India’s journey toward sustainability is both a necessity and a responsibility. Solar and wind energy with their abundance and compatibility with India’s diverse climate patterns, optimize energy generation throughout the year.
These renewable sources of energy have empowered many states with green solutions. Regions across India are carving their green legacy with distinct contributions to the solar and wind energy landscape. 
For instance, Rajasthan is a pioneer when it comes to solar energy. Its vast desert expanses are home to some of the country’s largest solar installations, contributing significantly to the national solar capacity. 
On the other hand, Gujarat’s coastline hosts some of India’s most prominent wind farms. The Kutch region, with its impressive wind corridors, stands as a testament to Gujarat’s pioneering efforts in wind energy. 
In addition to this, Tamil Nadu’s southern coastline and favorable wind conditions have made it a leader in wind energy. The state has also embraced solar power and adopted a diversified approach to renewable energy. 
Solar and wind energy collectively account for over 50% of the total renewable energy capacity in the country. They are not just reshaping regional landscapes but also transforming industries.
Solar-powered irrigation pumps are revolutionizing agriculture. Farmers in states like Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are benefiting from these clean energy solutions, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and increasing agricultural productivity. Energy-intensive industries are integrating solar and wind power into their operations. From textile mills to luxury hospitality resorts, renewable energy is becoming a cornerstone of sustainable industrial growth.
This progress in solar and wind energy can prove to be a global model to drive renewable energy adoption. Developing nations especially can look at India’s renewable energy sector growth as a blueprint. The adoption of solar and wind energy will not just support industry growth but also empower local communities. Distributed solar installations on rooftops and decentralized wind farms have the potential to make communities self-sufficient in energy. This decentralized approach democratizes energy access and empowers individuals to contribute to the nation’s energy transition.
 With strategic investment from the government and private sector and a favourable policy framework, the sector can witness accelerated growth contributing to green energy goals of India. 
The synergy between solar and wind energy will continue to drive India’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/09/the-race-for-100-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",The race for 100% solar,"The perennial top three countries – China, the United States, and India – continue to account for some two-thirds of global utility scale solar generation capacity. Look beyond those simple totals, however, and you find some impressive relative results by many of those countries in the remaining one-third.
From Wiki-Solar’s comprehensive database of more than 22,000 utility scale solar projects around the world, it is possible to derive a wide range of comparators, including site performance ratios, average yield, and land utilization. This article looks at national achievements and rates of progress.
Firstly, we have assessed the nominal annual output of the large solar capacity in each country and compared it with national electricity consumption. On that basis, five countries now meet more than 10% of their electric power demand from utility scale solar. Most of these figures would be significantly higher if rooftop and other small scale solar arrays were factored in.

Chile tops the list, thanks in part to its exceptional yield from so many high-altitude desert sites. El Salvador and Jordan feature strongly, with solar contributing substantially to their more modest electricity demand. Spain carries the banner for Europe while Australia has progressed strongly after a slow start.
The UAE owes much of its elevated position to a single huge project, the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. India may be only number three, in terms of total generation capacity, but leads the United States and China in relative terms, with 8.6% of its electricity from utility scale solar, and 13.2% from overall solar capacity.
An extended list which shows most of the countries with significant utility scale solar capacity is available on the Wiki-Solar website. There you will find Germany, with 3.2% of its electricity demand met by big solar, a few places above China, which sits at number 29, with 2.6%
The rate of progress is another key indicator. We have evaluated this by looking at the change over the five-year period from 2017 to last year.
For comparison, we have extended this rate forward until utility scale solar would meet 100% of electricity demand. This is, of course, a theoretical exercise. No nation would, in practice, generate all of its power this way and neither the growth of solar nor the trend in electricity consumption will continue as a straight line. The results of the exercise are, nonetheless, illuminating.

Chile again tops the list and would need just 25 years to achieve that notional 100% utility scale solar coverage. Spain has seen outstanding renewed growth in recent years, taking it to number two on this list, with El Salvador and Jordan not far behind. In theory, the top ten countries for solar progress would all reach 100% solar, from utility-scale alone, before the end of the century.
Again, the full list is available online and features a strong European contingent – Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark – just outside the top ten. Some countries where recent progress in utility scale solar has been slow would need several centuries to reach 100%, by this measure.
The large solar power stations we are considering here are not, of course, for individuals or households. Another measure of comparative achievement is relative solar generation capacity per person.

Inevitably this is quite similar to the first table above but this time the UAE and Australia leapfrog Chile. The United States has a much higher ranking in this table because its power consumption per capita – from all generation sources – is substantially higher than most other nations. Again, the full table is available online.
Wiki-Solar has accurate site footprints for the majority of utility scale plants, enabling us to assess the land area typically used for big solar sites in different parts of the world. When this number is related to the land area of each country, it is no surprise to find that land usage is seldom an issue.

The most that any country currently devotes to utility scale solar is just over one tenth of 1%. Only two, relatively small and energy intensive countries – Taiwan and South Korea – would need to allocate more than 3% of their land for PV, even to achieve the theoretical 100% solar paradigm.
The full list shows the United States down among the countries that would need to devote around 0.5% of total surface area for 100% solar. The use of building-mounted systems and the growth of agrivoltaics, of course, means that the land allocated can also be productive for other purposes.
The expression “nominal output” refers to the design or expected annual output of solar power stations. Actual output in practice will vary with solar radiation and other climatic and site factors, such as grid constraints.
The 100% solar paradigm is used for illustrative and comparative purposes. A 100% renewables scenario featuring wind, hydro, and biomass alongside solar is more realistic.
National power consumption figures are mainly taken from French data company Enerdata and the International Energy Agency; population data is mainly taken from the United Nations. Utility scale solar figures come from the Wiki-Solar database. For consistency, generation capacity is quoted in MW/TW (AC) to enable direct comparison between PV and concentrating solar power plants and other forms of generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/09/a-survival-guide-for-solar-smes/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",A survival guide for solar SMEs,"From pv magazine 09/23
This year, solar manufacturers have increased vertical integration and production capacity, and the global industry has attracted new entrants, buoyed by the market outlook and advancing technology. Infolink data shows annual module production capacity grew at an average of 30% to 40% from 2018 to 2022. That rate is expected to double this year, to an unprecedented 80%.

Technology and competition are driving expansion, prompting legacy manufacturers to modify production lines. For instance, passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) lines must have nine-busbar (BB) to 11 BB stringer machines upgraded to 16 BB devices, and have laminating temperatures controlled, to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) modules. For heterojunction (HJT) production, busbarless cell interconnection requires dispenser equipment.
InfoLink expects that more than a terawatt of annual module production capacity will be reached this year. Inventory has already started stockpiling, driving buyers to wait. Quarterly module prices have fallen below manufacturer quotes and some solar companies have clawed back their overseas stock at the end of June, as underselling continued into early August.

Module-only manufacturers are thought to have experienced negative gross margins thanks to solar cell costs, and risk management strategy will be critical to survive in a competitive market.
Solar manufacturers with just a single business model will need a risk strategy as competition increases. SMEs could take advantage of flat organizational structures to show flexibility in equipment use and at a managerial decision-making level.
Manufacturers can utilize the production of medium and low-efficiency products to control costs while also accepting special-specification or, unbranded, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) orders to manage monthly output. This allows for efficient capacity utilization and the maintenance of a stable utilization rate, which can be lowered to regulate inventory level. Based on historical expense data, the average gross margin level for OEM and dual-channel distribution may be lower than for direct sales. During periods of high market volatility, however, maintaining conservative gross margins can provide flexibility in continuing minimum operational conditions.
As the industry moves toward competitive convergence on identical or similar module technology, product differentiation strategies will help SMEs by increasing module diversity and market opportunities to create demand. Using differentiated products, such as flexible thin-film and small-format specialty modules – to expand product ranges and cater to different applications based on customer need – can foster the development of potential markets.
In addition, diversification of suppliers and customers can reduce reliance on certain clients, suppliers, and markets. As regional risks have been steadily increasing in recent years, particularly within the volatile environment of the solar industry, SMEs could become vulnerable to market fluctuation. Expansion overseas and developing diversified products will help spread risk and build solid customer relationships to ensure long-term business cooperation.
Manufacturers can also adopt supply chain integration strategies to manage the manufacturing capability of their upstream and downstream segments. Such vertical integration enhances cost management capability and retains transaction space by having in-house production capacity of other segments, thereby maintaining flexibility and mitigating risk during periods of greater volatility. Taking the example of cell manufacturers expanding into module production, if the cell inventory cycle extends, in-house module capacity can consume a portion of the cell output, ensuring better risk control.
The significance of vertical integration is growing for manufacturers. This involves expanding into project development, system design, integrated products, and after-sales operation and maintenance services. Such an approach can effectively address product usage and consumption issues. Moreover, manufacturers can gain a better grasp of real-time market information downstream through collaboration with clients.
With sustainability requirements tightening – in the form of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) reporting guidelines set to become obligatory in the European Union and with new standards planned in the United States and internationally – PV manufacturers powered by non-renewable energy, for example, will face greater risk. At the same time, this will provide all players with more opportunities for differentiation. Manufacturers can seize this chance.
Long-term oversupply has become a key issue in the PV industry. Given the resource and financial constraints faced by SMEs, companies should deploy a combination of strategies to establish presence in a market that is marked by a convergence of competition. This includes exploring potential markets via differentiated products and adopting strategies such as OEM and dual-channel distribution to mitigate operational risk. With sustainability becoming a corporate imperative, manufacturers should also be prepared for future policy dynamics in regional markets, thereby seizing businesses opportunities. Adapting risk strategies will be a crucial factor for the survival of manufacturers with a single business model.
