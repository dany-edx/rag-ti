Complementing hydroelectric power with floating solar PV can be a suitable solution for daytime peak electricity demand and to offset the respective shortfalls of the two power generation technologies.
With this in mind, a research group from the Islamic University of Technology, in Bangladesh, has conducted a simulation to evaluate the integration of a 50 MW floating solar plant with the 230 MW Karnafuli Hydroelectric Power Station located at the Kaptai Dam on the Karnaphuli River in Rangamati district, in the southeastern part of the country. The facility covers around 5% of Bangladesh’s grid electricity demand.
“Based on the available reservoir area and the yield of the Kaptai hydro plant, we considered 50 MW for the floating array,” research co-author Abdullah Al Mehadi, told pv magazine. “This capacity proved useful for the Kaptai hydroelectric power plant in compensating for the hydroelectric power plant’s low yield during the winter season and, at the same time, the low energy production from the solar plant, due to lack of irradiation and reduced sunlight hours during the monsoon season, can be compensated by additional water reserves in the dam due to high rainfall.”
In the proposed project configuration, the floating plant should be located close to the dam’s spillway, which the scientists say would reduce its environmental impact as local fishing activities and cohabitation of marine life are present on the other side of the basin. The array is planned to occupy a surface of 0.56km2, which would represent a minimal portion of the basin’s total surface, which equals 777km2.
The simulated PV system is south-oriented and built with 400 W panels with an efficiency of 21.63% from Korean manufacturer LG, and string inverters from Chinese specialist Huawei. The modules should be installed with a tilt angle of 30 degrees.
All the power generated by the solar facility should be used during the day, during which only some of the five turbines of the hydropower plant would be in use. “Conserving water will later prove to be a key differentiator when the preserved water is used to satisfy the peak load demand at night,” the research group emphasized, adding that the hydropower facility may act as a backup for the solar plant in the event of a discontinuity or instability in solar radiance.
The PV plant’s annual energy yield was estimated at 76,916 MWh and its performance ratio 0.752. The performance ratio is defined in IEC 61724 and is a metric commonly used to measure solar plant performance, for acceptance and operations testing.
According to the academics, the simulated system has demonstrated that hydroelectricity can respond appropriately to fluctuations in PV generation and that their complementarity is ideal for the so-called “load power plants,” which are plants that adjust their power output as demand for electricity fluctuates throughout the day. “The coupling of hydropower and floating PV is of particular interest in developing countries such as Bangladesh where grid infrastructure is unreliable,” they further explained. “Furthermore, installing a solar PV farm necessitates a significant investment in an electricity distribution system which can be avoided by constructing such a hybrid system where the distribution network already exists.”
The research team has not estimated, yet, the LCOE of the proposed system. “The cost of the panels and other accessories is difficult to ascertain because they will be subject to advance-trade VAT after their importation from abroad,” Al Mehadi said. “In addition, because floating solar plants have different maintenance situations than land-based plants, it is difficult to predict maintenance costs.”
The proposed hybrid system was described in the paper Optimized seasonal performance analysis and integrated operation of 50 MW floating solar photovoltaic system with Kaptai hydroelectric power plant: a case study, published in Energy Sources.
Several studies have been conducted in recent years on the combination of the two technologies. Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory said linking solar with hydro in a full hybrid system configuration at every hydroelectric facility in the world may result – at best – in the deployment of 7,593 GW of combined generation capacity for an estimated annual power generation of 10,616 TWh and 20% reservoir surface area coverage. And combining solar with hydro in this way brings further benefits, including improved system operation at different timescales; more opportunities for storage, thanks to pumped hydro; increased utilization rates of transmission lines; reduced PV curtailment; and lower interconnection costs and water evaporation.

Energy Vault, maker of the EVx gravitational energy storage tower, has secured $100 million in series C funding. The investment was led by Prime Movers Lab, with additional participation from SoftBank, Saudi Aramco, Helena, and Idealab X.
The company said capital raised will support plans to ramp up deployments of the EVx platform for customers in the U.S., Middle East, Europe, and Australia. The first U.S. deployments are slated to begin fourth quarter 2021, with a broader global ramp-up throughout 2022, said Energy Vault.
The EVx platform is a six-arm crane tower designed to be charged by grid-scale renewable energy. It lifts large bricks using electric motors, thereby creating gravitational energy. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the bricks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
There is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the raised composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time, said Energy Vault.
Energy Vault said the composite blocks are made of local soils, as well as materials otherwise destined for landfills or incinerators, including recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and wind turbine blades.
In 2020, Energy Vault had the first commercial-scale deployment of its energy storage system and launched the new EVx platform this past April.
The company said the EVx tower features 80-85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.
The company said its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from 2 to 4 hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from 5 to 24 hours or more.
With global lithium supply considered a constraint, and, according to the Biden administration, a national security issue, alternative measures are being taken to find ways to store solar and wind energy.
For example, Form Energy of Somerville, Massachusetts, has secured $240 million in series D funding for its iron-air batteries, which use iron pellets. The pellets are exposed to oxygen to create rust. The oxygen then is removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the batteries to be charged and discharged.

The Scheme allows farmers or their groups to set up PV power plants on their uncultivable/barren land and benefit from selling the generated power to the State Discoms.
Alongside, GEDA has invited an expression of interest from farmers/landowners willing to set up these PV power plants as it seeks to aggregate the capacity under the Scheme. 
The plants—to be installed in sizes of 500 kW to 2 MW—can be installed upon barren/uncultivable land within a 10 km radius of the 33KV/11KV network of the electricity department to facilitate the easy evacuation of solar power.
Individual farmers or their groups, also referred to as landowners, can collaborate with EPC contractors, system integrators, or developers to set up these plants through their own investment or lease mode.
The tariff determination shall be done subsequently based on the aggregation of capacity.

Utility-solar capacity addition in Q2 remained steady quarter-on-quarter despite rising module prices and lockdowns across the country. It accounted for 84% (1,785 MW) of the new capacity addition. Rooftop solar contributed 10% (205 MW) and off-grid 6% (120 MW).
With this, the nation’s total installed solar capacity has reached 46,130 MW as of June 30, 2021, comprising 37,503 MW of utility-scale, 7,367 MW rooftop solar, and 1,260 MW off-grid. 
The total utility-scale project pipeline – allocated to developers and at various stages of development – stands at 52,814 MW.
During the second quarter, prices for mono-PERC modules rose further to US cent 25.5/W. Total EPC cost for utility-scale projects rose to INR 32.69/W on the back of the firm module and balance-of-system costs. 
Notwithstanding fears of the third wave of the pandemic, Bridge To India expects the pace of project construction to remain steady in the coming months. It estimates 2,130 MW capacity to be added in Q3 and 2,450 MW in Q4.

Scientists from Germany’s Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP have developed a new process aimed at lowering the series resistance of monocrystalline PERC solar cells.
The new technique was tested in partnership with German company CE Cell Engineering GmbH. “Contacting surface structures (emitters) of solar cells with high sheet resistance is already technically possible, but costly,” said Stephan Großer, project manager in the diagnostics and metrology group at Fraunhofer CSP. “The series resistance of the contact structure on the solar cell increases due to high contact resistances, which significantly reduces the efficiency of a solar cell. In the project, we were able to lower the series resistance by using laser-assisted current treatment and elucidate the active principle.”
Through this process, which was dubbed laser enhanced contact optimization (LECO), the researchers were able to identify faulty semiconductor-to-metal contacts in the PERC cells and to establish where there was insufficient electrical contact formation between the metal and semiconductor. Furthermore, all this happened without damaging the solar cells. “The optimization of the contact takes place through a large number of microscopic current-fired contact points, which enable … very low series-resistance between the metallic silver contact finger and the doped silicon wafer,” the research team further explained.
The Fraunhofer CSP is currently evaluating the LECO process parameters for patenting.
