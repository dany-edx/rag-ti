To transform the present expensive, unreliable, and polluting fossil-fuels-based market into a low-cost, dependable, and low-emission system based on renewable energy, the government established a target of 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by fiscal year (FY) 2021-22. According to the Central Electricity Authority’s analysis on the “optimal generation capacity mix for 2030,” the aim was raised to 450 GW by 2030 in 2019. 
More than 90% of the 30 GW of renewable energy capacity added since the start of FY 2017-18, as well as another 50 GW awarded to date, has been contracted at rates ranging from INR 2.43-2.80 per kWh (US$35-40/MWh) for 25 years with no indexation in first-year pricing. This is 60-70 percent less than the expected new non-mine mouth coal-fired power plants.
In December 2014, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) announced a plan to establish Solar Parks and Ultra-Mega Solar Power Projects. It recommended that at least 25 solar parks and Ultra Mega solar power plants be established across the country. 
Since then, India has built a few ultra-mega solar parks with installed capacities over one gigawatt (GW) like the ones built in Bhadla (Rajasthan) and Pavagada (Karnataka). These are some of the largest solar parks commissioned in the world. 
Of late, there has been a renewed interest in the Ultra Large Renewable Energy projects. Ranging in capacities from 2 GW in Uttar Pradesh to 25 GW announced in Gujarat and Rajasthan, there is a list of such huge parks being planned by various states and nodal agencies. 
Also, the MNRE, through an Official Memorandum (OM) dated 15th June 2020, announced significant modifications to the 2014 solar park scheme. This OM introduced a new mode of implementation of solar parks to the existing seven modes of implementation. It announced a new eighth mode of implementation of the 2014 solar park scheme, called the Ultra-Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPPs) wherein developers have been offered multiple incentives to install UMREPP. This OM, coupled with other supplementary steps like the recently announced extension of the Interstate transmission charges waiver, will go a long way in fuelling the Indian RE landscape. 
With an eye on the 175 GW target by 2022 and the larger target of 450 GW by 2030, these large parks will be key to India’s transition to clean and green energy. National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), the country’s largest power generator, recently announced intentions to build India’s largest single-site solar power park of 4.75 Gigawatts (GW) in Kutch through its renewable energy arm. 
The ministry of Renewable energy provides central financial assistance to non-public project developers. In general, solar parks provide adequately developed property with the necessary permissions, transmission, water access, road connectivity, and communication networks, among other things. It speeds up the installation of grid-connected solar power projects and facilitates electricity generation on a large scale. 
Solar parks bring economies of scale, attract foreign investments, create employment and lead to the overall growth of the renewable energy sector. However, developing these large solar parks has its challenges; managing these parks efficiently is important. Collaboration amongst energy ecosystem partners like power producers, discoms, investors and manufacturers would play a crucial role in developing the renewable energy ecosystem.
Managing a solar park requires technical expertise, workforce management, scheduling, understanding of legal and regulatory framework, and community engagement. While looking at the generation and sale numbers is required, keeping track of State policies, DISCOM regulations, labor law and safety compliances, community welfare activities, etc. is important.
Solar Parks will fuel the economic growth of the country and help transition to a sustainable environment. To build solar parks, India would have to get forward-looking and well-aligned policies across states, promote domestic manufacturing of cells and modules, incentivize developers and discoms, and improve the power infrastructure. Indian utility-scale solar parks have been effective in kick-starting India’s energy sector transition. 
Many ultra-mega solar parks have attracted foreign capital and top global developers to India in the past few years. According to IEEFA, India provides an investment opportunity worth US$500-700 billion in renewable energy and associated grid integration and expansion over the coming decade to meet its renewable energy targets. 
India’s power and solar energy industry should use this time to resolve long-pending problems and be fully prepared for a green infrastructure investment stimulus as India comes out of this pandemic. India should take pride in being able to execute world-leading renewable energy projects and continue to work to resolve short-term policy impediments to achieving its long-term renewable energy aspirations.

Initially, it plans hydrogen power-based conversion of two diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) rakes in the 89km Sonipat-Jind section of Northern Railway. 
The hydrogen fuel cell retrofitment kit, along with the balance-of-plant and energy storage and hydrogen storage modules, will replace the existing power-train items onboard 1,600HP DEMUs.
Based on operational requirements of a 1,600 HP DEMU, the power train should consist of a primary energy source of 800 kW proton exchange membrane technology hydrogen fuel cell-based power stacks (preferably in multiples of 100/150/200 kW) supported by a secondary energy source (battery bank) with a power rating of 400 kW. The battery bank must be based on Lithium-ion technology. However, other battery types may also be accepted, provided these offer better energy and power density, life cycle, etc.
The scope of work includes design, supply, retrofitment, testing, field trials of fuel cell and battery-based power stack modules, hydrogen storage, power electronics/controls and associated equipment, including necessary engineering & supervision work, for hydrogen uses for retrofitment of 1600HP DEMUs.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/09/renew-power-signs-ppa-for-400-mw-round-the-clock-supply/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA,KARNATAKA,MAHARASHTRA,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 9, 2021",ReNew Power signs PPA for 400 MW round-the-clock supply,"Haryana-based developer ReNew Power has announced that it has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for a round-the-clock (RTC) 400 MW electricity supply. SECI is a Central Government owned entity, which has an AA+ domestic debt rating by ICRA, a subsidiary of Standard & Poor’s.
The PPA for round-the-clock renewable electricity supply is the first-of-its-kind in India. The power will be supplied to New Delhi Municipal Council and Dadra & Nagar Haveli utility.
ReNew had emerged the winner to supply round-the-clock power last year in an auction conducted by SECI. Under the contract, it will supply the electricity in the first year at a tariff of INR 2.90/kWh (3.9 US cents). The tariff will increase by 3% per year for the first 15 years of the 25-year power supply deal secured by ReNew before becoming a fixed payment.
“As a typical solar/wind firm power renewable energy project in India has a lower PLF depending on site and technology selection, ReNew Power anticipates the 400 MW RTC project will require a combination of 900 MW of wind capacity and 400 MW solar, supplemented by battery storage,” read a statement by Renew Power.
“The project will be designed to operate at an 80% average annual plant load factor (PLF) and will have a minimum capacity utilization factor of 70% monthly, despite being a renewable energy project.” 
The project cost is estimated at approximately US$ 1.2 billion.
ReNew Power will set up the wind and solar capacity across Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. It has already obtained requisite approvals to connect the project sites with the grid and has secured connectivity through the inter-state transmission system.
As of March 31, 2021, ReNew Power had a total capacity of approximately 10 GW of wind and solar energy projects across India, including commissioned and committed projects. It is backed by global investors like Goldman Sachs, CPP Investments, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, GEF SACEF, and JERA.
