However, as per the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the nation had achieved only 51 GW of solar by Feb 2022. While we haven’t met the goal, there has been meaningful and significant growth in the overall solar industry. Also, the Government has set a steeper target of 280 GW of solar to be achieved by 2030. While there is a lot of focus on increasing the installed solar capacity, equal focus is required on the sourcing and production of the requisite raw material to meet the increased demand for solar hardware.
As of date, about 95% of RE hardware is imported directly or indirectly from China. For comparison, China has over 340 GW of solar wafer manufacturing capacity against a 3 GW cell manufacturing capacity in India. This 3GW domestic capacity is mostly utilized for captive production of modules.
Of the 8GW module production capacity, 80% remains unutilised due to the high demand for Chinese modules on account of the competitive pricing of Chinese modules per watt.
To support the domestic solar manufacturing industry and safeguard it from the dumping of Chinese hardware, the Indian government, under the scheme of Atmanirbhar Bharat, came up with the policy of Approved List of Module Manufacturer (ALMM) Solar Photovoltaic Module order of 2019.
The MNRE had issued a notice to increase the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) by 40% on the import of modules and cells. Moreover, through the ALMM policy, MNRE has mandated all Government solar projects must use only panel brands listed in ALMM. This order, which was later expanded to include even non-Government projects for net metering and Open Access, was to be applicable from the 1st of April 2022.
However, considering the challenges faced by solar developers in commissioning the ongoing projects and protests from several industry bodies, MNRE deferred the policy implementation by six months till October. Though this provides interim relief to the solar developers, we need to look for concrete solutions to address the issue of the over-dependence of our solar sector on imports.
Capacity building must be our primary focus to address our dependency on imports. In the union budget of 2022, INR 50,000 crore have been allocated to boost the manufacturing of solar modules under the government’s flagship production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. It means incentivising the hardware supply side. The PLI includes subsidized land and tax rates to set up manufacturing units and incentives to improve investments in Research and Development.
While ALMM does support domestic manufacturers, this is not a sustained solution considering the wide demand-supply gap. Disincentivising imports could be a workable strategy when there would be enough or more capacity back home. As of today, India needs to build production capacity not just to meet its demand but also to emerge as a strong alternative photovoltaic supplier to the world.

Floating PV has added meaningful generation to water bodies at large scales. Now a new, lightweight solution built on closed water covers can bring solar generation for C&I producers with water reservoirs.
Genap is a 70-year old company – based in Arnhem, the Netherlands – that specializes in membrane solutions for water storage in agriculture. It showed off its Genap Energy Cover this week at the Fruit Logistica trade fair in Berlin. It works with fellow Arnhem-based flexible PV manufacturer HyET Solar to glue thin-film flexible panels to the membrane.
The modules in use are HyET Solar PowerFoil 115 modules, made to custom lengths for the cover. Each module is glued in place. Lightweight styrofoam is placed between the module and cover to act as a float.
Chrétien Hendriks, business development manager for Genap, told pv magazine that the idea came from the lack of available land and the efficiency benefits of lower operating temperatures for solar on water.
“Right now the payback period is around eight years, with the aim to get it down to five to six. But the normal covers we sell have a warranty of 15 years,” said Hendriks. “We’re also looking at ways to remove already-glued modules to reuse them on new covers.”
The company’s novel use of membranes and thin-film solar secured a finalist position in Fruit Logistica’s Innovation Awards for 2022. Curiously competing with an onion that doesn’t cause tears, a cauliflower with an edible stem, a new type of tomato, and other food innovations, the Genap Energy Cover offers tangible benefits for land-scarce locations, while adding conventional anti-algae and evaporation prevention.
Initially, the target market is local, focusing on water storage for agricultural and floristry greenhouses in the Netherlands. A pilot was placed on a reservoir at Wageningen University and Research in Bleiswijk in September 2021. The facility is approximately sized at 35 meters by 12 meters, with the overall output at 12kWp.
Hendriks said increasing the yield is a key goal. “The first generation of these panels in the test setup was around 60W/m2, rising to 120W/m2 in a year from now. And at the end, we’re aiming for around 165W/m2. It’s our first design and we think we can optimize and increase the percentage of the [membrane] that is covered in PV quite a bit higher – we’d like to go to a 90% coverage of the full floater.”
Genap expects to release the Energy Cover in the third quarter of 2022. Hendriks claimed that the capital cost of Genap’s floating, flexible PV solution is “less than half as expensive as other floating PV solutions currently available.” Maintenance is simplified with the retractable plastic-foil cover, without the heavy infrastructure of fixed panels, he said. No soiling issues have been noted, as there are cables to deter birds.
Hendriks also noted that a rooftop setup is also being explored with High yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group, recently majority acquired by Australian-based Fortescue Future Industies. HyET is helping with weight-constrained rooftops that are unable to support the heavy structures of fixed modules.
“We’re doing an innovation at the moment with HyET Solar, which is their modules glued onto our foils, with cables already integrated,” said Hendriks. “We’ll tension them and the membrane onto existing roofs, for rooftops that cannot have too much weight for conventional frame structures and glass panels. It’s a lightweight roofing solution we’re working on.”

The UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has published a report describing the possible impacts of an emerging international hydrogen economy on the global climate.
Scientists from the University of Cambridge and the University of Reading explored the atmospheric impacts caused by hydrogen leakage. They calculated the radiative forcing resulting from hydrogen emissions and the global warming potential of hydrogen.
“Any leakage of hydrogen will affect atmospheric composition (with implications for air quality) and have an indirect warming effect on climate, partially offsetting some of the climate benefits of the reduction in carbon dioxide,” the scientists warned, noting that hydrogen leakage also reduces the tropospheric concentration of hydroxyl radicals. “Increases in tropospheric ozone, water vapour and methane, consequent on increases in atmospheric hydrogen, would all tend to increase radiative forcing, partially offsetting the climate benefits of a switch to hydrogen.”
Radiative forcing is a parameter defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that measures influence a given climatic factor has on the amount of downward-directed radiant energy impinging upon Earth’s surface.
The British scientists developed a new way to calculate Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for gases whose emissions result in indirect radiative forcings. It considers the lifetime of a gas in addition to the lifetimes of the radiatively active gases causing the indirect forcing.
“This allows GWPs arising from indirect forcings to be calculated for gases with intermediate and longer lifetimes, such as hydrogen,” the scientists said. Several scenarios describing the atmospheric response to changes in the emissions of hydrogen were modeled and hydrogen leakage was found to affect the concentration of methane, ozone and water vapor in the atmosphere. 
“The changes in radiative forcing, like the changes in atmospheric composition, indicate that, to maximize the climate and air quality benefit of a transition to a hydrogen-powered economy, minimization of both hydrogen leakage and a reduction of the ancillary emissions of, for example, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and volatile organic compounds is required,” the scientists concluded.
