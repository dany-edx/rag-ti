To calculate this average price, BNEF conducted more than 300 surveys among buyers and sellers of lithium-ion batteries for electric passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, buses, two- and three-wheeled vehicles, and energy storage applications.
Prices vary by sector: Chinese electric buses and commercial vehicles have the lowest prices at $100/kWh. The average price of packs for fully electric passenger cars was $128/kWh.
“However, the story behind this price decrease is somewhat different from previous years,” the analysts said. While the main cause of falling battery prices has historically been technological innovation, this year the price drop is mainly attributed to reduced raw material costs.
Prices for key battery metals, especially lithium, have fallen sharply since January, due to significant growth in production capacity in all parts of the battery value chain, from raw materials and components to cells and battery packs.
Although demand continued to increase year on year, the pace of growth in some electric vehicle markets slowed in the second half of the year, mainly due to increased financing costs and economic uncertainty. On the other hand, battery production in China alone exceeded global demand.
As for the future, BNEF’s energy storage team expects prices to closely follow the trajectory of raw material prices. “We project that pack costs will fall to $133/kWh next year in real terms in 2023,” said BNEF. “In the long term, if the learning pace of the previous year is maintained, battery prices will fall below $100 /kWh in 2027.”
BNEF said that local battery manufacturing in regions such as the United States and Europe can drive up prices in the short term due to the price of energy, equipment, land and labor in these regions compared to Asia.
“However, as the industry matures, these costs could end up falling,” it said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/01/adb-approves-250-million-loan-for-indias-power-sector-reforms/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 1, 2023",ADB approves $250 million loan for India’s power sector reforms,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $250 million policy-based loan to strengthen India’s power sector by improving financial sustainability and facilitating the shift to renewable energy.
“ADB has been working with the Government of India to help ramp up its transition to clean and renewable energy and facilitate policy actions to ensure a sustainable, inclusive, and climate-friendly power supply,” said ADB Principal Energy Specialist Len George. “This policy-based loan will help reduce barriers to scale up commercial financing for clean energy and contribute to India’s fulfillment of its climate change mitigation commitments.”
Under policy-based lending (PBL), ADB transfers loan amounts to the government’s general budget instead of paying for explicit project costs. This helps countries that may be facing a financing gap in their annual budget, and may need additional funds to pay for general development expenditures.
PBL is disbursed only when the borrower completes policy reforms or actions that have been agreed with ADB. Examples include reforms to create a more business friendly investment climate, or those that improve governance and performance of state-owned enterprises. This creates a platform and incentive for governments to carry out improvements with a sector- or economy-wide impacts.
The Power Sector Reform Program is the first of a two-part program to strengthen the development of markets for power trade and related ancillary services. This will facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy given India’s target of 50% of its power generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. These policy actions will, among others, help accelerate the deployment of solar and other renewable energy technologies, promote the use of renewables in the agriculture sector, and optimize dispatch of power plants to reduce emissions.
The loan will also enable measures to improve the financial performance, corporate governance, and service quality of electricity distribution companies (DISCOM) and create a conducive environment for private sector investment. It will aid in the implementation of an incentive-based results-oriented approach to improving DISCOM performance on parameters including losses, cost recovery, metering and timely payment of dues in order to access government budget support.
This program builds on ADB’s engagements in emerging areas such as green hydrogen that will be important to facilitate energy transition. ADB will provide financial grants of $1.5 million from its Technical Assistance Special Fund and the Climate Change Fund for capacity development and the implementation of policy reforms. The program has been prepared in coordination with other development partners, in particular German development cooperation through KfW.

The projects are to be developed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis and should mandatorily include an energy storage system (ESS) component. ESS charged using a source other than RE power would not qualify as RE power.
SECI will sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders. Power procured by SECI from these projects has been provisioned to be sold to Punjab State Power Corp. Ltd (PSPCL), Punjab.
A single developer can bid for a cumulative contracted capacity of 50 MW to 500 MW in multiples of 10 MW. The projects can be located anywhere in India. For a single project, the RE generation components, along with ESS, may either be co-located or located at different locations.
ESS may be owned by the renewable power developer or may be tied up separately with a third party by the renewable energy developer, for supply of power. The ESS technology can be changed by the developer at any time during the term of the PPA.
“Bidders who have already commissioned RE Projects/storage projects or are in the process of constructing such projects and have untied capacity may also participate under this RfS. In such case, they will be given the benefit of a longer period of PPA, commensurate to the duration between the actual date of commencement of power supply and the scheduled commencement of supply date (SCSD),” as per the tender document.

Solar roofs in cars currently generate limited output due to space constraints, typically adding only a few kilometers of extra range.
Imec researchers designed glass solar modules with a proprietary ‘multi-wire’ connection technology, utilizing silicon heterojunction-based solar cells and a low-temperature process up to 180 C. This innovative architecture provides flexibility in the electrical design, maximizing space usage with minimal additional materials and lower costs.
The Imec researchers used a multi-wire configuration, connecting solar cell circuits in parallel to maximize energy production on curved surfaces. This innovative interconnection, along with optical coatings, increased efficiency and minimized heating of solar cells and vehicle cabins.
In addition, they automated the previously manual production process of the multi-wire connecting films, enabling the cost-effective transfer of innovations to glass solar modules.
“Further upscaling is absolutely necessary,” said Jonathan Govaerts, project coordinator and lead researcher at Imec. “But what makes this project so unique is its proof of concept for a wide range of applications. The flexibility of the multi-wire connection for integrating solar cells on different surfaces and in different configurations is impressive.”
The Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship is financially backing the SNRoof project. The consortium consisted of the industrial partners AGP eGlass, IPTE Factory Automation, Arkema France Sa and Michiels Group.

“This decision has been taken as a result of Qcells’ efforts to optimize module production capabilities, and in response to a stagnant domestic solar market in Korea,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The total volume of solar installations in Korea has been decreasing over the past three years, from 4.7 GW in 2020, to 3.4 GW in 2022, and a further decline is expected in 2023.”
The company said it will continue to invest in its flagship manufacturing facility in Jincheon, South Korea, where it still produces TOPCon products and operates a perovskite tandem pilot line.
“The shutdown of Eumseong will have a minimal impact on Qcells’ global module supply capabilities,” the spokesperson said. “The company’s manufacturing capacity has expanded a great deal, and current module production capability is large enough to cover our global markets.”
Hanwha Qcells said it offered voluntary redundancy packages to its employees.
“The company has not set a target number on this,” the spokesperson said. “Those staff that wish to remain in Qcells’ employ will be absorbed into the Jincheon operation, where the additional manpower will boost TOPCon and Tandem line operations.”
