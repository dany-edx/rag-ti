The project shall be located at village Parasan in Kalpi tehsil of the Jalaun District
The hydropower producer won the project by quoting an INR 2.68/kWh ((US$0.037/kWh)) tariff in an auction by Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA). 
UPNEDA will procure the power generated from the project for 25 years. 
SJVN’s latest solar addition follows the award for a 70 MW grid-connected PV project in the State of Gujarat. The Gujarat project will supply electricity to the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited at an INR 2.21/kWh (US$0.030/kWh) tariff for 25 years.
These projects will assist SJVN in achieving its ambitious shared vision of electricity generation of 5 GW by 2023, 12 GW by 2030, and 25 GW by 2040 and simultaneously contribute towards the RE capacity addition target of 175 GW by 2022 set by the Government of India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/21/renewable-energy-certificates-worth-over-inr-9000-crore-sold-to-date/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 21, 2021","Renewable energy certificates worth over INR 9,000 crore sold to date","An aggregate of 59.5 million renewable energy certificates (RECs) worth INR 9,266 crore (USD 1.24 billion) have been traded on the two Indian power exchanges since these market-based instruments’ launch in 2010, according to a study by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF). 
RECs help power distribution companies (discoms) and others meet their renewable purchase obligations (RPOs) without actually buying renewable power. Each REC issued corresponds to 1 MWh, or 1,000 kWh, of electricity injected into the grid.
The report highlights that the REC market is RPO-driven, with as many as 99% of all REC purchases dome to fulfill RPO requirements of Discoms, but is still grappling with insufficient demand. 
“Poor RPO compliance [by Discoms] across India has contributed to a demand shortfall of 7%, represented by the 5.1 million RECs unsold as of December 2020,” according to the report.
“Solar, which forms the centerpiece of India’s renewable energy (RE) ambitions, remains vastly underrepresented in REC issuances. To date, only 16% of RECs issued to power generators were against solar projects; wind and other renewable energy projects accounted for the balance 84% of REC issuances to power generators,” it added.
Rebooting the market
The volume of REC market trading in the last decade is an encouraging sign, given that the country will increasingly bank on market instruments like RECs to support its energy transition. However, the market hit a roadblock in 2020 due to an ongoing legal arbitration with CERC over removal of floor prices for these certificates. REC trading remains suspended since July 2020
Gagan Sidhu, Director, CEEW-CEF and lead author of the study, stressed on the need to resume REC trading at the earliest, accompanied by a calibrated market reboot to address current concerns and prepare for future challenges [in keeping with India’s RE ambitions for the next decade]. 
Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said, “Rebooting India’s REC market will give the world’s most ambitious renewable energy (RE) deployment programme a welcome fillip. While the REC mechanism was never intended to be a mainstay of the energy transition, it plays a crucial balancing role in a country where RE resources are unevenly spread. India’s experience with RECs can help shape the global roadmap for Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), a tradable emission reduction instrument expected to be a key discussion point at COP26.” 
The report stated while an effective market reboot should focus on boosting demand, it should also prepare for the possibility of a future supply crunch. This could happen if policymakers tighten lax regulations that currently allow defaulters to carry forward RPOs instead of meeting their targets using RECs. 
“India’s 27 RPO under-compliant states would have needed to buy an additional 67.2 million certificates in 2020 if they had chosen only to use RECs to meet their targets. For perspective, total REC issuances between 2011 and 2020 amounted to just 70.6 million,” it stated. 
In addition to improving RPO compliance vastly, Gagan Sidhu said, India should simultaneously develop alternative sources of demand such as voluntary REC purchases by corporations hoping to reduce their carbon footprint. Further, to ensure the market’s long-term health, the nation needs to focus on supply-side solutions like removing out-of-date conditionalities for REC issuance and creating more flexible markets.

Scientists at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have developed a prototype of a rechargeable battery based on cement with an average energy density of 7 Wh/m2.
Although the new storage technology is described as being at a very early stage of development, its creators are convinced that the device has the technical potential to be utilized in multiple applications. “This technology is perfectly suitable for large-scale storage of wind and solar energy,” researcher Luping Tan told pv magazine. “It is also perfect for rooftop PV and our primary idea was to produce roof elements with battery functions for storage of energy from PV.”
The storage system consists of a cement-based mixture in which a commercially available metal-coated carbon fiber (CF) mesh was embedded. Iron (Fe) was used for the anode and nickel-based (Ni) oxides for the cathode. “When CFs are used as additional filler in cement-based materials, they can increase electrical conductivity, decrease drying shrinkage, and increase flexural toughness,” the researchers explained.
The spacing of the meshes was 10 mm by 8 mm with a thickness of 1 mm and an ion exchange resin was added to the mixture of the cement-based electrolyte separator. “The structural battery was constructed as an anode layer, a separator layer, and a cathode layer, where the electrolyte is the cement-based separator,” the Swedish group said.

In the testing phase, the academics used a commercial charger for rechargeable nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries. The charging periods were approximately 12–16 h and the discharging periods around 8–12 h. “The cement-based electrodes with iron powder and nickel hydroxide (Ni (OH)2) powder are rechargeable in liquid electrolytes and can make a small LED lamp shine for several hours,” they stated. adding that its energy density reached just 0.5 Wh/m2.
The same electrodes with a coating of metal Ni and Fe, respectively, reached a maximum energy density of 7 Wh/m2 during six charge/discharge cycles. “The energy density is still low in comparison to commercial batteries, but this limitation could be overcome thanks to the huge volume at which the battery could be constructed when used in buildings,” the scientists said. “We have a vision that in the future this technology could allow for whole sections of multi-storey buildings made of functional concrete.”
A cost assessment of the storage technology was not conducted yet. “At the present stage it is difficult to compare the costs between different approaches,” Tan explained.
The experimental battery was described in the paper Rechargeable Concrete Battery, recently published in the scientific journal Buildings
