The 6.2MWp solar carport deployed by Tata Power will generate 86.4 lakh kWh of electricity per year and is estimated to reduce 7,000 tons of carbon emissions annually and 1.6 lakh tons over its lifecycle. 
Spanning over 30,000 square meters, the carport will generate green power and provide covered parking for finished cars in the plant.
Tata Motors envisioned the plant as part of its net-zero carbon goal for 2039. It had entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Tata Power in August last year. Despite the challenges brought by Covid-19, both companies successfully managed to develop this massive carport infrastructure in a record time of 9.5 months. 
Speaking on the occasion, Shailesh Chandra, President, Passenger Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors, said, “We have always been conscious of the need to conserve energy and are committed to achieving 100% renewable energy source for all our operations. Our partnership with Tata Power to deploy India’s largest solar carport at our car plant in Pune is a step in that direction.”
“As One Tata initiative, we are proud to partner with Tata Motors and inaugurate India’s largest solar carport. Our partnership is a testament to our collective efforts to lower the carbon footprint and provide innovative and future-focused green energy solutions. We will continue to explore new ways to harness clean resources and offer them to our partners and customers,” said Praveer Sinha, CEO and MD, Tata Power. 
Being a signatory of the RE100, Tata Motors is committed to using 100% renewable power and has taken several strides towards achieving this goal by progressively increasing the proportion of renewable energy used in its operations. In FY20, the company generated 88.71 million kWh of renewable electricity, which is over 21% of its total power consumption (up from 16% in FY19). This helped prevent the equivalent of 72,739 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The company further intends to source renewable energy more rigorously to meet its aspiration of sourcing 100% renewable energy by 2030. 
Tata Power has executed multiple large solar solutions, including the world’s largest rooftop solar plant (16 MW) at a single location at Radhasoami Satsang Beas in Amritsar, 2.67MW at Cochin International Airport, the world’s largest solar-powered cricket stadium for Cricket Club of India (CCI) with 820.8 kWp capacity; unique vertical solar farm (120 kW) for Dell Technologies in Bangalore, and 1.4MW floating solar at Tata Chemicals, Nellore.

A British-Nigerian research team has developed a model to design PV systems coupled to gravity-based energy storage systems.
The scientists explained that the proposed concept, described as a multi-state energy conversion system, builds upon the experience gained in previous research with pumped-hydro gravity storage systems, compressed air gravity storage, suspended weight in abandoned mine shafts, dynamic modelling of gravity energy storage coupled with a PV energy plant, and deep ocean gravity energy storage. “Essentially, this research is geared towards designing a storage system using non-conventional methods and radical ideas with little similitude to previous research but totally different in functionality,” they affirmed.
The research team built their experimental system with a solar power generator; a bulk booster charge controller; an inverter; a solenoid device – which is a coil of wire used as an electromagnet; a deep cycle battery; a pulley block; a geared motor; a microcontroller; and wire ropes.
The battery is not used primarily for storage purposes but only for smoothing out the system’s power output. It is connected to an inverter which, in turn, is connected to AC loads. “The life span of the battery in this proposed storage system will be longer, since the battery utilized here will have a constant output hour duration,” it warned.
The solar panels are connected via a diode to a charge controller that regulates the charges supplied to the deep cycle batteries and the electric geared motor. The latter is mounted on a foundation on the roof, which in turn opens into a hollow shaft connected to an intermediate pulley made up of two grooves. “One act[s] as the string wrap that carries the dead weight which falls under gravity when the solenoid retracts the geared motor shaft from the pulley shaft, while the other connects to the dynamo pulley via a flat belt,” the academics explained. “Then, the dynamo is connected to the battery via cables of considerable length, to avoid losses that may arise due to length and [the] resistivity of the cables used.”
Through a series of simulations the researchers found that, due to its high electrical requirements, the system needs to rely on high-power solar modules with an output of over 500 W, and suggested that a combination of multiple panels may be necessary for regions with low solar radiation levels. “This essentially proves the importance of effective utilization of this energy potential in continent[s] like Asia or Africa, with long sunlight stretches, as they will require [a] limited amount of panels, consequently reducing the cost incurred on [the] purchase of PV cells during set-up,” the researchers further explained, noting that raising of the weight and charging the battery requires a considerable amount of energy.
Africa is considered an ideal location, not only for its sunlight potential but also for the large amount of metal scrap materials it hosts, which can be converted to suspended weights at reasonable cost. “The unique characteristic of this system that makes it versatile, is the fact that it is not restricted to a particular land topographical reference or expensive component design materials,” they concluded. “Subsequent optimization of the design and sizing of this storage method might enable the gravity storage approach to compete favorably with current storage solutions already in the market.”
A complete description of the system can be found in the paper Gravitricity based on solar and gravity energy storage for residential applications, recently published in the International Journal of Energy and Environmental Engineering. The research group comprises scientists from the De Montfort University in the United Kingdom, and the Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria.

Acme holds the majority stake (51%) in the project awarded by state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI), with IFU raising a 39% stake and S3i 10%.
The total value of the project is the equivalent of just under US$ 200 million, of which about a quarter are financed through equity contributions by the three co-investors.
When commissioned, the Rajasthan solar project is expected to produce 675 GWh annually and reduce CO2 emissions by more than 500,000 tons CO2e annually, compared to the current energy mix. It will provide electricity to the equivalent of 500,000 households under a 25-year PPA agreement with SECI.
The project is estimated to create 225 direct jobs during construction and 75 permanent jobs during operation.
“This is a historic partnership agreement and we are very excited to have UNOPS S3i and IFU as our partners and co-investors in India for the development of solar projects. ACME will jointly develop world-class solar plants using the experiences of our partners in social impact measurement while optimizing operations and energy generation. This partnership is a key milestone towards ACME’s vision for developing a portfolio of 25 GW of RE projects which comes in line with India’s plans to achieve 450 GW of RE power by 2030,” said Manoj Upadhyay, Founder, and Chairman, ACME Group.
IFU’s investment is made on behalf of the Danish SDG Investment Fund, which is backed by the Danish state, larger Danish pension funds and other private investors.
The project is the first renewable energy project to be signed following the India-Denmark Green Strategic Partnership, launched in September 2020 by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.
In terms of megawatt capacity installed, the investment is one of IFU’s largest single renewable investments to date and will add further to IFU’s large portfolio of investments in renewable energy, which has reached a total of 2GW.
UNOPS will co-invest through Sustainable Investments in Infrastructure and Innovation (S3i), set up to deliver both social and environmental impact.
ACME Solar is one of India’s leading independent power producers in the solar energy sector with a combined portfolio of 5 GWp, out of which 2.3 GWp is operating and 2.7GWp under construction. The assets are well diversified with a presence across 13 states in India and a central: state mix of 65:35.
