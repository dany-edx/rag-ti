The BESS will have a capacity of up to 60.56 MWh.
The system will be co-located with a 50 MW solar plant in Phyang village, at a high altitude of 3,400 meters above sea level, where the temperature is very low.
“In this severe geographic condition, all devices need to be installed quickly and work reliably. Therefore, Sungrow has provided its comprehensive PV plus ESS solutions, including power conversion system SC2500UD and liquid-cooled energy storage system ST2752UX,” stated Sungrow, noting that it supports peak power management.
Tata Power was awarded the Leh solar-plus-storage project in August 2021. It is purportedly India’s first co-located, large-scale battery energy storage system solution and the first large-scale solar project in Ladakh. The project’s commercial operation date is set for March 2023.
Tata Power’s scope of work includes design, engineering, supply, procurement and construction on a turnkey basis, along with 10 years of operations and maintenance services. The deal brings Sungrow’s total inverter shipments in India to around 13 GW. The Chinese company also owns 10 GW of manufacturing capacity in Bengaluru.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/24/have-your-say-on-the-future-of-automation-in-solar-om/,"HIGHLIGHTS,SOILING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"MAY 24, 2022",Have your say on the future of automation in solar O&M,"A series of PV market, technological, macroeconomic, and even geopolitical developments have coalesced to make the automation of solar O&M provision a compelling proposition in 2022. In a recent pv magazine webinar, Wood Mackenzie Principle Analyst Daniel Liu described O&M automation as, “one of the last few place to unlock additional cost efficiencies on a project.”
The webinar was delivered in partnership with robotic cleaning provider Ecoppia, and the company’s CTO Ziv Ramati Miller noted that with two years of Covid-19 lockdowns making site visits at time impossible, automated O&M became the only way production, and profitability, could be maintained.
“It was only on sites that were fully automated that production was allowed to continue almost the same,” said Ramati Miller. “You needed to implement automation just to stay where you are.”
Given the imperative to adopt automation in O&M, pv magazine has partnered with Ecoppia to conduct a first-of-its kind survey into the subject. The short survey has been designed to take less than five minutes to complete and has been constructed to reveal insights into the opportunities for automation in O&M, and potential impediments to its more widespread adoption.
Complete the survey to influence how automation will be employed in O&M provision today and into the future.
While O&M may not be the first item on a project developer’s agenda, the webinar presenters agreed that how plants are to be maintained should be considered in the early development stages.
“It is true that solar is a very simple and robust technology, but we must keep in mind that your project starts with the early development phase and sometimes we tend to overlook some key considerations,” said Nicolas Chouluer, a partner at Europe-based independent engineers Everoze. “Good maintenance will help keep your asset viable.”
In terms of good maintenance, Ecoppia CTO Ramati Miller argued that technological development has delivered a host of opportunities for O&M automation. And in the current solar market, it is “not only a possibility but a necessity.
“You really have to combine the data from all sources, and it is not just about solar panel cleaning, but infrastructure, and corrective maintenance. If you can tell in advance which panels need to be switched, then you don’t need to have people on site constantly monitoring the situation. But you need to combine all of these [data] sources.”
Ramati Miller outlined how it is possible today to equip robotic cleaners with a host of sensors that can collect detailed information on module health – and importantly how things develop over time. With robots passing over modules on a regular basis, their ability to collect data in an ongoing fashion is unparalleled, he said.
“There are a lot of options for what can be fitted to a robot,” said Ramati Miller. As an example, he explained how simple sensors can monitor a tracking system’s health.
“One of the most basic situations we offer is just [to monitor] the angle of the panels. When we measure that we can see if angle keeps changing on trackers. Usually, you have a sensor in the middle of a row, at the motor, which might cover two tables. But the angle at the corners might change, and just by monitoring the angles in the corners it lets you know about material fatigue.”
In terms of the size of the opportunity, Wood Mackenzie’s Daniel Liu explains that given the current size of the installed PV fleet, “as a rule the industry needs to be much more proactive about all O&M and in this module washing.” He said that WoodMac anticipates annual non-residential solar O&M spend to reach $15 billion by 2030.
“Automation should ultimately help asset owner identify the true site conditions and give people a better handle on what is needed,” said Liu. “Predominately we have seen is that degradation is much higher and one of the main reasons why is that the soiling losses are higher than expected – even in place where you would expect rain to be quite frequent.”
The survey results will be presented and analyzed in the pv magazine Global magazine.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/24/perovskite-solar-cell-technology-on-the-road-to-commercialization/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"MAY 24, 2022",Perovskite solar cell technology on the road to commercialization,"From pv magazine Global
Achieving the US government’s decarbonization goals of 100% carbon-free electricity generation by 2035 and net-zero economy-wide carbon emissions by 2050 will require the deployment of record levels of renewable technologies. The most common solar technologies deployed to date are crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe), the costs of which have dropped markedly in recent years. The US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) said in order to meet 2035 targets, solar deployment has to double in the next three years, and ultimately ramp up to 100 GW by 2035.
While most development will use silicon and CdTe, SETO sees potential in nascent technologies like halide perovskites.
SETO finds that the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of halide perovskites (over 25% in single-junction cells and over 29% in tandem cells with silicon) show promise. One advantage of perovskites is that they can be easily manufactured in high volume. However, significant technological challenges must be addressed before perovskites are ready for commercial power sector markets.
In a recent Energy Focus report, SETO covers the critical technical barriers, the commercialization pitfalls and opportunities, and efforts to overcome barriers and challenges to commercialization. It also references SETO-funded projects, which can be viewed in the Solar Energy Research Database.
One of the major barriers is cost. In order for perovskite to be commercially competitive, its levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) must be competitive with that of other technologies. And with the cost of silicon and CdTe modules dropping while warranty times are increasing, it will be a steep challenge for perovskite to compete on an LCOE basis.
“As researchers continue to develop perovskites, there are lessons to be learned from the fates of other photovoltaic technologies. SETO is focused on helping perovskite photovoltaic companies to avoid those pitfalls and spurring innovation in order to get this technology market-ready and accelerate the deployment of solar energy,” said Dr. Lenny Tinker, photovoltaics program manager, Solar Energy Technologies Office, US Department of Energy.
Module and cell durability
Durability is the largest technological risk for perovskite PV. For LCOE metrics to approach SETO’s 2030 goals of $0.02 kWh, perovskite PV will have to last at least 20 years in the field, which will require improving its ability to withstand various environmental conditions. Much testing is required, yet today’s tests are geared toward commercialized PV technologies (Si, CdTe, etc.) and are unlikely to capture all the failure modes relevant to perovskite modules in the field.
Existing tests may also be excessive or promote irrelevant or uncharacteristic modes of perovskite device failure. SETO has published some minimum durability performance targets which, if realized, would provide strong evidence that a prototype perovskite PV device is ready to enter an initial production stage. To this end, SETO funds considerable perovskite durability work as well as development of test standards.
Efficiency, often considered a strength of perovskite PV, requires significant improvement for large-area devices before they are ready for the commercial arena. While standardized cell and module form factors have yet to be finalized for perovskite PV, standards will be a crucial prerequisite to scaling the entire industry beyond initial demonstration projects.
To encourage industry standardization and communication, SETO is promoting collaboration among academia, the national laboratories, and industry – intended to bring diverse perspectives and expertise to bear on common problems, accelerate cycles of learning, and facilitate transfers of knowledge and skills. Industry consortia like PACT and the US Manufacturing of Advanced Perovskites (MAP) consortium allow companies to connect and share best practices within this industry.
The final major technical hurdle to commercialization is achieving high production yield, with narrow distributions in module efficiencies. Barriers related to process control and manufacturing yield are often underappreciated, and perovskite solar cells have not yet demonstrated broad process flexibility in the lab. Cost-effective deposition processes will need to tolerate small variations in factors such as deposition tooling conditions, deposition environment, and ink compositions.
SETO has emphasized process control in perovskite projects across its portfolio, ensuring that changes in performance or efficiency are statistically significant and robust from a process standpoint, while funding the development of processes which, when scaled up, might be easier to control.
The ability of perovskite PV technologies to secure investor financing with low interest rates, may be even more significant than the technical challenges to perovskite PV commercialization.
Financing will be necessary for scaled manufacturing lines and deployment projects. Bankability is directly related to the confidence financers have that (1) the technical challenges have been solved, (2) the financed assets will perform long enough to deliver a desired return on investment, and (3) the liability of product failure and warranty claims is low. Ensuring bankability and durability standards are met is a SETO priority.
Future opportunity
These challenges faced by perovskite technology makes it uncertain as to if and when it can achieve gigawatt-scale deployment. In the meantime, there are many different applications that can support higher dollar-per-watt costs and durability issues including transportation, building integrated PV, military operations, aerospace, and Internet of Things. Substantial capital will be needed to scale the perovskite industry, which will come only once investors and financiers have confidence in the profitability of perovskite manufacturers and the long-term durability of perovskite module technologies.
Sustainable growth of the perovskite industry depends on avoiding these pitfalls and requires patient and careful investment that corresponds with the timeline and magnitude of progress needed to adopt this technology into products.
SETO has supported a wide range of perovskite startups in various stages of development, through different programs, as SETO can support sustainable investment in the perovskite PV space by providing nondilutive capital to promising early-stage commercial entities. Startups further along in the product development cycle and closer to pilot manufacturing are encouraged to apply for funding through SETO’s Incubator program.
Overall, the opportunities for perovskites as a solar technology are great. It has the potential to develop into a high-efficiency, low-cost module technology for commercial power sector deployment, with throughput rates and energy payback times superior to state-of-the-art PV technologies. SETO calls for members of the perovskite community increase device size, demonstrate relevant outdoor durability, and make processes robust in order to tap the potential of perovskite in the solar energy sector.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/24/upcycling-silicon-waste-from-end-of-life-solar-panels-into-thermoelectrics/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 24, 2022",Upcycling silicon waste from end-of-life solar panels into thermoelectrics,"From pv magazine Global 
A research group from Singapore has offered to reuse silicon from end-of-life photovoltaics in high-performance thermoelectric devices that convert heat into electricity.
“Our method can be applied to all silicon-based solar panels,” researcher Ady Suwardi told pv magazine.
The scientists said thermoelectric devices are very tolerant to defects and impurities, which makes them particularly suitable for recycled silicon, which is uneconomical to recycle due to its defect- and impurity-sensitive nature.
Their new technique consists of pulverizing polycrystalline silicon into powder and pelletizing it into ingots. The process relies on spark plasma sintering to dope the silicon with germanium and phosphorus. The combination of doping and reduced thermal conductivity is designed to improve the power conversion and cooling efficiency of applicable thermoelectric technologies.
The researchers tested their technique on 15.6 cm x 15.6 cm solar cells provided by Singaporean manufacturer Green Research Scientific.
“The silicon pieces were pulverized using ball milling into fine powder,” they said, noting that the ball milling is done for an hour in argon atmosphere to ensure homogeneity and prevent oxidation. “Subsequently, the mixed powders were consolidated using spark plasma sintering at 1,150 C for five minutes.”
The group found that phosphorus doping modified the electronic structure of the silicon, while improving its power factor and carrier scattering. Germanium doping helped further improve both the electronic and thermal transport properties of the upcycled silicon.
“Furthermore, the recycled silicon with low germanium content in this work is expected to have good stability since silicon-based thermoelectrics such as Silicon-germanium (SiGe) have been widely known to have good mechanical and chemical stability during long-term, high-temperature operation,” they said. “This results in attractive energy harvested/dollar ratio compared to conventional thermoelectrics that mainly rely on heavy elements.”
The academics presented their findings in “Upcycling Silicon Photovoltaic Waste into Thermoelectrics,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials. The research group includes scientists from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.
“At this point, it is difficult to estimate the cost of our recycling technology as it depends on many external factors such as scale, supply, labor, technology, and so on,” Suwardi said.
