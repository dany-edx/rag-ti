The company sourced 2,600 million units of green power in FY 2022-23 from various sources of renewable energy, including solar, wind, and hydro. Renewable power constituted more than 26% of total units sold to consumers by the company in its operational area.
Under the RPO mandate, Discoms must source a fixed percentage of their total power purchase from renewable energy sources. Popularly known as ‘RPO,’ the percentage varies from state to state and is fixed by the respective electricity regulatory commission of each state. In the case of the national capital, the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has fixed the RPO Obligation at 21.35% for FY 2022-23.
Tata Power-DDL met its RPO compliance in FY 2021-22 and FY 2020-21 too by sourcing 2,500 and 2,050 million units of green energy, respectively.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/10/hail-prone-areas-may-require-solar-modules-with-4-mm-thick-front-glass/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Hail-prone areas may require solar modules with 4 mm-thick front glass,"Recent hailstorms in Europe and North America have damaged several PV installations and heated up the debate on how solar power generators can be protected by these unpredictable events. A study conducted by Dutch scientists in 2019 showed that damages to solar panels are primarily caused by hailstones measuring at least 3 cm in size.
A new study from India claims now that the typical front glass used for solar panels, with a thickness of up to 3.2 mm, may not be sufficient to protect the modules in hail-prone areas. According to the scientists, although the PV industry mainly uses panels with that thickness, a front glass of at least 4 mm should be used. 
“Hail with a diameter of 20 mm to 30 mm is very critical to solar PV,” corresponding author Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar told pv magazine. “Damage is mainly related to the structure, resulting in a reduction of overall power generation, and in some cases also a drop in the operational lifespan.” 
Published in Renewable Energy, “Analysis of the hail impacts on the performance of commercially available photovoltaic modules of varying front glass thickness” suggests that standardized IEC durability tests for hail might not be sufficient, as testing of ice balls greater than 25 mm is only optional.
The group compared three PV modules with different thicknesses to their front glass – 2.8 mm, 3.2 mm, and 4 mm – under various hail sizes, weights, and velocities.
The analysis showed that, after being hit with a 45 mm ice ball, the module with the thinnest glass lost 21.8% of its power output, and the 3.2 mm module lost 11.74%. The thickest module tested lost only 0.81% after being hit with the same size of hail, and when tested against 55 mm hail lost 1.13%. Larger size ice balls were not tested, the scientists said, as they are relatively rare.
The loss of output was due to cracks. “Cracks are frequently imperceptible to the naked eye,” the researchers noted. “They might result in electrically disconnected cell areas, resulting in a linear drop in short-circuit current and increased series resistance, lowering the module’s power output.”
 With the 45 mm ball, very severe cracks were visible on the 2.8 mm and the 3.2 mm panels. In the case of the thickest panel, however, only microcracks were found when it was hit with the same-sized ball. “Microcracks can cause an electrical separation, rendering a portion of a cell inactive,” the research team explained. 
The academics also ascertained that all three panels experienced wet leakage current resistance – that is, a reduction in their ability to withstand moist and the wet – after being hit with 45 mm hail. The thickest panel lost 27.23% of its resistance, while the medium one lost 46.81%, and the thinnest lost 55.25%.
“The relationship between hail and damage to near-zero emissions measures is fascinating, especially with the likelihood of increased hailstorms owing to climate change in most parts of Europe,” they emphasized. “Because insurers are vigorously offsetting their exposure and module suppliers do not provide a warranty against hail damage, project owners and investors are left to bear the risk.”

It is already winning contracts with the solution, such as the $8.5 million agreement with ReNew, a NASDAQ-listed renewable energy developer in India, its fifth agreement with ReNew.
Like earlier solutions, the new Airtouch model is a robotic solution, operating autonomously. It is typically installed in arid and dusty locations. It uses airflow and microfiber wipers to remove soil from the PV module surfaces rather than water.
The latest version is designed to provide greater cleaning efficiency and better maneuverability, according to Airtouch Solar. It is a 4-meter cleaning unit that weighs less than 40 kg. For comparison’s sake, the Airtouch AT 3.0 is a six-meter robot.
Each unit can clean up to 2000 meters on a full charge,” a spokesperson from Airtouch Solar told pv magazine. “Optional rubber flippers can be added for hard-to-remove soiling. Each robot is recharged with the help of solar panels that Airtouch supplies and installs.”
The cleaning units are equipped with sensors and wirelessly connected to Airtouch’s cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform for remote monitoring, remote controlling, and management.
With extensive operations in India, Airtouch has been winning long-term supply and maintenance agreements with companies like Renew Energy, Amplus, Adani Green Energy, and Acme, as reported by pv magazine India.
