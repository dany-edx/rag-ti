The product will be commercially available by early next year. It will be the largest BDC made in India, stated the company. 
FIMER mainly caters to commercial and industrial and utility-scale applications in India and other markets. The company has a 10 GW factory in Bengaluru, which manufactures central inverters, bidirectional converters, and inverters for microgrid applications. 
FIMER’s 1 MVA bidirectional converter, PVS980-58BC, has been successfully deployed in Modhera and Indian army projects in Leh, Ladakh. 
The PVS980-58BC 5MVA features 978-1,500 V DC input, an efficiency of up to 98.8%, and a compact and modular design. The product measures 5694x2350x1634 mm and weighs 6,000 kg. It is designed for outdoor use with an IP55-rated enclosure and self-contained cooling system. The BDC can operate in ambient temperatures (nominal) ranging from -20 °C to +50 °C, and relative humidity of 5% to 100%.

CleanCo, a Queensland government-owned energy company, wants to add 3 GW of clean energy capacity to support the Australian state’s renewable energy targets, which aim for 50% by 2030, rising to 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035.
CleanCo Chief Executive Officer Tom Metcalfe said the 3 GW total includes project development acquisitions, joint venture investments, and offtake agreements.
“We’re looking for renewable energy and firming projects that will help us reach our 2030 goals and contribute to Queensland’s clean energy future,” he said.
Submissions for the 3 GW close on Nov. 17.
he Queensland government’s renewable energy targets call for an additional 22 GW of new wind and solar projects by 2035, supported by at least 12 GW of storage, firming and dispatchable technologies including grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro storage.
In June, the state government announced it would spend AUD 500 million ($316.4 million) through CleanCo “to propel the development of large-scale solar and wind projects” in central Queensland.
In September, CleanCo released an expression of interest seeking up to 400 MW of renewable generation and storage projects to support the development of its Swanbank Clean Energy Hub near Ipswich, Queensland.
CleanCo has also been given funding to install a 250 MW/500 MWh big battery at the Swanbank energy precinct.

Netherlands-based Triple Solar BV has launched a thermal battery for residential applications.
The manufacturer said the thermal storage system can be used in combination with its heat pumps. “Compared to a traditional hot water boiler, the thermal battery is up to four times smaller,” it said in a statement.
Triple Solar sells the new product in three different sizes. The smallest battery measures 640 mm x 365 mm x 575 mm and weighs 136 kg. It features a heat loss rate of 0.67 kWh/day and its capacity is 167 l.
The medium-sized device has a size of 870 mm x 365 mm x 575 mm, a weight of 187 kg and a capacity of 217 l. It has a heat loss rate of 0.77 kWh/day. The largest product has dimensions of 1,050 mm x 365 mm x 575 mm and weighs in at 233 kg. Its capacity is 333 l and it has a heat loss rate of 0.84 kWh/day.
All products operate at a maximum pressure of 10 bars and can reportedly provide hot water at temperatures ranging from 45C to 55 C, with minimum heat source temperature ranging between 65 C and 80 C.
“Households and their homes are becoming smaller and smaller. As a result, there is often no room for a large boiler,” said the company’s COO, Cees Mager. “The thermal battery is so compact that it even fits in a kitchen cupboard.”
Triple Solar began selling the new thermal battery on October 12. The Dutch company also manufactures heat pumps and photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panels.
