The solar park will be India’s largest when completed. It shall be located at Rann of Kutch—a saline desert near Khavada village of the Kutch district.
NTPC Renewable Energy, an arm of NTPC, received the go-ahead from the MNRE to set up the solar park under Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Park Scheme. NTPC Renewable Energy also plans to generate green hydrogen on a commercial scale from this park.
The 4.75 GW solar capacity will reportedly be part of the massive 30 GW hybrid renewable energy park coming up in Kutch at an investment of about 1.5 lakh crore rupees. 
When completed, the 30 GW park will be the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park spread over 72,600 hectares in Kutch, an area as big as Singapore or Bahrain, according to an earlier release by MNRE. 
NTPC, a coal-dominated power producer, aims to build 60 GW renewable energy capacity by 2032 as part of its commitment to sustainable power generation and safeguarding the environment. Currently, it has an installed capacity of 66 GW across 70 power projects with an additional 18 GW under construction.
The power producer commissioned India’s largest floating solar plant of 10 MW (AC) on the reservoir of Simhadri Thermal Power Plant, Andhra Pradesh, recently. An additional 15 MW (AC) would be commissioned by August 2021.
Further, a 100 MW floating solar project on the reservoir of Ramagundam Thermal Power Plant, Telangana, is in the advanced stage of implementation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/13/oriano-sees-solar-project-orders-surging-to-350-mwp/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 13, 2021",Oriano sees solar project orders surging to 350 MWp,"Mumbai-based Oriano has more than INR 300-crore contracts in hand for setting up 350+ MWp of utility-scale solar projects across various states in India.
“Out of this, orders for 125 MWp of projects in open access (OA) mechanism were closed last year (FY 2020-21) itself. However, the execution got delayed due to Pandemic. The balance capacity was bagged this year,” Lokendra Singh, business head–EPC business and co-founder-development division, told pv magazine.
With the pandemic subsiding, the company has now seen a sharp rebound in the business. Its order book has increased to 350+ MWp with a mix of Opex and Capex projects. The capacity includes 125 MWp in developer mode.
“We are seeing increased interest in commercial and industrial open-access segment. We being directly engaged with corporate consumers with their energy needs, are able to deliver bankable power purchase agreements along with speedy delivery of the project due to in-house development and EPC capabilities,” said Singh
In development business, Oriano said it recently won 70 MW of commercial and industrial solar capacity in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and signed corporate power purchase agreements for 55 MWp in Karnataka and Maharashtra with AA-rated clients. The company stated it has created 175 MWp of projects in shovel-ready status.
Founded in 2015, Oriano has a 700+ MWp of solar development and EPC projects installed and under execution, with consumer list including Honda, Bosch, Bajaj Auto, Amway, Cipla, Tata Communications, First Solar (USA), Aditya Birla Renewables, Solarpack (Spain), Downing (UK), Technique Solaire (France), HAL, and HPCL, among others. SIDBI Venture Capital is an equity investor in the company and the company has recently raised debt INR 15 crore from Caspian Impact Investments and Northern Arc.
“With this additional 350+ MWp, we are targeting a portfolio of 1+ GW by 2022. Moving forward, we are looking to partner captive customers across sectors looking to adopt solar energy. Additionally, we are in discussions with new partners to fuel our growth,” Lokendra added.

The installer shall set up the proposed project at a land identified, acquired, and purchased by it on SECI’s behalf and shall transfer the same in favor of SECI.
The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing, commissioning, and comprehensive operation and maintenance of the solar plants for 15 years. 
The cells and modules used in the project shall be sourced only from the models and manufacturers included in the first list (solar modules) under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) order issued by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy on March 10, 2021.
The minimum quantum of land required for the project is 400 acres and bidders are required to consider this minimum land requirement while bidding. 
The commissioning period for the 100 MW solar project with land handover is 18 months from the award of the contract.

Chinese solar manufacturer JinkoSolar has achieved 23.53% conversion efficiency for an n-type monocrystalline solar PV module based on its TOPCon mono cell technology, for which a record efficiency of 25.25% was announced in late May.
The result has been confirmed by Germany’s TÜV Rheinland and beats the company’s previous record of 23.1% set in January 2021.
“The module’s breakthrough performance was the result of adopting JinkoSolar’s cutting-edge TOPCon cell technology fused with a new-type of welding and packaging technology,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The module design not only reduces the internal resistance loss of the module, but improves power efficiency and module appearance.”
In January 2020, Jinko said it was able to improve the panel performance by applying a new anti-reflection coating and advanced metallization technologies. New Tiling Ribbon (TR) technology was also incorporated into the cell design, which eliminates any inter-cell gap. At the time, the panel power conversion efficiency was 22.39%.
The solar module relies on solar cells featuring a 267.72cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate grown using the Czochralski method.
