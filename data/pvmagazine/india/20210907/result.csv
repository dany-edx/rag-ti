To meet projections and targets for both renewable energy and electrification of transport set for the next decade, battery manufacturing will have to expand significantly. And though the batteries are needed to achieve decarbonization goals, the materials and processes used in battery manufacturing come with their own set of environmental concerns.
Battery electrodes are commonly manufactured using wet chemical processes requiring evaporation of toxic solvents, as well as drying at elevated temperatures requiring energy and space. The new process, developed by scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology (IWS), offers an alternative that promises to be solvent-free with considerably lower energy consumption.
The new process proposed by Fraunhofer IWS deposits a film of lithium (or another electrode material) between two and twenty microns thick onto a current collector. The raw materials are similar to those used in current large-scale battery manufacturing, though solvents are replaced with a binding agent.
The materials are fed as a dry mixture into a calender gap – two rollers rotating in opposite directions, one faster than the other. The force generated by this forms a fine film on the faster moving roller, and is transferred onto a current collector foil. This can then be coated with carbon to reduce resistance, cut to size and stacked with the other components to form a full battery cell.
The group estimates that its process would require just one-third the equipment of space of solvent-based processes, as well as moving the energy-intensive drying process from battery manufacturing. They have set up prototype machinery for the process, which it calls dry transfer electrode coating, or DRYtraec, and say they have demonstrated its applicability for large-scale production.
DRYtraec can also be applied to a range of different battery materials and chemistries. “The range of possible uses for the technology is not limited to a particular cell chemistry,” explains Benjamin Schumm, group manager for chemical coatings technology at Fraunhofer IWS. “It could equally be used on lithium-ion cells as on lithium-sulfur or sodium-ion cells.”
The group says it is in discussion with various automobile and battery manufacturers about establishing pilot systems to test and refine the process in an industrial setting. Schumm further notes that the process could also be suitable for use in manufacturing ‘next generation’ energy storage technologies, such as solid-state batteries. “These [solid state batteries] will be increasingly important in the future, but the materials cannot tolerate wet chemical processing,” he says. “Thus, DRYtraec allows to offer a very promising solution.”

This mass of PV waste generated will be due to early failures or damages during transportation, installation, and operation, according to a new study.
The report was developed in cooperation among the EU India Technical Cooperation Project (IDOM), European solar trade body SolarPower Europe, European take-back and recycling association PV CYCLE, and Indian industry body National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI).
To project the PV waste generated in India by the year 2030, the report authors estimated the annual and cumulative growth of the installed PV capacity in India under three scenarios. In addition, they made a number of assumptions about PV module weight, PV annual replacement rates, and PV modules damaged during transportation and construction. 
According to the analysts, by the year 2030 India will generate a cumulative mass of PV module waste of 11 kilotonnes (kt) in the Low scenario, 21 kt in the Medium scenario, and 34 kt in the High scenario. The waste generated due to the end of life of the PV modules would start accumulating only around after the year 2040 and will become rapidly the most relevant waste source.
Compared to current installation levels, the annual PV market is expected to grow significantly across all three scenarios investigated in the study. By 2030, cumulative installed capacity experiences a multifold growth across all scenarios. Under the Low and Medium scenarios, cumulative capacity by 2030 reaches 187 and 287 GW respectively, up from 40 GW in 2020. The High scenario capacity reaches 400 GW by 2030, in line with government ambition. Assuming that PV systems installed in 2020-30 have a lifetime of at least 30 years, any capacity installed during this period will reach the end-of-life stage not before 2050. 
Given that ground-mounted solar constitutes the vast majority of PV capacity, and that the residential segment is only a fraction of rooftop installations, the report concludes that the greatest bulk of end-of-life PV waste will be deriving from B2B relations.
In India, there is no policy in respect to dealing with the waste generated by PV modules as they are neither included in e-waste, nor in hazardous waste regulations. The report outlines different overall policy approaches for PV waste management in India. The business-as-usual scenario maintains the current status quo. In an improved business-as-usual scenario, a landfill ban is introduced but the end-owner retains end-of-life management responsibility. an Extended Producer Responsibility scenario, on top of a landfill ban, the producer has legal responsibility for the end-of-life management of the product. 
The authors recommend the Extended Producer Responsibility approach as the best one for the Indian context, as it constitutes the most effective means to perform sound PV waste management. They advise Indian policymakers to implement an EPR law for PV modules which sets the principle of a Producer Responsibility for PV modules and – where required – other products of a PV system, such as inverters and batteries.
EU India TCP, NSEFI, SolarPower Europe, and PV cycle designed a questionnaire to understand the notion of Indian stakeholders (especially manufacturers and developers) on different aspects of PV waste management mechanism. Thirteen key questions were posed to the stakeholders to seek their inputs. Around 71% of the stakeholders were willing to take the responsibility for the end-of-life phase of PV modules, inverters, and batteries sold into the Indian market. Among the manufacturers who participated in this survey almost 80% of them were willing to take this responsibility.
Only half of the survey respondents believed that PV recycling will be profitable in the coming years. Most of them cited the scale, market for the recycled materials, and incentives for recycling, diversity of PV modules and collection cost as the possible reasons for non-profitability. 
Around 71% of the stakeholders interviewed felt that recycling inverters is economically viable in India, while only 35% felt recycling Lithium-Ion batteries is viable in India. Imposing Landfill ban and taxes on it along with enforcing stricter Extended Producer Responsibilities are the two main factors the stakeholders felt should be enforced by the government to push the market for a circular economy. Finally, a majority (86%) of the respondents felt that setting targets for a minimum amount of recycled content to be included while manufacturing new modules will help in realizing recycling goals.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/07/hybrid-wind-solar-for-highways/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2021",Hybrid wind-solar for highways,"From pv magazine International
Swiss company Energy Pier has developed a new concept to build hybrid wind and solar plants along highways.
According to Laurent Jospin, an engineer at the company, the proposed solution is based on proven technology for rooftop PV. “The modules are designed in such a way that they have the highest possible degree of efficiency and can be replaced several times during the service life of the system so that the entire system always stays up to date with technological progress,” he explained.
Regarding the wind power unit, the company said that its load-bearing structure is designed in such a way that it creates an acceleration effect of air movement that is then used by its own AnemoGen, small scale wind generators, which are installed on both sides of the supporting pillars of the PV system deployed along the highway. “The rotor blades could absorb energy even with low air currents, and generate electricity via the generator,” the company explained. “The AnemoGen system is available in different sizes and is able to use both upstream and downstream air flows.”
Energy Pier believes that, with this approach, between 22,000 and 30,000 solar modules, and up to 320 AnemoGen generators, could be installed on every kilometer of a four-lane motorway. In addition, 162 pillars, to sustain the roof, should be deployed.
The company also emphasized the other advantages of its solution. For example, the protective wall and the roof ensure a considerable reduction in noise and the roof also protects the street from snowfall and sun. In summer, this offers protection from excessive heat and UV radiation, and in winter it makes snow-removal superfluous. In addition, the roof areas could also be used as rainwater collectors. The supporting structure, in turn, offers space for cables and other installations, such as emergency charging stations.
According to the company, which is already planning the first two demonstrators, the construction of the photovoltaic-and-wind combined power plants is also possible without interrupting traffic. One is being built in the municipality of Fully, in the canton of Valais. It is expected to have a length of 1,609m and to deliver around 50 GWh of green electricity per year.
The two pilot projects are planned in the Knonauer Amt district of the canton of Zurich. They will occupy a total area of 2,500m and generate around 78 GWh of solar and wind power annually.
