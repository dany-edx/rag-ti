https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/04/building-the-green-hydrogen-economy-in-india/,"ELECTROLYZER,FINANCE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 4, 2022",Building the green hydrogen economy in India,"Industry body India Hydrogen Alliance (IH2A) has proposed the creation of a public-private taskforce to develop gigawatt-scale green hydrogen hubs in India. The taskforce, called H2Bharat, will aim at identifying at least five large GW-scale green hydrogen hubs for development in India, within the next 18-months.
The IH2A proposal to the government policymakers was one of the seven points deliberated during a workshop conducted by NITI Aayog and IH2A to build the hydrogen economy in India.
The workshop was attended by representatives from the European Investment Bank (EIB), World Bank, OECD, GIZ, CDC, and FMO; Government of India, Government of Kerala, and industry players from across the hydrogen value chain. 
At the NITI Aayog-IH2A workshop, experts recommended India should replicate the global best practice of GW-scale green H2 hubs to commercialize green hydrogen. These hubs or regional clusters will have co-located green H2 production and consumption across different use cases.
The first green H2 hubs should be designated national projects or ‘Special Projects of National Importance’ and be supported with special incentives and public funding.
The formation of public-private consortiums is crucial to pool public and private resources and de-risk early project development in these national green hydrogen hubs and project clusters. 
Sovereign green bonds and global climate finance commitments can provide the necessary funding for GW-scale green hydrogen hubs in India. Multilateral and government agencies can catalyze early market development by part-funding design and pre-feasibility studies for the national hubs.
India needs a pipeline of national hydrogen hubs that can be evaluated before public and low-cost funding is extended to them. Funding agencies are keen to see the synergies across the green hydrogen value-chain in project plans rather than standalone green hydrogen projects, said the experts.
Experts said pre-feasibility studies for the first set of GW-scale green hydrogen hubs should start immediately, with at least five national green hydrogen hubs identified in the next 18 months. 
They recommended the formation of a public-private H2Bharat commercialization taskforce with a focus on green H2 hub or cluster development. The taskforce must target conducting pre-feasibility studies for the first five GW green H2 clusters/hubs in India in the next 12 months. 
Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive, NITI Aayog, said, “Our aim is to bring down the cost of green hydrogen to $2.5/kg by 2025 and $1/kg by 2030. This is possible only by increasing the size and scale of hydrogen manufacturing. With rapidly falling renewable energy costs, India’s green hydrogen production cost is expected to be amongst the lowest in the world. The H2Bharat Taskforce is an interesting proposal to kick-start green hydrogen project development at a large GW scale. We welcome this voluntary initiative from the industry and look forward to collaborating on it.”
Jill Evanko, Chief Executive and President, Chart Industries, and founding member, IH2A, said, “The H2Bharat Taskforce will identify and shortlist five GW-scale national green hydrogen hubs for development in the next 12 months. It would bring together all relevant stakeholders from the government, funding agencies, and the industry. IH2A will be happy to extend resources for this initiative voluntarily and work together with NITI Aayog and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) for it.” 
IH2A estimates that India will need about US$ 25 billion of investment from public and private sectors to create a domestic green hydrogen supply chain with a national installed electrolyzer capacity of 25 GW producing 5 MT of Green Hydrogen by 2030. It has earlier been stated that coordinated public-private actions will be required to develop the first generation of large-scale commercial hydrogen projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/04/ukrainian-energy-company-restarts-grid-generation-from-its-solar-parks/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UKRAINE",MAX HALL,"MARCH 4, 2022",Ukrainian energy company restarts grid generation from its solar parks,"From pv magazine Global
Ukrainian energy company DTEK has told pv magazine its three solar parks in the country this morning started to generate power for the national grid again as restrictions on the operation of clean energy facilities began to be lifted.
Renewables plants have not generated power for the Ukrainian grid since state-owned electricity transmission system operator Ukrenergo ordered them to be powered down on Thursday, for a three-day trial of running the grid in isolation from the power systems of Russia and Belarus.
That grid isolation exercise was part of a plan to eventually link the Ukrainian grid with the pan-European network overseen by EU body the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, a DTEK spokesperson said.
After the trial concluded, on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy decided to continue to operate the national grid in isolation mode, meaning renewables facilities in the nation had to remain powered down.
However, DTEK told pv magazine today that restriction has begun to be lifted, for the first time since Russia invaded the country a week ago, with the spokesperson stating: “As of the morning of March 1, DTEK RES [Renewables] solar power plants Trifonovskaya, Nikopolskaya, [and] Pokrovskaya [have begun] to gain load and supply electricity to the grid due to the gradual lifting of restrictions by NPC [National Power Company] Ukrenergo.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/04/iea-outlines-plan-to-rapidly-reduce-dominant-role-of-russia-in-europes-energy-markets/,"GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,EUROPE,RUSSIA,UKRAINE",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 4, 2022",IEA outlines plan to rapidly reduce dominant role of Russia in Europe’s energy markets,"From pv magazine Global
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is sure to have long lasting implications for the world’s energy supply. And for Europe in particular, which imported 155 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian natural gas in 2021 – 45% of the European Union’s gas imports and around 40% of its total gas consumption.
Europe’s reliance on natural gas, primarily for heating, is set to decline over the coming decades in line with net zero targets enshrined across the continent. However, the crisis in Ukraine has quickly highlighted the need for faster action not only in the name of climate protection but to ensure a secure and reliable energy supply.
In terms of immediate energy supply to Ukraine, Barbara Pompili, Minister for Ecological Transition of France, which currently holds the EU Presidency, stated in a press conference that Ukraine is no longer connected to Russia’s electricity grid, and that European grid operator ENTSO-E is expected to complete the country’s connection the European network within 15 days. Scatec Solar has also said it is ready to resume delivering power from the 336MW of currently curtailed PV that it owns in the country, and that it is able to operate these plants remotely.
Looking ahead to next winter and further, the International Energy Agency today published a 10-point plan by which it says Europe could reduce its imports of Russian gas by one third within a year, without compromising goals set out in the European Green Deal or risking major energy price increases. “Nobody is under any illusions anymore. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon show Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “Europe needs to rapidly reduce the dominant role of Russia in its energy markets and ramp up the alternatives as quickly as possible.”

Birol presented the 10 point plan, alongside Pompili and European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson, in a virtual press conference earlier today. First among the IEA’s suggestions are not signing any new supply contracts with Russia, securing alternative sources of gas, and to increase gas storage levels over the summer to provide an adequate buffer during the heating season. The agency notes that contracts with Gazprom covering more than 15 bcm are set to expire in 2022. During the press conference Birol noted Azerbaijan and Algeria as potential key sources of replacement supply.
Speeding up the development of wind and solar projects is fourth on the IEA’s to-do list for Europe, its analysis finds that tackling permitting delays alone could put an additional 20TWh of electricity onto Europe’s grids over the next year, while investing €3 billion in incentives covering part of the installation cost for residential PV could add another 15 TWh. The IEA estimates these two measures combined could reduce gas use by 6bcm.
They also recommend delaying the planned closure of four nuclear reactors, and bringing reactors taken offline for maintenance and safety checks back up, as well as increasing the use of existing biomass power plants, which were estimated to have run at 50% capacity in 2021.
Speeding up the adoption of heat pumps to replace gas boilers, and implementing new energy efficiency measures in buildings could cut 4bcm of gas demand this year. Further a move away from gas in supplying flexibility to electric grids, and boosting long and short-term energy storage, demand response and other alternatives to decouple gas from the electricity network could significantly cut gas demand, though it warns that “EU member states need to ensure that there are adequate market price signals to support the business case for these investments.”
The final set of recommendations relates to consumer supply, with the IEA calling for short term measures to raise additional taxes on energy suppliers likely to see profits increase due to high energy prices and to redistribute these to partially offset energy bills, as has already begun to happen in Italy and Romania. It is also noted that for consumers that turning down thermostats across the EU down by just 1 degree could immediately cut annual demand for gas by 10bcm.
“Reducing our dependence on Russian gas is a strategic imperative for the European Union. In recent years, we have already significantly diversified our supply, building LNG terminals and new interconnectors,” said Simson. “Next week, the Commission will propose a pathway for Europe to become independent from Russian gas as soon as possible. The IEA’s analysis outlines a number of concrete steps we can take towards that goal. It is a very timely and valuable contribution to our work.”
