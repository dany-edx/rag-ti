They developed the two-dimensional (2D) anode material using nanosheets derived from titanium diboride (TiB2), a material that resembles a multi-stacked sandwich, where metal atoms are present in-between layers of boron.
Currently, graphite and lithium titanate are among the most widely used anode materials in the commercially available lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) that power laptops, mobile phones, and electric vehicles. LIBs with graphite anode, which is extremely energy dense, can power an electric vehicle for hundreds of kilometers in one charge cycle. However, these are prone to fire hazards. Lithium titanate anodes are safer and also facilitate fast charging. But, they have a lower energy density, which means that they would need more frequent recharging.
The research team led by IITGN’s prof Kabeer Jasuja and JAIST’s prof Noriyoshi Matsumi found that when TiB2-based hierarchical nanosheets (THNS) were used to prepare the anode, a discharge capacity of 174 mA h/g (a unit that measures the energy capacity of a battery) can be obtained within 10 minutes at a current rate of 1 A/g. The intertwined carpet-like structure facilitates an efficient migration of charges in and out of nanosheets with ease, which resolves a Lithium-Ion diffusion-related challenge.
The researchers also found that this anode had an ultra-fast charging capacity with a considerable discharge capacity at high-capacity retention (up to 80% even after 10,000 cycles of operation), which means that batteries made with this material would give almost the same high performance even after more than 10,000 cycles of charging.
Moreover, there was no degradation or corrosion of THNS due to redox reactions and the porosity was also retained very well. This demonstrates structural stability with very less volumetric expansion (less than 40%) over thousands of charge−discharge cycles.
Explaining the high efficiency of the newly innovated battery material, Akash Varma, an MTech student, who is also the first author of this work, said, “It is the presence of titanium and boron atoms arranged in a carpet-like interweaved porous structure within the nanosheets that are helping in an efficient charge transport and storage.” Varma spent one year at IITGN and another year at JAIST as a part of his double master’s degree – a unique collaborative program between JAIST and IITGN.
The team stated that the pores within TiB2-based hierarchical nanosheets act as channels for fast and reversible ion transport; hence, Lithium-Ions can be rapidly inserted and extracted from the nanosheets resulting in faster-charging capacity.
The researchers emphasized that this is a promising technology for commercial applications where high energy density, high power, long life, and ultra-fast charging are desired. The research team plans to translate this work from the lab to a real-life application.
Prof Kabeer Jasuja, Dr Dinesh O Shah Chair Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering, IITGN, said, “What makes this work especially useful is the fact that the method to synthesize TiB2 nanosheets is inherently scalable. It only requires mixing the TiB2 particles in an aqueous solution of dilute hydrogen peroxide and allowing it to recrystallize. For any nanomaterial to translate into a tangible technology, scalability is the limiting factor. Our method to synthesize these TiB2 nanosheets only requires stirring and no sophisticated equipment, making it highly adoptable.”
Prof Noriyoshi Matsumi, Professor of Materials Chemistry, JAIST, said, “Nowadays, the requirement for high-rate charge-discharge technology is tremendously increasing to enable widespread commercialization of various kinds of electric vehicles in the future. Our findings can stimulate related research fields to invite more researchers to work on the application of unique 2D materials. We hope continuous research will contribute to the convenience of EV users, lesser air pollution on the road, especially in cities, and less stressful mobile life, which will enhance the productivity of society.”

With 165 GW of RE generation capacity (including hydro) already in place, the nation is on the right trajectory to meet its goal of meeting 50% of its energy needs through renewables by 2030, says a new report by Arthur D. Little.
To further accelerate adoption, the report recommends that India should focus on developing solar and wind generation capacities by focusing on improving investor confidence, removing barriers to entry of greenfield projects, increasing domestic equipment production, and scaling up rooftop solar and wind project deployment.
“The government needs to introduce policy reforms for facilitating a smoother and faster transition to a market-based model from the existing Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) model for buying electricity. There should be stricter policies to define and improve contractual structures and policies on curtailment of risk and compensation,” states the report.
Increased adoption of green energy with green hydrogen as a carbon-neutral energy storage solution; leveraging technologies such as carbon capture, smart meters, and smart grids with robust data management systems; and enabling efficient price discovery via power exchanges will shape the future of India’s power sector.
To achieve surplus generation, Arthur D. Little’s research proposes a multifaceted approach involving financial support from the government, policy reforms, judicial reforms, and technology integration at the Central, State, and Local levels while targeting the entire value chain.
“India is at the cusp of attaining self-sufficiency in electricity generation and establishing itself as a reliable energy exporter at the global level. Since the power sector is at the heart of India’s economic, political and technological growth, every small step towards improving it would propel the country’s leap towards the US$ 10 trillion economy goal,” said Barnik Chitran Maitra, Managing Partner, Arthur D. Little, India & South Asia.
The impetus to indigenous PV cell production, transition to smart grid, and increased private participation in distribution are key to unraveling India’s true potential in the power sector.
As per the study, India’s electricity consumption is expected to grow at 5.4% annually over the next decade, with annual demand touching 2300 BUs by 2030. However, at the current pace, generation will just reach only 2024 BUs by 2030, highlighting the need for reforms in capacity addition.

Solar modules built with cells based on both-sided contacted technology, such as TOPCon panels, could potentially be replaced by PV modules based on interdigitated back-contacted designs by the end of this decade, according to Radovan Kopecek, the co-founder and director of Germany’s ISC Konstanz.
“This will depend on the fact that the extended use of tunnel oxide passivation for both polarities on a module rear side, as for IBC products, may become the most advantageous option,” Kopecek told pv magazine. “IBC solar modules may drive TOPCon panels out of the market by 2028.”
He said that the transition to IBC products could begin as early as 2025, with products based on both-sided contacts potentially becoming a thing of the past by 2030. He claims that the global market share of IBC modules could increase from around 2% in 2022 to about 6% in 2026, 20% in 2028, and more than 50% in 2030.
“Many Tier-1 manufacturers are already working on IBC besides their TOPCon development,” he said. “As both technologies have very similar aspects like the development of single-sided and fast poly-Si depositions, silver reduction, improvement of quality and costs n-type wafers, the switch will go quite fast.”
In his view, the switch will happen by adding complexity to existing production lines with standard equipment.
“We were extremely surprised in 2012, when we started our bifiPV workshop about the future of bifacial modules in Konstanz, that people did not see that bifacial PV will come with a high impact on the PV market,” Kopecek explained. “Now, in 2022 we are similarly surprised that people do not see that after the upcoming dominance of TOPCon the last evolutionary step to IBC will follow. The next step to tandem is not an evolutionary process anymore but a small revolution. And here I rather believe that it will take a while before this technology will be visible on the market.”
The success of IBC tech will materialize through efficiency improvements and lower production costs, he added.
“The efficiency gains should be ensured by the implementation of poly-Si passivation technology, while lower manufacturing costs should come from the adoption of copper or aluminum metal contacts,” Kopecek said. “We demonstrated already IBC cell efficiencies above 23% with 20mg of silver only using copper or aluminum. However, we believe that the dominancy of silver will continue and the switch will happen only in a yearly 1 TW to 3 TW market starting from 2028, when the PV industry will be forced to switch.”
He said that IBC solar cells have already reached efficiency levels of more than 24.5% and open-circuit voltages close to 730 mV, in comparison to 23% and 685 mV in PERC cells and 24% and 710 mV in TOPCon devices.
“But it is not only about efficiency. It is also about temperature coefficient, degradation, and bifaciality,” he said. “And even if the bifaciality of IBC may be slightly lower compared to TOPCon, front side efficiency, temperature coefficient, and degradation are much more important factors.”
He argued that the cost reduction of n-type wafers, in combination with the implementation of copper and aluminum metallization in IBC cells, could lead to module production costs below $0.20/W.
“At the moment, wafer and metallization costs are the major cost differences compared to PERC technology,” he said.
Kopecek said he also believes that technological advancements could lead to a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in large ground-mounted solar plants with bifacial IBC panels to less than $0.01/kWh in many parts of the world in the future.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/07/new-standardized-guidelines-for-solar-om/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 7, 2022",New standardized guidelines for solar O&M,"From pv magazine Global
The International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power System Programme (IEA-PVPS) has published new guidelines to help PV asset owners with operation and maintenance for utility-scale PV plants in different climate zones.
In the “Guidelines for Operation and Maintenance of Photovoltaic Power Plants in Different Climates” report, the agency provided a series of climate-specific O&M programs for four climate zones – moderate, hot and dry, hot and humid, and deserts at high elevation areas. It also looked at extreme conditions such as floods, cyclones, and snow.
The paper defines O&M performance indicators and standard O&M operator services to create a clear framework.
“O&M contracts should take into account regional differences, such as national or local legislation that affects the availability of staff on-site, as well as variations in the capabilities of key stakeholders that affect project cost,” said IEA-PVPS.
The report also presents guidelines for monitoring and forecasting, as well as technical tools to analyze PV plant performance and safety.
“The scale and complexity of plants determine the level of monitoring: the larger and more complex the plant, the more intensive the monitoring,” said IEA-PVPS. “O&M operators need to be ready to comply with applicable grid codes and regulations, allowing for the re-evaluation of the scope of operations for contracts if grid codes change, especially in contexts where more RE plants replace thermal sources of power.”
The report also includes a description of different types of maintenance services and advanced inspections. IEA-PVPS offers a series of recommendations for climate–specific O&M.
“Preventive maintenance (PM) action plans that exclude redundant activities can bring costs down,” they emphasized. “The preventive maintenance plan should seek to optimize the overall PV plant and O&M budgeting, depending on the plant’s size, design, complexity, and environment.”
The report concludes by warning that maintenance is required, even though PV plants require much less maintenance than other types of power generation assets.
“A combination of well–designed O&M specifications, proactive monitoring systems and a flexible and tailored O&M regime that considers both possible weather impacts on systems as well as possible changes to grid requirements are good practices to ensure that PV systems perform according to or even beyond expected lifespans,” the researchers said. “Reducing risks by ensuring that personnel are trained and equipped for O&M operations, as well as employing PV forecasting to reduce possible downtimes, also contribute to maintaining PV plant performance according to specifications.”
