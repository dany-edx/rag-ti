Researchers said around 30% of the waste would come from balance-of-system solar array components.
The study was carried out by Ayush Gautam and Ravi Shankar, from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, and Prem Vrat, from The NorthCap University, in Gurgaon. Their findings have been published in the journal Sustainable Production and Consumption.
According to the authors of the paper, the 2.95 billion tons of PV system waste would include critical metals worth around $645 trillion (INR46936 lakh crore), of which around 70% – $452 trillion worth – could be recycled.
The academics said gold would account for 44% of that $645 trillion figure, with aluminum supplying 26%, copper 16%, and silver 10%. Metals including gallium, magnesium, indium, and tellurium would also contribute to the estimated value of the anticipated solar waste mountain, according to the paper.

The study pointed out the volume of waste – and its potential value – expected from the solar industry was higher than that expected from any other end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment during the same period. The academics stressed the importance of establishing recycling facilities and managing end-of-life PV waste. Encouraging a circular economy approach to its solar supply chain would enable India to reduce its dependence on imports of precious metals including gold, silver, and copper, they added.
The waste estimate was based on an assumption India will have deployed 347.5 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030.
The researchers included estimates of premature panel failure as well as the anticipated standard solar module lifetime when calculating how much waste would be generated by 2047. They used the Weibull reliability function, which is used to estimate the ability of equipment to function without failure.
India has already been experiencing end-of-life solar panel waste since early 2019, with the volume rising exponentially.

Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT, co-location for green hydrogen production, price trends amid the polysilicon shortage, and the factors informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Three PV technologies were considered in the study: silicon panels, cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CiGs), with the researchers using the market shares held by each panel type last year, rounded to 89%, 5.2%, and 5.2%, respectively.
The paper considered inverters, cables and mounting systems as integral parts of PV arrays and also took into consideration transformers and batteries as external contributors to balance-of-system components.
The average life of modules was considered as 25 years up to 2014, and 30 years thereafter, with inverters expected to last an average ten years and other balance-of-system components 25 years.

While much has been written about the global supply squeezes on cobalt and lithium which are expected to be driven by the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and large scale battery storage, a minerals supply chain report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted the solar industry’s dependence on copper.
Whilst global reserves of the metal are not expected to come under the extreme pressures expected of other raw materials, the IEA’s The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions document has pointed out plans to diversify copper mining with projects in Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mongolia will do little to dent China’s domination of the next stage of the copper supply chain: processing the element.
Solar power generation requires twice as much copper as coal-fired electricity, according to the study, mainly because of the electricity transmission properties exhibited by the metal, especially in subterranean and subsea power lines, where it is preferred to the aluminum widely deployed in overhead lines. The IEA report stated the sheer volume of solar generation capacity expected by 2040 would drive soaring demand for new electricity grid infrastructure. The copper content of power lines – plus the fact the metal makes up around 1% of the content of a standard silicon solar panel and around 40% of a rooftop PV system, thanks to its use in string inverters – means the 350 kilotons (kt) of copper used worldwide last year is likely to hit 990kt by 2040. That estimate is based on the IEA’s sustainable development scenario; under its more conservative, business-as-usual forecast, copper demand in 2040 would still rise to 800kt, thanks to solar.

The report examined three alternative scenarios regarding solar which included wider adoption of cadmium-telluride (CdTe), thin-film PV; perovskite-silicon tandem technology; and gallium-arsenide (GaAs) panels. A return to favor of thin-film panels would drive tellurium demand up to 1.4kt in 2040, up from global demand of 500 tons today, as well as supporting a 1.3kt cadmium market, carving a slice out of the current 23kt annual supply. Wider adoption of ultra-efficient GaAs solar tech would require 3.5kt of gallium in 2040, more than ten times the current annual market for the sufficiently high-grade version of the mineral, as well as around a quarter of today’s arsenic production – 8kt. If the commercialization of perovskite-and-silicon tandem devices was accelerated to carve out a slice of global solar, it may not have as dramatic an effect on critical materials supply but it would raise demand for lead, noted the IEA.
In terms of the current mainstream solar tech – and it’s grid expansion needs – around 30% of the today’s copper is extracted in Chile, with Peru, China and the DRC the other biggest suppliers, stated the IEA. Of that global supply, some 30% is carved up between five entities: Chilean state-owned Codelco, Anglo-Australian miner BHP and Anglo-Swiss rival Glencore, Arizona-based Freeport McMoRan and Mexican-owned Southern Copper Corp. Codelco has the largest slice of the pie, according to the IEA, with an 8% global share.
Investment in copper production has been steadily rising since 2010 – albeit with a Covid-related retreat from $18 billion in 2019 to $12 billion last year – and there are plans to diversify production with new deposits in the DRC, Indonesia and the U.S. However, the IEA noted, more investment in production will be needed to meet expected demand as copper mines have an average lead-in time of around 17 years from discovery of deposits to output.
The widespread prevalence of the copper mining industry, and related price stability and maturity of trading markets is counterbalanced by the fact the quality of copper ore at the world’s most established deposits is declining rapidly as the most easily accessible sources are exhausted, with the problem compounded by water stress in the world’s chief sources of the element.

Even if production expands sufficiently to meet demand, the IEA said, nothing currently being planned will reduce the world’s dependence on Chinese operations to refine the ore into processed material.
The Paris-based energy body made six recommendations in its 287-page study into how to ensure sufficient energy transition minerals remain available to enable carbon emission reduction targets to be met around the globe.
Policy support will crucial to drive new supply and technological innovation will help in substituting more commonplace materials for the minerals such as the cobalt and lithium needed for the EV transition and energy storage, and the nickel, zirconium and platinum-group metals required for hydrogen electrolyzers and fuel cells. Tech breakthroughs could also enable the extraction of vital minerals from other sources, such as electronic waste and mining by-products, added the IEA.
Wider, better recycling will be vital to shore up supplies, said the report, and nations could take actions to make their supply chains more resilient, including by stockpiling in some cases, although the IEA pointed out that would not be as effective for minerals with looser supply constraints, such as copper.
While the IEA’s case for tighter environmental, social and corporate governance standards across the board will be welcomed in many quarters, it is hard to understand the economic necessity of such a move, despite claims by the report that such regulation will be essential to keeping the energy transition in operation. Concerns over the damage opening up new mineral deposits could cause are well founded, particularly in a study which touches upon the potential of seabed exploitation, but could complicate the final suggestion made by the report, that international co-operation will be central to secure a sufficient supply of clean energy resources.
