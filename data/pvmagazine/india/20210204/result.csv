The project shall come up at Omkareshwar reservoir on river Narmada in the Khandwa district. The work scope includes design, engineering, procurement, construction, and comprehensive operation and maintenance of the plant, including 33kV transmission line and switchyard, for five years.
The commissioning period is 12 months from the award of the contract.
To be eligible, the bidder should have completed during the last seven years the EPC work for a solar power project of at least 20 MW capacity or two solar power projects of at least 12.5 MW capacity each or three solar power projects of at least 10 MW capacity each. 
Further, it should have an average annual turnover of a minimum INR 237 crore in the last three financial years and a positive net worth not less than the amount of paid-up equity share capital in three out of the preceding five years.
The last date of online bid submission is February 18.

The auction saw five players, including Adani Green, HES Infra, NTPC, Shirdi Sai Electricals and Torrent Power, submitting bids for a combined capacity of 14.9 GW.
Auction results shared by consultancy JMK Research show the lowest winning bid of INR 2.47/kWh from Torrent Power, which secured 300 MW capacity. Adani Green secured the biggest chunk of 3 GW across five locations (600 MW each). Shirdi Sai Electricals secured 2.2 GW, NTPC 600 MW, and HES Infra 300 MW.
“Out of these five players, HES Infra, a civil contractor firm, and Shirdi Sai Electricals, a transformer manufacturer, are the new entrants that have participated for the first time,” it said.
JMK cited lack of international participation as one reason for the higher tariffs discovered in this auction than record-low prices of INR 1.99–2.00 achieved earlier. “It could be partly due to lesser time for bid submission, because of which many players were not able to conduct detailed site assessment,” it said.
Higher risks associated with the earlier power purchase agreement (PPA) renegotiation issues with the Andhra Pradesh government and low solar irradiation level compared to Rajasthan also played a part.
The tender was floated by the Andhra Pradesh Green Energy Corporation Ltd (APGECL) in December last year. The solar capacity shall come up across ten locations in Anantapur, Kadapa, Kurnool, and Prakasam districts.
The APGECL shall enter into a PPA with the successful bidders for 30 years. Power procured from the projects has been provisioned to meet the demand of agricultural loads in the State.

And renewable energy is set to play an important role in achieving this goal as the State enjoys high solar irradiance and hydel potential.
“In the various assessments done, Ladakh has a potential of 30 GW of solar, 5 GW of wind, 2 GW of hydro, and 300 MW of geothermal,” Radha Krishna Mathur, Lieutenant Governor, Ladakh, said last year.
Now power minister RK Singh has announced the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is already working towards the installation of 10 GW hybrid renewable power projects in the Union Territory of Ladakh. 
The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Ladakh Administration are identifying land for this project. And the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) is preparing the detailed project report for the necessary transmission infrastructure, the minister informed.
The government has also approved the setting up of solar-plus-battery storage projects in Leh. The scheme includes a 20 MW (AC) solar project with a 50 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) in Phyang village and a 1 MW hybrid renewable energy power project with 1 MWh BESS in Nyoma village.
Further, SECI has awarded the projects and signed power purchase agreements for 1 MW solar power project with 2 MWh BESS at Siachen Base Camp and 1 MW solar power project with 2 MWh BESS at Partapur.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/04/flexible-heat-pumps-ideal-for-power-grids-congested-by-solar-and-wind/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Flexible heat pumps ideal for power grids congested by solar and wind,"From pv magazine International
The use of heat pumps and more flexible heating systems coupled to wind and power generation may be particularly beneficial for countries with serious grid congestion issues like the Netherlands.
This is the main conclusion of a recent report published by Dutch electricity transmission system operator (TSO) Tennet, in which its experts analyzed how the use of heat pumps and smarter heat networks may contribute to the creation of more flexible electricity demand, which would, in turn, have the twofold advantage of reducing fossil fuel consumption and not wasting surplus renewable energy generation during peak hours.
The Dutch high-voltage grid operator said that in hours with poor renewable energy production, part of the heating systems could be idled temporarily, and in hours with a lot of electricity from the sun and wind, the heat systems could be powered by these two sources to provide extra heating. “In 2030, this concept could already provide between 0.5 and 1 GW of temporary flexibility and, in order to achieve this, the heat pumps must be intelligently controlled,” Tennet explained.
The flexible demand created by this approach would help to level off peak loads during strong generation of wind and solar if the capacity of the electricity grid is in danger of being exceeded. “This flexibility is needed to make maximum use of variable solar and wind generation in hours of abundance, and to reduce electricity demand in hours without solar and wind electricity,” the authors of the report affirmed.
Flexible heat pumps would be key in this scenario as they can switch back temporarily, while a well-insulated building can remain sufficiently heated for a certain time. Furthermore, hybrid heat pumps that can be powered by both gas and renewables would also represent an optimal solution, as they can temporarily rely on the fuel in the event of electricity shortages. “This reduces the peak demand for electricity and keeps homes warm,” the report notes, adding that on days with abundant solar and wind power production, heating systems with heat storage may also save some sustainable heat to power the building the following day.
According to Tennet experts, this flexible electricity demand for heat would not only contribute to CO2 reduction by using the electricity as much as possible in hours with abundant wind and sun but also by utilizing it as little as possible in the hours with largely gas-fired electricity. “This helps to keep consumers’ energy bills from being higher than necessary in the future,” they further explained. “This advantage can be achieved through a contract with flexible prices with the supplier or a discount when flexibility is made available.”
The report states that these benefits will be negligible in the near future, although they may become bigger by 2030 and will continue to grow when more and more electricity from solar and wind is produced.
Tennet and Viessmann, a German manufacturer of heating, industrial and refrigeration systems, are currently working on a joint pilot project to use the potential flexibility of heat pumps for congestion management in power grids. The ViFlex project is aimed at combining a three-digit number of heat pumps and electricity storage systems to form a virtual power plant. With this approach, the heat pumps are bundled in virtual power plants to absorb surplus electricity from renewables and relieve the power grid.
The project relies on Viessmann heat pumps that can be operated with 100 percent renewable electricity. “These heat pumps can work and fill the heat storage system when a lot of solar power comes from the roof or the wind is blowing strongly in Germany and there is a lot of wind power available in the grid,” Tennet explained.
