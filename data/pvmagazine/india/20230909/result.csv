Huasun says it has achieved a 25.69% power conversion efficiency in a heterojunction (HJT) solar cell and expects to maintain an average efficiency of 25.5% in mass production. The completion of the Huasun Dali 2.5 GW Phase I HJT Cell Project, along with the successful production of the first batch of 210 mm HJT solar cells, occurred on Sept. 6.
“Thanks to the double-sided micro-crystalline process and silver-copper paste technology, the HJT solar cells can performance exceptionally well even in harsh environments such as high altitude and high ultraviolet rays,” said Huasun.
In March, the China-based heterojunction module manufacturer started making solar panels at its HJT cell factory in Xuancheng, in China’s Anhui province. The factory will have an annual capacity of 2.4 GW and will exclusively produce bifacial 182 mm HJT cells, based on a cell tech with a power conversion efficiency of 25.26%. The results have been confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research, in Hamelin, Germany.

“Hitachi Energy has been working closely with Ayana Renewables for this project to co-create an optimized solution that meets the safety, quality and technical requirements of Solar Energy Corp. of India, the end-user of the renewable plant. Leveraging its strong local footprint and expertise in project design and execution, Hitachi Energy will provide an engineering, procurement and construction management package that collects all the power generated by the plant and transfers it into the national transmission system safely and reliably,” stated Hitachi Energy.
The project is scheduled to be commissioned in March 2024.
According to CEEW-CEF, in FY 2022-23, renewable energy dominated India’s power generation capacity expansion. A total of 17 GW was installed during the year, with renewables accounting for 92%. Solar (grid-scale and rooftop) contributed 84% of the newly added renewable energy capacity. As of July 2023, India had a combined installed capacity of 179 GW from renewable energy sources, including large hydropower.
“Hitachi Energy Ltd is advancing the world’s energy system, and its pioneering innovative solutions expedite the integration of renewables at a large scale, helping to accelerate the transition. Today, 33 GW of clean power in India flows through Hitachi Energy’s technology. In [the latest] project, the power system is maintenance-ready being factory fitted with the RelCare digital platform and comes with EnCompass Service Agreement baseline to safeguard reliability and availability to operations. The new digitally-enabled service solution seeks to offer an enhanced customer experience for a period of one year and the whole lifecycle through minimizing the risk of incidents and contributing to the highest availability,” stated Hitachi Energy.
Hitachi Energy Ltd provides grid connections and power quality solutions, with more than 10,000 installations worldwide. Recently, it launched its GrideXpand range of modular and prefabricated grid connection solutions that make it faster, simpler and more efficient to expand power grid capacity and accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy system.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/09/ntpc-chidambaranar-port-collaborate-to-develop-green-hydrogen-hub/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TAMIL NADU",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2023","NTPC, Chidambaranar Port collaborate to develop green hydrogen hub","NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL), an arm of NTPC Ltd, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with V.O Chidambaranar Port Authority (VOCPA) to develop a green hydrogen hub at VOCPA, Tuticorin, in Tamil Nadu.
Under the MoU, NGEL and VOCPA will collaborate to develop a green hydrogen hub for the production of green hydrogen and its derivatives such as green ammonia and green methanol, on the land provided by VOCPA, for export and domestic usage.
NTPC is India’s largest power utility with the core business of power generation having a total installed capacity of 73+ GW. NGEL, its wholly-owned subsidiary, has been formed to take up renewable energy parks and projects including businesses in the area of green hydrogen, energy storage technologies, and round-the-clock RE power.
NTPC Group targets 60 GW of RE capacity by the year 2032 and is currently working on a pipeline of 20+ GW, out of which over 3 GW is operational capacity.
VOCPA is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (MOPSW), government of India. It has been identified by MOPSW to be developed as a green hydrogen/green ammonia refueling hub for green shipping. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has also identified VOCPA as the nodal port on the East Coast for the development of port infrastructure and logistics development for offshore wind, green hydrogen projects on a large scale.
