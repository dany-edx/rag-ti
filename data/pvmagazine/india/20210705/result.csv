However, a recent camel death has raised questions whether deserts are the best place to site solar installations.
The unfortunate incident took place in the Lala village of Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan. On Saturday night, a camel wandered into the plant site in search of food. As the plant workers tried to chase it away, the animal injured itself severely with the sharp-edged angles installed to erect solar panels, reported daily newspaper The Times of India.
The injuries were multiple and so severe that the camel bled to death.
The incident also puts the spotlight on finding ways to ensure co-existence of renewable energy plants with the ecosystem to achieve overall sustainability goal.
Last year, a study by University of California researchers measured the impact of solar installation on desert plants at Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, a concentrating solar power plant in the Mojave Desert of California, USA. The researchers said solar projects can negatively impact desert vegetation, a source of food for animals like camels. 
Among the different methods used for site preparation, bulldozing (or blading), where layers of earth are scraped away from the site, is the most damaging to cacti, Mojave yucca and other native plants. Mowing also destroys cacti and Mojave yucca, though shrubs were found to recover from it. 
The researchers said while there are ways to help conserve native desert plants at solar facilities, it was best to develop solar energy in marginalized lands like urban areas, places where ecosystems are heavily altered, rather than undeveloped desert.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/05/where-the-almm-listing-requirement-went-wrong-for-indias-solar-mission/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,QUALITY,INDIA",,"JULY 5, 2021",Where the ALMM listing requirement went wrong for India’s solar mission,"The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), in its drive towards reducing India’s dependence on solar imports and achieving self-reliance, announced compulsory registration of solar module manufacturers under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and has published a list of eligible models and manufacturers of solar cells and modules as of March 2021. 
The current ALMM, as notified by MNRE, mainly captures domestic manufacturers with a cumulative enlisted capacity that is still not able to meet the allotted bid capacity. 
The idea of ALMM is to verify the manufacturing unit physically and is mandatory for manufacturers supplying to the government-owned solar projects. This will be an extension of the quality check by the Government of India, which is currently limited to product (BOM) testing by BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) certification. 
The ALMM listing requirement was introduced to have better control over the quality of products available in the market. The application of BIS certification has only become limited to Government compliance. 
Irrespective of all efforts already being taken by BIS, all major developers have to audit the manufacturing lines and invigilate the manufacturing process. As per industry experts, ALMM is more of a non-tariff barrier for foreign manufacturers. 
The manufacturer needs to pay the application fee for the total installed capacity under the brand name at the rate of INR 5000/MW of enlisted global capacity. Now for all the major suppliers, only 10% of their capacity is being sold in India. For instance, a company with a total manufacturing capacity of 10 GW is selling 1 GW in India. For this capacity, they have to pay an application fee of INR 5 crore. There are additional costs such as two-time factory visit costs of each unit, which add about INR 1 crore to the application fee cost. 
For module manufacturers/suppliers in India, cells being used must also be ALMM approved though the manufacturer is not selling cells directly in India. Hence, for vertical integrators, the cost of application doubles up, and similarly, manufacturers will increase the price, which in turn affects the input to a financial model. Thus, the biggest challenge of ALMM is the cost involved, which, in turn, affects the bid tariff. 
Secondly, the timeline involved in ALMM registration for foreign manufacturers is also a challenge. The ALMM enlistment process is long, with manufacturers having to share their financial details, capacity, and purchase details of raw materials. Hence, it may take a minimum of two years for the process to go through. Also, BIS is a prerequisite for ALMM application. All of this makes a new product practically unfeasible to be launched in India within a time frame of 6-9 months, even after the initial ALMM registration of the manufacturer. 
We understand that the government’s intent is positive as ALMM aims to have a quality benchmark for modules, but, as it stands right now, it is only encouraging the Indian manufacturers to set up plants in India with vertical integration to uplift the Indian market, which might take significant time. 
In the current form, ALMM limits the solar developer in terms of the choice of module wattage and make and thus is not able to serve the purpose of accelerating India’s Solar mission and targets.

The projects are tendered under the Open category, allowing the use of only India-made cells and modules.
Bidders can compete for 50 MW up to all of 500 MW capacity on offer, in 10 MW multiples.
The scope of work includes design, engineering, supply, installation, commissioning, and three years of operation and maintenance of the complete solar plant, including switchyard and power evacuation system till interconnecting grid substation
The scope includes the complete transfer of ownership or lease of encumbrance-free land in favor of NTPC Ltd, and identifying and arranging grid connectivity at the ISTS substation.

Chinese module maker Trina Solar has announced to have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.03% for a monocrystalline p-type module based on 66 PERC cells with a size of 210×210 mm.
The result was confirmed by Germany’s standards bodies TÜV Rheinland and TÜV Nord.
“We are very pleased to announce the latest achievement of our R&D team at the State Key Laboratory of Photovoltaic Science and Technology. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first large-area p-type commercial module with aperture efficiency over 23%,” said Trina’s head of high-efficiency cell and module R&D center, Yifeng Chen. “Improving module efficiency is a key to help the customers to save land, labor and cables and etc. Trina Solar is always focused on developing leading-edge PV techniques and products to achieve commercial success of customers with our innovations.”
Trina said its scientists developed a new Multi-Musbar (MBB) technology to improve optical shading, and developed a new hybrid soldering technology to minimize the gap between cells, without providing further details.
