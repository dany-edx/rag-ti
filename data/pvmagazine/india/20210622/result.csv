This solar project benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.
Acme and Brookfield Renewable will jointly develop the 450 MWp solar project in India, said Manoj Upadhyay, Chairman, Acme Group, in the media statement.
However, Acme did’t disclose the terms of the deal and the amount of investment raised for the project. 
The project is estimated to provide clean and green electricity to over a million households. It is also expected to provide jobs for over 450 people during its construction phase and 150 people while operational. 
The latest announcement comes close on the heels of Acme raising equity investment for its 250 MW solar project in Rajasthan. For the 250 MW project, investors included Denmark’s state-owned government fund IFU and United Nations Office for Project Services’ S3i.
As the world seeks its ways to accelerate the pace of transformation in the clean energy sector, India is uniquely positioned to demonstrate tremendous growth in Solar Power.
“We appreciate the enthusiasm from global renewable energy companies and investors who strive to be a part of India’s success story. Backed by abundant renewable resources and lower per capita energy consumption, the country plans to achieve 450 GW of renewable power by 2030. ACME Solar is known for transforming and creating value by offering the most affordable tariffs to our end customers,” said Manoj Upadhyay.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/22/pli-scheme-will-help-india-emerge-as-clean-tech-factory-of-the-world/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDIA",,"JUNE 22, 2021",PLI Scheme will help India emerge as clean-tech factory of the world,"To boost manufacturing in India, the Union Cabinet approved government thinktank NITI Aayog’s proposal to introduce the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in several key sectors. The total outlay approved for these sectors is around INR 2 lakh crore, of which INR 22,600 crore has been assigned to clean technologies such as advanced battery cells and cutting-edge solar modules. This clear embrace of sunrise sectors is as historic as it is futuristic. 
A clean economy, powered by clean technologies, has long been viewed as a niche subset of the real economy, surviving under the patronage of eco-warriors and a bucket full of state subsidies. At least, that is what we were told just a decade ago. 
But the past decade has shown that clean technologies, including renewables, electric vehicles and LED lights, can not only survive without state subsidies but, over time, also upend existing paradigms, reduce energy prices and radically improve the ease of living. 
Much can be inferred from recent events and market signals. 
First, in August, the valuation of global e-vehicle giant Tesla reached $380 billion—more than that of the next 12 largest automakers combined. The spikes in valuations of clean-tech companies like Nikola and others clearly indicate the growing popularity of clean technologies among investors. In fact, the market is fishing for the next ‘Tesla’ across the clean-tech industry. 
Second, ExxonMobil’s fall of the Dow Jones Industrial Average after nearly a century signals that the trend is only accelerating. 
After the 2008-09 financial crisis, green measures accounted for 16% of the total stimulus globally. China’s enormous green stimulus post the 2008 financial crisis prepared the ground for its current performance in sunrise sectors such as electric mobility. 
To recover from the impact of covid-19 and battle the impending threat of global warming, governments worldwide are making decisive investments and strategies for clean technologies. This has created a pipeline of growing demand for clean-tech components such as batteries, solar panels, and hydrogen electrolyzers. 
Unfortunately, most of the clean-technology supply chain is concentrated in a few countries. International cooperation and leveraging each other’s strength based on mutual trust and the rule of law are crucial in these times of distress. 
India has a unique role in building back better as the nation has a combination of factors in its favor. These include a growing and gargantuan appetite for energy, a sizeable local market, a government committed to a clean future and ease-of-doing-business, and fast-growing manufacturing advantages. 
The government is walking the talk in clean energy deployment, which has helped set up an attractive local market for clean-tech manufacturers. India’s commitment to a cleaner energy mix has made it the fourth-largest renewable energy market globally in terms of installed RE capacity. Today, India’s renewables capacity, including hydro, stands at over 130 GW. 
As far as meeting the commitment under Paris Agreement NDC is concerned, the country has already achieved more than 33% of the non-fossil-fuel-based installed power capacity against the target of 40% by 2030.
At the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019, the Prime Minister had announced the doubling of India’s non-fossil-fuel target to 450 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. This includes about 300 GW of solar, 140 GW wind, and 10 GW of biomass-based capacity. India has already achieved close to 95 GW, making it one of the top four renewable markets in the world.     
The government’s efforts have been vindicated via investor sentiment, which remained strong even during the lockdown, leading to record low tariffs. India has also been averaging an US$11 billion investment flow into the renewable energy sector for the last five years, according to CEEW. With the rapid decline in renewable energy prices, this investment is now resulting in more and more capacity deployed.
India recognizes that clean-technology manufacturing is a high-tech proposition where global scales and consistent innovations are critical. That is why the PLI scheme with INR 18,100 crore ($2.4 billion) for battery giga-factory and INR 4500 crore ($600 million) for solar PV is focusing on cutting-edge technologies and global scales. 
Incentives will attract local and global champions to come together and anchor the clean-tech manufacturing ecosystem in the country. This will catalyze an ecosystem of component suppliers, R&D centers of excellence and equipment makers. The Central incentives are envisaged to be supplemented by state-level interventions like manufacturing parks, single-window clearance regimes, and other incentives. 
Societies advance when scientific breakthroughs open up a new world of possibilities. That can only happen when we embrace cutting-edge technologies and give voice to disruptive outliers. The INR 22,600-crore allocation for clean technologies is envisaged to do just that. The PLI schemes in batteries and solar will help India graduate from a passive recipient to an active driver in the global clean-tech story, which fortunately for us is just beginning to take shape.

Actis will acquire the 250 MW Pavagada II solar plant in Karnataka and another 250 MW in Rajasthan for approximately EUR 280 million on a debt-free and cash-free basis. Most of this value will be recorded during 2021. 
The divestment will be completed and the capital gain recorded in three tranches; during the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022.
The divestment is expected to have a positive impact of approximately EUR 20 million on the results of Fortum’s City Solutions segment.
Fortum and Actis have also signed a comprehensive agreement targeting further investments in solar power plants in India.
“We can utilize the strong competencies Fortum has gained over the years in solar development and construction, while utilizing the financial strength and track record of Actis to realize the investment potential,” said Per Langer, executive vice president of Fortum’s City Solutions division.
“This is an important step for Actis as we further strengthen our presence in India building on our achievements to date. We are pleased to be entering into this transaction with a firm of Fortum’s calibre and competence,” said Mikael Karlsson, Partner and Head of Energy Infrastructure at Actis.
Since 2013, Fortum has developed and constructed 680 MW of solar power in India. Over time, most of this capacity has been divested to enable further investments with limited equity exposure, in line with the build-operate-transfer business model.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/22/jinkosolar-longi-ja-solar-claim-182mm-modules-offer-lowest-lcoe-for-utility-scale-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 22, 2021","JinkoSolar, Longi, JA Solar claim 182mm modules offer lowest LCOE for utility scale solar","From pv magazine International
Chinese solar panel makers JinkoSolar, Longi and JA Solar have released a white paper intended to show what they believe are the advantages for developers of large scale PV projects of using photovoltaic modules manufactured with M10, 182mm wafers.
“The 182mm-wafer-size module is the most cost–effective solution based on the in–depth analysis of various boundary conditions of the whole industrial value chain,” the document reads. “Without efficiency improvement, further increase on module power with larger size modules will not achieve lower system cost.”
The three manufacturers emphasized the increasing reliability risks associated with larger and more powerful products and reiterated the well-known saying “bigger is not always better,” heard in recent months from all those companies that decided not to bet on 210mm wafers, and modules with a power output exceeding 600 W. JA Solar, however, launched an 800 W product in August.
According to the analysis by the three companies, which considered factors such as manufacturing, transportation, installation, power generation performance and system matching, the ideal module weight for easy deployment is 33.3kg and the maximum weight should not exceed 35kg. Furthermore, glass thickness for bifacial products should not be over 2mm. “On the premise of [a] two [times] 2mm, double-glass, structure and reasonable control of the frame cost, the size of the module should be within a limit, otherwise its ability to resist static and dynamic load will be weakened seriously,” the experts from the three companies stated, adding that glass burst and micro–cracks become more frequent if these size and width parameters are exceeded.
In terms of yield and efficiency, 182mm wafers do not differ substantially from 166mm products, however, they can provide a significant balance-of-system (BoS) cost reduction, due to their increased size and current. These lower costs are achieved thanks to three main factors: A larger racking design which reduces support and pile foundation costs per watt; a reduced length of the cables connecting PV strings and combiner boxes, or string inverters; and a lower labor cost associated with the limited increase in the product’s size. “The 182mm-wafer-size module is compatible with the design of two rows of vertical (2P) and four rows of horizontal (4L) racks, and can adapt to different terrain conditions by adjusting the number of strings on a single rack,” the paper notes.
The manufacturers compared the BoS costs of 182mm-wafer-size modules and 210mm products installed on the 4L rack, and found that the former have a slight advantage in racking, foundation, and land costs. “Excessive working current of a module will lead to a significant increase of the heat losses on the metal contact surface of the cell, the ribbon and the bus bar, which will increase the working temperature of the module to a certain extent,” the experts stated.
*The article was amended to reflect that the ideal module weight for easy deployment is 33.3kg and not 3.3kg as we previously wrote.
