Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have proposed to use silica sands – a stable and inexpensive material with prices ranging from $30 to $50/ton – as a medium to store excess wind and solar power.
The research team developed a thermal energy storage technology called Economic Long-Duration Electricity Storage by Using Low-Cost Thermal Energy Storage and High-Efficiency Power Cycle (ENDURING), which it defines as a scalable solution that can be deployed almost anywhere.
The baseline system, which is designed for a storage capacity of up to 26,000 MWh, works by heating silica particles through an array of electric resistive heating elements at a temperature of around 1,200 degrees Celsius and depositing them on insulated concrete silos for thermal energy storage.

“When energy is needed, the hot particles are gravity-fed through a heat exchanger, heating and pressurizing a working gas inside to drive the turbomachinery, and spin generators that create electricity for the grid,” the NREL researchers explained. “Once discharged, the spent, cold particles are once again fed into insulated silos for storage until conditions (and economics) are appropriate again for charging.”
According to them, the proposed storage technology could be deployed at a cost of between $2 and $4 per kWh and it could also be hosted by existing infrastructure from retired coal and gas-fired power plants. Furthermore, it may provide a continuous source of heat for industrial and chemical processes.
“Sand and concrete silos with refractory insulation are very inexpensive materials that can lead to low-cost energy storage,” said NREL researcher Patrick Davenport. “Traditional four-hour storage technologies don’t scale well to the grid or city scale. Now that we are in need of large scale energy storage, this technology makes a lot of sense.”
The prototype heaters and heat exchangers for the proposed system are currently being tested under high temperatures.

These include a $1.2-billion package of public and private investment in green projects and renewable energy in India and the joint launch of the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative (CFLI) India partnership. 
These investments will support India’s target of 450 GW renewable energy by 2030. The proposed amount includes a $1-billion investment from the UK’s development finance institution CDC in green projects in India between 2022 and 2026. This builds on CDC’s $1.99 billion existing portfolio of private sector investments in India.
Both governments committed joint investments to support companies working on innovative green technology solutions, including a new $200-million private and multilateral investment into the joint UK-India Green Growth Equity Fund, which invests in Indian renewable energy.
The CFLI India partnership will help mobilize private capital into sustainable infrastructure in India, including clean energy like wind and solar power and other green technologies. It will be led by a group of leading financial institutions responsible for $6.2 trillion of assets and chaired by Michael Bloomberg, UN Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions.
The two sides also agreed on further strengthening the UK-India strategic partnership on Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT)-City, India’s first International Financial Services Centre, to support GIFT to become a Fintech and sustainable finance hub. Barclays became the third UK bank to commence operations in GIFT City this year, after HSBC and Standard Chartered.
The UK also welcomed India’s recent decision to lift the Foreign Direct Investment cap in the insurance sector from 49% to 74% which will help British firms to take greater ownership of their operations in India.
Welcoming the announcement, Ulka Kelkar, director, Climate Program, World Resources Institute (WRI), said, “The massive scale of India’s low carbon transition will require upfront capital investments. Dedicated funding like this can be used to build new green energy, industry, and urban infrastructure and avoid lock[1]in to carbon-intensive projects. These new funding initiatives should also prioritize investments in decentralized rural energy and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which have great potential to reduce emissions and support livelihoods but have lower capacity to access finance.” 
Akhilesh Magal, head- Research Advisory, Gujarat Energy Research and Management Institute (GERMI), said this development should contribute to the flow of low-cost finance for clean energy goals: “Adequate financial support has always been a vital concern for climate action more so as India moves ahead in its quest for a clean future. The announcement adds confidence towards constructive negotiations at COP26. It remains to see how funds will come, from what sources, and where they will be used,” he added.
“Financing climate action has been a persistent issue. Coming ahead of the COP26, this partnership should bring in more private capital for sustainable infrastructure, including wind and solar. This will create a multiplier effect towards reducing emissions from key sectors like power and transport. This is good news ahead of the important meetings to be held over the next few months. It makes the commitments to finance real, and not a symbolic gesture alone,” said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends.

A Belgian-Ethiopian research team has compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and net present cost (NPC) of lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries for stationary energy storage and has found that the former are, techno-economically, more viable.
The analysis of both storage technologies was modeled through the HOMER software and the Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM), which describes the pure electrical behavior of a battery in terms of voltages, currents, and capacitances. “The ECM model is built-in using electrical components, which respond to the battery electrically,” the scientists explained. “On the other hand, HOMER is software used for the optimization of the components to be used in the grid-connected electrical power system.”
The analysis considered the charge and discharge rate influence on the performance of both kinds of batteries under typical application conditions assuming their use in a grid-connected photovoltaic system (PVGCS) with an inclination angle of 16 degrees and an azimuth angle of 0 degrees. “The system consisted of a 10 kWp photovoltaic array, a grid-connected converter of 5 kW capacity, 83 Ah lead-acid battery storage, and a li-ion battery of 167 Ah with a load having a 4-5 kVA rating,” the group explained, noting that in the simulation, the grid electricity price was estimated at €0.084/kWh.
Citing previous studies, the researchers said that, for stationary energy storage, lead-acid batteries have an average energy capital cost of €253.50/kWh and lithium-ion batteries, €1.555/kWh, and that their total average power cost is €333.50/kWh and €2,210/kWh, respectively. “Furthermore, the environmental impact of lead-acid is categorized as having a high impact, whereas li-ion has a medium/low environmental impact,” they also specified.
Through the simulation, the academics found that li-ion and lead-acid batteries have almost comparable charge and discharge properties but they also ascertained that the lithium-ion devices have the same discharge characteristics response as lead-acid batteries even with less capacity and a lower number of battery units, while also providing longer lifetime characteristics. Moreover, they found that the micro-grid formed by the PV system and the lithium-ion batteries has a net present cost of €14,399, while that of the PV system with lead-acid batteries is around €15,106. As for the LCOE, the latter reached a value of €0.34/kWh and the former, €0.32/kWh.
“The reduced number of batteries affects the per-unit COE and therefore the COE of the micro-grid system with li-ion batteries is lower, as compared to lead-acid batteries,” they further explained, adding that li-ion batteries have lower lifetime costs when associated with PV and reduced losses if compared to lead-acid batteries. “From the investigations, it can be concluded that, the PVGCS system with li-ion batteries requires 40% lesser batteries as compared to lead-acid batteries, and supporting in provision of reliable power supply with lower cost.”
The comparison between the two storage technologies can be found in the paper Techno-economic analysis of lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries in stationary energy storage application, which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research group comprises scientists from the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, in Belgium, and the Jimma Institute of Technology, in Ethiopia.
