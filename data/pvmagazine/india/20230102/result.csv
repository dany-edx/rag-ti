The authors modeled the cost-optimized transition pathway for the energy system of Delhi in a Best Policy Scenario (BPS) across North India. The energy system taken into consideration includes the power, heat, transport, and desalination sectors.
According to the study, Delhi will derive nearly 80% of its electricity from solar PV prosumers by 2050 as solar PV emerges as the least-cost energy source. [Prosumers are both consumers and producers of electricity, mainly through rooftop solar PV across residential, commercial, and industrial settings, which includes battery storage.] Further, imports from the regional grid constitute over 70% of the electricity for Delhi from 2035 to 2050. Utility-scale and prosumer batteries contribute a major share of electricity storage capacities.
The report states that the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in 2050 is increasingly dominated by capital costs as fuel costs continue to decline through the transition period. The regional weighted average for the LCOE is around 28 euros/MWh by 2050.
Given Delhi’s limitations in terms of land availability, it continues to get its power from the Northern region. It is expected that Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh are interconnected with optimized transmission networks.
Delhi’s power demands shot up to over 7 GW in July 2022. The demand is expected to go up from 2,000 TWh in 2020 to around 4,400 TWh by 2050. The adjoining states emerge as new exporters of low-cost renewable electricity, which can economically boost the states and also create much-needed jobs.
A recent announcement by the Delhi Pollution Control Board indicated that starting January 1, no coal will be permitted for use in 2023 although this does not cover thermal power plants. This was mainly to curb air pollution. The Delhi Government also recently announced its intention to become the rooftop capital of the country by 2030 and achieve 50% solar rooftops towards this.
“While this is encouraging and in the right direction, our study shows that the Government needs to be more ambitious given the potential and the co-benefits in terms of reduced costs, GHG emissions, and reduced air pollution that the capital has been grappling with for over a decade and a higher number of jobs. This is the time for transformative change and Delhi has the opportunity to drive the energy transition across North India,” said Dr Manish Ram, one of the authors of the study.

NTPC is developing the 23 MW Solapur project inside the existing NTPC Solapur Thermal power station. The project is being developed under a multi-package route by NTPC and the power generated is targeted to be sold under the government’s scheme for the flexible operation of thermal power plants.
The 300 MW Nokhra PV project is being developed under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy.

As solar PV becomes increasingly common, the world has gained a better understanding of how it converts sunshine to electricity. From solar arrays large enough to power entire towns to portable solar panels dynamic enough to charge cell phones, companies are continually exploring and expanding the bounds of how light can be used to power everyday life in ever more sustainable ways.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) are a prime example. They were first developed in the late 1980s to mimic the natural absorption of light energy and convert any visible light – not just direct sunlight – into electrical energy. Despite a relatively low cost of production, however, the power density of dye-sensitized cells was not competitive with conventional silicon solar technology so DSSCs remained little more than a novelty for 30 years.
What did hold promise, however, was the performance of such devices in low-light conditions, such as indoors or in shaded outdoor locations, even if those early DSSCs offered performance little better than the amorphous silicon cells used on solar-powered calculators. Fast forward to today, and breakthrough advances in chemistry and design have made low-light solar cells more efficient and offer higher power density, opening up new market possibilities.
The timing could not be better. Society’s reliance on connected devices – and IoT – has led to the manufacture of billions of consumer electronic devices and sensors. This is raising concern about IoT’s impact on the environment, as disposable batteries inside such devices significantly contribute to e-waste and carbon emissions. Low-light cells, however, show how the solar industry can lead a new area of decarbonization in such appliances.
Almost half of IoT sensors are installed inside buildings, where variable low-light conditions are the norm. PV technology such as those amorphous silicon calculator cells does not yield sufficient power in real-world, low-light operational conditions to power connected devices. At the same time, high-performance, low-light PV technology, such as gallium arsenide cells, come with a price tag that has made them suitable only for space satellite and research applications, not mass-market electronics.
Today’s low-light solar cells – including those being developed by my company, Ambient Photonics – can harvest energy from indirect and artificial light to create an endless power source for a myriad of devices. Indoor light and outdoor low-light environments are dynamic and generally gloomier than assumed. As a result, they require breakthrough power density to deliver reliable performance. Achieving high power dye-sensitized solar cells at competitive price points not only opens up new sustainability opportunities for device manufacturers, it also throws open the doors for design possibilities appliance engineers cannot achieve with disposable battery-powered devices.
Rooftop solar has become an effective, accessible solution for companies to offset emissions from their building operations by generating on-site electricity. While this effectively reduces what are known as “scope 1” and “scope 2” carbon emissions, there is still a disconnect between putting solar on the roof of a factory and the actual products being manufactured inside the building. Re-examining how products are made in the supply chain, with their associated “scope 3” emissions, the solar industry can provide more than just large scale generation, it can become the source of power for everyday life.
When it comes to electronic devices, for instance, a logical change manufacturers make along the supply chain, which leverages the advantages of solar, is to eliminate disposable batteries.
Consider the case of a remote control. German battery manufacturer Varta estimates each AAA battery has lifetime greenhouse gas equivalent emissions of 61 g of CO2. Most remote controls require two AAA batteries that last around a year, with average use. The average lifetime of a remote control is seven years, requiring 14 batteries during that time.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, approximately three billion batteries are sold in the United States alone each year, averaging 32 per family, or 10 per person. The typical consumer owns two button batteries and 10 A, AA, AAA, C, D or 9 V dry cell batteries, and throws out eight household batteries per year. Even in environmentally conscious California, only 0.55% of alkaline batteries are recycled.
Besides generating mountains of hazardous waste in landfill, the production and disposal of batteries itself has a large carbon footprint. By harvesting energy from everyday light, through the use of low-light solar cells to replace disposable batteries, manufacturers can more quickly achieve electronic device sustainability goals – particularly by reducing scope 3 supply chain emissions.
Power is a meta resource, as much of today’s modern world revolves around consumer electronic devices and equipment. In the coming decade, the potential exists for billions more devices and wireless sensors to enter the market. However, the challenge of reliably, affordably, and sustainably powering these devices has continued to limit IoT viability at scale.
Energy harvesting technology is a transformative, once-in-a-generation, world-changing advancement, and low-light solar cells put the solar industry once again in a powerful position to lead decarbonization on a huge scale.
