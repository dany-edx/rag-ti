Amara Raja is executing this 306 MWp ground-mounted utility-scale power plant spread over 1,850 hectares (the equivalent of 3,500 contiguous football fields) on an EPC basis.
The announcement follows the upward trend for the deployment of solar trackers combined with bifacial module technology in India due to falling module prices and increased tracker design efficiencies.
“Nextracker is the right local partner to help us achieve lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE) over the lifetime of the plant due to its bifacial optimized design,” said Dwarakanadha Reddy, business head-projects division, Amara Raja Power Systems.
Nextracker has a gigawatt of solar tracker systems operating on 24 projects across India and close to 200 local staff to support design and engineering, local content and manufacturing, sales, and aftermarket services.
With the first lot of Nextracker shipments to arrive in Q1 of 2023, the Nokh project is expected to become operational by October 2023.

The designated authority for cross-border power trading has approved the import of power by Bhutan.
Bhutan has also executed the agreement with the Settlement Nodal Agency for the settlement of grid operation-related charges.
“Over the years, Bhutan has been exporting hydropower to India. The increasing domestic demand in Bhutan now requires power imports during the dry winter season. This PPA will help address such energy requirements,” said Dr. Rajib K Mishra, CMD (addl. Charge), PTC India Ltd.
“This agreement is a step forward towards PTC’s endeavor to strengthen the regional power markets for energy security and sustainability in South Asia.”
PTC India Ltd has been mandated by the Government of India to trade electricity with Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh. The trading activities undertaken by PTC include long-term trading of power generated from large projects including renewables as well as short-term trading arising as a result of supply and demand mismatches, which inevitably occur in various regions of the country.
