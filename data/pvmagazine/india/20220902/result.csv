The 100 MWp portfolio includes three operational solar power projects in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The installations supply electricity to NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd. and Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd. under 25-year power purchase agreements (PPAs). Out of the three projects, Virescent completed the acquisition of a 12.4 MWp project located in Lalitpur earlier this month.
The purchase of Jakson’s solar assets will be the fifth such acquisition by Virescent, which has previously acquired assets from Shapoorji, Focal Energy, Sindicatum, and Godawari Power and Ispat. Virescent is the only infrastructure trust (InvIT) in India in the renewable energy space. The acquisition of Jakson’s assets is in line with its strategy to acquire operational renewable energy assets that have stable long-term cashflows with government counterparties across India.
“This new venture is a testimony to the company’s increasing footprint and focuses on sustainable growth in the renewable energy sector and we look forward to further expanding our relationship with them,” said Sanjay Grewal, chief executive officer of Virescent Infrastructure Investment Manager.
The Jakson PV asset deal will take Virescent’s total operational solar capacity to 600 MW.
“With the conclusion of this transaction, VRET will come closer to its aim of achieving a 1.5 GW portfolio of assets in the initial phase of its growth over the next two-three years,” it said.
Jackson Group, one of India’s leading energy companies, currently owns and operates around 200 MW of solar portfolio across four projects. It recently commissioned a 70 MW PV project in the Amguri solar park in Assam. It has also floated a new venture Jakson Green, which will focus on green hydrogen and ammonia, waste to energy, electrolyzers, fuel cells, utility-scale battery energy storage systems, solar, and O&M services across all segments.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/02/tata-power-delhi-distribution-tenders-510-mw-of-wind-solar-hybrid-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022",Tata Power Delhi Distribution tenders 510 MW of wind-solar hybrid projects,"Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd., which distributes electricity in North and North-West Delhi, has started accepting bids to develop 255 MW of wind-solar hybrid projects and an additional 255 MW under a greenshoe option.
The projects will be installed on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. The minimum bid capacity is 50 MW (with at least 50 MW of the project capacity being proposed at each project site) and a maximum of 255 MW.
For a project to qualify as a hybrid project, the rated power capacity of one resource (wind or solar) must be at least 33% of the total contracted power capacity. Tata Power-DDL requires 85 MW solar (33%) and 170 MW wind power out of the total 255 MW project capacity, with a greenshoe option of an additional 255 MW project capacity on similar lines. Accordingly, the bidder should quote solar and wind quantum in the ratio of 1:2.
Tata Power-DDL will sign power purchase agreements with the successful developers at the respective tariffs discovered after the e-reverse auction. The PPA duration will be 25 years.
Developers must submit their bid by offering a single tariff for all the projects quoted, which shall be applicable for the term of the PPA.
“Existing projects having untied capacity can also participate in the bid process in line with the conditions specified in the RfS and PPA. However, in such case, the bidder should ensure that the minimum remaining useful life of the project is between 20 years to 25 years on the date of submission of bid,” as per the tender document.

US startup Zendure has announced a new plug-and-play residential storage system with semi-solid state batteries for household backup power, mobile living, and portable EV charging applications.
The SuperBase V 6400 (SBV) measures 73 cm x 34.6 cm x 44.2 cm, including its real wheels, and weighs in at 59 kg (130 lbs). The semi-solid state Satellite battery B6400 measures 69 cm x 28.5 cm x 27.4 cm and weights in at 46 kg (101 lbs).
The battery pack, according to the manufacturer, contains 42% more energy than lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries.

One SBV unit has a storage capacity of 6.438 kWh and can be scaled with up to four battery modules, reaching a capacity of 32 kWh. Two SBV units can be chained together to reach up to 64 kWh capacity. The energy storage system can operate at temperatures ranging from -20 C to 45 C and has a 3,000-cycle life.
The company is launching versions of the system for the US and European markets, with different inputs and outputs. The US version has a maximum 1,800 W output at 120V, and of 3,800 W at 240V. The European version has a maximum 3,680 W output at 230V, and of 1,725 W at 115 V. Both versions also feature car and EV, inputs, as well as solar input up to 3,000 W. The system can be charged at up to 6,600 W.
The company claims a zero-millisecond backup power activation, with a zero-downtime Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) during blackouts.
The SuperBase V has its global launch on September 2 to 6 at the IFA 2022, at Berlin ExpoCenter City.
