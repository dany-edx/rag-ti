Earlier, in 2021, Airtouch Solar has landed a $7.6 million deal to deploy its water-free cleaning robots for ReNew’s three solar farms in Rajasthan. Its scope under the contract included the supply, erection, testing, commissioning, operation and maintenance of Airtouch robotic cleaning systems for 25 years.

The company offers complete solar panel cleaning solutions for commercial and residential PV installations.
The solutions are designed and engineered in Germany.
“The efficiency of a solar panel decreases up to 50% due to dust accumulation. So, panels in high-dust zones should at least be cleaned once a week. However, the use of cleaning equipment is yet to pick up pace in India due to the easy availability of labor,” said Jatinder Kaul, managing director at Kärcher India.
“There is also a need to create awareness about PV cleaning efficiency achieved with the equipment and the resulting impact on power generation,” he added.
The company has introduced its iSolar 400 and iSolar 800 solar cleaning kits that can be used with the Kärcher high-pressure cleaners with a water flow rate of 700 – 1000 l/h and 1000 – 1300 l/h, respectively. The kits include water-driven brush heads, telescopic lance, etc. The quick-releasing fasteners make retracting and deploying the telescopic lances easy.
The iSolar 400 has a single water-driven disc brush with a working width of 400 mm. The iSolar 800 has two brushes working in opposite directions to clean the modules. The contra-rotating brushes in iSolar 800 balance out any transverse forces, ensuring optimal handling.
Kärcher also offers safety gear for the rooftop solar cleaning personnel and panel cleaning detergent RM99, which it claims, can gently remove even the most stubborn dirt.
Kärcher was incepted in 1935 in Winnenden, Germany.

The acquisition takes its total portfolio size to 563 MWp.
“The acquisition continues to be in line with its stated objective of acquiring high-quality, income-yielding assets with stable and long-term cash flows that generate steady returns for investors,” stated Virescent Renewable Energy Trust.
Samta Energy developed and commissioned the 25 MW solar project in the Surendranagar district of Gujarat in January 2012. This project, spread across 200 acres of land, uses thin-film modules and supplies power to the Gujarat Government State utility.

Researchers at South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) have developed a perovskite solar cell by using alkylammonium chloride (RACI) to control the formation of defects in the perovskite layer.
“Alkylammonium chloride, which is dequantized at the crystallization stage while combining with perovskite components, was used,” said researcher Sang Il Seok. “This optimal combination with Alkyl was also able to optimally control the rate of volatilization with solvent during coating and heat treatment of perovskite precursor solution.”
The scientists built the cell with a metal halide perovskite known as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), which offers superior thermal stability and a narrow bandgap. The new process enables the creation of a dense perovskite film with good crystallinity, they claimed. They investigated the surface morphology of the film via grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.
“RACl added to the precursor solution was believed to be easily volatilized during coating and annealing,” they explained.
They tested the film in a perovskite cell and found that it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.08%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V, a short-circuit current of 25.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 86.15%. When tested by NREL experts, the device achieved a certified efficiency of 25.73%.
The researchers presented the cell tech in “Controlled growth of perovskite layers with volatile alkylammonium chlorides,” which was recently published in Nature.
“This study is very meaningful, as it examines the crystallization process of perovskite with halide anions in real time through the UNIST-PAL Beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory,” said researcher Tae Joo Shin.
