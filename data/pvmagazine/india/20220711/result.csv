The lithium-ion-based system provides on-demand electrical energy and replaces the need for movable fossil-fuel-based power generators.
The target applications include power for construction sites, outdoor events, on-demand electric vehicle (EV) charging, and disaster relief. MoviGEN is non-polluting and much quieter than diesel generators. Other advantages include lower operating costs and less maintenance.
“MoviGEN is scalable on both power and energy (battery capacity) ratings. The systems can range from 5 kW/10 kWh to 200 kW/400 kWh. We also provide customized solutions for power and energy ratings beyond 200 kW/400 kWh based on the application,” AmpereHour Energy CEO Ayush Misra told pv magazine.  “The charging time would vary based on the system’s power rating, but the system can do a maximum discharge rate of 1 C (one hour). The battery life is estimated to be 4,000 cycles.”
MoviGEN system comes with AmpereHour’s energy management platform, which facilitates remote management and control of MoviGEN via its Elina software platform. The software facilitates real-time monitoring of many system parameters, enabling future optimization and safe operation.

Maxeon Solar Technologies, a major PV module producer based in Singapore, revealed the results of a third-party energy payback performance evaluation of its Maxeon 3 panels in its 2021 annual sustainability report. 
Energy payback is the period required for a renewable energy system to generate the same amount of energy that was used to produce the system itself. The assessment considers the cumulative energy demand over all the life cycle stages of solar panels and considers local grid efficiencies for different global locations. 
The test found that Maxeon 3 solar panels had an energy payback period ranging from 0.13 to 0.45 years for ground mounted modules, and 0.27 to 0.92 years for a residential rooftop system. For ground mounted panels, the energy payback period can be as little as 47.5 days. 
Spread over the 40-year performance warranty on the panels, the energy output exceeds the input more than 100 times over its lifetime, marking a significant milestone for the sustainability of PV technology.
Sustainability Report 2021
Maxeon shared in its 2021 sustainability report that it delivered 899 MW of clean energy in 2021, namely its solar panels. The company’s impact led to over 52 million tons of carbon emissions abatement that year.
It committed to decreasing both the energy intensity and carbon intensity of manufacturing its panels from 2020 levels by 10% in 2025 and 20% in 2030. It also seeks to cut water use by 5% and waste creation by 20% by 2030.

For social goals in its ESG report, the company reported an industry-leading low rate of workplace safety incidences, and it has zero cases of non-compliance with human rights laws. It seeks to boost its traceability even further by 2025 by putting its supply information on blockchain, making supplier data is available within 4 hours of inquiry.
In 2021 the manufacturer introduced the Air panel, a thin, flexible module designed to adhere to low weight load bearing commercial roofs, which the company said represents a 4 GW market unserved by traditional solar panels that are too heavy for such structures.
The panel manufacturer also announced it joined the Singapore Low Carbon Network as an inaugural member as part of PwC Singapore’s Asia Pacific Centre for Sustainability Excellence. It formed new partnerships with Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore and National University of Singapore for continued advancement of its technology.
“With less than ten years left to meet the UN’s 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, renewable energy will be a key engine powering both Singapore’s and the world’s decarbonization agenda. We warmly welcome Maxeon Solar Technologies to the United Nations Global Compact and look forward to working alongside them to take decisive action for the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Esther Chang, Executive Director, Global Compact Network Singapore.

Dutch startup Charged has developed a lithium iron phosphate battery with a storage capacity of 5 kWh and a rated power of 2 kW. It brought the Sessy (Smart Energy Storage System) battery to market via a crowdfunding campaign.
“The AC coupled battery can be stacked in a six-unit configuration to reach 30 kWh of storage capacity and 12 kW of power,” company co-founder Roeland Nagel told pv magazine. “It can be placed between a residential PV system’s inverter and the main fuse box.”
The device measures 400 mm x 500 mm x 200 mm and weighs 45 kg. It features a nominal voltage of 48 V and is equipped with a bidirectional inverter that can be tied directly to the grid.
“The battery can be connected to Wi-Fi to get access to the cloud algorithm that provides the optimal discharge strategy to maximize savings and earnings from dynamic energy contracts,” Nagel said. “It considers solar radiation and consumption forecast, as well as electricity prices, in order to calculate the optimum time to charge and discharge.”
The roundtrip efficiency of the battery and the inverter is around 88% under full load. The product comes with a 10-year warranty and can purportedly maintain stable operations over 6.000 cycles.
“Sessy is currently being engineered and designed in the Netherlands,” Nagel said. “The production will also be done in The Netherlands in the facility of Charged in Aldelst, in the province of Gelderland, Netherlands.”
Charged plans to raise capital via funding rounds under the SmartHub Incubator Industry platform.
