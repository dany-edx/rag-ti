GAIL will set up a solar park for INR 7,250 crore, Aditya Birla Renewables 1.5 GW renewable energy and green hydrogen project for INR 6,000 crore, Malur Renewables 1.8 GW solar park for INR 5,090 crore, BPCL Ltd 1 GW renewable energy plant for INR 5,000 crore, and 900 MW Bhankrota solar park project for INR 4,050 crore.
Greenko Energies will build a 2.65 GW off-stream closed-loop pumped storage project for INR 13,500 crore. Other pump storage investments include ReNew Power INR 10,000 crore, Semaliya Energy INR 9,700 crore (1.2 GW project), and ACME Cleantech Solutions INR 7,150 crore (1.5 GW project) and INR 2,800 crore (600 MW project).

Husk Power became EBITDA positive in Q4 2022 in its two primary markets, India and Nigeria. [EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a widely used measure of corporate profitability.] 
“Corporate profitability in India and Nigeria was achieved against a backdrop of severe market disruption caused by Covid-19, global inflation, and rising costs of capital, demonstrating the resilience of Husk’s business model,” stated the company 
Husk has more than 150 minigrids in operation in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, serving more than 10,000 customers. “The majority of these customers are rural businesses that previously relied on polluting and expensive diesel generators because of unreliable DISCOM power. Husk minigrids have allowed those businesses to switch to solar power, making a significant contribution to India’s energy transition goals and reducing carbon emissions. The minigrids also power schools and health clinics, contributing to the broader Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda,” stated Husk.
Husk expects to grow ten-fold to more than 1,000 minigrids over the next several years in India. 
Husk pioneered the rural minigrid 15 years ago using waste biomass gasification, and in 2017 followed up with the industry’s first solar hybrid minigrid. “Husk has proven that the rural minigrid business model works, in Asia and Africa, and in off-grid, under-the-grid, and grid-interconnected communities,” said board chairman, Brad Mattson. “We have already scaled 10X, and are poised to scale another 10X.”
Husk has committed to building at least 5,000 minigrids by 2030 that would impact more than 10 million people and avoid 7 megatons of carbon emissions from diesel generators.

Rajesh Exports Limited has been selected by the Government of India as one of the three successful participants in the INR 18,100 crore ($2.2 billion) PLI Scheme for the production of advanced chemistry cells. The other two winners are Reliance Industries and Ola Electric. 
As per the requirement of the PLI Scheme, Rajesh Exports has incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, ACC Energy Storage, to execute the project for manufacturing advanced-chemistry lithium-ion cells for battery storage. 
Under the tripartite agreement, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India, has assured Rajesh Exports of all the required support for setting up a 5 GWh lithium cell factory. The Department of Industries and Commerce, Government of Karnataka, has also assured all the required support and a tailormade incentive package for the giga factory. ACC Energy Storage has undertaken to execute the project within the required time limit.
“Rajesh Exports will set up the world’s finest 5 GWh lithium-ion cell manufacturing plant with the finest and the most futuristic technology,” the company stated in a previous release. 
Rajesh Exports is the largest refiner of gold in the world and processes about 35%of gold produced in the world. It claims to be the only company with a presence across the value chain of gold from mining till its own retail brand. It recorded annual sales of INR 2,431 billion (approx. $33 billion) on a consolidated basis for FY 2021-22.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/24/assessing-vibrations-in-solar-modules-due-to-robot-cleaning/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOLAR PANEL CLEANING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 24, 2023",Assessing vibrations in solar modules due to robot cleaning,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI), part of Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), have tried to assess the mechanical stress to which solar modules are exposed during robotic cleaning operations.
“One specific concern is vibration – how much do the modules shake as a robot brushes them,” researcher Ben Figgis told pv magazine. “We found that the key factor was how large the modules were and that, regardless of differences in glass thickness and framing, modules with similar sizes tended to exhibit roughly the same amount of vibration.”
The study identifies the threshold of deflection at which solar cell damage can occur. The scientists set up an experimental setting at the QEERI testing facility in Doha and ran several tests on five crystalline silicon panels and on a thin-film module based on copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) tech. All of the panels were south-oriented and mounted in landscape orientation, with a tilt angle of 22 degrees.
“The modules had various frame thicknesses, so to achieve the same height of the module upper surface spacers were added beneath the frames of some modules, at the clamps,” they explained. “The thin-film CIGS, module F, was mounted with clamps on vertical metal profiles, also bringing its front surface to the same height as the other modules.”
For their experiments, the academics used a linear rotating dry-brush robot provided by Saudi manufacturer Nomadd Desert Solar Solutions. “The vibration results observed in this study are particular to the robot used, and other robots are likely to produce different vibrations,” they warned. “Each module was measured three times, i.e. with three robot passes in one direction, on non-windy days.”
The research group found that displacements of the modules from their neutral position, or deflection magnitudes, under robot cleaning were “very small” for all panels.
“There was moderate consistency in the severity and number of vibrations over the three robot passes that were conducted for each module,” they said, noting that the robot does not pose a threat to the modules. “Overall, it seems the main factor in a module’s vibration amplitude is its size.”
The scientists also determined that an hour of strong wind made the panels vibrate more than when exposed to the cleaning robot.
“This reinforces the earlier conclusion that this particular robot seems unlikely to be a risk for flexing-related PV module degradation, because natural wind has a stronger influence;” they said.
They presented their findings in “PV module vibration by robotic cleaning,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
