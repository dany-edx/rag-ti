Both partners signed a framework agreement for co-investment.
The Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries is owned by the Norwegian Government and invests primarily in the clean energy sector. It invests equity and/or debt capital, always as a financial minority together with partners. ACME Group is one of India’s leading renewable energy developers with projects across 12 States.
Manoj Upadhyay, founder and chairman of Acme Group, said, “Both the partners will invest in potential projects in the renewable sector that would help the country to attain sustainable development and create employment opportunities.”
Mark Davis, executive vice president-Clean Energy, Norfund, said, “ACME’s proven track record of being able to deliver on large scale renewables makes the company an ideal partner for Norfund in our efforts to contribute to avoiding carbon emission by investing in the energy transition in India.”
Recently, Norfund made an equity investment of INR 500 crore ($61.3 million) in Punjab-based SAEL that has developed biomass power generation as a solution to stubble burning. Together with pension fund KLP, also based in Norway, it has also bought a 49% stake in a 420 MW DC (300 MW AC) solar plant being built in India. Italy’s Enel Green Power is developing this solar plant in the Bikaner District of Rajasthan.

Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI, pointed out that the Union Budget 2023-24 will be the first to be presented since India announced the Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) to achieve the net zero emission goals by 2070. “It is imperative that the vision of long-term transition is embedded in the annual budgets, as the fiscal policy not only alters incentive structure for consumer and producer choices, but it also sends a strong signal to the private sector for technology adoption,” she said.
In order to bring down the material intensity of India’s development trajectory, Dr Dhawan suggested that the budgetary allocations for yet-to-be-built infrastructure must account for the needs of green planning, particularly the promotion of energy-efficient building designs, sustainably produced materials and the use of renewables.
She added that the “green” efficiency of subsidies needs to be enhanced by prioritising greener alternatives. “We need to align the LiFE initiative with the promotion of solar energy by targeting high power-consuming households. A combination of generation-based incentives for installing solar rooftops with higher peak tariffs will encourage high power-consuming households to invest in solar rooftop systems,” Dr Dhawan said. She further added that the range of options that the recently amended Energy Conservation Act offers, can be innovatively utilized for bringing down the cost of transition as well as distribution and enforcement of national targets to a wider set of actors.
Ajay Shankar, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, and former secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Government of India, noted that with the need to divert the cess on coal to “make good the shortfall in GST revenues of the states” now over, the money collected as cess could be used as a ‘Green Fund’. “It could be used to create a Green Equity Fund which could provide equity to start-ups and pioneering energy transition projects. It can also be used to provide Viability Gap Funding for energy transition projects,” he added.
With the recent years witnessing a rise in the incidence of crude oil spillage in the country, Dr Banwari Lal, Senior Director, TERI, suggested provisions in the Union Budget or tax /GST relief to oil companies that adopt green technologies or environment-friendly solutions and products to restore oil contaminated sites.
With 2023 marking the mid-point since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, Dr Shailly Kedia, Associate Director, TERI, drew upon the need to use Green Budgeting as a tool for systematic mapping and tracking funds, outlays, expenditures, and policies which, in turn, can support integration of green objectives.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/25/new-method-to-measure-energy-yield-of-bifacial-pv-systems/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 25, 2023",New method to measure energy yield of bifacial PV systems,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Sunlab laboratory at the University of Ottawa have devised a new way to measure the energy yield of bifacial PV systems. The innovation is intended to complement the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) measuring standard introduced in 2019.
The new scaled rear irradiance (SRI) method purportedly improves IEC measurements by accommodating the effects of different ground covers’ spectral albedo in its calculation of the bifacial system’s rear-side irradiance.
To prove the concept, the scientists modeled the performance of a bifacial silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar module under the IEC bifacial illumination technique and the SRI method. They mounted the system on a horizontal single-axis tracker 1.22 meters from the ground in Boulder, Colorado, United States. The ground covers considered were soil, red brick, green grass, roof shingle, concrete, sand, dry grass, and snow.
Results show that for a rear irradiance of 200 W/square meters, the IEC measurement does not distinguish between the different ground covers, overestimating bifacial gain by between 14% and 1.4% for all ground covers except snow. The SRI method, on the other hand, shows a clear differentiation between the range of operating conditions.
“Implementation of this method into international standards for such panels can enable predictions of outdoor bifacial panel performance to within 2% absolute,” said researcher Erin Tonita.
The new method can also predict energy yield gains in locations other than Boulder with an error of less than 7%, according to the academics.
The innovation could be used to compare different bifacial technologies and enhance system performance via ground cover-specific design optimization, the authors said. They shared their findings in “A general illumination method to predict bifacial photovoltaic system performance,” which was recently published in Joule.

Researchers led by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria have suggested the use of regenerative braking to store renewable energy at decommissioned mining sites.
Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that takes the wasted energy from the process of slowing down a vehicle.
The proposed underground gravity energy storage (UGES) concept consists of lowering sand into an underground mine and lifting this sand to an upper reservoir via electric motors to store energy at moments of low power demand.
“UGES uses regenerative braking to adjust the descent speed of the sand in the mine shaft and generate electricity,” researcher Zakeri Benham told pv magazine. “It has the advantage of making use of existing infrastructure and providing clean, cheap, and long-duration energy storage with no material intensity, on top of being already close to the electricity grid and roads.”
The system consists of a shaft with variable depths and diameters, a motor/generator, upper and lower storage sites, and mining equipment.
“To maximize power capacity, the sand containers in the shaft occupy approximately 50% of the shaft’s volume,” the scientists said. “The other 50% of space is required for filling and emptying the containers with sand.”
The charging mode consists of collecting sand from the lower storage site at the bottom of the mine with excavators and transporting the sand to the shaft with electric trucks or conveyor belts. Energy is stored using cheap or excess electricity from the grid or a large solar PV farm nearby to pull the sand up via the shaft with the motors/generators. After the sand reaches the top of the mine, the sand is stored in sand piles.
