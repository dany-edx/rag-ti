The bio-CNG plant is located at the Devguradiya Trenching Ground in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.
The company operating the bio-CNG plant incurs electricity costs of INR 38 lakh per month to power its operations. It plans to install another 800 kW solar panel plant in the complex within the next year. It expects that to help it save 40% on the bio-CNG plant’s electricity bill.
The plant treats 550 metric tons of wet waste (domestic organic waste) per day to generate 17,500 kg of bio-CNG, which is a purified type of biogas. It supplies 50% of its gas to Municipal Corporation, Indore, for use in public transport buses. The remaining 50% of its output is sold to various industrial and commercial consumers.

The two companies will form a joint venture for PV production. Cells and modules will be produced in two phases of 600 MW each at Websol’s existing unit at Falta in West Bengal, said Amp Energy India, as it announced the signing of a term sheet for the establishment of the joint venture.
Amp Energy India said its entry into PV manufacturing will help it to better control the supply chain for critical components. Websol will hold a 51% stake in the venture, while Amp Energy will own the remaining 49%.
The project will be financed via a combination of debt and equity. It will supply up to 50% of its output to Amp Energy India under an off-take agreement. The rest of the power will be sold on the market, in order to fill the demand-supply gap for cells and modules in India. 
Amp Energy India said it has a renewable energy portfolio of more than 2 GW across 15 states in India. 
“We believe that our entry into manufacturing would not only help in backward integration but also help us have better control over the supply chain of critical components,” said Pinaki Bhattacharyya, MD and CEO, Amp Energy India. “We have always supported the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative by generating renewable energy in India, and this natural progression into manufacturing is also an extension of our support.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/09/solar-perovskite-tandems-and-potential-induced-degradation/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Solar perovskite tandems and potential-induced degradation,"From pv magazine Global
That perovskite solar cells face a few challenges when it comes to stability has been well documented. Research on this area has largely focused on the material’s sensitivity to moisture, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions. Potential-induced degradation (PID), caused by currents leaking from the cell and driving various damaging mechanisms, has long been a threat to performance in silicon PV modules, but has so far been much less explored in emerging PV technologies such as perovskite.
Scientists led by Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) evaluated the PID susceptibility of perovskite-silicon tandem devices fabricated in its lab. They found that more work may need to be done on the issue before perovskites can be commercialized and deployed at scale.
“No investigation into PID effects in perovskite/silicon tandem devices … has been published in the literature, despite the importance of PID robustness for commercialization,” the group stated. “This motivates us to evaluate here the impact of a high system voltage on encapsulated perovskite/silicon tandem devices, provide insights into its root causes and formulate mitigation strategies.”
Industry guidelines for PID testing, outlined in the IEC 61215 standard, state that modules should be able to pass 96 hours at maximum system voltage under damp heat conditions (85 C, 85% humidity) with less than 5% loss to their initial efficiency. The tandem cell technology tested at KAUST was shown to lose 53% of its initial performance after 22 hours under a 1,000 V negative bias, at a lower temperature of 60 C. Control samples were exposed the same temperature without the voltage bias, serving as evidence that PID was to blame for the loss. Full details of the study can be found in “Potential-induced degradation in perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaic modules,” published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
After testing, the group took the cells apart and used imaging techniques to understand how the degradation had occurred. This showed that various materials from the perovskite layer had diffused into the encapsulant layer, suggesting that the voltage can change the perovskite’s structure and degrade its performance as a solar cell – meaning a distinct mechanism from the PID common to silicon, caused by sodium ions moving toward the cell.
In terms of mitigating this effect, the group sees encapsulant-free modules where the cell has no contact with the glass as one possibility, though noting that this would likely cause other problems given perovskites’ need to be shielded from moisture as well.
The testing also showed that applying voltage in the opposite direction could at least partially ‘heal’ the performance loss. The group, however, is certain that more protection will be needed. They state that searching for a material that can prevent diffusion of the perovskite materials without hurting cell performance in other ways could be a promising research direction.
