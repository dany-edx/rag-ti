(GUVNL) has started accepting bids to develop 1,000 MWh (500 MW x two hours) of grid-connected battery energy storage systems in Gujarat. The selected developers will set up the projects under the build-own-operate model.
GUVNL plans to use the energy storage systems on an “on-demand” basis, suited to the requirements of state electricity distribution companies during peak and off-peak hours. The projects will be awarded through e-bidding, followed by an e-reverse auction process. The minimum bid size is 80 MWh (40 MW x two hours).
GUVNL will enter into battery energy storage purchase agreements with the successful developers to provide energy storage facilities to it.
“Already commissioned projects cannot be considered under this RfS. Projects under construction or projects which are not yet commissioned will, however, be considered, in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes. Enhancement and augmentation of already commissioned Projects, irrespective of their capacities, will not be considered as eligible project under this scheme,” GUVNL said in the tender document.
The selected developers will be responsible for setting up the battery energy storage system and handling its interconnection with the state transmission network.

The two companies recently signed a commercial arrangement to set up the project for 100 MW of round-the-clock power supply to Hindalco’s Odisha smelter.
Greenko said it will ensure round-the-clock power supplies by backing solar and wind power generation with hydro pump storage.
“The [renewable energy] project will be set up as a captive generation facility under a 25-year offtake arrangement. It will supply power to Hindalco’s Aditya Aluminium smelter in Odisha, enabling reduction of CO2 emissions by 680,000 tons annually,” stated Hindalco. “Further discussions between the parties to execute a power purchase agreement along with the other supplementary agreements are expected to be completed soon.”
Aluminum smelting requires reliable and continuous power. The project will be one of the world’s first for the aluminum sector, with very high (+85%) reliability from solar and wind power, without dependence on grid electricity. Hindalco will also be the first aluminum company in India to use such round-the-clock, carbon-free power for smelting.
Greenko will design, construct, partly own, and operate the solar and wind facilities. It will provide appropriate storage capacity from its hydro pump storage project in Pinnapuram, Andhra Pradesh, to ensure continuous power supply.
Over the past few years, Hindalco has invested in more than 100 MW of solar and wind power. The latest renewables project adds 100 MW of captive, continuous power. Hindalco said it might also enhance another 350 MW of round-the-clock, carbon-free energy in the future.
“Clean energy sources backed with competitive and proven storage technologies like hydro pump storage project offers a competitive, reliable and sustainable alternative to consumers to support their decarbonization journey,” said Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, CEO and managing director of Greenko. “For instance, in this case, the RE project, along with Greenko’s pump storage project, will ensure firm and predictable supply even at individual time block level without any banking support from the grid, unprecedented for [renewable energy] projects globally, thereby committing very high reliability to Hindalco.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/12/rec-to-showcase-new-alpha-pure-r-solar-panels-at-rei/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA,NORWAY",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 12, 2022",REC to showcase new Alpha Pure-R solar panels at REI,"Norwegian solar manufacturer REC Group and its new parent company, Reliance Industries Ltd., plan to exhibit a new PV module at the Renewable Energy India (REI) expo, which is scheduled to take place between Sept. 28 and Sept. 30.
REC will unveil its new Alpha Pure-R solar panel, just one year after launching its REC Alpha Pure model, which won the 2022 Intersolar Award. The company said it has doubled its Alpha HJT production capacity in Singapore for the new solar panel.
REC and Reliance Industries, a Fortune Global 500 corporation, are also going full steam ahead to recruit talent for their new solar gigafactory at Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex in Gujarat. The complex will produce solar panels, energy storage systems, electrolyzers, and fuel cells, spread out over 5,000 acres of space.
The REC Alpha Pure-R panel features G12 heterojunction (HJT) cells in a patented design, delivering a power output of up to 430 Wp in a module that is less than 2 square meters in size. This makes the new product ideal for residential installations, where space is limited.
“The REC Alpha Pure-R hits the sweet spot in terms of its power output, size, weight, and handling,” said REC CEO Jan Enno Bicker. “With its high-power density innovations, the new panel follows the lead-free and RoHS compliant REC Alpha Pure Series.”
The REC Alpha Pure-R will go into production at REC’s new facilities in Singapore. The company is now doubling its Alpha HJT product line capacity from 600 MW to 1.2 GW.
