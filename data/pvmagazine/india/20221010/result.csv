The cumulative installed capacity includes 2,726 MW of commercial, 5,542 MW of industrial, and 1,952 MW of residential PV, according to Bridge To India‘s Solar Rooftop Map 2022 June.
The capital expenditure (Capex) model, wherein consumers own the system, accounts for 7,628 MW of the cumulative installations. The balance of installations (2,593 MW) is in Opex (operating expenditure) mode, wherein a third-party company (developer/RESCO) owns, installs, and operates the system at consumer premises.
In the July 2021-June 2022 period, the nation added 2,520 MW of rooftop solar–44% up from 1,748 MW installed in the corresponding twelve months ending June 30, 2021.
Residential installations have grown faster than installations in other segments in the last two years.
In the July 2021-June 2022 period, the residential segment added 660 MW of rooftop solar capacity—a 35% increase year-on-year.
The share of opex-mode installations in the annual installations dropped further from 20% in the previous year to 16% (397 MW of 2,520 MW).
China’s Solis topped in inverter supplies to the Indian rooftop solar market, accounting for 30.4% of the 2,520 MW annual installation. It was followed by Sungrow (19.5%) and Goodwe (12.1%).
Among players, Mumbai’s Tata Power led in EPC installations with 15.7% of the 2,520 MW market. Hyderabad-based Fourth Partner Energy ranked second with a 3.2% market share. Orb Energy (1.9%) installed the third most capacity.
Amplus Solar claimed 22% of the 397 MW Opex (developer-mode) market. Fourth Partner Energy (18.6%) and Tata Power (16.9%) followed next.

Researchers from Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) have developed a technique known as “FlexTrail printing” – a metallization method to print silver-nanoparticle-based front electrodes on busbarless silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells.
“Currently, we are working on a FlexTrail parallel print head allowing for fast, reliable, and precise processing of high-efficiency solar cells,” researcher Jörg Schube told pv magazine. “Because of the very low fluid consumption, we expect positive impacts on costs and ecological footprint for PV solutions.”
FlexTrail-printing can enable the precise application of media of different viscosities with an extremely precise, minimal structure width.
“It is demonstrated that it enables both an effective silver usage, contact uniformity, and low silver consumption,” the scientists said. “Due to its simplicity and process stability, it additionally has the potential for low cycle times per cell and is, thus, predestinated for a future lab-to-fab transfer.”
The technique involves the application of a very thin, flexible glass capillary filled with fluid at an atmospheric pressure of up to 11 bar. During the printing process, the capillary is in contact with the substrate and continuously trails over it.
“The glass capillary’s flexibility and bending allows for a non-destructive processing,” the academics said, noting that the method also enables the printing of curved structures. “Additionally, it balances possible substrate waviness.”
The research team fabricated one-cell modules using SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT), which is a multi-wire interconnection technology based on copper wires covered with a low-temperature solder alloy.
“Typically, the wires are integrated into a polymer foil and attached to the solar cell by an automated stringing. The solder interconnection is formed during a subsequent lamination process conducted at a silicon heterojunction-compatible process temperature,” the researchers said.
They printed the fingers consecutively using one capillary, which resulted in silver-based functional lines with a feature size of 9 μm. They then built 22.8%-efficient SHJ solar cells on M2 wafers and with those cells they fabricated a 200 mm x 200 mm one-cell module.
The panel achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%, an open-circuit voltage of 731.5 mV, a short-circuit current of 8.83 A, and a fill factor of 74.4%. For comparison, a reference module fabricated via screen printing achieved an efficiency of 20.78%, an open-circuit voltage of 733.5 mV, a short-circuit current of 8.91 A, and a fill factor of 77.7%.
“FlexTrail has an advantage over inkjet in terms of conversion efficiency. Moreover, it has an advantage in simpler and, therefore, more cost-effective processing, since only one pass per finger is necessary for printing and, in addition, silver consumption is lower,” the researchers said, adding that silver reduction was estimated at around 68%.
They presented their findings in “FlexTrail Printing as Direct Metallization with Low Silver Consumption for Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells: Evaluation of Solar Cell and Module Performance,” which was recently published in Energy Technology.
“To pave the way for an industrial application of FlexTrail printing, a parallel printhead is currently under development,” the scientists concluded. “For the near future, it is planned to utilize it not only for the metallization of SHJ but also for tandem solar cells, for example, perovskite silicon tandems.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/10/zinc-cerium-redox-flow-battery-for-renewable-energy-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 10, 2022",Zinc-cerium redox flow battery for renewable energy storage,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the City University of Hong Kong have developed a redox flow battery (RFB) based on electrolytes made of zinc (Zn) and cerium (Ce) that they claim may be an ideal solution for renewable energy storage, due to its design flexibility.
“The Zn-Ce flow battery has the advantages of moderate cost and high energy density, but suffers from low efficiency,” researcher Walid Daoud told pv magazine, noting that the devices usually have a lifespan of just a few cycles. “Thus, we proposed a new cell design to improve its efficiency and stability.”
The battery features two membranes to separate the incompatible ions of the two electrolytes. This configuration allows the scientists to custom-assign charge carriers to ions compatible with the electrolytes while separating incompatible species. In addition, the design enables the achievement of high and stable Coulumbic efficiency, while protecting the Zn half-cell from hydrogen ion poisoning.
“The Ce electrolyte is highly oxidative, which poses a challenge towards the stability of anion membrane,” Daoud said. “Thus, the stability and selectivity of anion membrane require further improvement.”
The device achieved a voltage plateau of 2.3 V at 20 mA cm−2, energy efficiency of 71.3% at 60 mA cm−2, and a record average Coulombic efficiency of 94% during cycling.
“It is concluded that the Zn electrolyte with highly reversible Zn plating/striping and suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction forms the foundation of the high Coulombic efficiency,” said the researchers. 
Daoud said that in the future, Zn-Ce RFBS could work efficiently in conjunction with PV power generation.
“The system design flexibility and safety advantages will lead to many opportunities. The battery can be easily scaled to meet the various storage demands of solar plants,” he said. “These storage systems are promising because of the low-cost and abundance of zinc. However, the involved metallic zinc deposition induces challenges, such as limited electrode space for zinc deposition compromising the practical energy density compared to the theoretical energy density, and zinc dendrites can potentially pierce the membrane.”
The research group presented the battery technology in “The Renaissance of the Zn-Ce Flow Battery: Dual-Membrane Configuration Enables Unprecedentedly High Efficiency,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
“This work designs a dual-membrane Zn-Ce RFB to address the incompatibility issue, with which the cell demonstrates a stable and reproducible cycling performance, thus reviving the potential of Zn-Ce RFBs as promising high-power-density rechargeable batteries,” the scientists concluded.
