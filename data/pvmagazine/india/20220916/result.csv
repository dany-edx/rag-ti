The company has formed a subsidiary, Techbec Industries Ltd (TIL), to undertake its business of lithium battery production and other allied activities.
The company’s lithium battery manufacturing plant with a capacaity of 480 MWh/annum is ready at Safiabad in the Sonipat district of Haryana and will start commercial production January onwards. It is spread across 40,000 sq.ft of land and can produce up to 600,000 units of battery packs annually. 
“This workshop will be equipped with fully-automated, cutting-edge production lines and testing facilities for making custom-designed battery modules, packs, and containerization,” stated Servotech.
Servotech, the holding company of TIL, would hold 63.5% share capital in the newly established battery manufacturing entity.
“TIL intends to bring specific focus to support the electric vehicle (EV) segment and the battery-as-a-service business model offering across its portfolio of commercial vehicles. In addition to the existing State Transport Undertakings (STUs) and government fleets, TIL will also cater to all business opportunities across passenger mobility applications,” said Raman Bhatia, founder and managing director of Servotech Power Systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/16/streamlining-epc-functioning-with-saas/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DATA ANALYSIS,HIGHLIGHTS,MONITORING AND CONTROL,OPINION & ANALYSIS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2022",Streamlining EPC functioning with SaaS ,"EPC or engineering, procurement, and construction is a contracting arrangement where the EPC contractor is responsible for the design, procurement, construction, commissioning, and handover of the project to the end-user or owner.
EPCs require seamless functioning and visibility, which is augmented with software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. From streamlining the flow of the operation to increasing agility and reducing costs, Software as a Service is the go-to these days for EPC functioning. 
Saas can help track each aspect of the EPC. EPC project management software can aid in handling and executing resources in a way designed and agreed upon by both parties. With SaaS, EPC users can manage different silos as per that particular project’s requirements. The software ensures that the silos are integrated and accessible during all phases of the EPC to maintain transparency and end-toned visibility. 
Accounting is a big portion of any contract. SaaS makes the job easier. Keeping track of all costs, payouts, etc, Saas augments accounting efficiency without increasing the pressure on human employees. One of the major advantages of SaaS for EPC is that it helps in bifurcating and deciphering costs about the different project phases. The SaaS integration makes tracking costs and accounts easier, from recording procurements to raising purchase orders with the suppliers.
Documentation, including project meetings, RFQs, RFPs, architecture diagrams, layouts, bills, invoices, procurements, negotiations, contract documents, purchase orders, etc can be streamlined via SaaS. The system helps in mapping project life cycle and management with the help of relevant software. The ease of uploading and accessing documents streamlines the entire process. This helps make a single repository for all the records, making the operation time-optimized.
Besides this, SaaS facilitates setting up pages/ portals wherein providers can access and respond to ‘request for information’ documents, pictures, and other sub-contractor job-related information. This enables real-time collaboration with internal and external stakeholders.
 From accessing status reports to cost control by mapping out the budget based on accumulated data, Saas can help with strategic changes, operational optimization and time optimization by reducing any delays in communication and general lag, helping the stakeholders stay ahead of the curve with real-time information at their hands.

“UPL and CleanMax will set up and operate a hybrid captive power plant with a capacity of 28.05 MW of solar power and 33 MW of wind power. This project will enable UPL to increase its renewable energy usage to 30% of its total global power consumption from 8% currently,” UPL stated.
This 61.05 MW captive wind-solar hybrid project is a part of a larger 400 MW wind-solar hybrid farm developed by CleanMax in Gujarat. The 400 MW wind-solar hybrid farm comprises 230 MW wind and 180 MW solar, leading to carbon abatement of 8.75 lakh tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum.

French solar developer TSE inaugurated its first agrivoltaic pilot project on Sept. 8, in Amance, northeastern France.
The pilot facility is equipped with TSE’s agricultural canopy and a 2.4 MW shade with rotating solar panels fixed on cables 5 meters above the ground. The company also uses tracking algorithms via a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system to orient the PV modules according to climatic conditions. By optimizing this tracking algorithm, TSE hopes to be able to increase production between 10% and 20% compared to a conventional PV plant.
“We believe that it is possible to reconcile sustainable agriculture, green energy, redeployment of biodiversity and preservation of water resources. This is the meaning of the ambitious program that we have designed and that we are currently deploying in nine other sites in France,” said Mathieu Debonnet, the president of TSE.
The company said it will begin building three other pilot sites by the end of this year. It will conduct agronomic trial for nine years over an area of 5 hectares to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agricultural canopy on different crops. It has set up a joint research project with INRAE, a public research institute that focuses on agriculture, food and the environment.
