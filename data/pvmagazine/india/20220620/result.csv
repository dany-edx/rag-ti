The 530 kWp InRoof system will help Canada-based natural stone manufacturer Pangaea Natural Stone to meet its net-zero goals by offsetting 18,346 tons of CO2 emissions.
The system serves as the primary roof over Pangaea Natural Stone’s newly constructed production facility. It covers a total roof area of 35,000 square feet, thereby saving 124,968 kg of CO2 that would have been emitted in the production of the steel roof.
Ornate Solar designed, engineered and manufactured the system in India. It was subjected to 18 months of tests before commercial deployment. The company claims that its InRoof system is the industry’s first universal structural solution to integrate panels of any shape and size to replace conventional metal roofs.
“InRoof PV can replace metal sheets traditionally used as roofing for industrial factories and can serve as a PV integrated roof,” Ornate Solar Director Aditya Goel told pv magazine.

The InRoof system is powered by module-level power electronics in the form of microinverters from Enphase Energy. The microinverters come with a 15-year replacement warranty and are aligned with the highest international safety standards.
Canadian Solar supplied 1,175 high-efficiency mono PERC solar panels to generate energy and act as an integrated roofing element, replacing trapezoidal sheets. The indigenously developed InRoof structure consists of special-purpose roll-formed continuous (SRFC) sections made from a high-strength steel alloy resistant to corrosion and oxidation.
Anodized aluminium profiles provide two-layer protection against water ingress and distribute the static loads of the PV panels across the building purlins. Precision-engineered structural members have been used to build walkways and ridge profiles that interlock seamlessly with the PV panels and ensure a 100% guarantee against water leakage.
“Roof-integrated solar systems designed with [our] proprietary architecture can accommodate 26% more solar panels than traditional roof-mounted systems and have shown to generate over 4% to 8% more energy, due to free air circulation which lowers module backsheet temperatures by up to 15 C,” said Goel.
The InRoof system can also be used for solar parking lots, canopies and facades. Existing parking spaces and sheds can be retrofitted easily with the InRoof components compatible with most prefab steel structure designs.
The company has invested in manufacturing the required components at its production facility in New Delhi. It is also developing a plug-and-play version of the InRoof system for premium residential households, which can be installed on terraces and balconies. It is expected to hit the Indian market by December.

Hinduja Group, Caterpillar Venture Capital, Mercuria, OurCrowd, and Volvo Energy have together invested GBP 15 million ($18.4 million) in Connected Energy.
Connected Energy will use the amount to scale up its technology and operations in response to a growing energy storage market and increasing international availability of second-life batteries. The investment will also facilitate the in-house development of the company’s first large-scale M-STOR system of around 20 MW and 40 MWh. The system will employ a contracted “flow” of batteries from multiple original equipment manufacturers to provide long-term operational services to customers.
Connected Energy’s E-STOR technology is battery agnostic. It allows thousands of batteries with varying levels of degradation to be aggregated, controlled, and reused as one stationary energy storage system. This technology has been proven, commercialized, scaled up, and installed in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands in collaboration with its network of international partners. Connected Energy already has 16 operational systems across these locations, with its largest at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire, England.
According to Connected Energy CEO Matthew Lumsden, when batteries are around 25% degraded, they are often considered unsuitable for vehicles. However, they still have sufficient capacity for up to 10 years of more use in battery energy storage systems (BESS). Over its lifetime in operation, a second-life BESS can save an additional 450 tons per MWh of CO2 equivalent compared to using first-life lithium-ion batteries.
“To grow the second-life battery industry, strong pan-value chain relationships will be critical to Connected Energy as it expands, and the company’s new investors will complement this effort,” said Lumsden.
Connected Energy is also backed by Engie New Ventures, Macquarie, and the Low Carbon Innovation Fund.

Researchers at France’s National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – are developing solar modules featuring new bio-based materials in the front and rear sides.
“As the carbon footprint and the life cycle analysis have now become essential criteria in the choice of photovoltaic panels, the sourcing of materials will become a crucial element in Europe in the next few years,” said Anis Fouini, the director of CEA-INES, in an interview with pv magazine France.
Aude Derrier, the research project’s coordinator, said her colleagues have looked at the various materials that already exist, to find one that could allow module manufacturers to produce panels that improve performance, durability, and cost, while lowering the environmental impact. The first demonstrator consists of heterojunction (HTJ) solar cells integrated into an all-composite material.
“The front side is made of a fiberglass-filled polymer, which provides transparency,” Derrier said. “The rear side is made of composite based on thermoplastics in which a weaving of two fibers, flax and basalt, has been integrated, which will provide mechanical strength, but also better resistance to humidity.”
The flax is sourced from northern France, where the entire industrial ecosystem is already present. The basalt is sourced elsewhere in Europe and is woven by an industrial partner of INES. This reduced the carbon footprint by 75 grams of CO2 per watt, compared to a reference module of the same power. The weight was also optimized and is less than 5 kilograms per square meter.
“This module is aimed at the rooftop PV and building integration,” said Derrier. “The advantage is that it is naturally black in color, without the need for a backsheet. In terms of recycling, thanks to thermoplastics, which can be remelted, the separation of the layers is also technically simpler.”
The module can be made without adapting current processes. Derrier said the idea is to transfer the technology to manufacturers, without additional investment.
“The only imperative is to have freezers to store the material and not to start the resin cross-linking process, but most manufacturers today use prepreg and are already equipped for this,” she said.


The INES scientists also looked into the solar glass supply issues encountered by all photovoltaic players and worked on the reuse of tempered glass.
“We worked on the second life of glass and developed a module made up of reused 2.8 mm glass that comes from an old module,” said Derrier. “We have also used a thermoplastic encapsulant which does not require cross-linking, which will therefore be easy to recycle, and a thermoplastic composite with flax fiber for resistance.”
The basalt-free rear face of the module has a natural linen color, which could be aesthetically interesting for architects in terms of facade integration, for example. In addition, the INES calculation tool showed a 10% reduction in the carbon footprint.
“It is now imperative to question the photovoltaic supply chains,” said Jouini. “With the help of the Rhône-Alpes region within the framework of the International Development Plan, we therefore went looking for players outside the solar sector to find new thermoplastics and new fibers. We also thought about the current lamination process, which is very energy intensive.”
Between the pressurization, the pressing and the cooling phase, the lamination usually lasts between 30 and 35 minutes, with an operating temperature of around 150 C to 160 C.
“But for modules that increasingly incorporate eco-designed materials, it is necessary to transform thermoplastics at around 200 C to 250 C, knowing that HTJ technology is sensitive to heat and must not exceed 200 C,” said Derrier.
The research institute is teaming up with France-based induction thermocompression specialist Roctool, to reduce cycle times and make shapes according to the needs of customers. Together, they have developed a module with a rear face made of polypropylene-type thermoplastic composite, to which recycled carbon fibers have been integrated. The front side is made of thermoplastics and fiberglass.
“Roctool’s induction thermocompression process makes it possible to heat the two front and rear plates quickly, without having to reach 200 C at the core of the HTJ cells,” Derrier said.
The company claims the investment is lower and the process could achieve a cycle time of just a few minutes, while using less energy. The technology is aimed at composite manufacturers, to give them the possibility of producing parts of different shapes and sizes, while integrating lighter and more durable materials.
