https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/22/physics-based-model-to-predict-soiling-losses-in-bifacial-solar-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOILING,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",Physics-based model to predict soiling losses in bifacial solar modules,"Researchers from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur’s (IIEST Shibpur) have developed a novel physics-based model to estimate dust accumulation on the front and rear surfaces of bifacial modules.
“This model is equally applicable for both rooftop plant and commercial ones,” researcher Saheli Sengupta told pv magazine. “In India, a larger plant with bifacial modules is not yet available and hence we could not validate the model for the larger set-up. But this is in our research program to carry out the same for larger plants from India and abroad.”
The proposed model considers a few input parameters such as particulate matter (PM) concentration, panel tilt, the sun’s angle of incident, solar radiation, albedo, and PV module specifications. It also considers weather parameters such as wind direction, speed, and ambient temperature.
“The considerations made in this analysis are that the shape of the particles is assumed to be spherical; the dust deposition over the module is considered to be uniform; and the effect of different composition of dust is not considered separately,” said the academics.
The model calculates dust accumulation on the front surface of the PV module by considering deposition, rebound, and resuspension phenomena. Deposition involves dust landing on the surface, rebound occurs when particles bounce back into the air, and resuspension involves settled particles lifted by mechanisms like wind and air turbulence.
The model then calculates dust accumulation on the rear surface, taking into account deposition, rebound, and resuspension phenomena. Different types of particle deposition on the back are considered, including particles moving along with airflow and particles lifted from the ground surface.
Following this, the model calculates transmittance, assessing the material’s ability to allow light passage, based on previous results. By summing beam radiation, diffuse radiation, and ground-reflected radiation, the model determines the energy yield of the PV plant.
Testing their physical model, the researchers have compared its projected results to real observation on a 10 kW PV system. The array was stationed on the rooftop of a university building located in the Indian city of Howrah, West Bengal.
“It is observed that surface density of dust on back surface for 34 days is 0.08 g/m2, for 79 days 0.6 g/m2 and for 126 days 1.8 g/m2, which are deviated from model based calculated ones by 10%, 33.33% and 4.4% respectively,” the researchers said. “The surface density of dust accumulated on the glass based rear surface is about 1/6th of the front glass surface, which is validated by the model also.”
In addition, the scientists found that the error between the observed DC power generation and the calculated one was 5.6% on the back surface and 9.6% on the front.
“It is necessary to validate this model for large capacity bifacial plant at different locations,” the academics concluded.
They introduced their findings in “Physics based modeling of dust accumulation on a bifacial solar PV module for generation loss estimation due to soiling,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Advances.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/22/with-china-pv-modules-reaching-record-low-prices-is-there-a-chance-for-local-pv-manufacturing-elsewhere/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023","With China PV modules reaching record low prices, is there a chance for local PV manufacturing elsewhere?","From pv magazine Global
As China PV modules reach record-low prices, having dropped from $ 0.23/W in January 2023 to $ 0.13/W in November 2023, PV manufacturing efforts in Australia, Europe, India, North and South America seem to make little sense.
In the first half of 2023, despite strong shipments exceeding 252 GW, overall PV production capacity utilization averaged 56%, with TOPCon and n-type PERC utilization reaching 80% and 79%, respectively.
With nearly 80% of shipments coming directly from China, 18% from other Southeast Asian countries and less than 2% from the USA and Europe, it is clear that more of the cheap Chinese PV modules can flow to any market that does not impose barriers or taxes to Chinese/Asian PV modules.
This oligopoly raises concerns about the control or influence over the solar supply chain, as well as on the carbon footprint of such PV modules. Economies of scale, supply chain integration, relatively low energy costs and labor productivity make China the most competitive solar module manufacturer worldwide.
The European Parliament is slowly moving towards verifying whether the European financing framework is adequate to achieve European sovereignty of PV module production by 2030, taking into account the entire value chain of the PV industry, which is the only way to achieve the strategic objective of resilient European photovoltaic production.
Solar energy industry associations are present in most countries, with the mandate to represent diverse group interests such as installers, manufacturers and importers of PV modules, inverters, and batteries, as well as retailers, researchers, and lobbyists “who have requested a union of professionals with similar ideas so that all the various interests and concerns of the solar industry could be effectively reflected under one roof.”
In all countries, membership is mainly made up of installers, who are interested in obtaining the cheapest PV equipment possible, regardless of origin, as long as the prices are low, and the quality is acceptable. As the installation of PV systems employs around ten times more people than the entire PV module production value chain, and cheap PV modules are the main driver of the exponential growth in the adoption of PV in most markets, defending local production faces a conflict of interest on the part of these associations.
After a strong move to bring PV production to Europe, the US and India over the past two years, PV module prices in 2023 have made the solar production business in these countries uncompetitive. To reach net-zero emissions, the world will need more diverse supply chains to meet the growing demand for solar modules, and other countries where PV uptake is increasing rapidly, such as Australia and Brazil, have what it takes to be major suppliers.
More than 80% of current global solar PV manufacturing uses technology developed in Australian laboratories. Silicon PV is a very energy-intensive industry: Brazil is a large producer of metallurgical grade silicon, with one of the lowest carbon footprints in electricity production worldwide, which is important for the solar PV image and carbon footprint.
In July 2023, the Australian PV Institute released the study “Silicon to Solar (S2S) Study – Phase 1: Market Assessment Report,” assessing whether parts of, or the entire PV manufacturing value chain can be operational in Australia. The study makes a market assessment of the current PV supply chain and discusses options for increasing manufacturing in Australia. These options must be in line with three guiding principles:
A wide range of industry partners and collaborators has been engaged to ensure that the assessment is as relevant as possible and that the credible future state reflects the conditions under which a rational business would establish manufacturing in Australia.
With tens of thousands of companies employing more than 240 thousand installers and O&M service providers, Brazil has seen more than 1 GW/month of new PV systems coming into operation in 2023. As news about low-cost rooftop PV spread across the more than 80 million consumer units available in the country, and with still “only” around 2 million photovoltaic systems installed on rooftops, there is plenty of room to grow. These installers want the lowest possible prices for PV modules and are lobbying against any measures to protect the small local PV module manufacturing industry that might result in higher PV module prices.
China has gained ground in Brazil, mainly due to the exemption from import taxes, which adds up to a difference of between 30% and 35% in relation to the module manufactured nationally. Brazilian-made PV modules gain competitiveness only in terms of financing, carried out through low-interest credit from the National Bank for Economic and Social Development, but with Chinese modules at $0.13/W or less, even low-interest financing is not enough to make local PV module production competitive.
More creative solutions, which go beyond fees, taxes and subsidies, must be created if local PV module manufacturing is to take place in markets that install dozens of GW of PV per year. An example would be public bidding processes, in which governments would prioritize the national market at levels compatible with local production capacity, and the remainder could be acquired abroad.
From the International Solar Energy Society’s perspective, and the vision of a world with 100% renewable energy for everyone used wisely and efficiently, PV module production should not become an oligopoly and should not be concentrated in one corner of the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/22/statkraft-bets-on-mix-of-renewables-for-hydrogen-production/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GREEN HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"NOVEMBER 22, 2023",Statkraft bets on mix of renewables for hydrogen production,"Statkraft said it sees a lot of momentum in the hydrogen space across Europe, but “few actual investment decisions so far as the EU regulatory challenges are complicating the development.” The Norwegian company has proposed a number of “clarifications” to current legislation, underscoring the importance of “improving electrolysis economics” by using diversified renewable energy portfolios instead of single renewable assets.
Statkraft said the full-load hours for solar are between 800 to 2,000 hours per year, depending on where projects are in Europe. 
“But this doesn’t mean that one can use the full generation of a solar plant for a hydrogen plant, as it would require massive over-sizing of your hydrogen plant, which would not be economic,” said Norway’s largest energy producer. “In our view, hydrogen projects should be able to tap into different renewable energy sources.”
To achieve a 40% utilization rate of the electrolyzer from a single solar plant, the project would need to be oversized by a factor of five in relation to the electrolyzer capacity, according to Statkraft’s analysis of production data from new solar plants.
“When doing so, more than half of your solar production will be excess production that needs to be sold back to the market when prices tend to be very low,” said Simon Kornek, vice president for southern Europe at Statkraft.
When mixing onshore wind and solar, the situation reportedly improves.
“Combining single onshore wind and solar plants improve the utilization rate of the electrolyser to up to 60%, but it would still result in 20% excess production,” said Kornek.
According to Statkraft, hydropower from large reservoirs is the closest to a cost-competitive power source that can be derived as a stable 24/7 baseload supply over most of the year.  
“In Scandinavia, where power markets are already largely carbon-free, hydrogen projects can tap into existing hydropower,” said Kornek.
Statkraft has signed four power purchase agreements (PPAs) for hydrogen production, with projects located in Sweden, Norway, and Germany. The company will supply renewable electricity to H2 Green Steel’s project in Boden, Sweden, the Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) Holmaneset green hydrogen and green ammonia project in Norway (with a capacity of 300MW), and Air Liquide’s 20MW green hydrogen water-electrolysis plant in Germany.
Despite the majority of electricity markets differing from the Scandinavian model, Statkraft, wholly owned by the Norwegian state, aims to leverage extensive portfolios through partnerships with market integrators, including utilities and intermediaries.
Statkraft said several business models will coexist. Big energy-intensive processes will need stable hydrogen supplies, power supplies and significant amounts of storage. Other projects might work with lower utilization rates and produce when electricity prices are low. Use cases in the transportation sector will offer more flexibility if they come with decentralized refueling stations and storage.
Kornek agrees with other experts that storage and transportation will be the primary drivers of the change leading to a commoditized market. A flexible market will emerge in the next 15 to 20 years. But he is worried by the legislative developments. 
Statkraft’s Kornek said that companies did not proceed with many investment decisions because of the “EU regulatory challenges.” Kornek adds that a first indication of the impact of the new rules will emerge more clearly in the coming 12 to 24 months. 
“The Delegated Act as currently written makes it very complicated to realize the green hydrogen targets in Europe. In particular, the strict requirements on additionality, temporality, and geographical correlation will be extremely difficult to comply with and will make green hydrogen more expensive than necessary,” Kornek told pv magazine.
Kornek stated that involving a credit-worthy integrator for the PPAs enables the project sponsor to secure more affordable financing through non-recourse project financing, utilizing only the project’s cash flow as bank security.
Statkraft is seeking clarification on the role of “intermediaries” as defined in the European Commission’s delegated regulation (EU) 2023/1184, stating that intermediaries can play a role in green hydrogen project PPAs.
“Already today, we face caution from the side of potential hydrogen producers to conclude PPAs for hydrogen production,” said Kornek. “It is therefore of utmost importance to accept PPAs with an intermediary as a contracting party either through adapting the Q&A document or, ideally, through amending the definition according to RED III (2023/2413).”
From Statkraft’s point of view, intermediaries such as utilities, traders and aggregators, are more than facilitators and will be crucial to accelerating the build-out of green hydrogen projects in Europe.
“Intermediary companies play a crucial role in integrating intermittent renewable energy in the market, warehousing and managing energy risks as well as leveraging portfolio effects,” it said. “Thereby they improve the overall market efficiency. Intermediary companies are contracting parties and not only facilitators of the PPA contracts.”
According to Pexapark’s PPA tracker, 38% of the 48 GW of PPAs that have been published since 2018, are so-called utility/trader PPAs concluded with an intermediary company.
According to Statkraft, a well-functioning market is the most effective tool to ensure profitability in renewable energy and, thus, the best facilitator for developing new renewable power production and hydrogen projects.
