Informational site and solar calculator developer SolarReviews and the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) partnered to release an inaugural report on solar installers’ experience in the market.
The nationwide solar industry survey was comprised of nearly 500 participants, of which 62% were from residential and small commercial installation businesses, 6% were commercial installers, 6% were operations and maintenance companies, 4.5% electricians, 4% utility-scale installers, and 17.4% listed as other participants. 
Increased electricity prices were listed as the top reason customers are looking for solar, as 66% of respondents said prices are driving demand. Additionally, 62% of respondents said the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to improve their business.
Notably, 61% of respondents said pv magazine is their top solar industry news source. This makes pv magazine the number one trade publication, followed by Solar Power World (53%), state-level trade industry groups (40%) and Solar Builder (19%).
Additionally, 63% of respondents listed solar industry conferences as their most trusted source of news, many of which cited pv magazine as featured media partner. Meet this author at the upcoming RE+ Southeast event in Atlanta, and the CleanPower conference in New Orleans.

Respondents said top panel brands they procure include Qcells (66%), REC (41%), Canadian Solar (30%), Silfab Solar (25%) and JinkoSolar (20%).
The top inverter brands include Enphase Energy (74%) SolarEdge Technologies (60%), Sol-Ark (24%), SMA (23%), Fronius (14%) and Generac (13%).
Enphase was also the top pick for energy storage systems (58%), followed by Tesla, SolarEdge, Generac, and LG Chem, all hovering around 25% of respondents.
“Enphase post-install customer service is the best. Panel brands are mostly dictated by availability from our distributor,” said Ellen Castle, a survey respondent from A1A Solar Contracting.

Installers are split on how much growth they expect in 2023. About 37% said they expect to sell slightly more solar, while 36% expect much more. About 16% of installers said they expect to sell the same amount of solar in 2023 as 2022, while 11% expect a dip in sales.
Installers continue to alter their offerings as demand for new technologies emerges. About 15% of installed systems were oversized to meet the future demands of an electric vehicle charging at home. Over 80% of residential installers said they now offer battery energy storage, while 67% said they offer EV charging ports. About 40% of residential installers said they offer electrician services, and 28% of installers also perform roofing work.
Respondents said 21% of solar jobs included energy storage, while California, Florida, and Texas have battery attachment rates closer to 30%. Increased electricity prices, more frequent power outages, and shifting net metering policy are expected to drive up battery adoption further.
In the finance category, the largest group of customers are opting for solar-specific loans (44%), followed closely by cash purchases (42%), and power purchase agreements or leases (10%). Mosaic was listed as the top loan platform (20%), followed by Sunlight Financial (17%) and Goodleap (12%).
When asked about the biggest barriers to success, participants listed the high cost of financing as the greatest concern (42%), followed by customer acquisition (42%), difficulty hiring enough employees (38%), inflation (33%), and permitting and interconnection rules and cost (31%).
Respondents say the effects of inflation are leading to increased operational costs (70%), higher prices leading to solar demand (66%), and higher wages for workers (63%).
As solar businesses struggle to find employees, respondents listed finding trained installers as the greatest skill in need (71%). This was followed by trained electricians (67%) and construction workers (51%).
Respondents reported that 11% of their employees were NABCEP-certified. Interestingly, 42% of installers said they require installation workers to obtain Continuing Education Units (CEUs) each year, and 74% said they cover the costs of CEUs.
When asked about ongoing supply chain issues, respondents were split. About 34% of respondents said they experienced better supply chain conditions in 2022 than 2021, while 26% said it was about the same, and 41% said component supply issues are worse than the previous year. As international goods were in short supply, 42% of respondents said they turned to sourcing domestically produced solar components.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/11/pv-manufacturing-capacity-hit-600-gw-in-2022/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MAY 11, 2023",PV manufacturing capacity hit 600 GW in 2022,"From pv magazine Global
This week sees the publication of the annual ITRPV report, compiled by German engineering association VDMA. Now in its 14th edition, the report takes an in-depth at technology trends across the supply chain for silicon PV products. VDMA calculates PV module shipments in 2022 at 295 GW, with 258 GW installed and the remainder still in transit or warehoused.
The ITRPV finds that, at the end of 2022, the weighted average spot price for silicon PV modules fell by 7% compared to the previous year, reaching $0.228/W. The report also notes a growing market share for n-type technologies, and that the price premium for these is now marginal – just two tenths of a cent above the average at $0.230/W.
In terms of manufacturing capacity, VDMA finds that around 600 GW was online at the end of last year, with crystalline silicon technologies representing 95% of the market. New factories coming online today usually have at least 2 GW of capacity, and this is expected to increase to 5 GW in the longer term.
Large wafer formats (182mm and 210mm) now represent more than 60% of the market, with formats 166mm and smaller expected to disappear from the market entirely by 2027. VDMA also expects formats larger than 210mm to appear after 2025, representing only a small market share over the next decade. The split between these two large formats is still not clear, but all new production lines will be able to process both.
Monocrystalline silicon now accounts for 97% of production, and the report expects older multicrystalline technologies to disappear entirely in the near future. Gallium doping has also now become mainstream, with the boron doping it replaces also expected to disappear by the end of this year.
PERC (passivated emitter rear contact) remains the leading cell technology for now, amounting to around 70% of the market, but VDMA notes that its replacement with TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contact) is now well underway. TOPCon is expected to reach a market share of 60%, heterojunction of 19% and back contact technologies of 5% in 2033, according to the report.
VDMA’s research found that efforts to reduce silver consumption have proceeded faster than predicted in the 2022 ITRPV, and have now reached an average of 10mg/W. This should fall to 6.5mg over the next decade, despite the growth of n-type technologies that require more silver than PERC. “TOPCon in mass production by Tier 1 manufacturers in China is reported to be, end of 2022, on lower consumption levels 2 to 5 years ahead of our prediction,” states VDMA.
The ITRPV remains conservative about replacing silver entirely, however. It expects copper plating to be introduced in mass production during the next decade, but says this will represent only 7.5% of the market in 2033. “Technical issues related to reliability and adhesion must be resolved before alternative metallization techniques can be introduced,” VDMA states. “Appropriate equipment and processes also need to be made ready for mass production. Silver is expected to remain the most widely used front metallization material for crystalline silicon cells in the years to come.”
