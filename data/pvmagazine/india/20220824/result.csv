(NHPC) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to set up a gigawatt-scale vertically integrated polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing unit. 
“The MoU aims at leveraging the complementary strengths and capabilities of BEL and NHPC to cooperate and collaborate in conceptualization, structuring, and implementation of the gigawatt-scale vertically integrated solar manufacturing unit. [It allows] optimum utilization of resources, available assets, infrastructure and knowledge base of both the organizations [for the purpose],” stated BEL. 
BEL is India’s leading defense electronics manufacturer that has also established an infrastructure to manufacture mono-crystalline solar cells, mono-crystalline, and multi-crystalline solar modules. It has also installed solar plants across India and overseas.
NHPC, a hydropower producer, caters to clean energy development with its scope spanning concept to commissioning, operation and maintenance. In addition to hydropower, it has ventured into renewable energy projects, mainly solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, floating solar, battery energy storage systems, and hydrogen.
“The MoU is a step in creating the required infrastructure on economies of scale for indigenous manufacturing of polysilicon to solar modules to reduce dependency on imports under Make In India and Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) exploiting the favorable policies of Govt. of India and other State Governments,” stated BEL.
Solar panels manufactured from this facility will be deployed to set up the rooftop and utility-scale solar power plants to achieve India’s renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030.

As part of the collaboration, both parties will jointly assess opportunities from the technical, commercial, and safety perspectives.  
Ohmium International, through its subsidiary in India, manufactures modular interlocking PEM electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The company aims to make India a nucleus for global hydrogen-based green energy solutions with R&D centers in Silicon Valley (USA) and Bengaluru (India).
Ohmium will work with Shell to explore green hydrogen applications enabled by its electrolyzers. 
Shell aims to become a net-zero carbon business by 2050, with a target to reduce absolute emissions by 50% by 2030. It is looking at developing the most competitive solutions in the production, storage, transport, and delivery of hydrogen to end customers. The MoU with Ohmium is a step in its journey.
“We plan to develop integrated hydrogen hubs to serve the industry and heavy-duty transport to be a leading player in this space,” said Nitin Prasad, chairman, Shell Group of Companies in India.
“We would like to work with Ohmium to make this a productive collaboration which would help us make our hydrogen projects most competitive. We are keen to explore all opportunities to work with all our contract partners to continuously drive competitiveness in our projects.”

Italy’s Enel Green Power is developing the solar plant in the Bikaner District of Rajasthan.
Norfund and KLP recently signed the agreement to raise the stake in the solar project, Thar Surya 1, for around INR 2.8 billion ($35 million).
Enel Green Power won the project in July 2020 through an auction by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). It will sell the generated electricity to SECI under a 25-year PPA.
The total project cost is around $200 million. It has already secured debt financing from Beijing-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ($50 million) and International Finance Corporation ($50 million).
“When the project is up and running, it will deliver more than 750 GWh per year. Given India’s current energy sources, with a considerable proportion coming from coal, the project will avoid more than 615,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year – equivalent to the yearly emissions from 316,000 petrol cars in Norway,” stated Norfund.

The “Reveal” research project began in July, with a number of big goals. They are focusing on the further development of advanced technologies that can produce aluminum from alumina without carbon dioxide emissions. And they are working on technologies to use the metal as a medium for long-term storage of electricity as heat, which can be extracted and used to heat homes in buildings during winter months.
The EU Horizon Europe funding program and the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) are supporting the project with €3.6 million ($3.7 million). The project will run until 2026.
Reveal’s main focus is the development of technology that can store energy from PV, wind and hydropower for months or even years at low cost. Nine partners from seven different European countries are participating in the project. It builds on ideas and preliminary projects from the SPF Institute for Solar Technology at the OST. The concept is fundamentally different from traditional methods of energy storage such as batteries, hydrogen or synthetic fuels, and uses aluminum metal as a medium for energy storage.
Researchers in Iceland have already shownthat electrical energy from renewable sources can be chemically stored in aluminum without emitting greenhouse gases. The OST team was able to back this up by showing that aluminum can be used to generate heat and electrical energy with great efficiency.
Initial model calculations also showed that storing energy in this way can be significantly cheaper than, for example, with power-to-gas or synthetic fuels. The discharge of the energy stored in the aluminum leads to reaction products. These can be converted to aluminum with new energy. But ultimately, the costs and environmental impact will be decisive for the success and sustainability of the concept, according to the Eastern Swiss University of Applied Sciences.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/24/tindo-unveils-410-w-solar-panel-with-20-6-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 24, 2022",Tindo unveils 410 W solar panel with 20.6% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Tindo Solar, Australia’s only solar panel manufacturer, has released its largest residential rooftop module yet. It said that its 410 W Karra panel has now been certified for sale and STC rebates.
The 410 W Karra panel is made with 108 half-cut monocrystalline cells based on M10 wafers (182 mm). It operates with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per degree Celsius.
The new panel measures 1,731 mm x 1,149 mm x 40 mm and weighs 21.5 kg. It is built with fully tempered glass and is wrapped in a black anodized aluminium alloy frame. It comes with a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year performance guarantee. End power output is guaranteed to be no less than 80% of the nominal output power.
Tindo Chief Executive Officer Shayne Jaenisch said the 410 W Karra panel had been specifically designed to cater to an increasingly sophisticated rooftop solar market. Tindo said the first order for the panels, which are being manufactured at the company’s headquarters in Adelaide, was from a large corporate buyer.
“Five years ago, Australians wanted solar power on their roofs, and the rebates and feed-in tariffs were designed to drive installations,” he said. “Now, the market is more focused on solar PV with battery, VPPs (virtual power plants), and a power supply with the most efficient and reliable output.”
Jaenisch said the 410 W panel had been tested by TUV SUD Korea. Engineers from the certification body confirmed it produced power at about 21% module efficiency and 23.1% cell efficiency. It recorded a cell-to-module (CTM) loss ratio of just 0.07%. Tindo said the industry average energy efficiency of a solar module is between 17% and 19%, and the average CTM loss is 2% to 3%.
“We should be proud that in Australia we have the engineers and the technical skills to commercially produce one of the highest-performing solar panels in the world, right here in Adelaide,” said Jaenisch. “If Australia is going to lead the world in the energy transition, we have to develop a sovereign capability in renewables.”
Jaenisch said the company had looked to address growing demand for ethically and sustainably produced modules with the new panel coming with an end-of-life recycling guarantee.
“Australians are serious about recycling and forced labor,” he said. “We use a global assurance firm to audit our supply chains for issues such as forced labour, and we have a recycling guarantee so that decommissioned panels are recycled for industrial re-use by Reclaim PV.”
