The acquisition was done at INR 375 per equity share, aggregating to INR 690 crore (and equivalent to 9.70% post preferential share capital). Consequent to such acquisition, Reliance New Energy Solar holds 25.16% of the total paid-up equity share capital of SWREL.
Reliance New Energy Solar had recently acquired a 15.46% stake in Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy Ltd through a preferential allotment of 2,93,33,333 equity shares and thus becoming one of its promoters. The preferential allotment was priced at INR 375 per share.
Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd aspires to take the lead in enabling cost-efficient green energy by having a presence in the end-to-end PV ecosystem from vertically integrated solar component manufacturing to project development. Towards meeting that objective, last year, the company agreed to acquire a 40% stake in Sterling and Wilson Solar Ltd, a leading Indian multinational solar EPC contractor, through a combination of preferential allotment, share sale by the Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited (one of the current promoters of Sterling and Wilson Solar), and an open offer.
The agreement included a preferential allotment of 2.93 crore equity shares (equivalent to 15.46% post preferential share capital) for INR 375.00 per share, aggregating to INR 1,098.75 crore. It also included the acquisition of 1.84 crore equity shares from Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited (equivalent to 9.70% post preferential share capital) at a price of INR 375.0 per share, aggregating to INR 690 crore. Further, Reliance New Energy Solar will make a public announcement to the public shareholders of SWSL to acquire up to 4.91 crore equity shares of SWSL, representing 25.9%.

The Scheme is intended to add approximately 10,750 circuit kilometres (ckm) of transmission lines and approx. 27,500 mega volt-amperes (MVA) transformation capacity of substations with central financial support.
The transmission infrastructure created under the scheme will facilitate grid integration and power evacuation of approximately 20 GW of renewable energy (RE) power projects in seven States. The beneficiary States include Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.
The transmission system is targeted to be set up with a total estimated cost of INR 12,031.33 crore (US$1.6 billion) and central financial assistance (CFA) at 33% of the project cost, i.e., INR 3,970.34 crore (US$534 million).  The CFA will help in offsetting the intra-state transmission charges and thus keep the power costs down, ultimately benefiting the end users.
The transmission system will be created over a period of five year from financial year 2021-22 to 2025-26, helping the nation to achieve the target of 450 GW installed RE capacity by 2030.
This scheme is in addition to GEC Phase-I, which is already under implementation in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu for grid integration and power evacuation of approx. 24 GW of RE power and is expected to be completed by 2022. The scheme provides for addition of 9,700 ckm of transmission lines and 22,600 MVA capacity of substations with an estimated cost of INR 10,141.68 crore ((US$1.36 billion) for transmission projects with CFA of INR 4,056.67 crore (US$546 million).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/07/electrolyzer-tech-to-produce-hydrogen-from-seawater/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 7, 2022",Electrolyzer tech to produce hydrogen from seawater,"From pv magazine International
German automotive supplier Schaeffler is currently working with partners from the Netherlands to extract hydrogen from seawater in a pilot project. With demand for car components expected to decrease as a result of the transition to electromobility, the supplier is planning to expand its activities in the field of hydrogen which, according to Schaeffler, should also be supplied to the automotive industry.
The idea of producing green hydrogen at sea, from large amounts of offshore wind energy is widespread. However, this type of hydrogen production faces the major challenge electrolyzers require ultrapure water. That means seawater must first be desalinated and then painstakingly cleaned and filtered before it can flow to the sensitive membranes, and is a process that is driving up the cost of green hydrogen.
Schaeffler has set up start-up Hydron B.V. in the Netherlands to develop polymer electrolysis membrane (PEM) systems. To clean seawater before it reaches the membranes, the engineers have implemented a solution in which waste heat from the electrolysis process can be used to distill the salt water. The consortium says it has proven the functionality of its membrane distillation technology and the system was able to generate a kilogram of hydrogen per hour, with the membrane distillation making 10kg of ultra-pure water (UPW) available for electrolysis.
“The generation of green hydrogen from wind energy is an important growth area for Schaeffler,” said Bernd Hetterscheidt, head of the hydrogen strategic business area for the company. “In cooperation with our partners in the wind power industry, we want to become one of the leading providers of system components in this area. To do this, we combine the innovative technology of Hydron with the strengths of Schaeffler, such as our system understanding and our knowhow in the rapid scaling of products and projects in order to bring them onto the market as quickly as possible.”
Looking forward, Schaeffler wants to push ahead with scaling of the filters and desalination components for use on an industrial scale. In addition, the cost and resistance of the system will have to be improved. The aim is to reduce green hydrogen production costs from the current €4-10/kg to €2. Water treatment is of key importance to reduce the price of electrolysis and significant efficiency advantages could easily be converted into cost savings. Companies from the chemical industry, such as Canada’s HPQ Silicon Resources, and rail sector businesses including Alstom have also formed consortia in a bid to be part of the race for cheap green hydrogen from seawater and wind energy.
