This move is in line with Decathlon’s global commitment to switch over to 100% RE across all its logistics and commercial facilities by 2026, it said. 
As per the three-year deal, Fourth Partner Energy will execute rooftop solar projects at the sites of Decathlon’s premium suppliers in Bangladesh. It will target 15 MW across 12-15 facilities by December 2023 in Phase 1. 
Sajid Syed, Head of International Business at Fourth Partner Energy, said, “In addition to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, switching to solar will reduce the electricity costs of Decathlon’s supplier network by 20-40% per unit.”
Fourth Partner Energy is targeting an operational portfolio of 150 MW in Bangladesh. “This country has tremendous potential for renewables, with a government-mandated 40 GW solar energy target by 2041. Fourth Partner Energy is keen on leveraging this opportunity,” said Syed.
In Bangladesh, Fourth Partner Energy has executed solar plants for SAN Apparels, Metro Knitting and Dyeing Mills, PANAM Group, and Denim Asia amongst others. The company has an operational portfolio of 950 MW of wind and solar assets across India and Southeast Asia.

The presented their findings in “Recent advances in synchronization techniques for grid-tied PV system: A review,” which was recently published in Energy Reports. They described all synchronization techniques for installations with single-phase or three-phase inverters. They also provided a framework of all grid-tied architectures and topologies for PV systems.
“This paper helps to provide a basic conceptual framework to develop a superior grid-tied system,” they said. “Synchronization is a crucial problem in grid-tied inverters operation and control research indicates that frequency, phase, and amplitude of voltage are the most crucial parameters that need to be measured and controlled for grid-tied application.”
They noted open loop and closed loop techniques. Open loop techniques can directly detect input signals parameters, while closed loop techniques can reportedly reduce phase errors.
“In closed loop system estimated value of phase is updated adjusting through a feedback loop mechanism. This loop locks the estimated value of signal to its actual value,” they said. “Closed loop techniques are a better as compared to open loop method.”
In closed loop systems, the phase locked loop (PLL) technique as a popular way to create reference current. A PLL is a system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to its input. It is commonly used to modulate, demodulate, filter or recover a signal from noisy communications channels.
“PLL is a non-linear feedback control system that freezes its output signal to input signal keeping constant minimum phase error(s). The block diagram of PLL consists of phase-detector (PD), a loop-filter (LF) and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO),” the scientists said. “There are some new techniques reviewed in the literature found to have better performance than conventional PLL, yet PLL is widely accepted for its robustness and simplicity.”
The academics concluded by saying that the right choice between all existing PLLs and synchronization algorithms could be difficult. They said more attention should be paid to converter topologies and technologies.
“Equivalently, utilizing artificial intelligence methods in hybrid with the conventional techniques can achieve more popularity and achievements in future research,” they said. “More attention should be given for robust grid interconnection during weak grid conditions.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/21/pcm-based-thermal-battery-to-store-solar-power-via-heat-pump/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 21, 2022",PCM-based thermal battery to store solar power via heat pump,"From pv magazine Global
SINTEF, an independent research organization in Norway, has developed batteries based on PCM, which are able to store wind and solar power in the form of heat via a heat pump.
PCM can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
“The heat battery can use any heat source as long as a fluid carries the heat to/from the heat battery,” researcher Alexis Sevault told pv magazine. “For example, district heating is also coupled to our demo unit, for more flexibility in winter. In that case, water is the heat transfer fluid, since it is very well suited for most buildings. Our technology can also be used in industrial processes, using pressure heat transfer fluid, for example, pressurized CO2 for refrigerated or freezing industrial processes.”
The scientists embedded what they described as a “bio-battery” in a silver-colored container that hosts 3 tons of a type of PCM – a liquid biowax based on vegetable oil. It is reportedly able to melt at body temperature and becomes a solid, crystalline material when it becomes “cold” below 37 C.
The heat storage system also contains a heat exchanger for heat extraction.
“This is achieved with the help of 24 so-called cushion plates that release heat to the process water which serves as an energy carrier that removes the heat from the storage system,” the scientists explained. “Together, the PCM and the plates enable the heat bank to be both compact and efficient.”
The PCM absorb large amounts of heat by changing its physical state from solid to liquid, and then releases it when the material hardens. The battery is then able to heat cold water and release it toward a building’s radiators and ventilation systems, thus supplying heated air.
“The PCM-based heat storage system is delivering exactly the performance we expected,” Sevault said, noting that his team tested the device for more than a year at the ZEB laboratory operated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). “We’re utilizing as much as possible of the building’s self-produced solar energy. We’re also finding that the system is very well suited to so-called peak shaving.”
According to the group’s analysis, charging the bio-battery before the coldest parts of the day may help significantly reduce power consumption from the grid while taking advantage of fluctuations in the spot price.
“The system is thus much less sophisticated than a traditional battery – but it isn’t suitable for all buildings. As a new technology, investment costs remain high,” the group said.
According to Sevault, the proposed storage technology is much simpler than conventional batteries, as it does not require any rare materials, with a long expected lifetime and little need for maintenance.
“That being said, the specific cost in euros per kilowatt-hour is already comparable or lower than regular batteries, without being mass-produced yet,” he stated, without providing further details.
Other researchers at SINTEF recently developed a high-temperature industrial heat pump than can work with pure water as its work medium, and reportedly reach a temperature of up to 180 C. The machine, which the research group describes as the “world’s hottest heat pump,” can be used with different industrial processes that rely on steam as an energy carrier and can reduce a facility’s energy consumption by between 40% and 70%, as it enables the recovery of low-temperature waste heat, according to its creators.
