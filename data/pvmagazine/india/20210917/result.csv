Lowering the restrictions on open access from 1 MW to 100 KW will immensely benefit a substantial proportion of the consumers of our country. In our fight against climate change, this policy will generate increased awareness and focus on renewable energy, waste-to-energy, and green hydrogen. I salute your dynamic proposal.
In my opinion, there are certain finer points in the Draft Electricity Rules, 2021, which need to be reviewed and adjusted to achieve an unbiased and free green open access in our country.
The draft rules are a step forward in creating uniformity of green energy open access charges in the country. The removal of an additional surcharge for green energy open access is a much-needed relief to the sector. However, the current drafts do not ensure complete uniformity of the charges to be levied across states.
A. Cross Subsidy Surcharge
The cross-subsidy surcharge was introduced to compensate DISCOMs for their obligations on providing subsidized electricity to marginal sections of our society. However, electricity is constantly used as a tool during elections that eventually leads to a rise in this surcharge over time. With DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer), electricity can be sold as per the market rates and the subsidized sections can pay for it from the transfers they receive from the state governments. This would largely eliminate the need for cross-subsidy. That being said, I understand it is outside the scope of this proposed draft. Hence, I recommend the following, 
B. Banking Charges 
The uniform Banking policy stated in the draft, with the proposed cap of 10%, is a step forward, as it creates a simple and easier framework for the developers. However, the banking charges are still categorized under the jurisdiction of states. It negates the purpose of standardization of cross-subsidy charges and the removal of any additional surcharges. If we are looking at centralizing the process, should it not be part of the central forum of regulators jurisdiction?
Additionally, I suggest that the banking cap should be increased to 20%, as the current 10% cap puts wind developers at a disadvantage when compared to solar developers. 
The draft rules have mentioned the creation of a forum of regulators, with respect to the common application format, that will be adopted by the respective state commissions. However, there are other formalities apart from the application form that needs to be completed on the consumer and generator sides. The process involves approvals from the state DISCOMs, transmission utilities, SLDCs, and other statutory bodies. Hence, I suggest that the forum of regulators should also work on standardization of the entire process for such approvals, in addition to the application form, and do so at the national level.
The proposed draft requires the creation of an online portal that will process green energy open access applications. I would suggest that the same portal should be used to grant approvals from respective state bodies, as specified in Point 1. This will enable a single-window clearance for all applications pertaining to green energy open access. Even if the application is rejected or if due to some reason not taken forward, the reason for the rejection should be clearly stated in writing as provided for in the current draft.
The proposed draft provides for the open-access application to be approved within 15 days or be considered “deemed approved subject to the fulfillment of the technical requirement specified by the 
Appropriate commission”. This technical requirement creates a back-door entry for delayed approvals. Hence, I suggest such (technical) requirements should be clearly specified – either within this draft or in the draft for green energy open access – by the appropriate commission. 
For green hydrogen and waste-to-energy, the guidelines mentioned are forward-looking and set the requisite prelude to what is needed for their growth. Given our ambitious targets and urgent need for energy transition, both sources are extremely critical for the sustainability of our environment. I hope these guidelines are the first step (of the many to come) and should be considered as a base for proper policies, that we are in dire need of. 
‘Green Hydrogen’ and ‘Waste-to-energy’ both need respective policies that list the crucial elements that are missing currently. These policies would need to formally state the rules and regulations to create demand and supply for such sources of energy. Only then can we expect them to become large-scale contributors towards energy transition in the country.
This draft is not without its positives and I would like to thank you for bringing in aspects that will benefit multiple segments of the industry. The proposed policy makes it easier for developers to work on projects across states. I can also foresee it creating a shift from government reliant organizations to a more self-sustaining model driven by market forces. 
Given that there is no option to reject ‘behind the meter’ projects in the draft, it will also provide a much-needed recognition of such systems across states and further boost the adoption of rooftop solar. In turn, this will have a marked impact on consumer sentiments, wherein they will have more available options, to help them convert to renewable energy for their power needs. 
Post receipt of views or suggestions from all the stakeholders and ironing out the minor crinkles that exist in the current proposed draft policy, I believe that the draft policy has the potential to act as a game-changer for the renewable energy industry. I would urge the government to relook at certain elements and consider creating a council or forum of regulators, that are centrally regulated for green energy open access projects and charges. Given the global urgency for energy transition, it is important to further the narrative on the widespread adoption of renewable energy in the country and I believe we are one step away from the same!

A new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) charts Orsted’s energy transition journey and provides key insights for India’s massive transformation to its energy sector. 
“During Orsted’s transition journey of more than a decade, it has created immense shareholder wealth, as its market capitalization zoomed by 314% since its listing in 2016,” says the report’s author, IEEFA energy finance analyst, Shantanu Srivastava. 
“This feat can be attributed to its successfully planned transition strategy, along with transparent sustainability-related disclosures. This is an example where an enterprise has been able to fulfill its goal of dramatic shareholder wealth creation while radically transforming its business model, something which many energy companies around the world are trying to emulate.”
The Indian government has set a huge target of having 450 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable energy capacity by the end of this decade. 
“The Indian public utility sector, along with its private counterparts, will have a huge role to play in realizing this massive goal,” says Srivastava. 
“Major utilities such as NTPC Limited and Tata Power have already committed to a green transition, evident in their capital expenditure plans and strategic roadmaps. Pure-play renewable energy companies like Adani Green Energy Limited and ReNew Power present examples of the private sector realizing the potential of this sector and its ability to create enormous returns for its shareholders.
“Into the future, the ability of Indian companies to walk the talk and undertake a profitable transition or growth journey will be paramount to attract capital and grow shareholder wealth.” 
Orsted, which has already championed the green energy transition journey, provides valuable lessons for Indian companies, which may face several of the same challenges and opportunities.  
The report stated Orsted’s journey to becoming one of the leading renewable companies in the world can be attributed to both internal and external factors. Internally, the company’s leadership made sound strategic decisions throughout its transition journey. Externally, the favorable new industry development and subsidy regime in Europe, coupled with a bullish environment for renewables worldwide, provided external tailwinds. 
The five major internal strategic decisions included: 
1. Committing to energy transition through long-term strategy realignment. Orsted set tangible long-term goals for itself when it came to the addition of renewable energy and phasing out thermal power.
2. Using non-conventional sources of funding through the “farm down” model, divestment of non-core assets and hybrid capital. The company’s funding strategy for its offshore wind projects relied on recycled capital from de-risked operational wind assets, proceeds through the sale of non-core assets which did not fit in the long-term strategy of the company, and using hybrid capital. The limited use of debt gave the company financial flexibility and confidence to handle the operational risks of expanding rapidly into a new field.
3. Gradual de-risking and restructuring of legacy businesses. A major component of the growth strategy was to restructure legacy businesses to support the growth of the offshore wind business. Cash flows from these legacy businesses were used to fund wind farm constructions, and simultaneously de-risked by adding value-added services and operational efficiencies.
4. Using economies of scale to establish cost leadership. Orsted was an early mover in the offshore wind industry. Since its inception, it has made several advancements in establishing technological prowess across the value chain through partnerships and strategic investments. Investments in the offshore wind were made at a size sufficient to capitalize on economies of scale. Having a presence across development, construction, and operation stages gave the company full control over the project’s entire life cycle.
5. Focus on sustainability-related disclosures. The company was a frontrunner in sustainability-related disclosures. Though Danish law mandated corporate sustainability disclosures since 2009, the company was already a member of the UN Global Compact from 2006. Orsted also disclosed its environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance since 2017. A good ESG score coupled with a consistent history of non-financial disclosures helped the company stay on its energy transition track and attract global capital, as witnessed in its sustained share price performance over the years.
