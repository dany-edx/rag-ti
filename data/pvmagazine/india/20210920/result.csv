https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/20/residential-rooftop-solar-in-india/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021",Residential rooftop solar in India,"pv magazine: Why has residential rooftop solar not taken off in a big way in India?
Mayur Misra: There are a multitude of reasons why rooftop solar for the residential sector hasn’t picked up the way it should have ideally. The first being inconsistent subsidy policies over the years for different states. Secondly, as per consumers, DISCOM moves slowly with the Net Metering process. Thirdly, there is still not a smooth financing process for consumers to get the funds arranged for the plant which further discourages the adoption of solar power as not everyone can afford an upfront cost. Another major reason for slow growth in the residential sector is the lack of awareness about the functioning of these plants, costs involved, return on investment (ROI), and more. Furthermore, non-promotion of success also hinders growth, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. 
In metro cities, smaller rooftops or shared rooftops as in residential buildings are a challenge? How can this challenge be overcome?
The wattage capacity of modules has improved significantly over the years. While 375Wp was the largest capacity of modules until 2019, one can get 550Wp modules in the market currently.
EPC companies with an advanced engineering and designing team can work out a raised structure to get away with the shadow issues. These structures also create an opportunity for owners to use the area underneath. In the future, modules shall also be prominent in the façade of the buildings.
What’s been the trend in component selection for residential rooftop solar? 
Residential owners are now giving preference to monocrystalline modules for better generation and efficiency. They are willing to spend an extra 5-10% for a better generation, which was not very common two years ago.
Technology has significantly advanced over the last two years. Modules with wattage as high as 550Wp are available in the market now and people are preferring them considering they need less area for installation. Furthermore, there has been a flurry of inverter brands entering the domestic market. Brands like Sungrow, Hitachi, and Polycab have gained popularity over the last two years, while Delta and ABB continue to have a good market share.
Solar plus battery is a go-to solution for consumers who face a lot of power cut-offs. This ensures battery backup in case there is no power in the grid. This mode is increasingly being adopted in Tier 2 and 3 cities, specifically by commercial and industrial consumers. However, in such an arrangement battery investment will be recurring. So, it is better to go ahead with Lithium-ion batteries over lead-acid ones as lithium-ion batteries have a longer life and are built on better technology.
Solar roofs or solar modules mounted on roofs, how to make the choice?
Solar modules mounted on roofs allow the owner to utilize their existing roof. A solar roof is currently an expensive option as it requires more components, but it can be chosen by premium customers who intend to set up a new roof exclusively for installation or must invest in a raised structure for installation.
What are the financing options available for residential rooftop solar? 
Solar financing is still a very complicated procedure in India and isn’t very widely available. Barring a few nationalized banks, no other banks have a dedicated vertical for the solar plant. Often, private banks in the country overlook the ROI aspect of the plant and assess the asset purely based on the creditworthiness of the client. 
Net metering policies vary from State to State. What are your views?
While in Haryana net metering facility can be availed by both residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) consumers, it is only valid for residential consumers in Uttar Pradesh. With net metering, the average ROI is between three to four years for consumers. Without net metering, it increases to around five years. 
As an established EPC company, we believe that the government should make one central net metering scheme to govern installations across the country. This will also help in post-installation analytics and data management for the government.

The Philippines has conducted the opening of applications for renewable energy projects under the third Open and Competitive Selection Process (OCSP3) which allows for 100 percent foreign participation in large-scale geothermal exploration, development, and utilization projects.
Indonesia plans to increase the portion of new and renewable energy (EBT)-based power plants from 30 percent to 48 percent or 19,899 megawatts (MW), according to the draft electric power supply business plan (RUPTL) of the state electricity company (PLN) for 2021-2030.
Singapore has deployed its first utility-scale Energy Storage System (ESS), with a capacity of 2.4 MW/2.4 megawatt-hours (MWh), at a substation. The ESS will participate in the wholesale electricity market to provide services necessary to mitigate intermittency caused by solar, as well as reduce peak demand. 
According to Black & Veatch’s Strategic Directions: Electric Industry Asia 2021 report, the most significant investment growth in new capacity over the next three to five years is expected in renewable energy. Solar (land), energy storage, solar (floating), wind (offshore), and microgrids represent the top five categories.
The report points to a need to balance affordability and pressure to decarbonize power generation while integrating reliable and resilient systems to cope with natural disasters, extreme weather events, and the intermittency of renewable energy. 
Underinvestment in more reliable transmission networks was identified as one of the key threats to reliable grid operations and performance across Asian electricity markets (see the figure below). 

                    
The industry expects more near-term investments reprioritized to existing assets compared to new builds or even investment deferment.
The pandemic could serve as an important inflection point that spurs greater digitization, remote diagnostics and monitoring, and more efficient asset management practices as a whole.
To accommodate new capacity from renewable energy, the region will need more integrated power solutions. 
From a power transmission perspective, one viable solution will be to deploy advanced system control devices, such as Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS), which can enable re-routing of power flow from congested parts of the grid to less congested portions. In addition, transmission technologies with greater situational awareness of local weather conditions, such as Dynamic Line Ratings, can provide near real-time updates on the available capacity of critical bulk power pathways. Advanced transmission line designs, such as Breakthrough Overhead Line Design ® (BOLD), can also promote efficient interconnection.
Multiple moving parts in a regional energy transition will increase grid management complexities. Hence, adopting digital transformation strategies that address core challenges of grid stabilization, peak load management, system flexibility and reliability in a holistic manner will be critical to balance changing consumer expectations, unpredictable load patterns, and increasing use of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Common examples of DERs include rooftop solar installations and energy storage systems. The progress of Southeast Asia’s energy transition will be influenced by the speed and scale of digitalization.
Digital applications can optimize the impact of individual technologies to enhance grid performance. For example, with wind and sunlight as variable factors affecting power generation production, sensors and smart grids help operators ensure renewable energy plants perform to their optimal potential.
Operationally, the development and adoption of predictive asset maintenance systems promise the monitoring of equipment performance in real-time, enabling better forecasting and optimization of maintenance schedules. Achieving such advances will help mitigate costly outages and other equipment failures across entire systems and extend the equipment lifecycles. Further still, the development of prescriptive analytics will enable autonomous management, where machines act on the information the artificial intelligence (AI) has extracted, offering even further operational savings long term.
Such plant-focused digitalization rolls up to asset performance management (APM) solutions in which the health, performance and optimization of multiple generation, transmission or distribution assets can be managed. The APM approach will minimize failures and improve the operational efficiency of power facilities, ultimately reducing the cost of energy production over time.
Digitization will also enable the holistic management of DERs across different capacities and installations.
Digitalization can also benefit project bankability. Digitizing power assets will make it easier for investors to assess the planning, returns, and risk allocation of projects. Data analytics across complex grids will provide insights that will help investors visualize risks, such as grid stabilization, peak load management, resiliency, and reliability, across many inter-dependent factors that determine financial success. Digitizing power systems will support investments in decarbonized grids and enable a more efficient and flexible grid operation. This will, in turn, reduce the cost to investors, operators, and ultimately consumers.
To achieve its sustainability targets, Southeast Asia will require integrated strategy and execution across generation, transmission and distribution, as well as planning that balances both capital and operational expenditures. 
The regional power industry will need partners who can merge data analytics with engineering expertise to deliver timely and actionable insights that realize the full potential of assets and facilities. The partners will need to be familiar with every aspect of the lifecycle of generation, transmission and distribution assets. They will also need to be experts in integrating these assets to create a stable, efficiently functioning whole. Partners who offer holistic infrastructure consulting capabilities will be able to advise how a change in one piece of the business can impact assets, costs, technologies, the workforce, and customers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/20/how-long-do-residential-solar-inverters-last/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2021",How long do residential solar inverters last?,"From pv magazine International
In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed  the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we examine residential solar inverters in their various forms, and look at their resiliency and how long they last.
The inverter, a device that converts the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, can come in a few different configurations. 
The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters. In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE), or DC optimizers. Microinverters and DC optimizers are generally used for rooftops with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientations (not facing south).
The technology ensures that each panel produces its max capability in real time and isn’t limited to the weakest link in the chain, or “string.” String inverters are subject to the “Christmas light” effect, where if one panel is not performing or is shaded, the rest of the panels connected in series will be limited to that panel’s production level.
Some string inverters are equipped with a bypass diode, a technology that prevents the “Christmas light” effect from taking place altogether, shown here by Fronius.
In applications where the roof has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little or no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
In a string inverter, there are fewer moving parts to break down, less complicated wiring, and a centralized location for easy repairs for solar technicians.  Typically they are less expensive, said Solar Reviews. It said that inverters can typically cost 10% to 20% of the total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
How long do they last? 
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly aging components. A common source of failure in inverters is wear and weathering on the condensers in the inverter. The electrolyte condensers have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralized residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life. String inverters  generally have standard warranties ranging from five to 10 years, and many have the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring throughout the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.

Microinverters have a longer life. EnergySage said they can often last 25 years – nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Usually, these inverters have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfill its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimizers, which are typically paired with a centralized string inverter. These components last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.
A study by kWh Analytics showed that 80% of solar array failures occur at the inverter level. There are numerous causes of this.
According to Fallon Solutions, one cause is grid faults. High or low voltage due to grid fault can cause the inverter to stop working, and circuit breakers or fuses can be activated to protect the inverter from high-voltage failure.
Sometimes failure can occur at the MLPE level, where the components of power optimizers are exposed to higher temperatures on the roof. If reduced production is being experienced, it could be a fault in the MLPE.
Installation must be done properly as well. As a rule of thumb, Fallon recommended that the solar panel capacity should be up to 133% of the inverter capacity. If the panels are not properly matched to a right-size inverter, they will not perform efficiently.
Maintenance matters
To keep an inverter running more efficiently for a longer period, Those Solar Guys recommend choosing a cool, dry place with lots of circulating fresh air. It also suggested avoiding installing in areas with direct sunlight, though specific brands of outdoor inverters are designed to withstand more sunlight than others. And, in multi-inverter installations, it is important to be sure there is proper clearance between each inverter, so that there isn’t heat transfer between inverters.
Those Solar Guys said it is best practice to inspect the outside of the inverter (if it is accessible) quarterly, making sure there are no physical signs of damage, and all vents and cooling fins are free from dirt and dust.
It is also recommended to schedule an inspection through a licensed solar installer every five years. These standups typically cost $200 to $300, though some solar contracts have free maintenance and monitoring for 20 to 25 years. During the checkup, the inspector should check inside the inverter for signs of corrosion, damage, or pests.
In the next installment of the series, pv magazine will examine the life of residential battery energy storage applications.
