In 2005, the National Electricity Policy (NEP) noted that about 44% of households in the country did not have access to electricity. In less than two decades, India accomplished the remarkable feat of electrifying every village and went from being a power-deficit to a power-surplus nation. 
But the stellar growth has brought a new set of challenges that signals the transition of the country’s power sector to a new paradigm focusing on decarbonization, renewable energy integration, and increasing quality of access. The recently announced draft NEP 2021 has been an acknowledgment of this shifting paradigm.
The country’s success in capacity expansion and renewable energy deployment is increasingly challenging the role of coal, which still accounts for approximately 70% of generation. As renewable energy capacity grows, the growing underutilization of coal pushes it towards becoming a stranded asset.
In this context, the draft NEP emphasizes demand forecasting and integrated planning for ensuring optimal asset utilization. It also stresses the role of short- and medium-term power markets for optimized power procurement. The NEP hints at introducing capacity markets and auctions to replace the traditional long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). 
Growing renewable energy generation also merits the need for power balancing and grid stability. The draft NEP lays out pathways for expanding balancing areas, coupling renewable energy with the conventional generation or storage systems, mandating renewable energy forecasting, enabling demand response, and introducing an ancillary services market. 
On this front, the NEP prescribes that the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) introduce regulations for enabling ancillary services and demand response. This has been put into effect by the recent introduction of the draft ancillary market regulations by CERC. 
The NEP also highlights the need for a new balancing capacity in the form of pumped hydro storage, gas plants, and energy storage. Pilots and demonstration projects are also encouraged in many of these areas. 
Given the geographical variability, the NEP recommends leveraging the transmission system to facilitate grid balancing for transferring power from regions with high generation to areas with high demand. 
The NEP also proposes a cost-sharing mechanism either nationwide or between states reaping the benefits of renewable energy generation to tackle the variability challenges faced by renewable energy-rich states. This mechanism can drive the proliferation of low-cost renewable energy adoption across states even where renewable energy potential is limited.
Highlighting the success of 100% village electrification the past decade, the NEP has focused on the need for distribution companies (DISCOMs) to improve the quality of electricity access. Central to this will be better load management, new distribution models, and automation and mainstreaming of climate resilience. 
To this end, the NEP emphasizes feeder segregation and solarization of agricultural pumps (via PM KUSUM) in rural areas. For larger urban areas, it prescribes implementing a ring main system that enables an alternate route for electricity supply to consumers in case one of the feeders faces any failure or interruption. 
The NEP also proposes a new distribution system operator to assist DISCOMs with load management, management of solar photovoltaic systems, improving power quality, and improving customer billing and collection using Distribution SCADA. 
While the emphasis on resilience leaves room for improvement, the NEP, nonetheless, recommends that DISCOMs explore the possibility of integrating renewable energy-based microgrids with the capability of automatic islanding.
With the draft NEP 2021, India provides the right policy direction for this decade of the energy transition. Yet, there is room for further improvement. 
First, it is critical to have correct economic signaling that can support the transition. Beyond introducing appropriate market mechanisms, this includes aspects like wide adoption of time-of-use tariffs and introduction of carbon pricing, reduction and streamlining of subsidy and cross-subsidy, and enabling and valuing services that various assets such as storage and smart meters can provide. Further, as many think tanks have commented, there needs to be a movement from normative cost-of-service regulation to performance-based regulation.
Second, targets and obligations need to meet compliance. This holds particularly true for aspects like renewable purchase obligations (RPOs). States should be allowed to propose a bundled RPO that is in line with integrated planning studies they undertake. 
Similarly, the solarization of agricultural pumps needs a targeted approach reinforced by ways to measure and encourage compliance. New avenues of flexibility such as storage and demand response could also use a target-setting approach going forward.
Lastly, the NEP leaves the door open for the deployment of efficient coal-based power stations. But a growing number of states like the large states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra are discontinuing the buildout of new coal plants. 
The CEA in 2018 also showed that India does not need additional coal capacity until 2027 if existing capacity targets are met. With renewable energy and energy storage costs continuing to challenge coal, any proposed new coal capacity should be assessed against the price of alternatives. The real emphasis must be on ensuring a just transition away from coal. 
The draft NEP is an important step in the right direction. But ultimately, the success will primarily depend on building consensus among the various states and their ability to enforce these initiatives in a time-bound manner.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/16/flexible-perovskite-solar-cell-with-21-0-efficiency-high-durability/,"HIGHLIGHTS,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 16, 2021","Flexible perovskite solar cell with 21.0% efficiency, high durability","From pv magazine International
An international group of researchers has developed a flexible thin-film perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of 21.0%.
The perovskite layer for the cell, which has an “n-i-p” layout, was fabricated with a metal-halide capping layer placed on top of a three-dimensional metal-halide perovskite film. This design provide hermetically sealed encapsulation, which is traditionally difficult in flexible perovskite cells, and also enhances the photocarrier properties at the interface between the perovskite film and the hole transport layer (HTL).
“This low-dimensional (LD) MHP capping layer not only reduces the propensity for fracture in bending but also provides protection against ingression of environmental species,” they explained in “Flexible perovskite solar cells with simultaneously improved efficiency, operational stability, and mechanical reliability,” which was recently published in Joule.
The MHP precursor was deposited through spin-coating on substrates made of fluorinated tin-oxide (FTO) and glass, followed by thermal annealing at 100 C. The perovskite layer was then sandwiched between a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) and an HTL made of Spiro-OMeTAD. Indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold (Au) were used as conducting electrodes on either side of the cell.
The device showed a short-circuit current density of 23.5 mA.cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.15 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.779, and a power conversion efficiency of 21.0%. The academics described these results as unprecedented. A cell with the same architecture but without the LD MHP capping exhibited an efficiency of 18.4%. The cell with LD MHP capping also showed a degradation to only 90% of the initial efficiency after 800 hours, while the device without capping degraded to 79% after 475 hours.
The researchers also analyzed the solar cell through cyclic bend testing and found that LD/3D MHP thin films have “unprecedented” bending durability, as the cells can retain 81% of their initial efficiency after 20,000 cycles. This value for the cells without the capping layer was just 54%.
“This resistance to cracking in LD/3D MHP thin films has cascading beneficial effects,” the researchers said. “First, the LD MHP capping layer, in addition to protecting the underlying 3D MHP thin film from environmental degradation, reduces cracking in the 3D MHP thin film, which further prevents environmental attack.”
The research group included scientists from Brown University in the United States and École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, as well as the Dalian University of Technology and Shaanxi Normal University in China.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/16/hardening-of-module-prices-to-moderate-solar-project-returns/,"COVID-19,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 16, 2021",Module price increases to moderate solar project returns ,"The increase in imported solar module prices is likely to impact the returns of solar power project developers. Module prices have increased by about 15-20% over the last 4-5 months to around 22-23 cents/watt as of date. This price rise has been mainly driven by a sharp increase in the price of polysilicon, a key input for cell and module manufacturers. 
As per an ICRA note, such hardening in the price of PV modules, if sustained, remains a near-term headwind as a majority of solar power installations in India are dependent on PV module imports. This risk is especially significant for about 4 GW capacity won by developers through the bidding route over the last six to nine months at tariffs ranging largely between INR 2.00/kWh (US$ 0.027/kWh) and 2.25/kWh (US$ 0.031/kWh) and is scheduled to be commissioned over the next 12-15-month period. This apart, the recent surge in metal prices is also leading to upward pressure on the overall capital cost for solar power projects. 
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head-Corporate ratings, ICRA, expects a 12-14 basis point impact on the debt service coverage metrics for the project developers. 
“Given that the PV module component comprises about 50-55% of the overall project cost, such increase in the module price level by about 4-5 cents/watt if sustained, is likely to moderate the debt service coverage metrics for the project developers by about 12-14 basis points,” he said. 
Kadam sees bidding tariff increase by about 55-60 paise/unit in upcoming auctions as developers try to offset the impact of the module price rise due to shortage of raw material supply and the basic customs duty. 
“The tariff increase required to offset such a module price increase is estimated at about 20-22 paise/unit. This, along with the impact of the basic customs duty (BCD) on imported PV modules, is likely to result in the overall bid tariff to increase by about 55-60 paise/unit for the forthcoming auctions.”
Nonetheless, he expects the solar bid tariff to remain below INR 3/unit even after factoring in this dual impact.
The BCD notification for cells and modules is effective from April 2022 onwards. This fuels the possibility of a surge in module imports, particularly in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal, and, in turn, supporting the elevated price levels for PV modules.
In this context, both the module price behavior and honoring of supply contracts by module OEMs from China in the near term continue to remain key monitorable for the solar power developers, stated ICRA. 
As per a notification issued by India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the solar projects bid out under the standard-bidding guidelines, post April 10, 2021, are required to procure modules from the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) issued by the ministry. 
However, the registration of module manufacturers outside India has remained affected due to the lockdown restrictions and procedural requirements so far, as evident from the ALMM list issued in March 2021. 
This, in turn, may pose near-term challenges to the Indian developers in the procurement of imported PV modules, especially given the capacity constraints for domestic manufacturers. 
Vikram V, vice president and sector head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA, added, “The uncertainty on the timelines for inclusion of module suppliers from China in the ALMM list may affect the incremental bidding activity in the solar power sector. Nonetheless, cumulative solar project awards as of date remain strong at around 28 GW (excluding the capacity pending for signing of power sale agreements/power purchase agreements and including hybrid projects), which provides healthy visibility on the capacity addition over the medium term.”
