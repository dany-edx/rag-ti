Solar wafer prices plummeted to their lowest values ever when trading resumed after China’s Golden Week, according to OPIS data. Extending their downtrend from before the holiday, Mono M10 wafers plunged a substantial 10.29% to $0.34/pc and Mono G12 wafers fell a similar 7.33% to $0.468/pc.
The main factors behind wafer price reductions are the decline in downstream demand and the accumulation of wafer inventories brought on by the high operating rate of wafer producers, concurred numerous sources.

Based on the production schedules of wafer manufacturers, a market observer estimates that China’s wafer production output would be around 65 GW in October. This would indicate an increase of around 8% in comparison to the 60–61 GW of wafers produced in September, according to data from the Silicon Industry of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
Approximately 2.4 billion pieces of wafers, or around 20 GW, are presently in stock on the wafer market, according to a source from a major vertically-integrated player. This figure will likely keep increasing soon due to the high operating rates of wafer factories, the source added.
Based on polysilicon’s current pricing, the cash cost for producing Mono M10 wafers at Tier-1 facilities is approximately CNY2.5 ($0.34)/pc, which means that there is still some room for Mono M10 wafers prices – currently average market price of approximately CNY2.78/pc – to fall further, according to a source from the polysilicon segment.
The sales of wafers has also been hampered by downstream manufacturers’ reduced production and wait-and-see attitude, OPIS learnt during its weekly market survey. This week also marks the lowest price ever for solar cells, with Mono M10 and G12 cells falling by 8.35% and 2.39%, respectively, to $0.0746/W and $0.0816/W.
According to another market watcher, cell manufacturers currently have no incentive to maintain high operating rates given their low profit margins, resulting in a decrease in wafer demand. This source therefore anticipates that wafer producers may be forced to reduce their prices on a weekly basis due to the steadily declining demand.
“Wafer producers cut production when wafer prices fall to the point when there is no more room for price reduction,” a source from a developer noted.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/13/topcon-dominates-rei-2023-show/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",TOPCon dominates REI 2023 show,"The Renewable Energy India Expo 2023, held last week in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, was way bigger and crowded than last year’s. Expo organizers confirmed to pv magazine that the show recorded 621 exhibitors and 43,182 trade visitors. The numbers exclude the Battery Show India, which was co-located with REI Expo 2023 for the first time in India and showcased over 200 brands to more than 8,000 visitors.
Majority of the solar PV manufacturers showcased their offerings in the latest n-type technologies. As we navigated the packed exhibition floors, it was clear that n-type TOPCon is going to take the driver’s seat for the Indian PV manufacturing sector.
“Currently, n-type TOPCon modules cost INR 1-2/W more than mono PERC, but as the technology advances, their price is bound to come down. Also, TOPCon allows for BOS cost savings of up to 3.26% while offering up to 5% increase in power output. So, if you consider all these factors, the user is going to benefit from the use of TOPCon,” Shubhra Mohanka, director at Gautam Solar, told pv magazine.
All major module manufacturers in India are embracing the shift from p-type to n-type technology, with TOPCon as their preferred choice.
“Many of the leading cell manufacturers in China have already started producing TOPCon cells. This development is expected to narrow the price gap between M10 p-type and TOPCon technologies by the end of 2023 or early 2024,” said Vikas Arya, AVP-product strategy & marketing, Solar Product Business, Jakson Group.
Mono PERC manufacturers looking to sync with TOPCon demand can modify/upgrade their existing mono PERC lines for TOPCon production due to the change in the number of busbars from ten busbars (10 BB) in p-type to 16 BB in TOPCon.
Arya said certain cell manufacturers in China are providing TOPCon cells with 10BB configuration, making it more cost-effective to adapt the existing 10BB mono PERC lines in the short term.
“It is essential to plan for the upgrade of machines from 10BB to 16BB in collaboration with machine suppliers, ensuring preparedness as the market transitions from mono PERC to TOPCon technology in 2024-25,” Arya said.
A Pixon representative added if Indian manufacturers do not upgrade their production lines to adopt advanced technologies such as TOPCon, they may lose the opportunity to emerge as a viable alternative.
Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Goldi Solar, said, “After three months, more than 50% of the module production globally will adopt TOPCon. Going with the flow, Goldi Solar is expanding its TOPCon-ready PV module capacity to 4 GW with the addition of 1 GW of new production lines.”
As regards HJT, most manufacturers were of the view that HJT adoption might take a bit longer [than TOPCon] due to its more complex manufacturing process and higher costs.
“The efficiency of TOPCon modules is somewhere around 24.5%, whereas HJT offers 24.5-25%. There is only half a per cent difference in efficiency between the two technologies but the costs involved with HJT is very high,” said Bhut.
Adani, which aims for 10 GW of MG silica-to-PV module manufacturing capacity by 2027 in India, showcased its Elan Shine series of bifacial TOPCon modules with up to 22.4% efficiency. Among other leading players, Waaree showcased both TOPCon and HJT products at the show. These included a 715 Wp dual-glass bifacial HJT solar module and a 720 Wp TOPCon panel.
“The overall trend in Indian PV manufacturing has been shifting away from polycrystalline to monocrystalline solar modules, especially considering the fact that ALMM limits on minimum solar module efficiency mean even small project developers are shifting to monocrystalline modules. In monocrystalline module technologies, n-type TOPCon has seen a significant uptake recently with many significant players [including us] showcasing n-type TOPCon modules at REI 2023. These modules provide greater efficiencies than mono PERC modules, which still remains the most preferred technology. But this will gradually change in the near future as many manufacturers are increasing their manufacturing capacity to increase the production of n-type TOPCon modules to meet the growing market demand,” said Gautam Mohanka, CEO of Gautam Solar.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/13/indias-steel-cement-plants-need-627-billion-to-go-net-zero/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,SUSTAINABILITY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 13, 2023","India’s steel, cement plants need $627 billion to go net zero","India’s existing steel and cement plants will require INR 47 lakh crore ($627 billion) in capital expenditure (CAPEX) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, according to independent studies by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). 
India is the second-largest producer of steel and cement in the world, both of which are emission-intensive processes. The CEEW studies are the first-of-its-kind calculation of the cost of decarbonizing these industries. These also pointed out these steel and cement sectors will need INR 1 lakh crore each year in additional operational expenditure (OPEX) to go net zero.
The CEEW analyses, funded by ‘bp’, an integrated energy company, also found that an 8–25% reduction in steel emissions and a 32% reduction in cement emissions is possible without any price increase by adopting efficient technologies such as waste-heat recovery and energy efficient drives and controls. 
Moreover, a 33% reduction in the combined carbon emissions of the steel and cement industries could be achieved with just 8.5% of the total additional CAPEX and 30% of the additional annual OPEX. This reduction can be done without considering the need for carbon capture and with the requisite supply of alternative fuels and raw materials.
Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of CEEW, said, “Decarbonising steel and cement industries will not only help India meet its climate ambitions but also make its industries market competitive and future-ready in a world with increasingly sustainability-driven regulations.”
CEEW’s assessment indicates that the Indian steel industry emitted 297 million tonnes of CO₂ in 2021-22 in crude steel production. That translates to 2.36 tonnes of CO₂ emissions per tonne of crude steel (2.36 tCO₂/tcs) compared to the world average of 1.89 tCO₂/tcs. The cost of producing this steel would increase with the tightening of emission intensity limits. 
The study found that near-net-zero steel could cost 40–70% more than the steel produced conventionally, depending on the production route taken, the technology chosen, and the prevailing costs of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). CCUS will be critical for decarbonizing the steel industry with a potential to abate as much as 56% of the emissions generated from the sector. But CCUS is still in its nascent stages and will need to be tested at scale before implementation.
The Indian cement industry is among the most energy-efficient in the world. However, apart from the use of fossil fuels, carbon emissions are inherent to the production process due to limestone processing. CEEW assessment indicates that the industry emitted 218 million tonnes of CO2 while producing 337 million tonnes of cement in 2018-19. 
The study shows that about 50% of cement plants in India need access to CO2 pipelines for carbon capture and storage. These pipelines can be constructed using existing natural gas pipelines’ right-of-way. Without such pipelines, these plants cannot opt for CCS.
Sashi Mukundan, president of BP India and senior vice president of BP Group, said, “The Indian industry’s transition to net zero is complex and requires technology advancements and policies that will give companies across the value chain the confidence to act. bp’s partnership with CEEW focuses on optimizing pathways to net-zero for the hard-to-abate sectors in support of our strategy to help decarbonize carbon-intensive sectors.”
Hemant Mallya, Fellow, CEEW, said, “Achieving net-zero target for India’s steel and cement industry will require a concerted effort in developing pathways for carbon capture, utilization and storage. Lowering of costs for carbon capture and green hydrogen production, and development of underground carbon dioxide storage sites are essential to achieving this objective.”
To achieve a net-zero steel and cement industry, the CEEW studies recommend the use of the best available energy-efficient technologies to reduce emissions at lower costs since all the energy-efficiency measures are already commercially available. Further, incentivizing renewable energy will play a pivotal role in decarbonization through lower or no transmission charges at the central and state levels. 
The study also recommends that the government of India should develop a policy for and expedite the establishment of a CCUS ecosystem to abate more than half of the emissions from the existing steel and cement plants. Since hydrogen will play a key role in its implementation, the next phase of the National Green Hydrogen Mission should focus on this agenda.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/13/bifacial-perovskite-solar-cells-for-indoor-applications-achieve-30-3-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 13, 2023",Bifacial perovskite solar cells for indoor applications achieve 30.3% efficiency,"Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi (IIT-Mandi) have designed a bifacial perovskite solar cell for indoor environments that use multiple artificial lighting sources.
“Indoor bifacial photovoltaics (i-BPVs) offer the potential to surpass traditional monofacial photovoltaics (i-MPVs) in terms of power output per single cell, all without significantly increasing manufacturing expenses and while occupying less space,” the research’s lead author, Ranbir Singh, told pv magazine. “We have developed i-BPV cell based on perovskite that can efficiently harvest maximum artificial indoor light from both the front and back sides of the modules.”
Singh and his research group described the solar cell in the study “Indoor bifacial perovskite photovoltaics: Efficient energy harvesting from artificial light sources,” published in Solar Energy.
They built the device with a semi-transparent substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), an electron transport layer (ETL) relying on tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), a MAPbI3 perovskite layer,  a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and a semi transparent electrode made of gold (Au) and ITO. 
The scientists explained that the electrodes were designed to maintain transparency and improve artificial light harvesting from both sides. “For different Au/ITO layer thicknesses, the transmission decreases significantly with increasing Au layer thickness from 5 nm to 30 nm,” they added. Furthermore, they noted that the multilayer electrode (Au/ITO) exhibits a “good amount” of transmittance in the 450 nm to 800 nm wavelength range where most of the indoor light spectrum exists.
The researchers tested the bifacial cell under 1,000 lux LED light illumination and found it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 30.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.93 V, a short-circut current density of 148.3 μA/cm2 and a fill factor of 71.7%.
“The cell achieves a remarkable power output per single cell of 152.01 µW/cm2,” Singh stated. “Theoretical calculations suggest that bifacial devices have the potential to double the power generation at a 50% lower cost compared to their monofacial counterparts.”
According to the research team, the bifacial devices also showed a significant reduction in non radiative recombination losses, lower hysteresis and better operational stability in ambient air conditions compared to conventional monofacial PV structures. “The champion bifaciali cells display an excellent bifaciality factor of 0.73 and demonstrated superior operational stability when subjected to continuous illumination,” it also stated.

Auxano Solar has opened a new solar panel factory in Lagos, Nigeria. It said the facility is located in Ibeju Lekki, in the southern part of the city.
The project was launched in 2016 with a 10 MW semi-automated production plant. In 2020, the company secured financial backing from investor All On, a subsidiary of Shell. An initial grant of $50,000, provided through the US African Development Foundation’s Offgrid program, was subsequently increased to $2 million to support construction.
“Our goal is to penetrate the Nigerian market before moving towards exporting solar photovoltaic energy to neighboring countries,” Chuks Umezulora, co-founder and CEO of Auxano Solar, said at the inauguration. “Our offering is aimed at both the formal sector – solar companies active in mini-grids, commercial and industrial solar suppliers – and the informal sector – importers of solar panels for resale.”
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that Nigeria had just 37 MW of grid-connected solar capacity at the end of 2022. The Nigerian government aims to meet 60% of the country’s energy demand with clean energy by 2050.

SWBs are a promising type of sodium-based battery technology which uses seawater as the cathode. One of their advantages is the ability to store energy over short and long timeframes and provide even annual storage.
In a recently released paper, researchers from the University of Perugia and the Sapienza University of Rome have explored the potential of SWBs focusing on renewables-rich Sardinia Island as a case study. The SWB technology they considered employed sodium-biphenyl (Na-BP) as the anolyte. It resembles a conventional redox flow battery with both the anolyte and the catholyte (seawater) flowing through the battery cells.
According to the researchers, a key strength of Na-BP-based SWBs lies in the possibility to externally store metallic sodium. This allows for an extension of the storage timeframe by increasing the Na metal external reservoir, enabling hourly to monthly and seasonal energy storage with only one device and thus decreasing the investment costs.
“This work aims at demonstrating the applicability of SWB to meet the European energy requirements, to arise the interest of the public and private sectors into the further development needed to bring the laboratory scale cells so far developed into commercial applications,” said the researchers.
To this aim, the researchers have investigated SWBs for short-term application when coupled with wave energy converters and found that this could allow for a potential reduction of more than 85% of generated power fluctuations on the Sardinian grid. In this case, the power ramp up reduction was calculated as the difference between two consecutive power values with a timestep of one second and the energy was stored in the Na-BP anolyte.
In the long-term scenario, the researchers found that SWBs could allow for coverage of Sardinia’s seasonal and even annual energy demand thanks to high volumetric densities of Na metal, which is around four times that of compressed hydrogen at 700 bar. The full decarbonization of the Sardinian grid involves integration of approximately 340,000 m3 of Na metal, corresponding to a 12-meter-high Na reservoir covering a surface of less than four soccer fields, the researchers calculated.
They also found that SWB application could eventually meet around 29% of the desalinated water requirements of the Sardinian population, in addition to harnessing its carbon-dioxide capture auxiliary functionality, which results in 37.3 grams of CO2 per stored kWh.
“The results of the modeling demonstrate the effectiveness of SWB-based energy storage combined with the abundant renewable sources of Sardinia, enabling the full decarbonization of the energy system on the island,” the researchers write. “Moreover, SWBs desalination and CO2 capture functionalities is an exemplar of clean energy transition implementation that can be extended to other islands and coastal areas.”
They discussed their findings in “Na-seawater battery technology integration with renewable energies: The case study of Sardinia Island,” which was recently published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.
