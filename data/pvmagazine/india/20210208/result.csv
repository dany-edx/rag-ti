These forklifts equipped with Waaree lithium batteries have now been deployed at Chennai airport and operating for 12 hours per day.
ACE has bagged an order for 28 numbers of these 3T capacity Li-ion battery forklifts with five years maintenance contract from Airport Cargo, Chennai. 
As per the company statement, the deployment of Lithium batteries has added value to ACE forklifts. The entire operation is through the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart battery management systems with CAN Bus Communication, which has added to the system’s operating life. 
Further, Waaree ESS lithium batteries’ long lifecycles have increased the forklifts’ daily duty hours compared to the conventional lead-acid batteries, bringing in more value for the money spent.
Chetan Gole, Vice President of ACE Ltd, said, “The technology offers virtually maintenance-free batteries, rapid charging/opportunity charging feature, offers longer working cycles and charging during free time to give maximum productivity. Also, it helps avoid the hassles of frequent change of batteries for longer operating cycles. This is relatively a clean and user-friendly technology.”
The high density of Waaree ESS lithium batteries has also helped reduce the weight of forklifts, in turn improving the operational energy efficiency of the entire system. The IOT Battery Management System with ‘on the Air’ features dynamically manages the battery parameters and life management, which is not possible with the conventional lead-acid technology. 
Waaree has in-house research and development expertise on various lithium battery technologies, including lithium ferro phosphate and lithium nickel manganese.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/08/amp-energy-india-powers-lt-metro-rail-hyderabad-with-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,TELANGANA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 8, 2021",Amp Energy India powers L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad with solar,"Amp Energy India has announced the commissioning of a 7.805 MW solar project for L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited, a public-private partnership project between the Telangana government and infrastructure company Larsen &Toubro Limited. 
The plant—said to be one of the largest behind-the-meter solar projects in India—will supply solar power to L&T metro rail’s 24 stations and two depots in the city of Hyderabad, Telangana.
The project will generate 11,300 MWh of green energy in a year and meet 15% of Hyderabad Metro Rail’s total electricity consumption, avoiding approximately 8,000 metric tonnes of carbon emissions annually. 
The Amp Energy plant benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement.
The solar plant was fully commissioned on December 26, 2020.  
“Hyderabad is one of the fastest-growing cities in India, with the metro playing a key role in providing efficient, safe and economical travel. This initiative will help us in reducing our carbon footprint and using green energy to partly power our operations. We are happy to partner with Amp for this project that has helped achieve our sustainability objectives,” said KVB Reddy, managing director and chief executive officer, L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited. 
“Amp’s solar project for Hyderabad Metro Rail Project is a futuristic infrastructure project—a high-quality, reliable renewable energy system powering an eco-friendly and sustainable transportation system. We believe that projects like these will provide the right momentum for mass public transport across cities in India to switch to sustainable energy sources and help meet India’s climate goals,” added Pinaki Bhattacharyya, managing director and chief executive officer, Amp Energy India. 
Amp Energy India is the India arm of the Canada-headquartered Amp Energy group with a portfolio of 1.5 GW and a strong pipeline of 3 GW of renewable generation assets and 2.2 GWh of energy storage assets.
