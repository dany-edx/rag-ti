https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/03/solar-power-for-the-worlds-longest-crude-oil-pipeline/,"HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,GUJARAT,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 3, 2022",Solar power for the world’s longest crude oil pipeline,"Cairn Oil & Gas, India’s largest private oil and gas exploration and production company, has announced that its Mangala crude oil pipeline will now be switched to solar.
The Mangala pipeline is the world’s longest continuously heated and insulated pipeline that runs from the oil fields of Rajasthan to the refineries in Gujarat, traversing 705 km. The 24-inch oil pipeline has 36 above-ground installations (AGIs) located along its route to serve as pipeline heating installations and pigging stations. [Pigging refers to the practice of inspecting and cleaning the pipelines using devices known as “pigs.”]
The Cairn team at Mangala has initiated the project to install rooftop solar photovoltaics on the available area of AGIs in a phase-wise manner. It targets to install solar rooftops in all 36 AGIs by 2025 with the goal to shift the complete AGI load to solar energy.
“The overall capacity to be set up at AGIs by 2025 is 540 kW (36 rooftop solar installations of 15 kW capacity each). The current requirement of energy at each AGI to run programmable logic controllers (PLCs), lighting, and other auxiliary facilities is 40 kW, which is taken from the grid. The solar installations will reduce the grid electricity consumption by 15 kW at each AGI,” Prachur Sah, deputy CEO of Cairn Oil & Gas, told pv magazine.
So far, Cairn has installed 13 AGIs with a solar rooftop capacity of 15 kW each. These installations are cumulatively reducing approximately 270 tons of CO2 emission per year. Cairn plans to install solar on ten AGIs each year to complete the project by 2025 and achieve a total GHG reduction of 770 tons of CO2e/annum.

Its factory in Gujarat is spread across 6,10,098 square feet. It is purportedly one of the largest factories in India for Li-ion battery packs and modules across pouch, prismatic and cylindrical formats. The facility has six highly automated assembly lines and testing labs to produce energy storage systems for electric vehicles and grid-based applications.
Nexcharge said it launched an extensive market study before launching production.
“From January 2019, we started looking at the market to understand customer requirements across market segments such as two-wheelers, three-wheelers, passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, electric buses, invertors, telecom, and UPS. Once we had a clear idea of the requirements, we started developing products. In total, more than 150 products have been developed. Once we developed those blueprint products, we were able to order the production lines [from China],” Stefan Louis, chief executive officer of Nexcharge, told pv magazine.

However, it took longer than planned to build the factory due to pandemic restrictions.
“The production line people were planning to send 30 people to our factory. Unfortunately, we could not get visas for 30 people because these people were coming from China. We were only allowed to get visas for six people. So the time to erect our factory was much longer than originally planned,” said Louis.
Nexcharge will import all of its battery cells from China and other markets until Exide’s proposed cell manufacturing plant is up and running in India.
“Leclanché being a lithium-ion battery manufacturer, we can source cells from them, but they are not suitable for every market we pursue. So we also need to bring cells from other manufacturers. As 75% of the world’s lithium-ion cell production is in China, we have to source cells from there,” said Louis. “Meanwhile, Exide has made a decision to set up cell manufacturing as well, domestically in India. The factory will be ready in 2024 but till then all of our cells will be imported.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/03/solar-beehive-in-south-korea/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 3, 2022",Solar beehive in South Korea,"From pv magazine Global
Hanwha Group has installed South Korea’s first solar beehive at the Korea National University of Agriculture and Fisheries (KNUAF), as part of a pilot program to increase the population of the world’s most important pollinators. Around 40,000 bees will help pollinate the fruit trees on campus and vegetation in nearby woodland areas.
“The solar beehive consists of two parts: a smart internal beehive that controls the bees’ growing environment, and an external structure that provides electricity to the beehive. The structure is made of Q Cells’s Q. PEAK DUO XL-G10 panels arranged in a hexagonal shape, to resemble the format of the cells of a beehive,” Albert Parker, director for Hanwha’s communication committee, told pv magazine.
On average, the panels will generate more than 10 kWh of electricity per day, reaching a maximum of 15 kWh per day in summer. The electricity generated by the PV panels will be used to automatically monitor and control the temperature, humidity, water, and food inside the structure, thereby maintaining a stable growing environment for the bees. The data can be monitored and controlled in real time through the beehive’s smart system app.
“The solar beehive will effectively increase the bee population and preserve the species, as it can monitor the growth of the bees in real time and detect diseases and pests immediately,” said Professor Hye-Kyung Kim of the Department of Industrial Entomology at KNUAF.
Evidence suggests that the concentration of bees within a 1-kilometer radius of a solar farm could be up to four times higher than that of other agricultural sites. The significant increase can be attributed to the range of plant species that often grown around solar farms.
Hanwha Group said the pilot project could help to disprove the assumption that solar farms negatively affect ecosystems of bees. The company is waiting for the results of the project to determine whether to install more solar beehives, said Parker.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/03/solar-plus-storage-vs-wind-plus-storage/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 3, 2022",Solar-plus-storage vs. wind-plus-storage,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have compared the costs of several of solar-plus-storage configurations with those of other wind-plus-battery plants across seven US wholesale electricity markets.
“We seek to understand the trends in the commercial development of hybrids and to identify factors that may alter those trends through an evaluation of the costs and revenues of different hybrid configurations, enabling planners to make more informed assumptions about the configuration and behavior of hybrids,” they said. “We also seek to understand which configuration choices are more impactful than others on market value and costs.”
They described their findings in “Keep it short: Exploring the impacts of configuration choices on the recent economics of solar-plus-battery and wind-plus-battery hybrid energy plants,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The group of researchers considered historical wholesale market power prices from 2012 to 2019 and recent component costs for renewable energy projects. They shaped their analysis by considering battery duration and capacity, grid interconnection capacity, the size of PV systems relative to inverter capacity, and the connections between batteries and generators.
They also considered hybrid costs based on capital costs and battery lifetimes.
“We construct an analytical approach that system planners could use with case specific parameters to evaluate hybrid development trends and demonstrate its explanatory power by qualitatively comparing the attractive hybrids we model to recently developed hybrids or projects in the near-term development pipeline,” they said.
The scientists calculated the net value of each of the proposed configurations. They also relied on a linear optimization program to calculate a generator’s revenue based on historical wholesale power market prices.
“The objective of the optimization is to maximize revenue from buying and selling power from the hybrid at an hourly varying wholesale power price, accounting for a linear degradation penalty applied to the battery charge and discharge power,” they said.
They found that battery duration and capacity have the largest impact on the net value of either solar or wind hybrid plants. They said the ideal configurations are those with a battery duration ranging from two to four hours. In solar-plus-storage projects, the battery capacity with the highest net value should be between 25% and 100% of the PV plant nameplate capacity, depending on the region and the availability of fiscal incentives, while the highest net value for wind-plus-storage plant should be around 25% of the wind capacity, with or without the tax credits.
“AC vs. DC coupling and the sizing of the solar panels relative to the inverter in solar hybrids appear to be secondary,” they said.
The scientists said their analytical framework aligns with current commercial trends and identified six main trends in US electricity markets. Solar-plus-battery projects are more common than their wind counterparts, while solar hybrids are more common than wind hybrids. Both solar and wind hybrids are more common in the bulk power system operated by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), while battery durations are commonly between one and four hours. Battery-to-generator capacity ratios are larger for solar than wind hybrids, but hybrids in the CAISO have a point of interconnection capacity similar to the renewable generator capacity. In addition, DC-coupled projects use inverter loading ratios ILRs at the same levels of those for off-grid solar.
The researchers said that in the future, they want to improve their analysis of the cost and hybridization cost-reduction potential.
“Future work could refine battery cost and degradation estimates for specific battery technologies, along with incorporating projections of cost trends into the future to make more precise estimates of the net value of specific hybrids,” they said.
