Solar plants on canals have already been successfully built in India, where this technology has shown that solar power can also be generated without occupying land and, at the same time, reduce water evaporation.
According to a group of researchers from the University of California Santa Cruz, in the United States, these projects may be easily developed in the U.S. and, in particular, in California, which has the world’s largest water conveyance system, and is constantly threatened by droughts. They warned, however, that achieving a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) closer to that of ground-mounted solar will be crucial for their feasibility.
In the paper Energy and water co-benefits from covering canals with solar panels, published in Nature sustainability, the scientists conducted regional hydrologic and techno-economic simulations to assess if California’s 6,350km canal network may be suitable for the installation of similar solar arrays. “In our main results we considered cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductor technology but in the sensitivity analysis, we also considered multicrystalline silicon,” they specified.
The research group applied three different methods to assess potential water evaporation: A modified version of the Penman-Monteith equation, which requires data on temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation; pan evaporation, which is a measurement tool considering temperature, humidity, rainfall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind; and the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS), which helps agricultural producers and growers efficiently manage water resources.
Three different PV plant configurations were analyzed for eight different sites across the California network of canals: A common, ground-mounted solar plant located on land adjacent to canals; a steel-truss canal-spanning design already used in several projects in India; and a suspension-cable canal-spanning design that was also utilized in India.
The academics calculated the net present value (NPV) of the three plant typologies, considering revenues, upfront costs, installation, permitting and land, and found that plants built with tensioned cables may have a higher NPV than a ground-mounted facility, as their additional costs can be easily offset if water conservation, enhanced electricity production, avoided land costs, and reduced aquatic weed maintenance are achieved.
Plants built with a steel truss had a lower NPV than ground-mounted arrays, due to the high cost of the truss. “Although the truss, over-canal system generally has the lowest NPV, at the site with the highest water costs the steel-truss system has a higher NPV than the overground system,” the scientists explained. “The net present value of over-canal solar exceeds conventional overground solar by 20-50%, challenging the convention of leaving canals uncovered and calling into question our understanding of the most economic locations for solar power.”
The analysis also showed that there is not a big difference between the three project types, in terms of LCOE. “This is because in the case of the over-canal designs, the increases in the annual costs were proportional to the increases in annual energy output, due to evaporative cooling,” the paper reads.
Looking forward, the U.S. group said off-grid, or ‘distributed generation,’ projects should be considered for initial field experiments or pilot projects. Furthermore, criteria such as proximity to the grid or land availability in a given area should also be included in future analysis.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/23/sungrow-unveils-325-kw-string-inverter/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,CHINA",VINCENT SHAW,"MARCH 23, 2021",Sungrow unveils 325 kW string inverter,"From pv magazine International
Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow has launched a new string inverter with a power output of 325 kW, which it claims is the most powerful string inverter ever launched on the market to date.
The SG320HX inverter is an upgraded version of the SG225HX, unveiled in 2019 with a power rate of 225 kW.
The device measures 1,100 x 890 x 360mm and weighs 110 kg. It offers a reported efficiency of 99.01%, for a European rating of 98.52%. The device also features 1500 V (DC) technology and an ambient operating temperature ranging from -30 C to 60 C.
It is equipped to have up to 16 maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs and its MPPT range is 860-1300 V. The product also comes with IP66 protection, forced air cooling, and can be used in projects at altitudes of up to 5,000 meters.
According to the manufacturer, the inverter can be used with panels exceeding 600 W in power and modules designed with 182mm or 210mm wafers.
“In 2019, our SG225HX shocked the market and so far cumulated over 15 GW shipment worldwide,” said Sungrow Vice President Li Shun. The new SG320HX is redefining the super-high power string inverter, which will help Sungrow  customers to once again lower the levelized cost of energy, he added.
If used in a 100 MW project, the SG320HX would enable cost savings of around RMB 10 million ($1.56 million), or around RMB 0.10 ($0.0156) per watt.
The company will begin mass production of the new devices in the second half of this year. First shipments are expected to be made in September.

The solar farm will be set up by BHEL at Tamarind Falls, Henrietta (Phase II), on an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) basis.
The contract for the project has been awarded to BHEL by CEB (Green Energy) Co. Ltd, Mauritius, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Central Electricity Board (CEB), Mauritius government.
The project is funded under the Indian government’s Line of Credit (LOC) through Export Import Bank of India (EXIM Bank) and has been secured by BHEL through a competitive bidding process. It will be executed by BHEL’s Solar Business Division, Bengaluru, and International Operations Division, New Delhi.
The government of Mauritius is planning to increase the use of renewable sources of energy from the current level of around 22% to 35% by 2025.
The Indian Ocean island state has also been supporting distributed solar through net metering and rebates.
The solar project in Mauritius marks the consolidation of BHEL’s presence in Africa, where it has been active for more than four decades with electricity generation projects (aggregating to around 2,100 MW) and equipment supplies in 23 African countries.
Apart from conventional power plants (thermal, hydro and gas), BHEL has been contributing significantly to the development and promotion of solar energy over the past three decades. It offers EPC solutions for both grid-interactive and off-grid, ground-mounted, rooftop, floating, and canal top solar plants, with a current solar portfolio of more than 1 GW. Besides, BHEL is manufacturing space-grade solar panels and batteries for space applications.
