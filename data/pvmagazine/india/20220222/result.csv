This is the lowest rate of interest for any project finance facility in terms of rupee financing for the company’s existing portfolio so far.
Azure is implementing the 600MW interstate transmission system (ISTS) connected solar project in the Bikaner district of Rajasthan through a special purpose vehicle called Azure Power Forty Three. The project was fully commissioned recently in December 2021. It is the largest solar power project in India, owned and operated at a single location by any developer. The project is allocated by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
“Refinancing the original term loan was one of our highest priorities, even before the project was fully commissioned in December 2021. The facility will result in substantial savings in interest cost and will improve the project IRR significantly. We are overwhelmed with the response we get from the credit markets which reflects lenders’ confidence in our strong corporate governance standards, operational capabilities, and credit fundamentals,” said Pawan Kumar Agrawal, chief financial officer, Azure Power. 
L&T Finance Limited acted as the sole underwriter for this refinancing facility. 
The power generated from the project is being supplied to SECI at a tariff of INR 2.53 (US 3.5 cents) per kWh under a 25-year power purchase agreement. The project was commissioned in multiple phases, with the last 100 MW commissioned in December 2021.

The solar site is one of two 600MW solar parks planned in Uttar Pradesh to be developed by central government-owned hydropower business THDC India Ltd in a joint venture with the Uttar Pradesh New & Renewable Energy Development Agency. Under the terms of the joint venture, THDC India will own 74% of the Tusco Ltd joint company, with the state renewables body holding the balance.
THDC India and the state renewables agency have been tasked with developing up to 2GW of solar park capacity, including the 600MW solar-ready site to be prepared in the Jhansi district of the Garotha tehsil of Uttar Pradesh which the IFC will try to attract private investment for.
The 2GW of solar parks to be set up by Tusco will be installed under the Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Park scheme run by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
Tusco will get federal government funding of INR20 lakh per megawatt of solar generation capacity which can be hosted at the site or 30% of the solar park project development cost, whichever is lower. The cash will be used to provide park infrastructure and the joint venture will also meet electricity transmission costs to the central or state utility.
The park will encompass 242 acres of government land and 2,851 acres leased from farmers in the villages of Sujanpura, Jaswanpura, Jalalpura, Pura, and Kharora, next to the Dhasan river in Garotha.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/22/kpi-bags-repeat-captive-solar-order-from-chemicals-manufacturer/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 22, 2022",KPI bags repeat ‘captive solar’ order from chemicals manufacturer ,"Gujarat-based KPI Global Infrastructure today announced it had secured a repeat order for executing a solar power project of 7.5 MW DC capacity from Surat-based Anupam Rasayan India Limited—a company engaged in the custom synthesis and manufacturing of specialty chemicals in India. KPI shall execute the project under the captive power producer (CPP)’ segment, which shall take its total capacity for Anupam Rasayan India to 20 MW DC.
KPI Global commissioned the first order of 12.50 MW DC for Anupam Rasayan in September 2021.
Captive solar power plants make a lucrative proposition for growing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Most manufacturing units in the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) segment have poor infrastructure and small roof size, which allows them to meet barely 5-10% of their energy consumption from solar installation, whereas energy consumption accounts for 25-40% of their total manufacturing cost (excluding raw material cost). Some MSMEs involved in the business of foundry, forging and dyeing have even higher energy cost of up to 50%, according to Faruk Patel, Chairman and Managing Director, KPI Global Infrastructure.
By going for captive solar plants, MSMEs can not only contribute in addressing the challenge of global warming but also generate additional cash flows to their business.

A trust set up to provide for the pensions of retired army personnel in Bangladesh has announced a deal to bring 1GW of solar generation capacity to the country within five years.
Under the terms of a deal with US-based power company Eleris Energy Ltd, five 200MW solar fields will be developed on the Swarna Dweep island in the Bay of Bengal, which the Bangladesh Army uses for training.
The plants will be connected to the Bangladeshi grid and will export any electricity not needed for on-site consumption, to help the nation towards a target of sourcing 40% of its power from renewables by 2041.
The deal, signed in Dhaka on Thursday by Eleris chief operating officer Jerry Price and Army Welfare Trust MD brigadier general Abul Mansur Md Ashraf Khan, follows a memorandum of understanding signed by Eleris and various Bangladeshi partners last year which related to 2.2GW of solar plans.
The solar sites will be constructed on the 360km2 island in the Meghna River which is part of the Noakhali district of the Chittagong division of Bangladesh, in the southeast of the country.

The project, owing to challenging terrains and varied structures, will see Ecoppia deploy its full product suite (the E4, the T4 as well as the latest H4) for the panel cleaning job.
The H4 robotic solution is designed for both fixed-tilt and single-axis tracker installations. It is powered by Helix Technology that enhances the cleaning quality of the panels, and other revolutionary innovations such as speed adaptability, bidirectional cleaning, and flexible frame—providing a safe, effective and smart solution.
The lightweight T4 robot for single-axis trackers smartly removes panel soiling by using a soft microfiber and controlled airflow while the tracker is in stow position, navigating an optimized path.
The E4 robot for fixed-tilt solar installations can clean up to 1,000 modules in a single nightly operation. 
The project is part of Ecoppia’s framework agreement with Azure, emphasizing Ecoppia’s ability to supply the future needs of the client’s expanding operation. 
Jean Scemama, CEO of Ecoppia, said, “With this project, Ecoppia solidifies its ability to do so, offering Azure Power a wide spectrum of autonomous robotic solutions, supporting their expanding efforts. We believe that with Ecoppia’s newest product H4 joining the Ecoppia portfolio, energy companies will be able to achieve faster ROI while safeguarding their assets”. 
With over 3 GW of deployed capacity, Ecoppia is a world leader in robotic solutions for photovoltaic solar. Its cloud-based, water-free, autonomous robotic systems remove dust from solar panels on a daily basis, leveraging sophisticated technology and advanced business intelligence capabilities. Remotely managed and controlled, the Ecoppia platform allows solar sites to maintain peak performance with minimal costs and human intervention.
