The company will build these projects in EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) and developer modes.
“We are fully dedicated to playing a substantial role in India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, positioning ourselves as a major player in this emerging space,” Simarpreet Singh, director of Hartek Group, told pv magazine.
Under its power system business, Hartek works with developers to build the entire grid infrastructure for solar/wind power to be evacuated. So far, it has executed more than 350 substations and transmission and distribution projects up to 400 kV, connecting 5 GW + solar to the grid for government and private developers.
“Our involvement in the execution of approximately 5 GW of solar grid connectivity has curbed 150 MT of CO2 emissions since 2009,” said Singh.
Hartek partners with industries and buildings to meet their ESG and sustainable development goals. It has installed over 100 MWp of rooftop solar, fostering clean energy adoption.
Additionally, the company has established itself as a major player in the floating solar sector. It recently executed North India’s largest floating solar project and is now building a 22 MW floating solar for SJVN.
Over the next 12 months, Hartek plans strategic expansion in several key areas, including rooftop solar, floating solar and green hydrogen. “Our goal is to extend our reach to more regions and empower an even broader base of customers with clean and sustainable energy solutions that will accelerate their decarbonization journey,” Singh told pv magazine.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/07/advancing-iron-and-salt-batteries-with-8-million-in-seed-funding/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Advancing iron and salt batteries with $8 million in seed funding,"From pv magazine USA
Inlyte Energy, the recipient of $8 million in seed funding, was founded by Dr. Antonio Baclig, who incubated the company as a 2021 Activate Fellow in partnership with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Since that time Inlyte has been on an upward trajectory—securing an ARPA-A award, acquiring Beta Research, being named to the 2023 Cleantech 50 to Watch and now receiving a funding boost from At One Ventures.
The company, which is located in the California Bay Area, aims to use the seed funding to develop the first generation of its grid batteries made with the most abundant materials: iron and table salt.
The 2022 acquisition of UK-based Beta Research moves Inlyte many steps closer to design and manufacturing, as the scientists at Beta originally developed a sodium metal halide battery more than 40 years ago and brought the technology to commercial readiness and manufacturing capacity. Beta Research has a pilot production line, with 30,000 square feet of manufacturing and testing facilities, which will enable Inlyte to begin manufacturing, once the optimized design is complete.
“The experience of the Beta Research team and their facilities give Inlyte a significant advantage compared to other battery startups in this space. They don’t need to find a pilot factory, get the tooling, or figure out how to manufacture,” said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Inlyte’s ability to compete with lithium-ion on lifetime, round-trip efficiency, and of course upfront cost also gives them a significant opportunity in a market that’s exploding right now.”
The battery chemistry is sodium metal halide, which Inlyte says can “create an energy storage system with high efficiency, long lifetime, competitive energy density, excellent safety, and at an ultra-low cost”. An advantage the chemistry has over conventional lithium batteries is the ability to operate in extreme heat or cold, said the company.
The target market for Inlyte’s batteries is the diurnal energy storage market, with a storage duration of four to 10 hours. The company says this makes them appropriate for grid storage and other industrial applications.
“Conventional sodium metal halide batteries, made from nickel and salt, were developed for electric vehicles in the 1980s and ’90s but never made it down the cost curve,” said founder and CEO, Dr. Antonio Baclig. “At Stanford, I realized that by optimizing that design for the grid instead of for vehicles, and by using iron instead of nickel, we could drive the cost incredibly low. Inexpensive storage is what will truly make wind and solar a competitive total solution versus fossil fuels, not just in California but everywhere in the world.”
The sodium metal halide battery’s iron chemistry’s raw storage materials are Earth-abundant table salt and iron. Inlyte intends to use electrochemical measurements and materials characterization to study the sodium/iron chloride cells, isolate the factors that allow for long cyclability.
Once the company can scale manufacturing, Inlyte expects its batteries to have the lowest cost because the raw materials are common, inexpensive and locally available, thus avoiding sourcing from another country.
“At the end of the day, solutions for the climate crisis are beholden to economics for both companies and countries, and we would have chosen this design and these materials on that basis alone – but there are so many other benefits as well,” said Baclig.
The seed funding round is led by At One Ventures with participation from First Spark Ventures, Valo Ventures, TechEnergy Ventures, Climate Capital, Anglo American, and others.
The next step is for Inlyte to finalize its grid-optimized sodium metal halide design. The company also plans to engage with pilot customers in the coming months, with a goal of launching a manufacturing facility in the U.S. in the coming years, leveraging incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/07/sri-lankan-government-launches-twin-100-mw-floating-solar-plant-tender/,"FLOATING SOLAR,SRI LANKA",ANGELA SKUJINS,"NOVEMBER 7, 2023",Sri Lankan government launches twin 100 MW floating solar plant tender,"From pv magazine Global
The Sri Lankan government’s Ministry of Power and Energy said last week that it is inviting applicants to submit their “least cost basis” proposals for the country’s first photovoltaic auction.
According to tender documents, the government-owned Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is welcoming bids to develop two 100 MW floating solar plants on the surface of Samanalawewa Reservoir, located 160 km south of the country’s capital of Colombo.
The Samanalawewa Power Station is one of five power plant assets owned by CEB. In 2021, the hydroelectric facility recorded 120 MW installed capacity and generated 405.19 GWh, according to a CEB annual report.
The aim of these twin PV facilities is to “leverage” the reservoir’s existing hydroelectric energy generation capabilities by “complementing” it through daytime solar energy production, the tender documents said. Successful bidders will be awarded 20-year power purchase agreements and are expected to connect “early” to the electricity grid.
“Experienced and qualified firms” must only submit one proposal for 100 MW capacity. Proposals must include details about the power plant as well as grid interconnection, such as transmission lines and substations. The deadline for applications is Dec. 13 2023.
Last month the Sri Lankan government announced it was inviting applicants to submit their proposals for the development of three ground-mounted or floating PV projects ranging from 1 MW to 5 MW.
Sri Lanka recorded 714 MW installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
