The company already has a 1.5 GW cells and modules facility operational at Mundra. The latest addition has expanded its overall capacity to 3.5 GW.
The new 2 GW line will produce bifacial modules with power outputs above 500 Wp. Initially, it will produce 535Wp modules with power conversion efficiency of 21% and above. Plan is to bring out modules of 650+ Wp in the near future as the technology and infrastructure is already in place.
Adani Solar is a dominant player in retail solar sales (1kW-200kW systems), commanding over 50% market share in rooftop solar and over 70% in solar installed under component B of PM KUSUM Scheme.
Haryana-headquartered Saatvik, which is currently the largest module manufacturer in northern India with an 800 MW module capacity in Ambala, Haryana, will soon have a new 1.2 GW module factory operational in Gandhidham of Gujarat. The facility will start production by June 2022 and will manufacture mono PERC and mono facial modules with minimum 21% efficiency. Initially, it shall produce modules with 540-550Wp output and upscale to 610Wp after two-three months.

“We chose Gandhidham, Gujarat, for our new factory owing to its proximity to Kandla and Mundra ports. So, manufacturing in Gujarat will reduce freight costs for us in imports of raw materials like cells, aluminium frames, junction boxes, etc,” shared Pushpendra Samadhiya, national sales head-key account sales, Saatvik.
“This strategic location shall also reduce our transportation costs for selling in Southern India, and for exports to other countries.” Saatvik has supplied 800 MW+ modules in India since the start of its operations in 2015.

With this, Gujarat alone accounts for 38% of 37,771 MW capacity approved for different States. Project-wise sanctioned PV capacity in Gujarat is as follows: Dholera Solar Park (Phase-I) 1,000 MW, Dholera Solar Park (Phase-II) 4,000 MW, GIPCL RE Park (600 MW), GSECL RE Park (3,325 MW), NTPC RE Park (4,750 MW), and Radhnesada Solar Park (700 MW)
The “Development of Solar Parks and Ultra-Mega Solar Power Projects” Scheme, rolled out in December 2014, aims to facilitate solar developers in setting up projects by providing a plug-and-play facility through these parks. The Scheme targets to set up 40 GW of solar park capacity.
Gujarat is followed by Madhya Pradesh (6,000 MW), Rajasthan (4,276 MW), Andhra Pradesh (4,000 MW) and Uttar Pradesh (3,805 MW) in the approved solar park capacity.
The overall approved solar park capacity for different States also includes floating solar capacities of 600 MW in Madhya Pradesh, 150 MW in Jharkhand, 100 MW in Odisha, and 50 MW in Kerala.
The timeline for completion of solar parks in all States under the scheme for “Development of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects” is March, 2024.

Spanish mounting system manufacturer Alusín Solar has launched its Picos 4.0 system for rooftop PV systems built with large-size solar panels.
The mounting structure was conceived, in particular, for those flat-deck-type roofs with PVC or asphalt covers that cannot be drilled.
“Installing a panel horizontally at 10 degrees, with a 60-cell panel with [a] length of 1.65m was not a problem,” Javier Font, general director of Alusín Solar, told pv magazine. “But now we have moved to 2m modules and in rooftop installations, when the modules grow, the problems grow.”
According to him, large photovoltaic modules are more subject to vibration problems and the possibility of being blown away by strong winds.
“Our system is a ballasted structure without drilling and uses a deflector plate that prevents the wind from entering from the back,” he further explained. “We have also incorporated a slot that holds the panel in six different points, which means two extra fixing points are added, to prevent any minimal movement of the module.”
According to the manufacturer, the Picos 4.0 system is currently the only one on the market that provides six fixing points for a solar panel in ballast-secured structures.
