https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/22/ten-most-common-rooftop-solar-safety-risks/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,QUALITY,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 22, 2023",Ten most common rooftop solar safety risks,"From pv magazine USA
Clean Energy Associaties, a clean energy advisory company, performed over 600 safety audits at sites all over the world and found that 97% had safety concerns.
The vast majority of these hazards are caused by poor installation practices, according to CEA. This means most of them can be identified and resolved relatively easily before they lead to fires, safety risks and potentially costly liabilities.
The top ten safety concerns include:

Nearly half of the sites surveyed had damaged modules caused by incorrect installation or cleaning methods, extreme weather, electrical short circuits in the module or heavy soiling on the modules. And while damaged modules can cause underperformance, they can also cause electrical faults, shock hazards and fire safety risk.
Cross-mated connectors were found in 41% of the sites. This typically occurs due to installer error or a lack of understanding UL-listed connector pairings, or the use of incorrect installation techniques. It can also happen when field-made connectors don’t match the module connector. The effect can be water intrusion or corrosion. Or it can potentially lead to fire from arcing in the connector housing.
Poor terminations were seen at 40% of the sites. The issue can be caused by untrained technicians using the wrong crimp, wrong die, poor wire stripping and/or trimming methods. Poor terminations can arc to one another or to wire clippings within the inverter housing. This can also increase heat at the terminal, causing safety and longevity concerns.
Improperly assembled connectors were found at 40% of the inspected sites, another risk possibly caused by untrained workers or lack of standards. The problem cannot be identified during a visual inspection and requires thermal imaging (shown below) or destructive testing. Left unchecked, poorly assembled connectors can cause extreme thermal signatures that result in safety and reliability issues.

Module hotspots were found in 31% of sites. Hotspots can be caused by manufacturing defects, module shading or soiling or damage during shipment. This issue can lead to voltage mismatch between modules, causing string underperformance. If the modules get too hot they can melt the backsheet, potentially causing arcing or fire.
Cables rubbing against sharp edges were found at 27% of sites surveyed. This can be caused by untrained workers or by weather variations. The expansion and contraction that takes place through seasonal heat changes can cause enough movement to allow sharp edges to eventually cut through the cable installation. Once the conducts is exposed, a short circuit can develop and may lead to fire.
Broken and damaged connectors were found in just over one-quarter of sites. While this can be cause by untrained workers or lack of standards, it can also be caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight, rain, etc.
All installations are expected to resist a certain level of water from rain and snow, however, water ingress was found to be an issue at 26% of sites. This can be caused by improperly installed equipment covers, missing or damaged conduit seals or missing weep holes, leaving no way for water to exit enclosures. Electrical failure and potential thermal events can result, caused by compromised component protection or the creation of unintended electrical paths.
Enclosure hotspots were identified at 19% of sites. These hotspots can be caused by installation problems or from faulty fuses or unsafe system operation. The issue can affect production output, or can risk component breakdown and electrical failure.
Co-authors Chris Chappell, CEA’s senior director of engineering services, and Ankil Sanghvi, engineering manager, will discuss these findings and their experiences inspecting solar rooftops for some of the largest retailers in the U.S. at 1 p.m. EDT June 29, on a free webcast, “From Sunlight to Spotlight: Avoiding Fire Hazards in Your Rooftop Solar Installations.”

Reports of a Chinese citizen’s arrest at Munich Airport prior to the start of Intersolar Europe caused a stir last week at The Smarter E exhibition. The person – identified as a senior sales representative at a Chinese module manufacturer – is under investigation by the public prosecutor in Augsburg, Germany, for alleged crimes dating back to the 2015-17 period.
The suspect, along with other individuals under investigation, was allegedly involved in developing an illegal system to evade anti-dumping duties on imported Chinese solar modules. The accused is represented by lawyer Alexandra Gutmeyr.
The investigation by the Augsburg public prosecutor’s office, which began several years ago, focuses on the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. In April 2018, three suspects were arrested by customs investigators in connection with more than 400 imports of PV products from China into the European Union. The accused used intermediary companies in Greece and the Isle of Man to hide their operations, avoiding approximately €35 million ($38.2 million) in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.
Minimum import prices for crystalline PV products, introduced in the European Union in 2013, expired in September 2018, in line with a decision by the EU Commission.

SMA has developed new one-phase hybrid inverters for residential rooftop projects. The Germany-based inverter manufacturer showcased the new line at Intersolar Europe last week in Munich, Germany.
The Sunny Boy Smart Energy comes in four versions, with power outputs ranging from 3.6 kW to 6 kW. The inverters measure 500 mm x 586 mm x 236 mm and weigh 17.5 kg.
The transformerless inverters feature three maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points, with efficiency ratings of up to 97.5% and a European efficiency rating of up to 96.8%. The MPPT voltage range is 60 V to 480 V, with a maximum PV power input of 7.2 kW for the 3.6 kW inverters and 12 kW for the 6 kW devices. The maximum input voltage is 600 V.
“The Sunny Boy Smart Energy shines with its fast battery charging capability,” SMA said. “Conventional charging performance is challenged in northern climate by few hours of sunshine and plenty of cloud cover. The Sunny Boy Smart Energy’s fast charging allows more solar power to be harvested and stored in those few hours, ready to power homes and reduce homeowners’ energy costs.”
The inverters have IP65-rated protection and operate within a temperature range of -25 C to 60 C. They come with lithium-ion batteries that have voltages ranging from 90 V to 500 V, supporting a maximum charge/discharge current of 30 A.
The new hybrid inverters will be available in the fourth quarter of 2023.
