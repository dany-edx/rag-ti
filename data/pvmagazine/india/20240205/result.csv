An international group of scientists has proposed a new copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cell structure using antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as the back surface field (BSF) layer.
Sb2S3 is a promising candidate for the photovoltaic community owing to the earth-abundant and environmentally friendly constituent elements alongside appropriate optoelectronic properties such as a desirable band gap of around 1.7 eV, large absorption coefficient and long-term stability
BSF layers consist of a higher doped region at the rear surface of the solar cell and are commonly used to increase a device’s voltage. “Sb and S are abundantly available on Earth. Hence, incorporating a thick layer of Sb2S3 in industrial CIGS solar cells can effectively reduce their production costs,” the researchers said. “By reducing the thickness and cost of the CIGS absorber layer, this approach promises to make solar energy more accessible and sustainable.”
They numerically simulated and optimized the solar cell via the SCAPS–1D solar cell capacitance software, developed by the University of Ghent, to simulate the novel cell design.
The academics fabricated the cell with a back contact layer made of nickel (Ni), the Sb2S3-based BSF layer, a CIGS absorber, an electron transport layer (ETL) made of tin disulfide (SnS2), a window layer based on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and a front electrode made with aluminum (Al).
In the simulation, the researchers optimized the thicknesses of the buffer, absorber, and BSF layers. They also investigated acceptor density, defect density, capacitance–voltage (C–V), interface defect density, rates of generation and recombination, operating temperature, current density, and quantum efficiency.

“After details optimization, the optimal thicknesses for the FTO window, CIGS absorber, SnS2 buffer, and Sb2S3 BSF layers are found to be 0.05 μm, 1.0 μm, 0.05 μm and 0.20 μm, respectively,” the group said. “The large thickness of buffer creates the series resistance and absorption losses in the solar cell structure. Since the buffer allows light to enter the solar cell device, so excellent transparency and the right thickness are needed, which is the 0.05 mm for SnS2 buffer in our proposed structure.”
With those optimized parameters, the simulated double heterojunction (DH) cell exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 31.15%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.08 V, a short-circuit current density of 33.75 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 88.50%. A reference CIGS cell optimized and simulated without the Sb2S3 BSF layers achieved an efficiency of 22.14%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current density of 28.21 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 86.31%.
“The outcomes of this study provide insights into the development of an ultra-thin Sb2S3 BSF layer, which can be included in conventional CIGS solar cells to improve their efficiency and reduce the absorber material’s cost,” the group concluded.
Its findings and the solar cell concept were presented in the study “Improving the efficiency of a CIGS solar cell to above 31% with Sb2S3 as a new BSF: a numerical simulation approach by SCAPS-1D,” published in RSC Advances. The team included scientists from Bangladesh’s Begum Rokeya University, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University and Pabna University of Science and Technology, as well as from Mexico’s Autonomous University of Querétaro, Iraq’s Al-Karkh University of Science, and Saudi Arabia’s King Khalid University.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/05/wafer-prices-stable-ahead-of-chinese-new-year-festivities/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-02-05,Wafer prices stable ahead of Chinese New Year festivities,"Wafer FOB China prices have stayed consistent for the third consecutive week due to a lack of significant changes in the market fundamentals. Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafer prices remain steady at $0.246 per piece (pc) and $0.357/pc, respectively.

Cell manufacturers who intend to keep up production throughout the Chinese New Year break have started to accumulate raw materials, which has increased the volume of wafers traded. The amount of wafers produced and in stock is adequate to meet downstream demand, momentarily dashing wafer makers’ expectations of additional price increases.
Divergent views exist regarding the near-term outlook for wafer prices in the marketplace. According to a market observer, polysilicon companies appear to be banding together to drive up polysilicon prices perhaps as a result of the relative scarcity of N-type polysilicon. This foundation may lead to an increase in wafer pricing, the source said, adding that wafer makers may boost prices even if demand does not recover in the near future because of manufacturing cost considerations.
On the other hand, a downstream market participant believes that there aren’t enough fundamental prerequisites for price hikes in the supply chain market as a whole due to the oversupply of upstream materials. The polysilicon production output in January is expected to be equivalent to about 70 GW of downstream products, significantly greater than the module’s January production output of roughly 40 GW, according to this source.
OPIS learned that only the major cell producers will continue regular production throughout the Chinese New Year break, with nearly half of the existing cell capacity in the market suspending production during the holiday.
The wafer segment is expected to reduce plant operating rates during Chinese New Year but is less evident as compared to the cell segment, resulting in higher wafer inventories in February that may exert downward pressure on wafer pricing in the coming weeks.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/05/best-practices-for-end-of-life-pv-management/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-02-05,Best practices for end-of-life PV management,"SolarPower Europe has published best practice guidelines for handling EoL solar panels, in a bid to ensure that solar is making a valuable contribution to the European Union’s circularity objectives.
The report offers recommendations on how to sustainably handle EoL products and outlines how companies can comply with mandatory requirements. The scope of the legislation covered spans the utility-scale, commercial and industrial, and residential segments.
The association says guaranteeing high-quality EoL solar management is crucial for both the sustainability of the industry and public support for solar.
“Solar will be the backbone of Europe’s green transition, and this needs to come with sustainable growth,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe. “This new report will support the sector in diligently managing end-of-life solar panels, and ultimately, strengthen the sector’s resilience going forward.”
With the lifespan of solar systems normally around 30 years, the report warns part of the EU’s existing solar fleet is expected to start reaching EoL in the next decade, with increasingly more waste produced as time progresses.
Estimates suggest that when a PV panel reaches the end of its natural life, it still possesses approximately 80% of its initial power generation capacity that could be exploited.
The report says that in the next 10 to 15 years, more than 50% of the PV panels considered as “waste” could be re-used because they are still functional, as long as reuse can be done under environmentally sound, qualitative, and safe conditions.
In response, part of the report offers recommendations on how to assess potential for a “second life” or extension of a solar system’s lifespan, featuring detail on how to prepare for reuse and the factors that must be considered, such as the availability of spare parts and repair services, security updates, safety requirements and regulatory compliance, and compatibility with other devices and protocols.
When reuse and repurposing options are exhausted, recycling and takeback programs are pivotal for the responsible management of PV waste.
The report says that as more panels near their EoL, an unprecedented waste management challenge is emerging. It is projected that PV waste will account for a substantial portion, ranging from 4% to 14%, of the total electricity generation capacity by 2030 and could reach 60 million tons to 80 million tons by 2050.
The final chapter explores the role of producer responsibility organizations (PROs) in managing the responsible disposal and recycling of PV components, the challenges and obstacles faced in the pursuit of sustainable and efficient recycling processes and the recycling and take back processes of PV components.
SolarPanel Europe’s latest report follows best practice guidelines on floating PV and agrovoltaics, published by the association in 2023.
