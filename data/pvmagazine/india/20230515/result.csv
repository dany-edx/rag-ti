It has proposed comprehensive solutions to create an efficient, optimal, and reliable market framework to enable the energy transition and integration of renewable energy into the grid.
The Group has recommended a roadmap outlining the interventions for the near, medium, and long term. The interventions include setting up a mechanism to monitor whether adequacy of supply is being maintained by the state utilities, enhancing the efficacy of the day-ahead market, introducing a market-based mechanism for secondary reserves, and implementing 5-minutes based metering, scheduling, dispatch, and settlement.
The proposed changes also include demand response and aggregation, which could reduce reserve requirements and lower electricity costs. There will be a strengthening of market monitoring and surveillance activities to keep track of participation and prevent price volatility. A regional-level balancing framework for deviation management will be implemented. This would result in a reduction in deviation penalties for the States at the inter-state transmission system (ISTS) level and consequently lower the reserve requirements.
Union Minister of Power and New & Renewable Energy, R.K. Singh, said the proposed reforms are crucial to meeting India’s renewable energy targets, and will also create a conducive environment for investment in renewable energy. The changes will enable better grid integration of renewable energy and pave the way for a cleaner, greener future.
The Minister emphasized the need of ensuring the procurement of the most efficient power generation capacity while designing the capacity contracts and also agreed with the recommendations of having long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) of 12-15 years duration from now onwards.
The Minister also directed to immediately undertake the development of new RE capacity based on the Contract for Difference (CfD) methodology to ensure competition and transparency. He directed that the power exchange clearing engine may be validated by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.
According to the latest data for 2022-23, the total traded volume in the Indian electricity market was 102,276 MUs, which represents only a small portion of the 1,624,465 MUs of energy generated from all sources (including RE). The peak demand for electricity in 2022-23 was 215.8 GW, and it is expected to increase to 335 GW by the year 2029-30.

Japanese chemical company Kaneka has designed a two-terminal (2T) perovskite-crystalline tandem solar cell using a 145 μm thick industrial Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafer.
The company’s researchers built the cell with an anti-reflection intermediate layer relying on what they call “gentle textured structures” that were applied on the front side of the bottom. This reportedly enables a significant improvement in the typical light confinement effects in perovskite-silicon tandem devices.
“Light management technology is mandatory to fully utilize the wide range of the solar spectrum in a solar cell, especially for a 2T tandem structure, since its top and bottom cells are electrically connected in series and required to satisfy the constraints of current matching whereby the respective currents at the operating point are aligned to some extent,” they said. “Because of the large difference in the refractive indices between perovskite and crystalline silicon (c-Si) materials, the optimized intermediate layer as shown acts as an anti-reflection coating to suppress the reflection loss of the infrared light that is utilized in the bottom cell.”
The tandem device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 29.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.929 V, a short-circuit current density of 19.5 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 77.55%. The result, which was confirmed by Fraunhofer ISE Callab, improves on the 28.3% efficiency Kaneka had previously achieved for a device with the same architecture, withe the main differences being the passivation layer and wafer thickness.
“This is the highest certified power conversion efficiency of 2T perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells using CZ wafer to our knowledge,” the company said, noting that they are currently considering moving to a four-terminal (T4) configuration for the further development of the device.
The company presented the new cell in “High efficiency perovskite/heterojunction crystalline silicon tandem solar cells: towards industrial-sized cell and module,” which was recently published in the Japanese Journal of Applied Physics.
Kanela has developed in the past what is still the second most efficient solar cell based on crystalline silicon – a 26.63%-efficient crystalline silicon solar cell featuring heterojunction and back-contact technology.
*The headline of the article was updated to reflect that the cell is a T2 device and not a T4 cell, as we previously reported.

First Solar said it is buying Swedish manufacturer Evolar AB in a bid to accelerate its efforts to develop tandem PV technology. The US solar module maker will initially pay around $38 million, but it might later pay an additional $42 million, subject to certain technical milestones being achieved in the future.
First Solar said in a statement on Friday that the acquisition will accelerate the development of next generation PV technology, including high efficiency tandem devices. It aims to integrate Evolar’s know-how with its existing research and development streams, intellectual property portfolio, and expertise in developing and commercially scaling thin-film PV.
“This acquisition supplements our existing R&D streams with expertise in thin film semiconductors that complement CadTel. We expect that it will accelerate our efforts to develop tandem technology that continues our commitment to ultra-low carbon, responsibly produced solar,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer of First Solar.
Evolar, which was founded in 2019 by now-insolvent CIGS thin-film manufacturer Solibro, focuses on developing solutions, including manufacturing equipment, to commercialize tandem solar technology with perovskite thin films.
The company says that its unique evaporation technology enables it to apply a thin-film layer of perovskite, known as “PV Power Booster” technology, to increase cell energy yield by 25% at a minimal cost. It is currently in the process of commercializing its turnkey production line for perovskite cells, which can be seamlessly integrated into silicon production lines to upgrade tandem cell production.
Last year, Evolar put its encapsulated, semitransparent standalone perovskite modules through a series of industry-standard accelerated reliability tests. The results suggested that the cells could stand up to 25 years if deployed outdoors.
Evolar holds the current world record for CIGS research solar cells with an efficiency of 23.6%. The company collaborates closely with Uppsala University and has established a research laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden. This marks First Solar’s first R&D facility in Europe, although the terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
After the transaction closes, around 30 of Evolar’s R&D staff will join First Solar and collaborate with the company’s team of approximately 60 scientists at its research technology center in Santa Clara, California, and development teams in Perrysburg, Ohio.
The Perrysburg facility, representing an investment of up to $370 million announced in October 2022, is believed to be the first of its scale in the Western hemisphere. It is expected to accelerate the development and production of advanced thin film PV and tandem PV modules and is scheduled to be completed in 2024.
