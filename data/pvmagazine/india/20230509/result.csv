https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/09/green-hydrogen-demand-to-reach-2-85-mmt-by-2030/,"ELECTROLYZER,FINANCE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 9, 2023",Green hydrogen demand to reach 2.85 MMT/annum by 2030,"India will reach annual green hydrogen demand of 2.85 MMT by 2030 if existing public and private sector momentum for green hydrogen continues and announced projects get implemented over the next few years. The nation will require a total investment of $57.6 billion to support this transition, according to a new report prepared under USAID’s South Asia Regional Energy Partnership (SAREP).
The report states fertilizer and export sectors will account for nearly 37% (1.02 MMT) and 29% (0.81 MMT) of the total 2.85 MMT green hydrogen demand. 
In this base case scenario, the report authors considered 10% of India’s refineries switch to green hydrogen, existing city gas distribution pipelines are blended with 10% green hydrogen, 50% of ammonia-based fertilizer imports are substituted by domestic green ammonia, and the country achieves 6% of demand from target importing countries by 2030.

To meet these green hydrogen demand estimates, the report says India will need 62 GW of additional renewable energy capacity, 29 GW of electrolyzer capacity, and 11 MMT per annum of ammonia infrastructure. This represents an estimated investment need of $36 billion, $15 billion, and $6 billion, respectively, by 2030.
Multiple oil public sector undertakings (PSUs) have announced internal targets for the adoption of green hydrogen. The report authors considered internal targets from leading oil PSUs in arriving at the estimates from oil refining and natural gas blending industries.
India is well positioned to emerge as a green hydrogen production hub, given its excellent renewable energy resources, including an installed capacity of 62+ GW solar and 42+ GW wind, existing consumption markets for hydrogen and its derivative products, and availability of suitable sites that can be developed into green hydrogen hubs. 
The report states these advantages will allow producers in India to achieve amongst the lowest levelized costs for green hydrogen and green ammonia, estimated at $3,800-4,800 per ton and $850-1,100 per ton, respectively.
The Indian government’s National Hydrogen Mission (NHM) has added further momentum to the growth of the sector. Under the mission, India targets a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT/annum by 2030.
The report states India will require an investment of $99.4 billion under the best-case scenario where it reaches annual green hydrogen demand of 5 MMT by 2030 as targeted under the NHM. In this scenario, it assumes the government will introduce significant mandates, subsidies, and other incentives to drive demand in green hydrogen sub-sectors to push production capacity to at least 5 MMT by 2030, in line with the NHM target.

Over 100 countries have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050, according to the United Nations. A recent study conducted by researchers at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that to totally decarbonize global electrical systems using solar in the 2050 to 2060 decade, the world would need to install 63.4 TW of PV. The findings of the study are published in “Photovoltaic Deployment Scenarios Toward Global Decarbonization: Role of Disruptive Technologies,” which appears in the journal Solar RRL.
The researchers modeled viable trajectories to supply > 60 TW of installed solar capacity to meet the goal of global decarbonization and studied the effect of a disruptive technology on deployment cost and market opportunity. They concluded that it is possible for production to scale up to the 2.9 TW to 3.7 TW needed per year within 10 to 15 years, a goal that will cost from $600 billion to $660 billion. The model includes using existing technology as well as mature technologies using silicon and CdTe. The study estimates that disruptive technologies offer a $1 to $2 trillion market opportunity and that the potential for cost savings could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.
The disruptive technologies include cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based PV, perovskites and tandem technologies. CdTe, which is the technology used by solar manufacturers First Solar and Toledo Solar, among others, currently represents about 16% of the U.S. solar market, NREL reports. Perovskites have challenges with long-term durability, but they offer advantages in manufacturing because they can be printed quickly and relatively inexpensively in a roll-to-roll method. Tandems pair technologies, such as perovskite on silicon, and several companies are beginning to manufacture tandems including TandemPV, CubicPV and OxfordPV.
According to NREL, tandem devices and minimodules are seeing efficiencies of as much as 31.25%. And while the efficiencies are promising, and other tandems continue to be developed, R&D is still needed in order for these devices to be manufactured at the scale needed to achieve terawatt capacities.
“There are economically viable trajectories that get to the needed manufacturing capacity to produce the amount of PV needed to completely decarbonize the world’s energy economy,” said Jao van de Lagemaat, director of the Chemistry and Nanoscience Center at the U.S. Department of Energy’s NREL. “Emerging technologies could potentially lower the cost of this deployment significantly if they get commercialized in time.”
To provide enough solar over the next two decades to decarbonize the global electrical system will require an “unprecedented ramp-up of production capacity”, but it is achievable, according to the NREL analysis.
The estimated target of 63.4 TW needed between 2050 and 2060 is a 60-fold increase in the amount of installed PV worldwide today. When the researchers say this is possible, it is under the assumption that investors protect their investments by avoiding stranded production assets. The model demonstrates that a sustainable ramp-up of manufacturing is possible, and that disruptive technologies will play a role in lowering capital costs.
Another assumption is that the lifespan of a PV module will increase considerably, possibly from an average of 30 years in 2020 to 50 years by 2040.
Looking beyond the 2050 to 2060 decade, van de Lagemaat, noted that module retirement and population growth will be the drivers of a “relatively modest demand” after global decarbonization is reached.
In addition to van de Lagemaat, the other authors are Michael Woodhouse from NREL and Billy Stanbery from Colorado School of Mines. NREL’s internal Laboratory Directed Research and Development program funded the research.

École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) researchers have developed a thermally integrated photoelectrochemical device to generate hydrogen through concentrated solar irradiation. The 7m-diameter parabolic dish concentrates sunlight into a 144 cm^2 reactor where water is pumped, achieving a solar-to-hydrogen device-level efficiency of greater than 20% at an H2 production rate of >2.0 kW. The scientists published their findings from the project, which is first system-level demonstration of solar hydrogen generation, in a recent edition of Nature Energy. Heat and oxygen are recovered and used, and an EPFL start-up, SoHHytec, is commercializing the system to scale up the technology.
Sapienza University of Rome scientists have collaborated with Sorbonne University, CNRS, and SISSA to create a phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium at high pressures and low temperatures. They discovered that the atomic metallic hydrogen phase forms at 577(4) GPa, and the molecular hydrogen transforms from a metallic phase to another molecular structure (phase VI) at 410(20) GPa. The researchers said in a recent paper in Nature Physics that anharmonic vibrations of nuclei can make the metallic hydrogen phase stable at much larger pressures than previously estimated.
Plug Power has delivered three containerized electrolyzers to Hungary-based Ganzair for two projects. One is the Bukkabrany Solar PV Park project, which will generate 850 kg of hydrogen daily to be mixed with the local gas pipeline to heat homes and businesses. The other project, Aquamarine, will test the use of hydrogen for storage purposes. The New York-based company said that this will demonstrate the long-duration energy storage potential of green hydrogen. The 3 1 MW containerized electrolyzer systems will be installed later this year. These are Plug’s first electrolyzer systems delivered in the EU and are expected to be the first in operation.
Glenfarne and Samsung Engineering have launched a collaboration agreement to complete feasibility studies for multiple green hydrogen and ammonia projects in Chile, as part of Glenfarne’s recently announced Hydrogen Fuels Initiative. “Green Pegasus, the first project being developed as part of the agreement, will have up to two gigawatts of solar PV installed capacity and is estimated to produce 459 kilotons (kton) of green ammonia and 89 kton of green hydrogen annually. Green Pegasus will primarily focus on export to Asia, particularly South Korea, and Europe, where Glenfarne maintains several business and commercial partners,” said Glenfarne.

An international research team has utilized a machine learning algorithm known as XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to predict PV adoption among homeowners. This algorithm consists of a distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library that can help accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models.
“We further dive into the modeling detail of XGBoost and decompose its enhanced prediction performance over logistic regression into two factors: variable interaction and nonlinearity,” the scientists said. “We last show the potential of XGBoost in reducing customer acquisition costs, and then the ability to identify new market opportunities for PV companies.”
According to them, this new methodology could help solar companies lower customer acquisition costs and other soft costs associated with the residential PV business.
They compared the performance of the proposed algorithm with the logistic regression approach, which the researchers described as the most commonly used method to analyze differences between PV adopters and non-adopters. “Our logistic regression model with nine original and highly visible household features successfully predicts 71% of out-of-sample PV adoption statuses,” they further explained. “The model correctly identified 66% of adopters and 75% of non-adopters.”
The adapted algorithm, according to the research group, was able to offer better results than the logistic regression in predictive performance. “The predictive model correctly predicted 87% of the two PV adoption statuses, compared to 71% for logistic regression,” they added. “The correct adopter rate increased from 66 to 87% and the correct non-adopter rate increased from 75 to 88%.”
They attributed the superior performance of the machine learning-based approach to the fact that it integrates complex nonlinearity and variable interaction and considers factors such as summer bills, household income, and homeowner’s age, among others.
“The advantage of using these variables is that they are highly accessible so that PV companies can collect data on them with little cost,” they also note. “Another reason to explain the improved performance of XGBoost is that it can potentially recover key latent information embedded in the data. “For example, including geographical information such as the state or county of the respondent increases the prediction accuracy of logistic regression to some extent.”
The research group estimated that the novel methodology can help PV companies reduce customer acquisition costs by about 15% or $0.07/Watt. It also explained that data mining and machine learning could also help reduce soft costs for contract cancellation, supply chain management, labor assignment, and permitting and inspection issues.
It described the new methodology in the study “Machine learning reduces soft costs for residential solar photovoltaics,” published in scientific reports. The research group is formed by scientists coming from the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Florida State University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Renmin University of China.
