So understanding how different site and installation conditions affect the build up of dust and droppings on a module surface is valuable knowledge for the PV industry.
A group of scientists led by the Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu, India, had this in mind when they came up with a simple yet effective way to study the effects of different types of soiling on PV modules. The scientists gathered samples of five different types of soil (black soil, desert soil, red soil, alluvial soil, laterite soil) as well as coal dust and bird droppings, from various locations in India. The samples, in different amounts ranging from 10g to 50g, were then shaken and brushed onto the surface of PV modules, and the modules were tested using a sun simulator.
The results showed that at all tilt angles, bird droppings had the largest impact on module performance, with the 50g sample taking away more than 80% of the modules’ efficiency – a considerably larger loss than any of the dust or soil samples caused.
The study also found that the physical properties of the soiling material play a larger role than the angle of the modules in deciding the soiling rate. The results are discussed in full in the paper Experimental analysis on the impacts of soil deposition and bird droppings on the thermal performance of photovoltaic panels, published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering.
The group says that its study will help contribute to a better overall understanding of the effects of soiling on PV modules. This knowledge could help project developers better assess site conditions and avoid locating a project in regions where soiling will be particularly heavy, or ensuring that appropriate mitigation measures can be included from the start.
They note, however, that the results of this study can only be applied to regions with a hot, dry climate similar to Vellore in India on which the simulation conditions were based – Further, climate-specific studies are needed to draw similar conclusions for other climate types.

Israeli inverter manufacturer SolarEdge is unveiling two new power optimizers for residential and commercial PV systems at Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany.
“In the residential segment, the company is introducing the S500A power optimizer for short strings,” said SolarEdge. “This new product allows for a cost-efficient design of smaller rooftop systems with higher power modules. Following a growing demand for higher power modules across the markets in Europe, the S500A can be used on systems with as few as six modules using the SolarEdge home short string three phase inverter and the SolarEdge home single phase wave/hub inverter, or 10 modules using any SolarEdge residential three phase inverter.”
The S500A has a rated input DC power of 500 W with a maximum efficiency of 99.5% and a weighted efficiency of 98.6%. The dimensions of the S500A are 129 mm x 165 mm x 45 mm, and it weighs 790 g.
“For the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, the company is introducing the 2:1 S1400 power optimizer for high-input, bifacial, and high-power 700W modules, including G12 modules,” SolarEdge said. “The increased output current allows the PV system to be designed with fewer, yet more powerful strings, resulting in a typical around 30% reduction in DC balance of system costs.”
The S1400 has a rated input DC power of 1.4 kW with a maximum efficiency of 99.5% and a weighted efficiency of 98.8%. The dimensions of the S1400 are 129 mm x 155 mm x 52 mm, and it weighs 1.087 kg. The device is designed to connect to two PV modules in series and includes a 25-year warranty. The optimizers come with an IP68 enclosure and support a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V.
“Both new power optimizers include SolarEdge’s multi-layered suite of safety features,” the manufacturer stated. “The SafeDC feature allows the PV systems’ DC voltage to be automatically reduced to touch-safe levels (1V DC per module), in grid failures or when the inverter is shut down. The Rapid Shutdown feature enables installers to activate SafeDC at the flip of a switch, discharging the conductors to safe voltage levels within just 30 seconds.”

LEAG is looking to build a major renewable energy hub in a bid to replace baseload power currently provided by lignite-fired coal generation plants operating in southeastern Germany, near the Polish border.
The hub will comprise up to 14 GW of solar and wind energy generation paired with 2 GWh to 3 GWh of battery energy storage, as well as 2 GW of green hydrogen production.
The first large-scale project was announced this week at Intersolar Europe in Munich. The coal miner signed an agreement with NYSE-listed battery specialist ESS to build a 50 MW/500 MWh battery system to help replace the 2.5 MW Boxberg coal-fired power station in Saxony, eastern Germany.
It will be commissioned in 2027 at a cost of €200 million ($218.9 million). The initial investment will come from LEAG and partners with potential subsidies at a later stage.
“A key requirement for our transformation into Germany’s Green Powerhouse is the deployment of cost-effective long-duration energy storage,” said LEAG CEO Thorsten Kramer.
In addition to long-duration BESS, LEAG will also install short-duration lithium-ion batteries on site. The company, a leading operator of large-scale lignite mining and coal-fired generation in eastern Germany, expects to demonstrate a renewable energy system at scale to replace baseload coal generation, while using battery storage and hydrogen to replace natural gas for grid balancing.
“If you want to replace natural gas, you need to have long-duration storage,” Aland Greenshields, director of Europe at ESS, told pv magazine.
Greenshields stated that the company’s current operations include an 80 MW fully automated manufacturing line near Portland, Oregon. The opportunity for significant deals would enable them to expand their operations. Greenshields identified the primary challenge as increasing the pace of scaling up.
ESS has developed a battery technology that uses abundant materials like iron, salt, and water, resulting in batteries that are safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. It claims that these iron-flow batteries do not deteriorate with usage and are resistant to the formation of dendrites, which are needle-like filaments that can lead to battery malfunctions and lithium-ion fires.
ESS systems have already been deployed in commercial microgrid systems, with utility-scale projects now underway in the United States and Australia. The definitive agreements and financial close for the 50 MW system at the Boxberg Power Plant site are anticipated in the third quarter of this year, with commissioning expected in 2027.
LEAG and ESS have joined the Energy Resilience Leadership Group (ERLG), a multi-stakeholder initiative led by Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy and Siemens Energy. The group was launched at the 2023 Munich Security Conference to enhance Europe’s energy resilience.

The state’s power generation will reach 1,73,679 million units (MUs) by FY 2029-30 considering an average growth rate of 5% annually from 2021-22 FY till FY 2027-28. The share of 50% renewables by 2030 represents 86,839 MUs.  
In FY 2021-22, renewable energy, including solar, wind, bioenergy, and hydro, accounted for 22% (26,202 MUs) of the state’s total energy generation of 117,553 MUs. Coal power was the single largest source in the power mix with a share of 70%. The share of nuclear and gas in the state’s total electricity generation stood at 8% and 1%, respectively.  
To meet the 2030 target of 50% RE, an additional 60,637 MUs of RE will need to be generated. This represents an addition of around 28 GW of wind energy capacity or 32 GW of solar energy capacity and means that in the next six years starting with FY 2023-24 approximately 4.8–5.5 GW of renewable energy capacity needs to go on-grid. The average annual RE capacity addition in Tamil Nadu from 2018 to 2023 was 1.21 GW. 
Assuming there will be no change in the generation of nuclear energy and gas energy, coal energy will represent a share of 45% or 77,597 MUs in 2030. 
In 2021-22, coal power was at 82,109 MUs. To meet the 2030 target of 50% renewable energy in total generation, coal power will need to reduce by 4,511 MUs or 5% compared to the 2021-22 values. The bulk of this reduction will need to come from the state electricity generation and distribution company TANGEDCO. 
The 50% RE target, therefore, implies the need to strategically reduce coal power generation and sourcing. This may need a combination of retiring some of the older coal power plants operated by TANGEDCO and reducing coal power purchases by central generation stations and other sources.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/19/virtual-power-plants-roll-out-across-the-u-s/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 19, 2023",Virtual power plants roll out across the U.S.,"From pv magazine USA
VPP pilot programs have run for years in the United States. The market is maturing as the technology competes with centralized utility scale power plants as a low-cost alternative with benefits to the grid and end-users alike.
A VPP is a virtual aggregation of small-scale, distributed energy resources (DERs) including PV, energy storage, electric vehicle chargers, and demand-responsive devices such as water heaters, thermostats, and appliances. VPP technology has shown immediate promise in replacing natural gas “peaker plants” on grids, offering additional capacity during times of peak electricity demand.
Over the last decade, the US has spent more than $120 billion on 100 GW of new generation capacity, mainly for resource adequacy. A study by Boston-based consultancy Brattle Group estimates utilities could save $35 billion by 2033 by focusing on VPPs for peaker capacity.
“By deploying grid assets more efficiently, an aggregation of distributed resources lowers the cost of power for everybody, especially VPP participants,” says Jigar Shah, the director of the US Department of Energy (DoE) Loans Programs Office.
Brattle Group’s 400 MW resource adequacy study considered a utility with 1.7 million residential customers. The power company had 5.7 GW of gross peak demand and 3.6 GW of net peak demand from solar and wind resources. Its aim was to generate half its electricity from renewables by 2030. The study found VPP peaker usage would be 40% to 60% cheaper than alternatives, including gas peakers and grid-scale batteries.

Brattle Group estimated 60 GW of VPP deployment could meet US resource adequacy needs through 2033 for $15 billion to $35 billion less than the cost of alternatives. That level of VPP deployment could also provide more than $20 billion worth of emissions and resilience benefits over the decade.
“VPPs do more than provide decarbonization and grid services – they increasingly give grid operators a large scale and utility grade alternative to new generation and system buildout, through automated efficiency, capacity support, and non-wire alternatives,” says Shah.
Project Hestia
The DoE Loan Programs Office has supported VPPs, recently proposing a $3 billion conditional loan to energy-as-a-service provider Sunnova to roll out its “Project Hestia” nationwide. The plan aims to increase solar and VPP service access for disadvantaged communities that could otherwise be unable to secure residential solar loans. Sunnova will receive indirect, partially guaranteed cash flows for loans backing customer accounts.
Eligible households must use Sunnova’s energy management system, accessible via smartphones or other electronic devices. The system will recommend demand response behavior, enabling customers to reduce energy costs while helping balance the grid during peak demand.
If issued, the DoE package would support loan origination for solar, storage, and other Sunnova adaptive home technology with VPP capability. The guarantees could drive up to $5 billion in loan originations, saving on interest and reducing the weighted average cost of capital.
“Project Hestia would make possible a historic private sector investment in disadvantaged American communities and energy infrastructure,” says Sunnova CEO William J. Berger.
Market tailwinds
Shifting US market conditions are further driving VPP adoption. The $369 billion of climate and energy spending in the Inflation Reduction Act includes many requirements for serving energy communities: disadvantaged communities crucial to an equitable energy transition. Projects in designated energy communities are eligible for an additional 10% investment tax credit, supplementing the 30% base credit for renewables projects.
Other states are beginning to follow California in trimming back or removing net energy metering (NEM), a rate mechanism instrumental in launching the US residential solar market. Older NEM rates offered customers the full retail value for every kilowatt-hour of electricity fed to the grid. California’s NEM 3.0 rate essentially kills the value of exported energy and other states will follow suit. Solar installers have warned this could prompt a market based on self-consumption from batteries, with resulting grid defection doing little to help network flexibility. VPPs, however, offer grid services including demand response, peak demand shaving, and more. Customers can be incentivized to trim energy use or export power during peak grid hours, making for a nimbler network.
Resilience
VPPs also reinforce grid resilience in zones affected by climate change-related extreme weather. Residential solar installer Sunrun has been selected to deploy a 17 MW network of solar-plus-storage VPPs in Puerto Rico.
In the wake of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, the Caribbean island’s government created a framework for DERs with 2019’s Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act.
Sunrun will enroll Puerto Rican customers this year to begin VPP operation next year. The company says customers will bank power cost savings and be compensated for offering battery storage capacity to the grid now run by US-Canadian joint venture LUMA Energy. The 10-year VPP program enables customers to opt out, Sunrun says.
“We’re solving energy insecurity on the island by switching the model so that solar energy is generated on rooftops and stored in batteries to power each home and then shared with neighbors, creating a clean, shared-energy economy,” says Sunrun CEO Mary Powell.

According to recent forecasts, the solar market will triple in size over the next five years, amounting to a total installed solar capacity of 378 GW by 2028. However, this rapid growth brings some challenges, as noted in “Build Together: Rethinking solar project delivery,” released by McKinsey. The report notes that the solar industry faces significant construction and labor shortages that could worsen over the next three to five years, and demand for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) will also grow rapidly.
Based on McKinsey’s analysis, to serve utility-scale solar projects, EPC capacity would have to almost triple to meet the anticipated demand of approximately 50 GW installed in 2027. Instead, the report suggests rethinking traditional practices around project delivery.
To capture the potential value of U.S. renewables, estimated at $700 to $800 billion in capital investments to build onshore wind and solar projects through 2030, EPCs “should establish new approaches to partnerships, risk ownership and contracting, workforce development, and digital and technology adoption,” the report contends.
EPC and labor shortages are a top challenge for renewables players. The report notes that these challenges have overtaken other obstacles such as limited access to land and permits, inflation and commodity price volatility, and interconnection. As a result, collaboration is key and will be achieved through strategic partnerships, risk ownership and contracting, workforce development, and digital and technology adoption. One recommendation in the report is for EPCs and developers to work more closely together, integrating engineering times and promoting transparency on pricing and risk.

By making such changes, the market could shift to new contracting structures where EPCs and developers could pursue portfolio partnerships. Both parties would be incentivized to take on supply chain and workforce challenges. According to the report, leading developers have locked in capacity with two or three core EPC partners on average, which brings benefits to both sides. Such partnerships can range from nonbinding relationship-based commitments to formal master service agreements with bilateral contractual commitments. But the overall benefit is that both partners share common objectives, such as increased visibility and joint planning of project pipelines, early engineering involvement and continuous improvement of designs, and collaborative workforce attraction and development programs.
The McKinsey report indicates that rapid market growth opens the door to new players in the renewables industry. For example, regulated utilities are increasingly interested in developing renewables to take advantage of the alternative Solar Production Tax Credit within the Inflation Reduction Act. Diversified EPCs are also expanding into solar. And local and regional contractors of all types are being retrained as solar installers, thus entering the woefully deficient solar workforce.
As partnerships are formed and both risk and opportunity are shared, stakeholders will have to shift their contracting approach to streamline project delivery and reduce disruptions to agreements. Contracting itself will become more collaborative as the stakeholders adjust to sharing the responsibilities and challenges. The report notes that collaborative contracting is used in other capital-intensive industries, where pilots have improved both costs and schedules by 15% to 20% versus traditional contracts, according to prior McKinsey research.

3Sun, Enel Green Power’s PV manufacturer based in Catania, Italy, released a new series of n-type heterojunction (HJT) solar modules this week at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany.
“The modules, set to come to market in 2024, are based on 3SUN CORE-H, the tried and tested heterojunction technology (HJT) entirely developed by 3SUN, and therefore 100% European,” the company said in a statement.
The 3SUN CORE-H technology, according to 3Sun, combines crystalline silicon with amorphous silicon layers and ensures superior efficiency, performance, and reliability compared to other products in the market, for utility-scale and distributed generation installations.
The M40 series for rooftop applications includes nine versions, with power ratings ranging from 440 W to 480 W and power efficiencies from 22.9% to 25.0%. The modules measure 1,754 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weigh 21 kg.
They feature an anodized aluminum frame, 3.2 mm of tempered glass, and a white backsheet. The products operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V and have an IP68 junction box. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.24% per degree Celsius and an operating temperature range from -40 C to 85 C.
The series comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is reportedly 1.0%, and the 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 91.8% of the nominal output power.
3Sun offers a Bold version of the rooftop series, which maximizes practical and aesthetic requirements. It has an output power ranging from 430 W to 470 W and an efficiency of up to 24.5%.
In addition, 3Sun launched a utility-scale series at Intersolar Europe with power outputs ranging from 650 W to 680 W, a bifaciality factor of 95%, and an efficiency of up to 24.63%.
The three new products will be available starting in 2024. 3Sun manufactures the modules in its gigafactory in Catania, which currently has a 200 MW capacity. A capacity expansion to 3 GW of heterojunction modules is scheduled to be operational in July 2024.
