Jash Energy, the joint venture, has a solar tracker factory with an annual production capacity of 3 GW in Mundra, Gujarat. The factory spans more than 16 acres of land and will produce all major components for Arctech solar tracker products.
The factory is modeled after Arctech’s existing Chinese manufacturing base, in both the automatic production line and manufacturing management system. It is equipped with an advanced automatic production line for Arctech’s patented torque tube, stated the company.  With the official launch of the factory, Arctech now caters to the entire lifecycle of its tracker systems in India, including structural, mechanical, and electrical design as well as construction, operation and maintenance. 
Arctech’s shipments in the region recently hit the 3.5 GW milestone. According to Wood Mackenzie Power and Renewables, Arctech was India’s largest supplier of solar trackers in 2020 and held a 45% market share in 2021. 
“Strategically located in Mundra, the largest private port in India, Jash Energy will have easy access to Western, Middle East, and African markets. Mundra also provides an ideal base for traders due to its relatively short logistics connectivity to the northwestern hinterland. It is easily accessible from all major industrial destinations in Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh for the export of cargo,” the company stated.
Arctech has added more than 200 jobs to the local community by setting up this factory. It plans to offer technical training for local employees. It also intends to go deeper in vertically integrated production, including the use of local steel for trackers made in India. In addition, it aims to work with domestic steel manufacturing partners to develop solar trackers.

A cumulative capacity of 100 MW each will be allotted in Nagpur, Amravati, Aurangabad, Konkan, Nashik and Pune districts. Individual solar project capacity will be 2 MW to 10 MW in size, as per the availability of substation connectivity.
Bidders must arrange land for the projects. It could be their own land or leased land near the 11 kV substation owned by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL).
The prospective developers will design, install, test and commission the solar project, along with power evacuation arrangement. It will also provide operation and maintenance of the solar project and evacuation arrangement for a period of 25 years.
In addition, MAHAGENCO will sign power purchase agreements with the selected solar power developers. It will also sign a back-to-back power sale agreement with MSEDCL.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/30/sharp-begins-developing-zinc-air-flow-batteries-for-renewables-storage/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 30, 2022",Sharp begins developing zinc-air flow batteries for renewables storage,"From pv magazine Global
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp said this week it has started developing zinc-air flow battery (ZAFB) for the storage of large-scale renewable energy projects.
“Based on the zinc-air secondary battery technology that we have developed over many years, we aim to establish a low-cost, high-capacity energy storage technology with a new ‘flow’ design,” the company said in a statement.
Sharp said the new devices will be safer than lithium-ion batteries, as the electrolyte in which the zinc is soaked is a water-based liquid, and the possibility of ignition is extremely low.
A ZAFB consists of two electrodes – a Zn anode and an air cathode. The anode and cathode are separated by a separator allowing ions to transfer across the cell. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution is commonly used as an electrolyte.

“In batteries with a ‘flow’ design, the cell and the tank are independent of each other, so it is possible to easily increase the capacity by increasing the size of the tank,” Sharp said. “During charging, zinc oxide (ZnO) chemically changes to zinc to store electricity and, in the discharging phase, when zinc returns to zinc oxide by the action of oxygen contained in the air, the stored electrons are released, so electricity can be extracted.”
The company said the research project has the support of Japan’s Ministry of Environment. It did not provide any additional technical details.
