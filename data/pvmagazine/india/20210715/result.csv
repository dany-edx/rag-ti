The projects are to be interconnected at two designated substations in Gadag and Koppal districts, with the capacity award for each substation being limited to 600 MW. 
SECI shall sign a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidders. The power procured by SECI has been provisioned to be sold to the different buying entities of India.
Developers can submit a single bid for any quantity from 50 MW to the whole of the tendered capacity (1200 MW), in multiples of 10 MW only. Only the PV modules included in the first list under the Approved Models and Manufacturers of Solar Photovoltaic Modules (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order are allowed for the projects.
Already commissioned projects will not be considered. However, projects under construction or projects that are not yet commissioned will be considered in case these projects are not already accepted under any other central or state schemes.
Connectivity and long-term open access shall be in the scope of the solar power developer.
Karnataka Solar Power Development Corporation Limited will be responsible for providing the required land for the project to the successful bidders for a period not less than the complete term of PPA. It shall provide possession of land to the developer within six months of the award of the contract.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/15/indigrid-acquires-100-mw-solar-assets-from-fotowatio-renewable/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ANDHRA PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 15, 2021",IndiGrid acquires 100 MW solar assets from Fotowatio Renewable,"India Grid Trust (IndiGrid), India’s first power infrastructure investment trust (InvIT), has announced the completion of 100 MW of solar assets from Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) for INR 6.6 billion. It now holds a 100% stake in Fotowatio Renewable Ventures’s two special-purpose vehicles operating these solar assets. 
With this acquisition, IndiGrid’s asset portfolio will now consist of 14 diversified power projects, including 40 transmission lines (about 7,570 ckm long), 11 substations (13,550 MVA capacity), and 100 MW of solar power plants across 18 states and one Union Territory. 
IndiGrid’s acquisition of its first solar asset marks the first renewable energy acquisition by any InvIT in the country. 
The 100 MW assets are fully operational and located in a high radiation zone in the 400 MW Ananthapuramu Solar Park in Andhra Pradesh. The projects benefit from a fixed-tariff, 25-year power purchase agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) as the counterparty. The projects have been operational for over two years.
“This transaction is in line with IndiGrid’s strategy to acquire solar projects with long-term power purchase agreements, operational track record, and financially strong counterparties/off-takers such as SECI and NTPC. In addition to long contract life and low-risk cash flows, this asset complements IndiGrid’s transmission portfolio with synergies on operations and regulatory establishments,” IndiGrid said in a BSE filing. 
The acquisition funded by a combination of debt, internal accruals and recent Rights Issue would boost IndiGrid’s distribution per unit (DPU). 
Commenting on the acquisition, Harsh Shah, Chief Executive Officer of IndiGrid, said “We are excited to diversify our portfolio and add the first set of solar assets. This acquisition is DPU accretive and would result in healthy addition to our net distributable cash flow. While power transmission assets remain at the core of IndiGrid’s growth strategy, we believe such attractive opportunities to acquire good quality solar projects ties in well with our strategy of providing predictable cash flows to our investors and reinforces our commitment to be a socially responsible organization.” 
Cyril Amarchand and Mangaldas, PriceWater Coopers and Mahindra Teqo advised IndiGrid on this transaction. Greenstone Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor on the transaction representing FRV.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/15/earth-sciences-ministry-revisiting-weather-forecast-approach-to-suit-solar-sector-needs/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MONITORING AND CONTROL,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 15, 2021",Earth sciences ministry revisiting weather forecast approach to suit solar sector needs,"India’s Ministry of Earth Sciences is working to strengthen the weather forecast approaches to suit the needs of the solar and wind energy sectors.
There has been a demand from industry stakeholders to provide weather forecasts on a much advanced basis as extreme weather can impact renewable power generation and demand.
A workshop organized by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, intended to address such emerging demand from the wind and solar energy sector.
Speaking at the workshop, M. Rajeevan, Secretary, The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), said, “Apart from day-ahead (24-hour lead) forecast at 15 minutes interval, there are often queries from the stakeholders about forecast of wind, cloud covers and shortwave incoming radiation etc with a few weeks lead time and even sometimes with a few months lead time.” 
In its 2021-26 plan period, the ministry will further strengthen forecasting activities related to the energy sector, he stated.  
The MoES institutes like the IITM Pune, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), and the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) have been issuing meteorological forecasts for wind and solar energy forecast to the stakeholders. 
The forecasts have been found to be much skillful on a daily scale. However, due to increasing demand and aspirations by the stakeholders, a need has been felt to revisit the approaches currently being used in wind and solar energy forecasts, said the minister. 
The minister stressed on increasing involvement of the Earth Sciences Ministry with the renewable energy sector by way of providing weather forecasts to suit the needs of the wind and solar energy sectors. 
“We have already started our work to help the industry, we want to improve further….Based on the discussions in the workshop, the MoES will decide upon, and IITM and NCMRWF will implement methods to provide forecasts as per the industry’s requirement, he added.
Rajeevan also highlighted the difficulties faced in meeting the requirements of wind and solar energy sectors. “It needs very, very highly localized and location-specific forecast. A very high-frequency forecast in every 15-20 mins is also needed.”
The day-to-day variations in weather play a dominant role in power generation, distribution, and load forecasting, said Director General of India Meteorological Department, Dr. Mohapatra, adding that “weather and climate forecast plays a significant role and can improve the economy in the power sectors.”
Ravi Nanjundiah, Director of IITM, Pune stated accurate forecasts are imperative to achieve the Government’s ambitious goal of having an installed capacity of 175 GW from renewable resources by 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/15/portable-hydrogen-fuel-cell-generator-with-power-output-of-400-w/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 15, 2021",Portable hydrogen fuel cell generator with power output of 400 W,"From pv magazine International
Estonia-based hydrogen fuel cell specialist PowerUP Energy Technologies has unveiled a 400 W portable fuel cell-based generator that can be used in off-grid applications.
The generator, dubbed UP400, is sold at a price of €6,500 and is claimed to have a minimum lifetime of 5,000 working hours. It operates at temperatures ranging from -20 to 52 degrees Celsius.
The device has a weight of 10kg and is based on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell technology which works in three different steps: first the electrons are stripped from the hydrogen molecules through a catalytic process; then the positively charged protons pass through the membrane to the cathode and the negatively charged electrons are forced through a circuit to generate electricity; and finally, the electrons combine with the protons and oxygen from the air to generate by-products such as water and heat.
The hydrogen is provided by external cylinders and its fuel cells work in parallel with a battery module, with the former acting as the main power source during operation. The solution is claimed to be ideal for sailing and yachting, camper vans or other recreational vehicles, and off-grid homes.
“Whether you own a yacht, a camper van, or need a power back-up for your off-grid home, we have a powerful solution for everyone,” said the company’s CEO, Ivar Kruusenberg. “These smart generators can be combined with batteries, solar panels, or even wind turbines to create a smart grid system.”
