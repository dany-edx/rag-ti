The project will supply up to 52 tons of green hydrogen annually for power generation and energy storage application.
Spirare Energy will manage the project’s engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), with Ohmium providing its hydrogen electrolyzers.
Ohmium International, through its subsidiary in India, manufactures modular interlocking PEM electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The company aims to make India a nucleus for global hydrogen-based green energy solutions with R&D centers in Silicon Valley (USA) and Bengaluru (India).
“Green hydrogen offers India the opportunity to become a global energy leader–and with Spirare and NTPC, we’re delivering on that potential. NTPC is pioneering the green hydrogen sector in India, and we’re thrilled that they are utilizing our Made in India electrolyzers,” said Arne Ballantine, CEO of Ohmium International. “We look forward to showing how our modular, high-volume, low-cost PEM electrolyzers can scale rapidly and efficiently to reach megawatt to gigawatt applications.”
Ohmium PEM electrolyzers can be stacked to significantly reduce installation and maintenance costs while enabling unlimited configurations of deployment sizes. Ohmium’s proprietary electrolyzer stack technology can sustain a differential pressure across the membrane without compromise, which enhances cost-effective operation.

The three developers signed PPAs with M.P. Power Management Co. Ltd (MPPMCL) for a total of 278 MW. They will execute the project on a build, own, and operate basis.
SJVN has secured 90 MW of the floating solar project (FSP) at INR 3.26 ($0.041)/kWh. NHDC landed 88 MW.
The projects are set for commissioning within 15 months from the signing of the PPA.

The project was commissioned in stages, with its last-part capacity of 48.8 MW starting to feed electricity into the grid recently.
NTPC developed the PV project under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s (MNRE) Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme Phase II. It won the project through viability gap funding (VGF) based competitive bidding in an auction by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) in 2019.
Adani Infra (India) Ltd executed the project under EPC with land mode, wherein it arranged the land required for the project.
As per the conditions of the CPSU Scheme, the project employs domestically produced PV modules and cells and receives VGF from MNRE.

Aces Delta, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development LLC, plans to build an underground storage project with a capacity of 300 GWh in Delta, Utah.
Advanced Clean Energy Storage I, LLC recently won a $504.4 million loan guarantee from US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office for the construction of the storage facility. The project will store hydrogen generated by the Intermountain Power Agency’s IPP Renewed Project – an 840 MW hydrogen-capable gas turbine combined cycle power plant located in the area.
“The plant will initially run on a blend of 30% green hydrogen and 70% natural gas starting in 2025 and incrementally expand to 100% green hydrogen by 2045,” Aces Delta said in a statement.
US-based contractor WSP USA has secured an engineering, procurement and construction management contract (EPCM) to build the two underground hydrogen storage caverns, each with a capacity of 150 GWh.
“This stored green hydrogen becomes an energy reserve that can be released to produce fuel for electric power generation at any time,” said WSP USA.
The storage caverns and the power plant will form the Advanced Clean Energy Storage hub, which Aces Delta says will convert renewable energy via 220 MW of electrolyzers to produce up to 100 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. The development of the project began in May 2019.
“Central Utah is the ideal location for this project, and Utah is a business-friendly state for projects like this,” said Craig Broussard, CEO of Magnum. “Magnum’s site adjacent to the Intermountain Power Project is positioned to take full advantage of existing regional electricity grid connections, fully developed transportation infrastructure, ample solar and wind development capacity, a skilled workforce currently transitioning away from coal, and, of course, the unique salt dome opportunity.”
Magnum Development also owns a domal-quality salt formation in the western United States and five operational salt caverns for liquid fuel storage.
