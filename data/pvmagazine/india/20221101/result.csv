Three, including NHDC, SJVN, and Tata Power Solar, bid for 200 MW each. The rest four (Eden Renewables, Hinduja, Mahindra Susten, and NTPC) have made bids for 100 MW each, Avaneesh Shukla, executive engineer with Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Ltd (RUMSL) told pv magazine.
“It’s a good response with respect to floating solar being a new technology, I think we will set a trend for others to follow across the world,” said Shukla. 
Financial bids will open on November 7.
Speaking about the massive response to the tender, Bridge To India Managing Director Vinay Rustagi said, “Madhya Pradesh has a well-established and streamlined procurement process consistently attracting strong bidding interest. But there is another factor at play here—project developers are anxious to build a pipeline as auction volumes have dried up this year. In the nine months to September, only 7,600 MW renewable capacity had been allocated, which is a five-year low.”
RUMSL, a joint venture of the Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd and Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd, is implementing the 600 MW floating solar park at the Omkareshwar Reservoir under the Centre’s Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPP) Scheme. Upon completion, the park will be India’s largest floating PV plant and one of the world’s biggest floating solar installations. 
M.P. Power Management Company Limited will purchase the entire 600 MW of power generated from the project. 
The floating solar project is being constructed in two 300 MW phases on the reservoir formed by the Omkareshwar dam across the Narmada river. RUMSL has already issued letters of award to NHDC, AMP Energy, and SJVN to develop a total capacity of 278 MW in the first phase.

Using a tubular dry-cleaning method, the machine, called Eco Bot, cleans vertically by combining airflow and friction from the anti-static microfibre cloth to remove the dust off the solar panel. 
“The bot by default travels at about 0.3 metre per second. The speed of the robot and the cleaning unit can be modified based on the amount and type of dust,” Suraj Mohan, co-founder of Solavio told pv magazine. 
The bot can be manually shifted to serve other rows of panels. 
The use of antistatic microfiber cloth for cleaning and even mechanical load distribution ensures no physical damage to the panels. “We have even used certified global third-party agencies to test and certify the bot over an accelerated period (10,000 cycles) covering the life of the plant,” said Mohan.
The bot has been designed with a unique All Wheel Drive (AWD) mechanism. “With the help of the onboard sensors and our proprietary algorithm, it can overcome deviations across x-y-z axis between panels or tables. For deviations beyond certain limits, we recommend the use of our proprietary connecting bridges to ensure smooth operations of the bot,” said Mohan.
The bot is powered by an onboard Lithium battery and can travel as much as 2.5 km on a single charge. “There are no limitations on continuous use, thanks to our onboard electronics cooling chamber,” said Mohan.
The battery uses Japanese cell technology and can be charged with a normal AC charger, an AC fast charger, an onboard PV panel, or a dedicated docking station in the field.
The Eco Bot is cloud-based, enabling remote monitoring, control, and spare part management. LORA-enabled technology ensures security for both the bot and data across the network. The bots can be controlled via the onboard buttons, a remote fob, or the Internet of Things (IoT) dashboard.

Scientists led by the Public University of Navarra in Spain have conducted a detailed life cycle analysis of solar PV technologies, comparing their impacts in various categories to those of electricity generated by other renewables technologies, as well as fossil fuels or nuclear.
In terms of CO2 and equivalent emissions, the study finds that solar’s impact today is much lower than all coal and gas generation (including with carbon capture), slightly lower than wind and slightly above nuclear. And while the impact level of the latter two is expected to remain at a similar level through to 2050, the study notes much more opportunity for solar to reduce its emissions in this timeframe.
The study, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, finds that land use is the only category where solar can have a comparable to that of fossil fuels, although solar overall would still require less land and have much lower long-term impacts on that land. Improvements to rooftop and otherwise integrated PV generation, as well approaches such as agrivoltaics, are set to improve this in the coming years.
The study still notes, however, that competition for land with food production, as well as public acceptance, should be carefully considered in the planning of new, large-scale PV installations.
The study also examined different solar technologies including crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride and CIGS thin-film, noting that silicon comes with the highest emissions, but others have larger concerns on availability of materials such as indium and tellurium. Silicon PV will have to contend with the availability of silver, but since alternatives to this material are already on offer commercially, the study does not expect this to have a major impact.
The authors also sought to take perovskite solar cells into account, as an emerging PV technology likely to see large-scale production well before 2050. They note that a proper life-cycle assessment for this technology is difficult to conduct, since it is far from clear the exact pathway and material construction it will take. But the presence of lead mean it will likely have a raised impact on human health categories, while the ease of processing would give it potential for very low emissions and environmental impacts.
The study’s other key conclusions are that the concentration of almost all PV materials manufacturing in China could present a further challenge to solar sustainability in the near future, and recommends both collaboration and the establishment of manufacturing in other regions.
And finally the authors note that recycling of PV products is still a major question mark hanging over the industry, and that much work is still needed both to develop new processes to recover more materials from end-of-life products, and to implement these at scale.
“More facilities for dismantling modules are required; and then, either in situ or in other specialized sites to which the dismantled parts could be sent for further treatment, facilities to increase element recovery and specially glass recycling will have to be built,” the paper concludes. “A logistical approach at regional level (e.g., European scale) should also be considered for the end of life of PV modules, with transport to recycling sites being a substantial part of future emissions associated to the PV systems’ full life cycle.”

A research group led by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has proposed a new approach to utilize connective heat transfer for solar module cooling in large-scale solar power plants.
Their modeling considers factors such as row spacing, panel height, and tilt angle. It also uses a length scale input to characterize the space through which air moves around or through the solar modules. In the standard models, by contrast, the length often used is a ratio of module dimensions, which ignores PV plant configuration.
“The convective heat transfer curve was generated through computational flow simulations and wind tunnel experiments that allowed for convective heat transfer to be described for a lacunarity length scale value that describes the spacing of the entire PV array through a single length unit,” the scientists said, claiming that using the lacunarity length scale leads to 1.5% more accurate power production.
Their techno-economic analysis considered 1 MW south-facing PV systems located in Phoenix, Arizona, with a fixed tilt angle of 30 degrees over different row spacings, or ground coverage ratio (GCR). The annual land lease cost was assumed at $0.054/m2. The row spacing of the PV plants was varied from two to 11 meters, corresponding to GCR values of 0.73 to 0.08.
“Increasing spacing could enable more varieties of crops and more types of agricultural equipment to be utilized in agrivoltaic systems,” said Jordan Macknick, who leads a different NREL research project focused on agrivoltaics. “That could potentially make these spaced-out solar systems more cost-effective and compatible with larger-scale agriculture.”
Through the modeling, the group ascertained that the optimal levelized cost of energy (LCOE) point was $0.29/kWh, with row spacing varying between 4.83 and 7.34 meters. With two-meter spacing, the LCOE was $0.33/kWh, and with 11 meters it was $0.36/kWh.
The group found that the greatest LCOE improvements were registered in climates with low average annual ambient temperatures and moderate to high average annual wind speeds across the US. They presented the modeling in the study “Technoeconomic Analysis of Changing PV Array Convective Cooling Through Changing Array Spacing,” recently published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.
Other recent proposals for using convective solar module cooling include packing PV panels in close proximity, and taking wind direction and module inclination into account.
