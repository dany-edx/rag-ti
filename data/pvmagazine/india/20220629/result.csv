Bengaluru-based Pyse is financing the 5 MW open-access solar project through its investment platform, which allows retail investors to own PV assets. The plant will supply electricity to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Karnataka.
“By owning the asset, these retail investors can make fixed income out of the plant’s generated revenue while also offsetting their personal carbon footprint,” Pyse co-founder Kaustubh Padakannaya told pv magazine. “The ground-mount project is expected to offset 6.5 million kg of CO2 every year for the next 25 years. And our investors have already offset close to 1.6 million kg of carbon.”
The Pyse platform allows retail investors to own stakes in the INR 26 crore solar project for as little as INR 10,000.
“Our tranche 1, 2, and 3 had a minimum investment of INR 10,000. And for our latest and last tranche in this ground-mount project, an investor has to invest in a minimum of INR 5 lakh,” said Padakannaya.
Pyse has previously done decentralized rooftop projects through its 4,000-plus retail investors, but the latest 5 MW project is its first venture into the ground-mount open-access space.
Padakannaya said Dexler Energy is installing the project as the engineering, procurement and construction contractor. It will also provide operation and maintenance support for the entire plant. The project is under development and will likely be commissioned in July.

The project will include the production, storage, distribution and dispensation of hydrogen, with a fuel-dispensation target of 700 bar.
“The project will use PEM electrolyzer and produce 10 normal cubic meters of green hydrogen per hour. A 50 kW electrolyzer will be installed,” Anchal Tyagi, Uneecops Solar’s green hydrogen chief, told pv magazine. “It will be powered by a solar plant that will be co-located with the green hydrogen plant.
Umagine is the technical consultant for the project. Anchal Tyagi said the objective of the project is to gain a practical understanding of green hydrogen plant operation.
“We are expecting to get the know-how and see what are the challenges to execution, both process wise and cost wise,” she said.
GH2 Solar will install both the green-hydroegn plant and the solar plant.
Uneecops Technologies has installed around 30 MW of renewable energy projects. It has moved into green hydrogen production under the GH2 Solar name.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/29/lithium-ion-fire-fears-spark-recall-of-433000-solar-led-umbrellas-in-us-canada/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 29, 2022","Lithium-ion fire fears spark recall of 433,000 solar LED umbrellas in US, Canada","From pv magazine Global
A joint recall with Health Canada, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (US CPSC) and SunVilla Corp. has been issued for all 10-foot solar LED market umbrellas. The umbrellas have LED lights on the arms of the umbrella that are powered by a lithium-ion battery charged with a small solar panel.
The recall was issued after reports of batteries overheating and causing fires in the United States and Canada. In three reported incidents, the solar panels caught fire while charging via the AC adapter indoors.

Lithium-ion batteries have been known to cause fires in the past. Last year, LG Energy Solution Michigan issued a recall for its RESU 10H batteries in the US market that affected about 10,000 storage systems.
“The home batteries can overheat, posing a risk of fire and emission of harmful smoke,” the manufacturer said at the time.
Battery manufacturers are increasingly turning to less hazardous solutions. After its recall, LG transitioned from nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry to lithium iron phosphate in its future products.
Briggs & Stratton’s SimpliPHI Energy Storage System uses lithium-ferro-phosphate chemistry, which does not use cobalt, a metal associated with health hazards, and a key culprit in battery fires. And a new Canadian company, Salient Energy, developed a zinc-ion battery, which is a water-based chemistry that the company says eliminates the risk of fire, making the batteries more applicable for residential energy storage.
The umbrellas affected by the recall are made in China by SunVilla and sold at Costco in the United States and Canada. Consumers can return them to any Costco Warehouse for a full refund. SunVilla and Costco are also attempting to contact known purchasers.
