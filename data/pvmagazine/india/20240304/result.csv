“The long-term offtake agreement between Yara and Acme covers the supply of 100,000 tons per annum of renewable ammonia and is possibly the world’s first arm’s length contract for renewable ammonia of this scale and tenure,” stated Yara.
Acme will supply renewable ammonia from the first phase of its Oman project with an expected start date in 2027. It is building the green ammonia project in Oman with a planned capacity of 900,000 ton per annum in a phased manner.
Yara will serve as an anchor customer for Acme’s solar-based ammonia project being developed in Oman.
Ashwani Dudeja, director of ACME Group, said, “This agreement [with Yara] is only a start and will facilitate further cooperation between the two companies while playing a vital role in accelerating the adoption of green hydrogen and its derivatives…. with the signing of this contract, we aim to become the world’s first large scale producer of green ammonia.”
“The renewable ammonia from Oman will be part of our scalable distribution system, developing a reliable, safe, and cost-efficient supply chain for low-emission ammonia across different market segments,” said Magnus Ankarstrand, President, Yara Clean Ammonia.
Acme Group is one of the largest private-sector power producers in India with a portfolio of more than 8.5 GWp of renewable energy capacity under operation and various stages of implementation.
India’s Union Minister for Steel and Civil Aviation, Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, virtually inaugurated India’s first green hydrogen plant in stainless steel sector located at Jindal Stainless Ltd, Hisar. It is purportedly the world’s first off-grid green hydrogen plant for the stainless steel industry and the world’s first green hydrogen plant with rooftop and floating solar. This project, a state-of-the-art green hydrogen facility, targets to reduce carbon emissions by around 2,700 metric tonnes per annum and 54,000 tons of CO2 emissions over next two decades. The project has been executed by Gurugram-based Hygenco.
Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) has confirmed its commitment to the development of hydrogen-fueled power units across different disciplines and competitions. “FIA will focus its efforts on contribution to development and promotion of solutions based on hydrogen stored in liquid form (LH2),” said the organization, which oversees racing events such as Formula 1. FIA is betting on liquid storage due to its lower volume and weight compared to compressed gas tanks (CGH2).
PT PLN has inaugurated the Kamojang green hydrogen production facility in West Java, Indonesia. It is the first geothermal-based green hydrogen production plant in Southeast Asia. Geothermal-based green hydrogen is produced from condensation water from the Kamojang PLTP electricity production process.“We built the plant at Kamojang with a production capacity of 4.3 tons per year,” said PT PLN President Darmawan Prasodjo. The company also recently inaugurated Indonesia’s first hydrogen vehicle filling station in Jakarta. “The new station shows PLN’s continued efforts and innovation in developing an end-to-end hydrogen ecosystem in Indonesia, after in November 2023 inaugurating 21 green hydrogen plants (GHP),” the company said in a separate press release. The company can produce 203 tons of green hydrogen per year and said it wants to use 128 tons “to support the development of the hydrogen vehicle ecosystem.”
OMV Petrom has signed two financing contracts to build two green-hydrogen production facilities with a total capacity of 55 MW at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The Austrian company said it signed the contracts with the Romanian Ministry of Energy for a maximum funding amount of €50 million ($54.2 million), with the total investment coming it at EUR 140 million. It noted that public support comes from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), a funding facility supported by the European Commission.
Powerhouse has signed an initial five-year framework agreement with Australia-based National H2 for multiple hydrogen-based projects in Australia, Italy, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. “The agreement sets out the terms on which the company’s technology and engineering expertise would be provided, on a project-by-project exclusivity basis, to National H2,” said Powerhouse. Engsolve, a wholly owned subsidiary of Powerhouse, will undertake the front-end engineering design (FEED) for the facilities, which will be fully funded by National H2.
Siemens Energy has agreed to supply HH2E with high-voltage systems and power transformers, which are essential components for its large-scale green hydrogen production units across Germany. The two companies said HH2E’s strategy focuses on maximizing the use of curtailed power, in order to convert untapped green electrons into green hydrogen production.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/04/the-long-read-thin-prospects/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-03-04,The long read: Thin prospects,"From pv magazine 02/24
While certain solar production steps are measured in nanometers, atomic layers, and fractions of a percentage or cent, ingot and wafer production more closely resembles heavy industry. Gleaming crystalline silicon ingots emerge from towering pullers to be sliced by diamond wire saws into iridescent, black square, or rectangular, monocrystalline wafers.
The ingot and wafering production steps are power hungry and produce waste in the form of kerf slurry – the residue ingot material from between the sliced wafers. Those are the PV production steps most highly concentrated in China.
Jessica Jin is the principal research analyst for solar and clean energy technology at S&P Global Commodity Insights Shanghai. Jin reported that in 2023, China accounted for 96% of global ingot and wafer production. She added that the wholesale switch within PV manufacturing from multicrystalline to monocrystalline technology, in and around 2018, was decisive for China’s dominance of the production step. That dominance has extended upstream.
“This was led by Longi, as everyone knows,” she said. “Since then, Chinese equipment manufacturers working with Longi keep improving their technology and also add capacity and they all grow up with the market expansion in China.”
The development is one that is common throughout China’s solar success story. Through aggressive scaling and close cooperation with technology and material suppliers, Chinese manufacturers have been able to rapidly adapt new technology and production processes, outcompeting European and American rivals first on cost, and then on performance and efficiency.
“Nowadays, we see most of these equipment suppliers are also in China as well,” said Jin. The result being that in 2024 there are few credible pathways for non-Chinese manufacturers interested in developing ingot and wafer capacity.
PV manufacturing advisory Exawatt, now a part of CRU Group, finds that the only notable ingot and wafer production hub outside of China is in South East Asia. Exawatt tallied some 35 GW of wafer facilities in operation in South East Asia by the end of 2023, with that potentially expanding to 45 GW by the end of 2024.
While expansions are under way in South East Asia, the opposite is the case in Europe. The year 2023 saw both Norsun and Norwegian Crystal suspend or wind up their operations in Europe – effectively reducing wafer production in Europe to zero. Those decisions were followed shortly after by that of, presumably, a key supplier. Polysilicon producer REC Solar Norway began winding up its operations in Kristiansand, Norway – which had an annual output of 8,000 tons – and in Heroya, Norway – with 5,500 tons – in November 2023.
Norwegian Crystal had closed its 500 MW ingot facility in Glomfjord, Norway, a month earlier. As recently as 2022, it had been pursuing plans to develop a 6 GW ingot and wafer facility but had been unable to secure funding, forcing it to begin liquidation of the company.
In September, compatriot Norsun announced layoffs and a production halt at its 1 GW facility in Årdal, Norway. Tellingly, Norsun is now trying to establish a 5 GW ingot and wafer production facility in the United States. In August 2023, it announced it had raised NOK90 million ($8.5 million) in capital in pursuit of the plan, alongside the €53.6 million ($58 million) it was awarded by the European Union Innovation Fund.
Subsidies are available for solar manufacturers in Europe but they pale in comparison to what is on offer in the United States. In the first 12 months after the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law, announcements were made totaling 155 GW of annual solar manufacturing capacity, right across the value chain, according to trade body the Solar Energy Industries Association. However, few were for ingot and wafer production.
“According to our model, the incentive is actually very good for production in the United States,” said S&P Global’s Jin. “But it’s not simply about the production cost but also other costs, like the recycling, construction cost, and so on.”
Jin said that securing environmental approvals for wafer operations may prove difficult outside of China. Although she did note that in the past five years, many of the waste and recycling issues from wafer production have been addressed.
South Korean module maker Qcells stands out as an exception. In January 2024, Qcells announced a $2.5 billion investment decision which included 3.3 GW of annual ingot, wafer, and cell production capacity, to be executed in stages. The manufacturing will involve the establishment of a new production base, in Cartersville, Georgia – outside of the city of Atlanta in the United States. It follows the expansion of Qcells’ module assembly operations, to 5.1 GW capacity, in Dalton, Georgia, in the United States, completed in October 2023.
In January 2024, Qcells announced it had expanded an existing 2.5 GW module supply and engineering, procurement, and construction services deal with Microsoft to 12 GW of supply over eight years. The companies say the projects covered by the deal will be supplied by Qcells’ “fully integrated solar supply chain factory in Cartersville,” to the tune of 1.5 GW per year through 2032.
The deal provides offtake certainty to Qcells, with one-third of its ingot and wafer output accounted for in cooperation with a bankable counterparty. For its part, by working with Qcells in this way, Microsoft hopes to accelerate its renewable energy deployment by locking in supply and driving large-scale domestic production of solar modules in the process.
“There is always something that makes supply to the US uncertain,” said Alex Barrows, head of PV at Exawatt. “I can see an appeal to locking in something that gives you some certainty – even if you’re paying a premium.” PV module prices are higher in the United States and there remains a complex web of tariffs, exemptions, border seizures, moratoria, and legal challenges, all of which can delay final project realization or blow out costs.
On Jan. 27, 2024, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) issued a “plea for survival” to European policymakers. It argued that foreign PV module manufacturers were dumping modules, or selling below cost. It also pointed to the decisions to cease European operations taken by Norsun, REC Solar Norway, and Norwegian Crystals – along with the winding up of the German module production lines of Swiss company Meyer Burger. “The closure of PV module manufacturers is also closing possibilities to develop other parts of the PV value chain and European material and component manufacturers are thus also at very high risk,” the ESMC said in a statement. “Losing nearly all European PV module producers right now would have irreversible negative consequences for the entire EU PV manufacturing industry,” said the ESMC’s Žygimantas Vaičiūnas. He said that emergency measures must be introduced by the middle of February 2024, “at the latest.”
Barrows noted that Qcells’ parent company, Hanwha, is South Korean rather than Chinese. It has access to American polysilicon from REC Silicon and is on the way to becoming a vertically integrated United States producer – making it well placed to offer stability in the face of potential policy turmoil or geopolitical shocks. “I feel like it is a pretty good way to lock in some security,” said Barrows.
Yet despite the IRA, higher prices, and advantages for locally produced products, Barrows remains skeptical of the prospects of many announced ingot and wafer facilities in the United States. Alongside Qcells and Norsun; Convalt Energy, CubicPV, and India’s Vikram Solar have announced American manufacturing plans that extend up the supply chain to ingots and wafers.
“I think we’ll get a bit [of ingot and wafer capacity] in the US but nowhere near what has been announced,” said Barrows. “Thirty-five GW of capacity by the end of 2026 has been announced but I would actually suspect it is more likely that 15 GW to 20 GW will be installed.”
On the list of aspiring manufacturers, CubicPV stands out. Not only has it announced its intention to develop 10 GW of traditional ingot and wafer technology, it is also a proponent of “direct wafer” usage. The company’s chief executive officer (CEO), Frank van Mierlo, formerly led 1366 Technologies. That business had attempted to commercialize “direct wafer” technology by producing multicrystalline solar wafers from a liquid, rather than cleft from a monocrystalline ingot.
Qcells worked in partnership with 1366 Technologies and achieved notable conversion efficiency achievements with the latter’s technology, including cells with more than 20% efficiency. However, when the PV industry switched to monocrystalline technology, 1366’s wafers were left stranded on the wrong side of development.
Germany’s NexWafe is pursuing a wafer technology not dissimilar to that used by 1366. The NexWafe approach is described as epitaxial and involves gases being deposited onto a seed substrate from which it can be separated and fashioned into a cell. Both approaches can be described as “kerfless” wafer production as they do away with wafer cutting and the waste kerf it produces.
In October 2023, NexWafe broke ground at a 250 MW factory in Germany where it will invest at least €70 million. Interestingly, NexWafe CEO Davor Sutija was the former president and CEO of SiNor, which eventually became Norwegian Crystals.

Production alternatives to the mature Czochralski process for monocrystalline ingot pulling and diamond wire sawing must overcome capital expenditure, throughput, and efficiency challenges to become commercially viable. High cell efficiencies on epitaxial or direct wafer technology have not yet been reached, nor has competitive throughput from a factory at scale.
The establishment of any new ingot and wafer capacity with any technology will also take place under intense cost competition. The year 2023 saw module prices decline by more than 30% on global markets and there is a glut of product on the market. “We’re definitely expecting a wash in the industry next year,” said S&P Global’s Jin.
Yet, in times of bankruptcies and consolidation, there are opportunities for “step change” or next-generation technologies. European or United States companies may prosper while oversupply grips their Chinese rivals. NexWafe and CubicPV are pursuing new approaches to wafer production despite manufacturing-segment adversity.
In November 2023, NexWafe appointed Rick Schwerdtfeger as chief technology officer and André Seemaier as chief financial officer as the company moves into the commercialization phase of its gas-to-wafer technology.

Researchers keep pushing the limits of silicon solar cell technology in a quest to use less material in thinner and lighter cells without sacrificing efficiency or durability.
Now a team led by researchers from Chinese vertically integrated module manufacturer Longi has developed processes to fabricate high-efficiency heterojunction (HJT) solar cells, while reportedly avoiding the fragility and lower efficiency results seen in earlier attempts to produce thinner cells.
In the study “Flexible silicon solar cells with high power-to-weight ratios,” published in nature, the scientists said the new cell ranges in thickness from 57 μm to 125 μm and is made using M6 wafers with an area of 274.4 cm2.
The wafer thinning not only lowers the weight and cost, but also facilitates the charge migration and separation, noted the research team.
“The flexible and thin profile of these solar cells open up new opportunities for incorporating solar energy generation into various aspects of daily life and industry in portable electronics, building integrated PV, transportation, space applications, emerging technologies with unconventional surfaces or structure,” Xixiang Xu, Longi R&D team leader and corresponding author, told pv magazine.
The team developed its own control and regulation system to enable a continuous low-damage-plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to prevent epitaxy and maintain surface uniformity. It is a modification of the conventional step-by-step, non-continuous CVD process for passivation, noted the researchers.
In addition, they implemented a “self-restoring nanocrystalline sowing and vertical growth process for the doped contacts” in a high-frequency plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) process, which enabled growing “high-quality n-type and p-type carrier selective contacts” for the hole transport layer and electron transport layers.
Another innovation was to use contact-free laser transfer printing to deposit low-shading grid lines. For the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers, they opted for cerium-doped indium oxide (ICO) and a low-damage reactive plasma deposition (RPD) process.
The team deposited ICO as the TCO coating using a low-damage reactive plasma deposition method, which they said “produced superior electrical performance, including much lower resistivity (2.7 × 10−4 Ω cm) and higher carrier mobility (83.1 cm V−1 s −1), when compared to those of the magnetron sputtering-derived indium tin oxide reported elsewhere”, adding that the process “played a decisive role in subsequent stability improvement.”
The cell achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 26.06% with a thickness of 57 μm, a value of 26.56% with a thickness of 106 μm, and a maximum efficiency of 26.81% with a thickness of 125 μm. The 57 μm solar cell had  also the highest power-to-weight ratio (1.9 W g−1) and open-circuit voltage (761 mV).
The results were validated by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin.
The scientists were also able to reduce optical loss by optimizing the configuration of grid lines using “industry-compatible contact-free” laser transfer printing technology. “The finger width could be reduced from 40 μm (typical screen printing) to 18 μm, with the shading area controlled to less than 2%,” they noted.
The devices were tested for potential-induced degradation and light-induced degradation, according to the paper. “This technological progress provides a practical basis for the commercialization of flexible, lightweight, low-cost and highly efficient solar cells, and the ability to bend or roll up crystalline silicon solar cells for travel is anticipated,” concluded the team.

The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for mono PERC modules from China was assessed at $0.110 per W, stable from the previous week while TOPCon module prices were flat at $0.119/W week to week. Prices have held steady for the seventh consecutive week as market participants adopt a wait-and-see approach for a clearer price trend to emerge.

Market sentiment was mixed. There were some talks in the market of possible domestic Chinese price increases of CNY0.03-0.05 ($0.042-0.069)/W in March but other market participants were uncertain if the price hikes would materialize given ample inventory in the market.
Other market participants attributed the possible price hikes to suppliers’ reluctance to accept orders at previously lower prices and the fast conversion of p-type to n-type in the market had resulted in a drop in P-type supply. “Cell makers had increased P-type prices before the Lunar New Year but did not increase n-type prices”, a market source said.
One seller held on to the view that any price increases in the Chinese market would be for p-type modules as production had reduced and that N-type modules could see some price declines. However, other market participants said this remains to be seen.
The outlook for March was improving with demand expected to recover in Q2-Q3 as overseas projects usually start construction after winter, while in China, module tenders are generally carried out in the first half of the year and construction in the second half of the year, a solar veteran said. The Chinese market will see 30-40% of demand in the first half of the year, with most of the demand concentrated in the second half of the year, the veteran added.
Module makers are expected to increase their operating rates as demand improves in the coming weeks. China is expected to produce more than 50 GW of modules in March, according to the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
