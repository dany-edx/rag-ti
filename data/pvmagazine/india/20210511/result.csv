Tesla watchers report that the company has shifted to cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for its 3 MWh Megapack energy storage product. The shift to LFP cathode batteries could cut costs and ease demand for supply-constrained nickel-based battery production capacity.
LFP batteries are typically less expensive to produce, but they also are less energy-dense than the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells used by Tesla in its electric vehicles.
The Megapack has a maximum energy capacity of 3 MWh per unit and is claimed to require 40% less space and fewer parts than other systems on the market. Reports said that with LFP batteries, the Megapack could see lower production costs, which could be passed on to customers of grid-scale storage technology.
Last year, the EV car manufacturer deployed 3 GWh of storage in a single year for the first time. That was an 83% increase against 2019. The company attributed much of this growth to the popularity of its utility-scale storage product, Megapack.

The capacity utilization was lower sequentially in April 2021 due to priority in supplying the liquid oxygen for medical purposes over augmenting steel production. During April 2021, over 20,000 tonnes of liquid oxygen for medical purposes was supplied from the Steel Complexes of the company, said JSW Steel. 
The company’s crude steel production for April 2021 was 13.71 lakh tonnes (a 5% drop from 14.46 lakh tonnes in March). The average capacity utilization was 91%, as against 96% in March.
Production of flat-rolled products dropped 9% to 9.57 lakh tonnes. Long rolled production dipped 5% to 3.37 lakh tonnes.
JSW Steel accounts for more than 60% of India’s production of flat-rolled steel that is plated or coated with alloys of aluminum and zinc.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/11/states-must-plan-for-utility-scale-battery-storage/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 11, 2021",States must plan now for utility-scale battery storage,"State-level efforts are crucial for India to make rapid strides in the uptake of utility-scale battery storage and ensure smooth integration of variable renewable energy into the power grid. Specifically, States with large load centres, such as Maharashtra, Delhi NCR, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, must lead the way now by making their plans for utility-scale battery storage systems, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (Ieefa).
The government-owned agency Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has led the way by coming up with multiple renewable energy plus battery storage auctions that mandate round-the-clock RE power supply. However, the report said, SECI’s efforts alone will not suffice to build the required battery storage capacity for the Indian grid to handle the large injection of variable renewables.
In Ieefa’s view, a time-of-day pricing mechanism that differentiates between peak and off-peak power supply is critical to incentivize investment into such capital-intensive assets. Additionally, the states could offer viability gap funding (VGF) for battery storage just as they did to support the growth of ultra-mega solar parks a few years ago.
Grid integration of large-scale variable renewables will be one of India’s biggest challenges as it targets the deployment of 450 GW of renewable energy (RE) by 2030 as part of efforts to decarbonize the economy. Reaching this target from the current installed renewable capacity of 93 GW will require average annual renewable capacity additions of 35GW.
India could further double its renewables capacity to 900 GW by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) India Energy Outlook 2021. 
Currently, renewables form 10% of India’s total power generation, which will increase to 31% by 2030 with 450 GW coming online. 
The report said as the share of variable renewable generation increases, India’s power system will have to evolve and modernize to respond to grid stability challenges. There is a need for an accelerated deployment of utility-scale battery storage to store power when available in abundance and provide firm power later, during the evening peak hours or at other times when generation is low, but demand is high.
IEA projects that India could have 140-200 GW of battery storage capacity by 2040 — potentially a third of total battery storage capacity in the world by then.
Success stories from Germany, Australia, and the USA show the way for India to integrate large-scale variable renewables in its power grid; Germany has 46% of its electricity coming from RE, South Australia 60% and California 36%.
Ieefa stated global power markets such as Australia, the U.S. and U.K. have leveraged the cost deflation in battery storage to strengthen their grids with the increasing penetration of ultra-cheap renewables. Grid-scale batteries have proven to be an important grid management tool to deal with frequency fluctuations on the grid.
The cost of standalone lithium-ion battery storage systems globally has plummeted from US$1,100/kWh in 2010 to US$137/kWh in 2020. According to Bloomberg NEF (BNEF), costs will decline a further 55% to US$58/kWh by 2030.
The report also highlighted the nation-specific drivers. “Australia’s battery storage market is booming with the development of utility-scale standalone battery storage projects across its National Energy Market (NEM). Increased penetration of renewables into Australia’s grid has driven the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) demand — an important grid management service. Energy utilities operating in the NEM are accelerating standalone battery storage deployment as FCAS requirements surge on the national grid,” it said.
In contrast to the Australian market, which is predominantly driven by market economics, the accelerated uptake of batteries in the U.S. market is being driven by state-level enforcement of battery storage requirements as well as subsidy support through tax credit incentives, the report added.
The states of California, Oregon, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Virginia have defined capacity targets for the state utilities for battery storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/11/new-tech-to-identify-best-locations-for-floating-pv/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 11, 2021",New tech to identify best locations for floating PV,"From pv magazine International
The Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) and Norway-based technology company Glint Solar have jointly developed a technique for the assessment of wind and wave conditions at locations where floating PV arrays have to be deployed.
“We have made a model that uses satellite-derived wind data and the shape of the lake to calculate the fetch in multiple directions and locations in order to calculate the wind waves,” Glint Solar COO, Even J. Kvelland, told pv magazine. “Glint Solar has used the algorithm and the model with several customers like the World Bank to calculate waves on potential project sites.”
The technique is based on an algorithm that considers the geometry of the water surface and 40 years of data on wind conditions and is claimed to be able to automatically calculate wave heights and wind directions. “Given the importance of high-quality data in the early phases of floating solar projects, we are now able to help developers and consultants better understand the potential risks at individual sites as regards waves,” Kvelland further explained. “Waves of course greatly impact the technical feasibility of a site and what type of floating solution one can use.”
The tool is said to drastically speed up the analysis process and to be able to take into account multiple factors. “When we talk about waves, it’s not only the height that matters but also the direction, wave periods, significant wave height, and 50-year wave height that are important to understand when assessing potential project sites,” the COO specified. “We see an increase in new solution providers who are making more and more robust floating solutions that can withstand higher waves.”
According to him, companies like Ocean Sun, Oceans of Energy, SolarDuck and Moss Maritime are all introducing solutions that can withstand rougher weather, including higher waves. “Some of them are designed to withstand waves up to 3-4 meters,” he added.
The NGI has a long experience in wave analysis for the aquaculture sector and the oil and gas offshore industry. “However, this is the first time the institute is automating its technology and hence giving the wave analysis instantly,” Kvelland stated.
