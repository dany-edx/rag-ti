Dutch-Norwegian offshore PV specialist SolarDuck, Italian investment fund Arrow Capital, and Italian developer New Developments have signed an agreement to develop a 540 MW floating wind-solar project off the coast of Italy.
The hybrid offshore plant will be located in the Gulf of Taranto, off the coast of Corigliano-Rossano, in Calabria. It will feature 28 floating wind turbines with a cumulative capacity of 420 MWp and 120 MWp of floating PV.
The development is part of Green Arrow Infrastructure of the Future Fund (GAIF) and is currently under permitting with an estimated commercial operation date in 2028.
The project will feature SolarDuck’s elevated platform technology, which allows PV panels to be deployed in significant wave heights, while maintaining a safe working environment for access and maintenance and minimizing environmental impacts.
“With the current momentum, we believe this is a unique opportunity for the offshore renewable energy industry to help shape a favorable regulatory framework and facilitate the scaling of OFPV,” said SolarDuck CEO Koen Burgers. “This is not just important for Italy, but also for other countries in the Mediterranean.”
SolarDuck unveiled its first demonstrator project in 2021. It deployed the 64 kW system at an inshore site on the Waal (Rhine) River, near IJzendoorn, the Netherlands.
Its floating arrays hold the solar panels more than 3 meters above the surface of the water, and are able to handle coastal sea conditions and hurricane-force winds. The systems are optimized for offshore sites in estuaries and natural harbors, as well as near-shore sites.
The basic floating platforms are triangular structures measuring 16 meters x 16 meters x 16 meters. They resemble offshore floating wind platforms or floating oil platforms and can be flexibly connected together to form large plants.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/05/new-tech-to-remanufacture-recycled-perovskite-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,2024-03-05,New tech to remanufacture recycled perovskite solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists has developed a novel method for remanufacturing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with carbon-based electrodes (CPSMs). They describe remanufacturing, as opposed to only recycling, as the combination of re-used, recycled, repaired, or replaced parts to make a new product.
“In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a remanufacturing strategy for glass-glass encapsulated perovskite solar cells,” they stated. “Our study presents a facile experimental method to remove the edge-sealant, encapsulant, back electrode, and degraded perovskite, allowing reuse of the device constituents.”
They initially researched which materials in a module are associated with high environmental impacts. The module they analyzed – which they say has high potential for commercialization – includes a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) front electrode, compact and mesoporous titanium dioxide (c-TiO2 and m-TiO2, respectively), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), and a carbon-based back electrode. The device is encapsulated with thermoplastic olefins (TPO), polyisobutylene (PIB)-based edge seal, and a glass backsheet.
“Only a small part of the global warming potential (GWP) contribution of the cell stack comes from the materials itself (5%), while the majority originates from the energy and solvents used to deposit these layers,” they said. “The main GWP reduction can be achieved by re-using or recycling the glass (front and back), which can potentially reduce the GWP of PSMs by up to 53% and 52%, respectively. The photovoltaic cell constituents (and their embedded energy) have a relatively small contribution to the overall carbon footprint.”
The academics also determined which components were worth targeting. First, they heated the cell to 120 C to 140 C, to facilitate the mechanical separation of the backsheet glass from the FTO. Then, they left the glass substrates to cool down to room temperature before the encapsulant removal step.
To dissolve the TPO and PIB encapsulant, they placed them in acetone for one hour and peeled them off. Afterward, they dipped the devices into a bath of methylamine (MA0) and ethanol to liquefy and wash out the perovskite – the part most likely to deteriorate in the shortest time.
“The removal of perovskite and carbon allows reuse of the metal oxide layers (TiO2, ZrO2) deposited on the FTO  in order to remanufacture encapsulated CPSCs,” they explained. “The layer morphology and thickness are preserved. Therefore, carbon deposition and perovskite solution infiltration, followed by the encapsulation with TPO and PIB can be performed again to complete the remanufacturing loop.”
While the recycled solar cell had a power conversion efficiency of 11.7% after the remanufacturing process, they kept 88% of the original efficiency. Given the efficiency and the resources needed for the process, that led to a reduction of 24% GWP. If the process is further optimized, and the PCE remains the same after remanufacturing, the drop in GWP can reach 33%.

“Note that, despite fully re-using parts constituting 62.4% of the GWP, the reduction in GWP (compared to virgin modules) due to remanufacturing is substantially lower,” the researchers said. “This is because of the additional processes required for remanufacturing. Predominantly the chemical treatment in MA0/EtOH and acetone baths, but also the temperature-assisted mechanical separation of glass substrates and annealing at 400 C result in non-negligible CO2-eq emissions.”
The researchers also determined that the CO2 footprint of electricity generated by the remanufactured systems could be lower than that of c-Si. In the conditions of Freiburg, Germany, and an annual generation of 1429.2 kWh/m2, the remanufactured system needed 10.7 years to have lower CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour than c-Si modules. That compares with more than 16 years with the used virgin modules. If perovskite PV’s efficiency reaches the efficiency of c-Si modules, the remanufactured footprint will be lower after five years.
“Remanufacturing strategy utilizes solvents and treatments that do not decompose inorganic device constituents, such as metal oxide layers,” the academic group said. “Thus, this approach can also be applied to a broad range of n-i-p devices and some inorganic p-i-n based ones, for which we expect similar reductions in GWP.”
They presented their findings in “Remanufacturing Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules–A Holistic Case Study,” which was recently published in ACS Sustainable Resource Management. The research group included scientists from Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE), the University of Freiburg and the Philipps University of Marburg, Switzerland’s Solaronix, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne. Researchers from Energy21 in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom’s University of Cambridge, and Morrocco’s Abdelmalek Essaadi University also participated.

Singapore-based PV module manufacturer REC has developed residential solar modules based on its Alpha heterojunction cell technology.
“Production has started at REC’s Industry 4.0 fab in Singapore and first shipments will reach the US market in May 2024,” the company said in a statement released.
The REC Alpha Pure-2 Series is available in four versions, with power ratings ranging from 400 W to 430 W, and efficiencies of 20.6% to 22.2%. They are made with 132 heterojunction, half-cut monocrystalline solar cells and have a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V.

“Our new cell opens the door for wide bandgap perovskites solar cells, which will be crucial not just for applications such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) or solar windows, but also multijunction solar cells,” the research’s corresponding author, Michael Saliba, told pv magazine. “Single junction perovskites with wide bandgaps have not reached high voltages yet.”
The scientists explained that the application of this material in solar cells is limited by the fast crystallization kinetics and poor solubility
of its precursors, which results in incomplete film coverage with an irregular film morphology.
To overcome this issue, the research group adopted a two-step deposition method and annealing under molecular nitrogen (N2) gas inside a glovebox. “We demonstrate that the annealing atmosphere strongly influences the crystallization kinetics of MAPbCl3 without changing its bulk property,” stated co-corresponding author, Mahdi Malekshahi. ” During annealing in the N2 atmosphere, MAPbCl3 films exhibit poor surface coverage with many voids and a high root-mean-square (RMS) of around 64 nm.”
The academics built the cell with a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), an electron transport layer (ETL) based on carbon–titanium dioxide (C/TiO2), a TiO2 mesoporous layer, the MAPbCl3 absorber, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer (HTL), and a gold (Au) metal contact.
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 0.81%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.71 V, a short-circuit current density of 0.73 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 64.7%.
“It is noteworthy that such a high open-circuit voltage of 1.78 V is obtained for a wide-bandgap perovskite using conventional spiro-OMeTAD HTL,” the academics said, noting that the open-circuit voltage is the highest ever recorded to date for a perovskite solar cell based on MAPbCl3.
“Importantly, this is achieved with the same contacts that are used for the world-record efficiency perovskite solar cells with narrow bandgaps,” added Saliba. “Surprisingly, the conventional hole-transport layer spiro-OMeTAD, optimized for narrow bandgaps, sustains such high voltages.”
The solar cell concept was described in the paper “MAPbCl3 Light Absorber for Highest Voltage Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in ACS Publications.
