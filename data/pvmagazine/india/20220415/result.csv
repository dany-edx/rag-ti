An international research group has conducted a comprehensive analysis of all failure modes and vulnerable component faults in grid-connected solar inverters that offers a broad view of all available detection and localization techniques.
The overview provides, in particular, a classification of various component failure modes and their potential causes in a tabular form and describes different approaches for data preparation and feature mining. It also categorizes all fault detection and localization (FDL) techniques in a tabular manner.
The review includes a list of all wear-out failures such as bond-wire heel cracks, solder fatigue, die-attach degradation and delamination, aluminum reconstruction, substrate cracks, corrosion, electrochemical migration, ionic contamination, and time-dependent dielectric breakdown. It also categorizes catastrophic failures such as latch-up, bond-wire melting, avalanche breakdown, electrostatic discharge, and secondary breakdown.
Furthermore, the work analyzes the impact of these failures on the performance of solar modules and the inverter themselves, as well as a description of both model-based and model-free FDL approaches and other FDL techniques.  Model-free methods coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) were found to be the most efficient in terms of quantifying the performance parameters. “In addition, AI based techniques provide superior detection and localization abilities as compared to model-based techniques,” the academics explained. “However, a bottleneck in the direction of AI is that there are very few real-time implementations of AI based techniques.”
Their work was presented in the paper Overview of Fault Detection Approaches for Grid Connected Photovoltaic Inverters, which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. The research group includes scientists from the Jamia Millia Islamia University in India, the Brno University of Technology in Czechia, and the Aalborg University in Denmark. “The future work is further motivated to include the inductance estimation in current emulators as a part of new fault detection approaches and improve the efficiency under high power operation,” they concluded.

The proposed investment is expected to fund Tata Power Renewables’ aggressive growth plans as it targets over 20 GW of renewables assets and a market-leading position in the rooftop and electric vehicle charging space across India over the next five years. 
“BlackRock Real Assets, together with Mubadala, shall invest by way of equity/compulsorily convertible instruments for a 10.53% stake in Tata Power Renewables, translating to a base equity valuation of INR 34,000 crore. The final shareholding will range from 9.76% to 11.43% on final conversion,” read a statement by Tata Power. 
This newly created platform will house all the renewable energy businesses of Tata Power, including utility-scale solar, wind and hybrid generation assets; solar cell and module manufacturing; engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracting; rooftop solar infrastructure; solar pumps and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. 
The broad-based portfolio of assets ensures diversified yet stable revenue sources, including 25-year fixed-price power purchase agreements for grid-connected utility-scale projects. 
The first round of capital infusion in Tata Power Renewables is expected to be completed by June, and the balance funds will be infused by the end of December this year. Moelis & Company is the financial advisor to Tata Power, while JP Morgan is the financial advisor to BlackRock Real Assets.

The project capacity of 500 MWh each shall be located close to Fatehgarh-III Substations of the ISTS network in Rajasthan.
The projects shall be awarded through international competitive bidding followed by reverse auction. 
The selected developer shall set up the BESS on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis and make it available to the SECI (acting as an intermediary nodal agency for using the energy storage facility) or other buying entities for charging/discharging “on demand.” The BESS may be charged by any energy source, including conventional energy. Ownership of such an energy source is not mandatory to be held by the battery storage developer. 
SECI shall sign a battery energy storage purchase agreement with the successful developers for 12 years.
The total capacity of 500 MW/1,000 MWh shall be set up at a single location, with two projects each of 500 MWh (250 MW x 2 hours) capacity to be set up at the identified location. A developer can submit a single bid offering a contracted capacity of either one project (250 MW/500 MWh) or two projects (2x(250 MW/500 MWh).
“Already commissioned projects cannot be considered. Projects under construction or projects which are not yet commissioned will, however, be considered in case these projects are not already accepted under any other Central or State Schemes. Enhancement and augmentation of already commissioned projects, irrespective of their capacities, will not be considered as eligible project under this scheme. The battery capacity being installed under this tender cannot be used by the developer as part of the installed project capacity demonstrated under any other tender concluded by any Central or State Agency as on the last date of bid submission,” as per the tender document.
