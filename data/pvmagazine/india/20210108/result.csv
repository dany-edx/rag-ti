Sodium-ion batteries are a promising energy storage technology, one that has already seen limited commercialization in the stationary storage segment. And sodium-ion has attracted plenty of attention from researchers, since it offers an alternative to lithium-ion batteries that relies on much cheaper, more abundant materials.
In terms of energy density, sodium-ion technology is a little way behind lithium. This means it is widely seen as impractical for applications such as electric vehicles or consumer electronics, where the size and weight of the battery are a primary concern. A new discovery from scientists at the Tokyo University of Science (TOS), however, could be set to turn this assumption on its head.
A group at the university looked to carbon electrode materials to boost sodium-ion battery capacity, and developed a technique to fabricate a porous, hard carbon anode. The technique is described in the paper New hard-carbon anode material for sodium-ion batteries will solve the lithium conundrum, published in Angewandte Chemie, International Edition.

The capacity—to be developed in the RESCO model (capital expenditures covered by the installer)—has a levellized ceiling tariff fixed at INR 4/kWh.
Each project’s size may be in the range of 10 kWp to 400 kWp or more, and each rooftop unit can separately connect with the grid and have separate energy meters.
The work scope includes design, engineering, supply, erection, testing and commissioning, and operation and comprehensive maintenance for 25 years.
The generated solar power will be fed to the grid on a net metering basis. 
The estimated project cost (for 2 MWp) is INR 7.2 crore, and the work is to be completed within 12 months from the award of the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/08/sungrow-solar-inverter-sales-in-india-cross-7-gw/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,INVERTERS,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 8, 2021",Sungrow solar inverter sales in India cross 7 GW,"Chinese solar PV inverter manufacturer Sungrow—which has over 120 GW installed worldwide as of June 2020—has announced that its cumulative shipments to India exceeded 7 GW by the end of the year 2020. Out of the cumulative 7 GW, it sold at least 3 GW in 2020 alone.
The year saw the manufacturer secure some big orders in the highly competitive Indian market as a series of tenders and reverse auctions were conducted at regular intervals, keeping the solar project pipeline robust for upcoming years.
“Notwithstanding many challenges this year, we were able to ship more than 3 GW of inverters in one calendar year. With this resounding number, we have consolidated our position in both utility and rooftop markets in 2020,” said Sunil Badesra, Business Head, Sungrow India.
Sunil also emphasized that Sungrow’s vast service network spread across the country provides timely and comprehensive support to all customers.
Sungrow credits the shipment boost to its latest offerings in both central and string inverters for large-scale utility projects.
Sungrow’s shipments included the 1500V, 3.125 MW central inverter solution and the 1500V string inverter, SG250HX-IN. The latest commercial series also saw huge demand in the thriving distributed rooftop market, translating to a healthy market share in this price-sensitive segment.
Sungrow has a central and string inverter factory in Bengaluru, Karnataka, which caters to local and international demand.
“Since the beginning, we have produced more than 5 GW of PV inverters to cater to both global and local markets, and we see a mounting growth,” commented Sunil Badesra.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/08/singapores-sembcorp-awarded-400-mw-solar-power-project-in-rajasthan/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN,SINGAPORE",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 8, 2021",Singapore’s Sembcorp awarded 400 MW solar power project in Rajasthan ,"Singapore-headquartered Sembcorp Industries (Sembcorp) has announced that its India arm, Sembcorp Energy India Limited (SEIL), has won a new 400 MW solar power project in the Indian state of Rajasthan. 
Sembcorp won this capacity, at INR2/kWh tariff, through its renewables subsidiary Sembcorp Green Infra in a closely contested auction conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).  
SEIL has received the letter of award from SECI to develop the project in Rajasthan. 
The project will connect to the state’s transmission utility Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (RVPN). The SECI will buy the entire solar electricity generated from the project under a long-term 25-year power purchase agreement, as per the company statement. 
The project will be funded through a mixture of internal funds and debt and is expected to start commercial operation by mid-2022. 
Vipul Tuli, chief executive officer-South Asia, Sembcorp Industries, said: “As a long-term player committed to India’s energy transition, we are pleased to secure the 400 MW utility scale solar project in Rajasthan. Sembcorp has established a track record of delivering world-class power projects within timelines. We are confident of delivering this project, thanks to strong support from central and state government agencies and our business partners. India is a key market for Sembcorp, where we will continue to contribute to the nation’s clean energy mission. With this win, we have moved into our next phase of growth.”
Since entering the Indian market in 2011, SEIL has established itself as a reliable independent power producer in the country. With a presence across nine states, SEIL owns and operates 35 assets with a total power capacity of 4,370 MW, including 1,730 MW of renewables.
After Singapore, India is the second-largest revenue generator for the integrated energy player Sembcorp Industries. In the year 2019, it earned overall revenues of S$9618 million, of which S$1625 million came from the power business of Sembcorp Energy India Limited.
With the latest win in Rajasthan, Sembcorp Industries now has a renewables portfolio of over 3 GW in operation and under development across Singapore, China and India.
