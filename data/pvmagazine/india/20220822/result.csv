The modules from Jakson’s Helia series are based on M10 half-cut mono PERC cells. They are designed for use in residential, commercial and utility-scale installations. Its polycrystalline and monocrystalline panels are already included on the ALMM list, which is produced by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The seventh update to the list now features its Helia series 600 W modules.  
The ALMM list includes eligible models and manufacturers of solar modules that comply with the Bureau of Indian Standards. Only the models and manufacturers included on the ALMM list can qualify for use in government projects and projects set up under government schemes and programs.
“Helia series modules are available in variants ranging from 120, 132, 144, and 156 half-cut cells. Developed using A+ category half-cut mono PERC solar cells and combined with multi-busbar (MBB) technology and high-density interconnections, these achieve a class-leading efficiency of over 21%,” said Jakson.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/22/larsen-toubro-builds-green-hydrogen-plant-at-hazira-manufacturing-complex/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 22, 2022",Larsen & Toubro builds green hydrogen plant at Hazira manufacturing complex,"Larsen & Toubro has commissioned 380 kW of an 800 kW green hydrogen plant at its AM Naik Heavy Engineering Complex in Hazira, Gujarat.
The Indian multinational said the green hydrogen plant, which is spread across 3,000 square meters, aims to produce 45 kg of green hydrogen per day for self-consumption by the company’s Hazira manufacturing complex. The operational 380 kW capacity uses an alkaline electrolysis process. The remaining 420 kW capacity will be based on PEM electrolysis technology. 
“The green hydrogen plant is designed for an electrolyzer capacity of 800 kW comprising both alkaline (380 kW) and PEM (420 kW) technologies,” said Larsen & Toubro. “It will be powered by a rooftop solar plant of 990 kW peak DC capacity and a 500kWh battery energy storage system. The 420 kW PEM electrolyzer, along with solar plant capacity augmentation to 1.6 MW peak DC, will be part of future expansion.” 
Larsen & Toubro engineers set up the green hydrogen generation plant and integrated it with the existing manufacturing facilities to use the high-purity green hydrogen (99.99%) and oxygen that is produced. The manufacturing facility will use a blend of 15% hydrogen with natural gas as a fuel. Oxygen will supplement the existing usage in cutting and welding applications. 
The plant design incorporates both active and passive safety systems to ensure safe operation and production. It will be operated through state-of-the-art control systems with remote monitoring functionality, the company said. In addition, an integrated data analytics platform designed by Larsen & Toubro will provide insight into the performance of the electrolyzers and the overall plant.
Larsen & Toubro said it aims to play a significant role in accelerating the ecosystem around green hydrogen, with its thrust in both the EPC and build-own-operate models, coupled with the backward integration of manufacturing electrolyzers and grid battery energy storage systems.

HIRA Group arm Godawari Power and Ispat Ltd. is the offtaker. The capacity is part of a 172 MWp open-access PV order from HIRA Group. The project’s balance capacity is set for commissioning by January next year.
The 70 MW captive solar plant was constructed on 184 acres of land in the villages of Kakrel, Nawagaon, and Baigatola in Rajnandgaon district. It uses 540 Wp mono PERC modules based on half-cut cell technology. The balance of systems components were made in India, including solar inverters from Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corp. (TMEIC). 
Oriano built the project on a turnkey basis, with a scope spanning CREDA approval, land due diligence, design, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, and operation and maintenance for five years. It now has a project development and EPC portfolio of more than 800 MWp and aims to exceed 1 GW by the end of this year.
Godawari Power and Ispat manufactures steel products, mainly steel wire. It also makes sponge iron, billets, ferroalloys, among other products.
