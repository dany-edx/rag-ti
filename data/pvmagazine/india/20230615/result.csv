Scientists at the Mutah University in Jordan have sought the reduce the operating temperature of photovoltaic panels by placing clear acrylic sheets in various slops over the modules at a distance of approximately 30 cm.
The researchers said that 3 mm acrylic sheets can reflect and absorb 10% of solar radiation with wavelengths below 1.1 μm, which is insufficient for exciting electrons in PV power generation. They believe this unused radiation contributes to increased panel temperature and reduced performance.
“All of these wasted solar radiations will just heat the PV panel and increase the surface temperature,” the researchers stated.
For their experiments, the researchers used three 30-degree tilted monocrystalline solar panels, each with a power of 50 W, dimensions of 630 mm x 540 mm x 18 mm, and weighing 3.3 kg.
They used one panel as a reference without the acrylic sheet, while the second panel had a sheet installed at a 30 mm distance with variable slopes of 15, 30, and 45 degrees. The third panel had a parallel-mounted sheet at the same distance.
Through analysis and tests, the scientists found that the panel with slopes of 30 and 45 degrees experienced the highest temperature reduction at 14.5%, while the panel with the parallel-mounted sheet achieved a decrease of around 10%.
“The reduction in PV surface temperature led to an increase in PV electrical efficiency and output power of about 2% each,” they explained. “The results of all experiments demonstrated that installing a clear acrylic sheet will reduce the PV surface temperatures, enhance the performance, increase the electrical energy production, and extend the cell life.”
They introduced the new tech in “Installing clear acrylic sheet to reduce unwanted sunlight waves that photovoltaic panels receive,” which was recently published in Results in Engineering.

Solar in Southeast Asia is set for a rebound, following a two-year market contraction triggered by Vietnam’s abrupt suspension of its generous feed-in-tariff regime in 2020, the Asian Photovoltaic Industry Association (APVIA) and the Global Solar Council (GSC) say in a new report, published in collaboration with SolarPower Europe.
Annual capacity additions are expected to hit 3.8 GW in 2023, up 13% from the previous year. In 2021, the market contracted by 68% to 4.2 GW of annual additions. But now, favorable policy frameworks, declining technology costs, and increasing electricity demand now point to growth opportunities in Southeast Asia.
“New capacity is well distributed across different countries and the regional market no longer depends on one single contributor, [i.e. Vietnam],” said the APVIA and the GSC.
However, uncertainty remains, as several countries are now at a turning point in their solar stories. The report said it remains to be seen just how quickly they can deploy solar. The region also faces challenges related to grid infrastructure, access to financing, land availability, and lack of a skilled workforce. According to the report’s “high” scenario, regional installations could hit 5.7 GW in 2023, or contract to 2.5 GW under a “low” scenario.
“Starting from 2024, a high pace of growth is expected across the region,” the APVIA and the GSC said. Annual installations are forecasted to grow 32% to reach 5.1 GW in 2024, 59% to 8.1 GW in 2025, 28% to 10.4 GW in 2026, finally hitting 13.3 GW of new additions in 2027, according to the report.
The region’s top five markets are Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/15/reviving-stranded-power-plants-better-than-investing-in-new-thermal-capacity/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 15, 2023",Reviving stranded power plants better than investing in new thermal capacity,"A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) finds that acquiring and subsequently reviving stranded thermal plants is a better option for India’s short-term energy security needs than investing in new fossil-fuel-based capacity.
The report comes against the backdrop of the central government directing NTPC, India’s biggest power producer, to add a further 7 GW of new thermal power units over the coming three years. 
The report identifies six plants with a cumulative capacity of 6.1 GW that are ripe for strategic acquisition by NTPC in partnership with other government-owned companies like Power Finance Corp., REC, and National Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd (NARCL).
“IEEFA believes any new investment in thermal power can potentially lead to stranded asset risk, given the clear economic case of renewable energy over thermal power. Financing these thermal plants will expose domestic banks to another set of potential power sector non-performing assets (NPAs) and a higher climate risk on their portfolios,” said Shantanu Srivastava, Sustainable Finance and Climate Risk Lead, South Asia, IEEFA.    
According to the report, a strategy to strategically acquire and revive power sector NPAs will also clean up the books of Indian banks, which have been reeling under high NPAs for over a decade.
“It will give the banks more headroom to contribute towards achieving India’s ambitious clean energy goals,” said Srivastava.
The report, through case studies, argues that by partnering with either PFC Projects Limited (PPL) or NARCL, NTPC can save significantly on upfront investments while adding capacity for India’s immediate energy security needs.
“NTPC can undertake work on providing coal linkages and power purchase agreements where required, while PPL can provide finance for working capital requirements,” said Srivastava.
“On the other hand, there are examples of asset reconstruction companies acquiring stranded assets using a 15:85 model, wherein it pays 15% of the consideration amount upfront and issues security receipts for 85% of the consideration amount, payable on recovery of loans. Partnering with NARCL, with the 15:85 central to its strategy and security receipts having a sovereign guarantee, to acquire some of the stranded thermal assets means that NTPC will not have to invest much capital upfront,” he added.
The report also highlights that acquisition and revival should be the first step, as adding new or acquired thermal assets will hurt the acquirer’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) profile.
“NTPC aims to install 60 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, which would require securing capital from global ESG investors. Hence, a post-acquisition strategy to retire and repurpose acquired stressed thermal assets for renewable energy generation will align well with ESG investors and prevent future stranded assets on NTPC’s books,” said Srivastava.
“The company can also explore the burgeoning market for carbon credits trading to further improve returns from repurposed projects,” he added.

Ciel & Terre says it has become a “gigawatt player” in the floating PV segment. It has 400 MW of projects under construction and a total pipeline of 1.5 GW, including projects that are currently being designed.
The France-based floating solar specialist has more than 280 projects installed in more than 30 countries, with a total capacity of 820 MW. It installed its first megawatt-scale projects in Japan in 2013.
Its portfolio now includes a 70 MW floating solar array in China, a 73.4 MW project in India, and an 88 MW installation on a protected stretch of seashore in Taiwan. It is currently building an extension of the Taiwan Changbin project, with a target of 192 MW.
“One of the main challenges for this extension is to manage the salty water effects on metallic parts with a very careful selection of materials with an anti-corrosion screw set solution,” it said in a statement.
Waves and tides pose challenges for anchoring in cyclonic zones. Ciel & Terre Taiwan has developed an innovative anchoring system that distributes loads based on tide levels.
Its other projects under construction include a 120 MW installation on a cascading reservoir.
“The site is actually quite challenging in terms of environmental loads considering the wave height, the water depth, the nature of the rocky lakebed, which are very specific to such type of application on dams,” said Ciel & Terre.
The company said it aims to deliver 2 GW of cumulative floating solar capacity by 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/15/first-solar-showcases-pre-commercial-bifacial-thin-film-pv-modules/,"BIFACIAL,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 15, 2023",First Solar showcases pre-commercial bifacial thin-film PV modules,"From pv magazine Global
US-based thin-film PV manufacturer First Solar is showcasing fully functional, pre-commercial, bifacial thin-film PV modules at Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany. It has announced a limited production run of what it calls “the world’s first bifacial solar panel utilizing an advanced thin film semiconductor.” The cells feature thin-film CdTe for the semiconductor.
The bifacial product line is now undergoing field and laboratory testing. It builds on the company’s Series 6 Plus monofacial modules, which were first launched in 2019.
First Solar’s R&D teams have reportedly developed a transparent back contact for the module. This innovative feature allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through the back of the module instead of being absorbed as heat. It also enables bifacial energy generation. The manufacturer said that this technology will reduce the operational temperature of the module and increase its specific energy yield.
“This module combines the quality, sustainability, reliability, and long-term performance of our Series 6 Plus platform with our first increment of bifaciality,” said Pat Buehler, chief product officer at First Solar. “Once commercialized, we expect Series 6 Plus Bifacial to represent the first real alternative to crystalline silicon-based bifacial technology, effectively combining bifaciality with the industry’s best warranted degradation rate, CdTe thin film’s ability to deliver more energy per nameplate watt, best-in-class reliability and durability, and innovative module design.”
The monofacial series 6 Plus modules have power ratings from 455 W to 480 W and up to 19.0% efficiency. They offer a 0.3% warranted degradation rate, spectral response, shading behavior, and an anti-reflective coating to enhance energy production.
“Moreover, unlike crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels, First Solar’s Series 6 Plus module does not experience losses from Light Induced Degradation (LID) and Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID),” said First Solar.
In October 2022, First Solar said that it would build a new R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio. The facility will be completed in 2024 with a pilot manufacturing line to produce full-sized prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules.

Singh met a French delegation recently to discuss collaboration for accelerating the global energy transition, powered by solar energy, under the institutional framework of the International Solar Alliance (ISA).
India is the President and France the Co-President of ISA.
The French delegation was led by Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, Minister of State for Development, Francophonie and International Partnerships.
Singh emphasized the need for the ISA to take up more solar energy projects, especially in Africa. He stressed on supporting energy transition in economically weak countries through green funds.
The two sides observed that almost half of the African continent does not have access to electricity. Noting that alongside energy transition, the focus has to be also on ensuring energy access as well, Singh spoke of the need to help the ISA forge ahead in this direction. 
Singh emphasized the role of three funds: insurance for renewable energy projects, payment security mechanism, and debt financing. “Once established, these funds will grow, due to contributions and interest payments,” the minister told the French delegation.  
Singh said that the ISA should set up a de-risking mechanism and should also tap more green funds to promote grid-scale solar energy projects in the African continent.
The two sides also took note of Kenya’s success in renewable energy and discussed the idea of holding an ISA conference in Kenya.
