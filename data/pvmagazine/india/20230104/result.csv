The allocation includes INR 17,490 crore for the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program, INR 1,466 crore for pilot projects, INR 400 crore for R&D, and INR 388 crore for other mission components.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) will formulate the scheme guidelines for the implementation of the respective components.
The Mission targets the development of a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT (million metric tonnes) per annum by 2030 with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country. The targets by 2030 are likely to bring in over INR 8 lakh crore in investments and create over 6 lakh jobs while leading to a cumulative reduction in fossil fuel imports by over INR one lakh crore. Nearly 50 MMT per annum of CO2 emissions are expected to be averted by 2030.
The Mission will facilitate demand creation, production, utilization, and export of Green Hydrogen. Under the SIGHT program, two distinct financial incentive mechanisms targeting the domestic manufacturing of electrolyzers and the production of Green Hydrogen will be provided. The Mission will also support pilot projects in emerging end-use sectors and production pathways. Regions capable of supporting large-scale production and/or utilization of hydrogen will be identified and developed as green hydrogen hubs.
“An enabling policy framework will be developed to support the establishment of a Green Hydrogen ecosystem. A robust Standards and Regulations framework will be also developed. Further, a public-private partnership framework for R&D (Strategic Hydrogen Innovation Partnership – SHIP) will be facilitated under the Mission; R&D projects will be goal-oriented, time-bound, and suitably scaled up to develop globally competitive technologies. A coordinated skill development program will also be undertaken under the Mission,” according to a government release.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/04/india-misses-2022-renewables-target-of-175-gw-by-30/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 4, 2023",India misses 2022 renewables target of 175 GW by 30%,"Bridge To India analysts estimate India has installed a cumulative renewable capacity (excluding large hydro) of 122 GW by December, 30% short of the 175 GW target set by the government.
According to the analysts, annual solar and wind capacity addition averaged about 9 GW over the last five years as against a corresponding target of 19 GW. Wind capacity growth, with average annual capacity addition of only 2 GW, suffered particularly since the transition to competitive auctions in 2017. In contrast, solar capacity grew more consistently.
Going forward, the government has set an extremely ambitious target for combined solar and wind capacity addition at 36 GW per year up to FY 2030. However, analysts expect 2023 to be a very slow year as many projects are being postponed due to a lack of domestically manufactured modules. Module supply over the year is expected to be constrained with the implementation of up to 40% basic customs duty (BCD) and ALMM (Approved List of Models and Manufacturers) policy.
The government has already provided a time extension of up to September 2024 for many centrally auctioned projects.
The analysts highlight four key measures towards meeting the revised targets and addressing both demand and supply side challenges in the sector.
Encourage demand from states. Most states seem reluctant to buy more renewable power despite strong policy thrust, growing demand, and low cost. 25 of the 30 states had adopted Renewable Purchase Obligation targets lower than the central government target of 21.2% for FY 2022. Even the low targets were rarely enforced by state regulators because of the poor financial condition of DISCOMs, intermittency concerns, lack of renewable resources, and/ or land at a reasonable cost.
Amongst the larger states, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and West Bengal are the main laggards. Only five states including Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Haryana have adopted the enhanced RPO target of 43.3% for FY 2030.
The government needs to activate demand by undertaking efforts to boost grid flexibility, investment in storage infrastructure, and demand management.
Address land and transmission bottlenecks. Initiatives such as solar park schemes, green energy corridors, and renewable energy zones have faced extensive delays and cost overruns. Almost all utility-scale projects face acute land, and transmission challenges delaying execution.
The recent announcement of a 500 GW transmission plan by CEA is a good first step but timely implementation is key, said the analysts.
Improve the integrity of the bidding process. According to the analysts, the excessive policy focus on reducing the cost of renewable power as against addressing renewable power’s intermittency issue or facilitating timely completion has been a major detraction. The overly loose bidding framework has allowed both off-takers and project developers to wriggle out of their commitments resulting in a large number of projects being canceled or postponed.
They recommend a tighter procurement process with more emphasis on execution certainty to instill bidding discipline.
Policy certainty for corporate and residential markets. Corporate and residential renewable markets hold immense growth potential but a lack of support from DISCOMs and states is preventing these markets from taking off. Recent measures to streamline the project approval process, waive inter-state transmission charges, and create national application portals need to be followed through with effective implementation to accelerate progress, said the analysts.
Commenting on the latest developments, Vinay Rustagi, managing director of Bridge To India, said: “The sector has been somewhat muddling along recently in the absence of policy stability and proactive long-term planning. The task ahead is going to get more acute as we add more intermittent renewable capacity impacting grid stability. It is important that we lay a stronger foundation for the future with investments in new technologies, transmission, and storage capacity, and improved coordination between center and states.”

“While 5% GST is levied for the vehicle, for spare parts, there is no clarity and the industry ends up paying 28% (except for batteries),” it said, urging for a uniform 5% GST for all EV spare parts.
The EV manufacturers have also urged the government to review customs duty on lithium-ion cells for EVs as cell manufacturing within the country is still in its nascency. They have called for the scrapping of customs duty on cells until cell manufacturing starts in India.
The manufacturers also want an extension of the FAME Scheme, citing they are yet to meet the penetration the subsidy was supposed to catalyze. The validity of FAME II is set to expire on March 31, 2024.
“The new FAME II scheme should be linked to E-mobility conversion rather than being time-based. According to market trends, E Mobility, particularly E2W, has the potential to continue growing once it reaches 20% of the total 2W market. The subsidy can be tapered thereafter,” they said.
Further, the FAME II scheme should have provisions to directly transfer the subsidy to the customers. The scope of FAME should be expanded to include commercial vehicles on a project-mode basis. “Today, trucks account for over 40% of India’s fuel consumption and over 40% of the Greenhouse gas emissions across the road transport sector. Expanding the FAME subsidy to electric tractors will help India reduce fuel imports and GHG emissions,” they said.
The EV manufacturers have also called for incentives/grants for battery R&D and a policy towards lithium-ion battery recycling. “For research & development expenses related to battery recycling, a 200% tax rebate, as before, may be considered.”
Other recommendations include the implementation of a Battery Swapping Policy, reduction in GST on swap batteries, and FAME II subsidy for extra (float) batteries for battery swapping.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/04/ntpc-starts-indias-first-green-hydrogen-blending-in-png-network/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,GUJARAT",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 4, 2023",NTPC starts India’s first green hydrogen blending in PNG network,"NTPC Ltd, India’s largest power generator, has commissioned India’s first project to supply green hydrogen-blended piped natural gas (PNG) in efforts to decarbonize the cooking sector. With this, it has become one of the few countries like Australia, Germany, and the UK to achieve this feat.
The green hydrogen blending has been started in the PNG network of NTPC Kawas township in the Surat district of Gujarat. The project is a joint effort of NTPC and Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL).
After the start of the blending operation, NTPC Kawas held awareness workshops for township residents with the help of GGL officials.
“NTPC and GGL have worked relentlessly towards achieving this milestone in record time after Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), the regulatory body, approved 5% vol./vol. blending of green hydrogen with PNG to start with and the blending level would be scaled phase-wise to reach 20%,” stated NTPC.
Green hydrogen when blended with natural gas reduces CO2 emissions keeping the net heating content the same. This set-up is geared up to supply H2-NG (natural gas) to households of Kawas township at Adityanagar, Surat.
Green hydrogen in Kawas is made by electrolysis of water using power from the existing 1 MW floating solar project of NTPC Kawas.
“This would bring India to the center stage of the global hydrogen economy. India would not only reduce its hydrocarbon import bill significantly but can also bring forex ashore by being a green hydrogen and green chemicals exporter to the world,” stated NTPC.
