https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/13/gates-backed-fourth-power-pilots-thermal-storage-based-on-tpv-cells/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 13, 2023",Gates-backed Fourth Power pilots thermal storage based on TPV cells,"From pv magazine global
While thermal energy storage (TES) has struggled to take off to date, U.S.-based Fourth Power is taking a new technological approach to some of the cost and scale challenges. Its high-density TES system is based on its Guinness World Record achievement for high temperature in its patented liquid metal heat transfer system, which allows for operation at almost half the sun’s temperature.
“Until this innovation, I don’t think there has been an innovation in thermal fluid infrastructure in almost 100 years,” Fourth Power CTO Asegun Henry told pv magazine. “Utilizing PVC, steel, or nickel-alloy pipes has been around for a very long time, and that’s what everyone is doing.”
He said Fourth Power’s approach is based on knowledge of the struggles that other TES companies have faced in trying to scale the technology.
“The key is our liquid metal handling infrastructure, which allows us to transfer heat at fluxes more than an order of magnitude higher than traditional thermofluid systems,” Henry said. “This leads to higher power density and lower cost.”
Fourth Power’s system converts renewable energy to heat, or thermal energy in a fully enclosed system roughly the size of half of a football field. The thermal battery heats liquid tin and moves it through a closed-loop piping system to heat stacks of carbon blocks until they glow white hot.
The system then exposes TPV cells to the light and converts it into electricity. This is similar to traditional solar generation but uses light from very hot — up to 2,400 C — graphite rather than light from the sun to produce electricity. The battery is sealed in a warehouse of argon gas to maximize system lifetime and ensure safety.
“We’re primarily focused on electricity and industrial heat,” Henry said. “To be more specific, we aspire for our technology to replace peaker plants in combination with renewable electricity generation.”
For power generation alone, Fourth Power’s roundtrip efficiency target is 50%.
“Our TPV cells have already set a world record at 41% – and we have designs to reach 50%,” Henry said. “For co-generation, the efficiency is near 100%.”
Finally, by using readily available and less expensive materials, the overall system cost is lower, enabling energy storage that is 10 times cheaper than lithium-ion batteries ($25/kWh-e vs. $330/kWh-e), according to the company.
On Tuesday, Fourth Power announced that it had received $19 million in Series A funding to scale its TES technology. The investment round was led by the venture capital firm DCVC, with participation from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Black Venture Capital Consortium.
“After more than 10 years of research and development, we are grateful to reach this crucial milestone in our journey thanks to our funding partners who recognized the innovation and potential of Fourth Power’s thermal battery technology,” said Henry, who developed Fourth Power’s thermal battery technology when he was a professor at Georgia Tech.
The funds will also support the construction of a 1 MWh-e prototype facility outside of Boston, with a targeted completion date in 2026. In addition, it will facilitate rigorous durability tests and expand the company’s engineering team.
“Following the 1 MWH-e prototype facility’s successful completion, we plan to partner with utilities to conduct pilot projects designed for commercialization throughout 2026 and 2027,” Henry said. “We anticipate achieving our goal of installing full-scale, 100 MWh-e systems by 2028.”

Many of the Chinese solar photovoltaic module manufacturers are alleged to have reneged on their supply contracts, leading to an escalation in prices of the panels that are critical for solar power generation.
With more than 80% of India’s solar PV module market being controlled by Chinese suppliers, the domestic engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies are hit with amplified costs. Several of their clients have opted to defer projects.
Tanmoy Duari, CEO, AXITEC Energy India, says, There are lots of utility-scale projects that need to be commissioned before the ALMM abeyance period elapses on March 31, 2024. As the time is short, the developers cannot wait too long. If developers cross the commercial operation date deadline, they will have to pay a huge fine to the project’s owner/govt or can even be blacklisted for a few years.
The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), vide its order dated March 10, 2023, exempted solar projects to be commissioned till March 31, 2024, from the requirement to source modules from the Approved Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) list. It took the step given the challenges faced by solar power developers in sourcing modules from domestic manufacturers.
Duari says accelerating PV deployment in India requires a multifaceted approach addressing the following challenges:
Price uncertainty: The volatility in prices, especially after contracts between Chinese module manufacturers and Indian assemblers, poses a significant challenge. Implementing long-term contracts or exploring diverse sourcing options can help mitigate this uncertainty and stabilize prices.
Currency fluctuations: The continuous increase in the value of the Dollar, affecting the purchase of cells and other components, demands strategic financial planning. Hedging mechanisms, financial instruments, or exploring local alternatives for certain components can be considered to counter the impact of currency fluctuations.
Financial closure challenges: Securing loans and financial support is a critical aspect of PV projects. Streamlining the financial closure process by fostering collaboration between financial institutions and project developers, along with offering incentives or easing regulations, can enhance accessibility to financial resources.
Clearance for substations: Delays in obtaining clearances for substations can impede project timelines. Streamlining approval processes, ensuring transparent communication between stakeholders, and leveraging digital platforms for documentation can help expedite clearance procedures.
By addressing these challenges collaboratively, the solar industry in India can work towards a more stable, resilient, and efficient deployment of PV projects.

A group of researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) and Sidney-based PV manufacturer Sundrive has utilized Monte Carlo Ray Trace (MCRT) techniques and electrical modeling to assess the power yield gains that bifacial rooftop PV systems offer compared to monofacial counterparts.
The scientists explained that their modeling framework couples MCRT with a detailed electrical model of high-efficiency bifacial PV modules, which they said tackles the typical limitations associated with traditional view factor (VF) modeling.
“Specifically, the approach resolves the complexities of real-world factors, including mismatch phenomena at both the cell-to-cell and array levels arising from non-uniform illumination effects and edge effects,” they said. “Moreover, it meticulously accounts for non-uniform illumination effects stemming from module frames and mounting components, an aspect often overlooked in previous models.”
The proposed approach works in four steps: Optical modeling; thermal modeling; electrical modeling; and integration. The MCRT model assesses direct and diffuse light separately and combines the results based on measured direct and diffuse irradiance values at each timestep.
The research group utilized the MCRT framework for analyzing the performance of two rows of eight solar modules each with a constant row-to-row distance of 5 m. The modules are tilt-rack mounted at different angles at over 20 cm above the surface of the roof. “It’s important to note that our exploration of system design does not extend to considerations of module spacing or other design factors that influence optimal system performance,” it said, referring to the limitations of their technique.
The analysis showed that rooftop reflectivity is a key factor in increasing a bifacial rooftop PV system performance. The academics found that bifacial arrays can provide energy gains that are up to 22.6% higher than those of monofacial counterparts. “Additionally, the investigation revealed that rooftop reflectivity also influences the optimal tilt angle for bifacial modules,”  they emphasized. “Compared to monofacial modules, bifacial modules exhibit higher optimal tilt angles for maximum energy generation.”
Moreover, the analysis demonstrated that system and module design also play a decisive role in increasing power yield, with parallel interconnections of top and bottom substrings being particularly beneficial. “Without parallel substrings, bifacial gain was reduced by 0.9 % for a system with mounting components at a 75 % reflective rooftop,” the scientists noted.
Their findings were introduced in the study “Accurate modeling of the bifacial gain potential of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.

The group, which is at the forefront of India’s green energy transition, targets to become net zero by 2050 or earlier for five of its portfolio companies — Adani Green Energy, Adani Energy Solutions (AESL), Adani Ports & SEZ, ACC, and Ambuja Cements—by actively sourcing renewables, electrifying operations and adopting biofuels, and deploying waste heat recovery and energy storage technologies.
These portfolio companies will invest $100 billion over the next decade toward achieving energy transition.
“The roadmap to the net zero transition will require last-mile green hydrogen solutions. To make green hydrogen adoption feasible, Adani’s track record in large-scale renewables and fully integrated manufacturing with end-to-end EPC capability — all in one single location — uniquely positions it to lower costs,” stated Adani Group.
Adani Electricity Mumbai, a subsidiary of Adani Energy Solutions, has increased its renewable energy share in the overall mix to an impressive 38.3%, positioning Mumbai as leading procurer of RE amongst all megacities. This was made possible by the collaboration between portfolio companies Adani Energy Solutions (which owns the Mumbai distribution business) and Adani Green Energy.
Adani Energy Solutions received an impressive score of 86% from CSRHUB, a leading ESG global performance rating agency. With this, AESL’s score surpassed the Electric & Gas Utilities industry average of 911 companies.
Adani Green Energy is the highest rated utility company in the world as per Sustainalytics. In the first half of the financial year, the renewable power company achieved zero waste to landfill for all operational sites and turned net water positive at all sites of 200 MW or more.
Adani Ports, which owns 15 ports and logistics business, is well on track to turn net zero by 2040. In the first half of FY24, it achieved a 15% share of renewables in the total energy mix, reduced energy intensity by 46%, energy emission by 48% and water consumption intensity by 59%.
Adani Enterprises is building three giga-factories with a target to develop 10 GW of solar panels, 10 GW wind turbines, and 5 GW hydrogen electrolyzers as part of its low-cost integrated green hydrogen project. For solar module manufacturing, the glass factory is completed, with work commencing on the ingot and wafer plant. In October, the company commenced production of India’s largest wind turbine of 5.2 MW.
To promote reduced emission and promote sustainable energy, Adani Power partnered with IHI Corporation and Kowa company to explore ammonia co-firing at the Adani Power Mundra plant. The studies aim at initially de-carbonizing Adani’s coal fired plants but with a larger objective to implement the technology in other coal-fired plants across India.
In another significant move, Adani Enterprises entered into an agreement with Ashok Leyland and Ballard Power to develop a hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Truck (FCET) for mining logistics and transportation, which will be Asia’s first and one of the few companies globally to operate green hydrogen-powered mining trucks.
