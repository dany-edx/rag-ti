The foundation stone for the project was laid by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.
The first-of-its-kind project will co-locate energy storage with wind and solar power in Kurnool district. It will feature 10.8 GWh of daily pumped storage, 3 GW of solar, and 550 MW of wind. Greenko expects the $3 billion project to become operational by the end of 2023. It has already started signing storage contracts with central utilities and large industrial customers. 
Greenko has an installed 7.5 GW of renewables, including wind, solar and hydro, with 10 GW now under development. It is also building an intelligent, low-cost energy cloud storage platform with 50 GWh of capacity by 2025, followed by 100 GWh to be commissioned by 2027. In addition, it is targeting 10 GW of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030.

About 70% of the land required for the solar plant has already been allotted. The PV plant will be ready within a year, and will generate 1.4 GW of electricity per day, said Girraj Dandotia, the chairman of Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd.  
At present, the state’s largest single-site solar power plant is in Rewa district, generating 750 MW of power. The solar plant in Morena district will be twice as big as the Rewa plant. It will be built under the solar park scheme.
“The district administration has so far allotted 2,000 hectares of land in the hills of Behara Mata Temple between Kailaras-Pahargarh road. The allotment process for the remaining 800 hectares of land is in progress,” Dandotia said. “(About) 70% of its power will go to Madhya Pradesh, and 30% of the electricity can be voluntarily supplied to anyone by the company setting up a solar power plant.”

Project developers in Bangladesh are developing power plants at a slower pace, as overall costs have escalated by 15% to 20% since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Rising US dollar exchange rates are also driving up costs, as shipping costs soar due to the lingering impact of the pandemic, say stakeholders. Imran Chowdhury, country manager for Sungrow Renewables Development, said the last two years of Covid-linked disruptions and rise of the dollar against the Bangladeshi taka are having “serious impacts” on renewables.
Higher panel and inverter prices are driving up total EPC costs. Chowdhury said that prices of Tier-1 solar modules have increased by 15% to 18%, while prices of reputable inverter brands have risen by up to 8%. Due to rising prices, project developers are not reaching their targeted internal rates of return. This is one of the key factors for banks to see a project as bankable.
Masudur Rahim, chief executive officer of Omera Renewable Energy, said developers are a bit hesitant to move forward on projects now, as shipping costs have doubled and panel prices have increased by 10% to 15%.
“After signing a PPA, one has to commission a project within a year,” he said. “Many projects now may need to tenure extension due to procurement delay.”
Ezaz Al Qudrat A Mazid, managing director of Solar EPC Development Ltd., said that prices of modules increased several months ago. He said prices of electric cables and aluminum have also risen.
Bangladesh now has the capacity to generate 787 MW of renewable energy, with 553 MW coming from solar. The country aims to generate 40% of its total electricity from renewable sources by 2041.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/18/pulsed-joule-heating-tech-to-remove-snow-frost-ice-from-solar-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 18, 2022","‘Pulsed Joule heating’ tech to remove snow, frost, ice from solar modules","From pv magazine Global 
Scientists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have developed a multifunctional coating material to remove snow, frost and ice from PV modules by using “pulsed Joule heating,” which is the physical effect by which the passage of current through an electrical conductor produces thermal energy.
Compared to Joule heating alone, which would be too energy-dependent for the viability of the proposed technology, pulsed joule heating drastically reduces energy consumption and the time needed for desnowing, defrosting, and deicing.
“We tested the system on a lab-scale prototype where we used a solar simulator to simulate the sunlight, and we attached the solar cell to a low-temperature chiller and a humidifier to simulate the outside icing/snowing condition,” researcher Siavash Khodakarami told pv magazine. “The cost of the technology was not evaluated in our work. But we have studied the benefit of using this method rather than just leaving the snow on solar cells by themselves to melt over time.”
The scientists applied superhydrophobic (SHP) coating on the module glass, through a method that they describe as simple and ultra-scalable. They initially deposited a nanoscale-thick aluminum (Al) layer on the cover glass, followed by immersion in hot deionized water to create aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlO(OH)) nanostructures.
“The density and porosity of the nanostructures can be modified by varying the immersion time and temperature during fabrication,” they explained. “We chose the conditions used in order to achieve higher superhydrophobicity and minimized droplet–surface adhesion.”

The film becomes optically transparent after hydrothermal treatment. And as the surface roughness remains lower than 30 nm, it does not cause visible light scattering.
“The combination of optical transparency and superhydrophobicity in the same coating allows for multi-functionality to enable pulsed Joule heating for desnowing and defrosting on PV panels,” the researchers said. “For desnowing of PV panels, the cover glass needs to be capable of efficient pulsed surface heating, superhydrophobicity, and optical transparency.”
Indium tin oxide (ITO) was used as a layer for Joule heating, due to its remarkable optical transmittance of more than 85%, as well as certain electrical characteristics. The thin-film heater with a superhydrophobic surface acts at the interface of the substrate and snow/frost/ice and is said to achieve interfacial defrosting by confining the heat to a very thin region.
Through a series of tests, the academics found that pulsed Joule heating is divided into three different regimes of interfacial desnowing/defrosting, partial melting, and refreezing, depending on the energy input, pulse width, and inclination angle of the surface. The claim their new technique can remove snow and ice at a rate that is three times faster than convetional approaches.
“Our method only requires a single pulse of electrical current for heating the surface to completely remove accreted snow, frost, or ice,” they said.
The scientists introduced the technique in “Enabling Renewable Energy Technologies in Harsh Climates with Ultra-Efficient Electro-Thermal Desnowing, Defrosting, and Deicing,” which was recently published in Advanced Functional Materials.
“We are continuing the work to make it a possible commercial product for solar cells and other applications as well,” Khodakarami said.
