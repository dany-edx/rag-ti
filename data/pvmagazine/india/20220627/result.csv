However, a long-standing challenge with solid-state batteries is the growth of lithium dendrites across the solid-state electrolyte layer that leads to the premature shorting of cells and limits their practical viability. The dendrite growth accentuates during fast charging.
Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, have come up with an innovative interfacial engineering approach to enable fast charge-discharge rates in solid-state lithium metal batteries. They have found that nanoscopic refractory metal layers like Tungsten could improve the performance of these batteries by improving dendrite growth tolerance in solid-state electrolytes. 
The researchers performed extensive fundamental electrochemical measurements over several hundreds of solid-state lithium half cells with metallic interlayers between a garnet-based lithium-ion conductor and lithium. After nano-characterization, they realized that interfacial void growth precedes dendrite nucleation and growth. They identified that the growth of lithium voids during discharge leads to dendrite growth during charge.
The team comprising Vikalp Raj, Victor Venturi, Varun R Kankanallu, Bibhatsu Kuiri, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan, and Naga Phani B Aetukuri found that Li-ion currents were concentrated at the edges of the microscopic voids. The currents at these edges were around 10,000 times larger than average currents in the cell. Hence it is necessary to impede void growth to prevent dendrite growth.
To delay void growth, the researchers experimented with an ultrathin layer of refractory metals between the lithium anode and the solid electrolyte. They noted that tungsten is an ideal candidate to impede lithium vacancy motion due to its low solubility for lithium and therefore delay void growth. They collaborated with researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to corroborate their work through computational methods. 
The research was carried out under the collaborative energy storage platform between the Indian government’s Department of Science and Technology and the IISc. The Energy Storage Platform on Supercapacitors and Power Dense Devices platform aims to develop and engineer techno-economically viable, power-dense electrochemical energy storage solutions through active collaboration and accelerated technology development.
The team now intends to build on this advance to develop full solid-state cells that could enable charging in less than an hour and offer up to 1,000 or more cycles while withstanding high temperatures of 45 degrees Centigrade or higher.

Ohm Cleantech, a part of Pune-base electrolyzer specialist H2e Power Systems, developed the bus. It is purportedly the first hydrogen-operated bus to be made in India.
The bus is powered by a 60 kW PEM fuel cell. It provides a minimum range of 450 km on a single refill. The bus will welcome tourists to the Kaziranga Nation Park in Assam in the months aheads. 
Oil India’s green hydrogen plant at its Jorhat oilfield in Assam will supply the green hydrogen required for the bus. H2e Power Systems commissioned the plant for Oil India. The hydrogen will be blended with natural gas to run the hydrogen bus.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/27/novel-floating-pv-system-design-from-norway/,"FLOATING SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 27, 2022",Novel floating PV system design from Norway,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from Norway’s Institute for Energy Technology recently tested a novel floating PV system design developed by Norwegian startup Current Solar on a body of water in Kilinochchi, Sri Lanka.
The system has a capacity of 44 kW and uses composite beams to support the solar panels. It features high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes to provide system buoyancy.
“The composite beams are arranged in east-west orientation with a 15-degree tilt and the solar panels are mounted in portrait mode for maximum utilization of the standard-length HDPE pipe,” the researchers said. “Four of the strings are west facing, while the other four are east facing.”
They used two different kinds of solar panels provided by Norway-based REC Group – the REC Solar N-Peak 315 W and the REC Solar TwinPeak 295 W.
“Each string contains 18 modules, and for each module type there are two strings facing west and two strings facing east, giving a total of eight strings in the FPV system,” the researchers said. “Each pair of strings with the same module type and orientation is connected in parallel to a separate maximum power point tracker (MPPT) on the same inverter.”
The inverter is a 50 kW SMA device with a total of 6 MPPTs. The group describes the system as having a small footprint and a relatively open structure, as the modules are located close to the water surface.
The group compared the performance of the floating array with a reference 2.5 kW installation on the reservoir’s shore for a period of a year. The reference system consists of eight south-facing REC Solar N-Peak 315 W type modules with an 8-degree tilt.

The academics discovered that the floating PV installation did not have any performance issues. However, the dam at which it was installed had been dry for some time.
“When compared with the closely situated ground-mounted PV system, the relative yield difference during times of stable performance is 0.6% in favor of the FPV system, which is within the margin of error of installed capacity and is not considered a substantial difference in performance,” they stated. “The results show an overall performance of the system in the same range as other floating PV systems located in similar climates.”
They presented their findings in “The performance and amphibious operation potential of a new floating photovoltaic technology,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.
