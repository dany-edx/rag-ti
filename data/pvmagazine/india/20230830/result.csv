https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/30/redesigned-zinc-air-batteries-better-than-lithium-say-australian-researchers/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 30, 2023","Redesigned zinc-air batteries ‘better’ than lithium, say Australian researchers","From pv magazine Australia
A team of researchers at Western Australia’s Edith Cowan University have redesigned zinc-air batteries and claim to have overcome the technology’s notorious power output limitations.
“The new design has been so efficient it suppressed the internal resistance of batteries, and their voltage was close to the theoretical voltage which resulted in a high peak power density and ultra-long stability,” said research lead Muhammad Rizwan Azhar.
Zinc-air batteries consist of a zinc negative electrode and an air positive electrode. The chemistry holds promise and is significantly more sustainable than lithium-based counterparts, but the poor performance of air electrodes and short lifespan has limited the technology’s power output and ultimately its reach.
However, the Edith Cowan University team, says it has made a breakthrough in the technology which has enabled engineers to use a combination of new materials, such as carbon, cheaper iron and cobalt based minerals, to overcome these issues. The redesigned zinc-air batteries have emerged as a better alternative to lithium, according to the team’s recent study.
“Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are becoming more appealing because of their low cost, environmental friendliness, high theoretical energy density, and inherent safety,” said Azhar.
Lithium batteries rely on high-cost, finite resources, and also have safety issues.
”With the emergence of next-generation long-range vehicles and electric aircraft in the market, there is an increasing need for safer, more cost-effective, and high-performance battery systems that can surpass the capabilities of lithium-ion batteries,” said Azhar. “By using natural resources, such as zinc from Australia and air, this further enhances the cost-effectiveness and viability of these innovative zinc-air batteries for the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/30/google-to-sell-rooftop-solar-mapping-data/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 30, 2023",Google to sell rooftop solar mapping data,"Google announced it will sell application programming interfaces (API) datasets for the solar industry, empowering business operations with large, interactable data for understanding rooftop solar potential.
The Solar API contains key building, rooftop, shading, and panel configuration data covering over 320 million buildings in 40 countries, with the goal of helping accelerate the transition to clean, renewable, solar energy. The company said it expects to drive up to $100 million in revenues from sales of its API in the first year alone.
“By using the Solar API, solar businesses can improve the customer experience for interested property owners, create reliable project proposals without requiring an on-site visit, and expedite the overall installation process,” said Google.
Google is known in the solar industry for its Project Sunroof, a free application that helps homeowners understand their estimated bill savings potential for installing rooftop solar. The new Solar API builds on years of collaboration with industry leaders to develop datasets that fit their business needs.
The Solar API includes 3D dataset access for individual building data as well as for aggregated data for all buildings in a particular city or county.

Included in the Solar API is a Buildings Insights endpoint, which provides details of a building’s location, dimensions, and solar potential. It contains information like the size and slope of the roof and the modeled energy production of a rooftop array.
The API also contains a Data Layers endpoint, which produces granular details on raw solar information for the area surrounding a building. Data layers include shading and obstructions and the roof layout to assist detailed system placement and layout. The data can be used to create custom solar proposals and by software-as-a-service developers to automate the design of more efficient arrays.
A pilot project user and Solar API customer Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) used the API to create Suncle, an online rooftop solar energy simulation.
“By inputting an address, homeowners can locate their residence on the map, and adjust their electricity bill and solar installation size as they wish. They can find out installation costs, local subsidies available, cost savings, break even point, and how much impact their solar installation could have on reducing CO2, all in a few seconds. To get these figures without Suncle, they would need to have installers visit their house,” says Masami Jenkins, director, environment & social business design lab, TEPCO.
More information can be found on Google’s Solar API webpage and the related documentation page. A demo of the product can be found here.

Its primary objective was translating ambitious solar energy goals into concrete results while addressing pertinent regional issues. 
The meeting was presided over by Tania Masea, vice minister for new sources of the Ministry of People’s Power for Energy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, representing Latin America and the Caribbean Region as the ISA regional vice president.
The meeting was held virtually with participation from 20 ISA member countries, six ISA signatories, and seven prospective member countries from Latin America and the Caribbean Region, as well as representatives from ISA partner organizations and special invitees.
During the meeting, representatives from member countries addressed a range of topics related to the International Solar Alliance’s support programs for advancing solar energy deployment. Additionally, discussions revolved around the progress and impact of ISA flagship initiatives, including STAR-C, SolarX Startup Challenge, and Solar Finance Facility. 
Tania Masea, vice minister for new sources of the Ministry of People’s Power for Energy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, said, “The region is gearing to implement approximately 250 projects in the forthcoming years, with a planned capacity of nearly 19 GW…Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Chile, and Peru are spearheading solar energy adoption. These five nations contribute to over 88% of the installed solar capacity and approximately 97% of the planned expansions already underway. Around 15 countries within LAC have steadfastly committed to fulfilling 70% of the energy demands through renewable energy by 2030.” 
Noting that a 50% discount is available for solar pumps in Africa, Masea proposed extending this discount to Latin America as well. “By aggregating our volume, we can potentially negotiate a more favorable price for solar pumps. I suggest we initiate the tendering process without delay,” she said.
The Meeting discussed the ISA Five-Year Strategic Plan (2021-26), which outlines the roadmap for achieving the goals established by the ISA Framework Agreement. This strategic blueprint addresses the diverse needs of member countries within the ISA. It comprises a range of undertakings, including providing programmatic support and assistance to least developed countries and small island developing states in conducting capacity-building programs, offering analytics and advocacy support, facilitating investment mobilisations and assisting technological advancements. 
ISA aims to secure $1 billion over five years to achieve these objectives. 
Ajay Mathur, director general of ISA, said, “The future of energy transition in the Latin America and the Caribbean Region holds immense challenges and promising opportunities. This transition is driven by economic, environmental, and social factors and has the potential to shape the energy landscape of the entire region. One of the critical challenges facing energy transition in this region is the need for significant investments in infrastructure and technology. As renewable energy sources are intermittent, efficient storage solutions are also necessary to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply.”
“We can effectively mitigate the impacts by collaborating on climate action, sharing best practices, and implementing joint strategies. Highlighting the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing,” he added.
Deodat Indar, minister within the Ministry of Public Works of Guyana, remarked, “The government of Guyana has benefitted from ISA and looks forward to opportunities for greater collaboration as our country embarks on tremendous transformation in the energy sector.”
The Meeting spotlighted mini-grids’ role in universalizing energy access through innovative business models. As the international organization partner of India’s G20 Presidency, ISA released a report on the Roadmap of Solar Energy for Universal Energy Access. The Roadmap is a collaborative endeavor between ISA and India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), unfolding a strategic vision of leveraging solar-driven solutions to tackle the global energy access challenge effectively and economically. The report provides case studies, examples, and innovative policies that can make a pivotal shift in the deployment of solar mini-grids.
The International Solar Alliance is an international organization with 116 Member and Signatory countries. It works with governments to ease solar deployment and promote solar power as a sustainable transition to a carbon-neutral future. ISA’s mission is to unlock $1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing technology and its financing costs.

The site adjacent to Stanwell Power Station on Queensland’s mid-coast is now home to 10 iron flow batteries, with another 10 to follow suit shortly,* as the state government-owned energy company Stanwell Corp. prepares to transform its soon-to-be retiring coal plant to a AUD 100 million ($64 million) hub for renewable commercialisation testing, research, development and training.
The iron flow batteries use the technology of US-based Energy Storage Solutions, better known as ESS. Inc, for which local company Energy Storage Industries owns the Asia-Pacific licence. The pilot batteries are each 12 meters long and have a combined capacity of 1 MW/10 MWh. In its announcement, the Queensland government said the installation marks Australia’s first iron flow battery and the largest such installation in the world.
Energy Storage Industries (ESI) Managing Director Stuart Parry told pv magazine Australia the battery project is expected to be operational by September 2024. Once fully commissioned, Stanwell will acquire the flow battery, saying that it is aiming deliver service and maintenance on the pilot.
The iron flow battery deal is just one element of the transformation of Stanwell Power Station into the Stanwell Clean Energy Hub. This will include a AUD 100 million Future Energy and Innovation Training Hub (FEITH), described as a mall-sized “sandbox” for new technologies in wind, solar, hydrogen and battery storage.
Stanwell is also partnering with hydrogen electrolyzer technology company Hysata, a spinoff from research conducted at the University of Wollongong, which claims to have the world’s most efficient electrolysis cell. Stanwell’s Rockhampton hub will host 5 MW pilot project with Hysata’s electrolyzer technology to validate its commercialisation potential and technical performance. To that end, Stanwell will provide AUD 3 million and supply the site and facilities for the field deployment of the electrolyser at the site.
While news of the Stanwell coal plant’s transformation was only made Monday, work seems to have already began in the form of the battery delivery, and the government noted it will establish common infrastructure and civil works “in late 2023.”
The Stanwell hub is to be realised in stages, with the announcement flagging the AUD 100 million investment will be deployed over the next five years.
In early August, the Queensland government committed AUD 24 million to further evaluate and assess the capacity of flow battery technology to help the state meet its renewable energy targets. Of that funding, AUD 12 million went towards an iron flow battery from ESI.
