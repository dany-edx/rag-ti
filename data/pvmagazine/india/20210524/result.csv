As notified on the stock exchange, AGEL’s arm Adani Renewable Energy Holding Four has transferred 74% shareholding of MSEL to Adani Tradecom LLP—a wholly-owned arm of Adani Enterprises Limited, an entity falling under the joint control, i.e., Adani Group.
Adani Enterprises Limited, through its subsidiary Mundra Solar PV Limited, is already into production of high-efficiency multicrystalline, mono PERC and bifacial modules from a state-of-the-art factory in Gujarat. The acquisition of MSEL will help the company solidify its position in the solar manufacturing domain.
“MSEL is incorporated to manufacture crystalline silicon solar PV cells, modules and ancillary operations, which is in similar line of business undertaken by Adani Enterprises Limited through its subsidiary namely, Mundra Solar PV Limited. This acquisition will bring synergy in its current manufacturing operations and enhance the market share by its brand value,” read the AGEL statement.
MSEL is registered in Gujarat and is yet to commence its business operations.

The plants—to be installed in sizes of 500 kW to 2 MW—shall come upon cultivable land, pastureland, marshland, barren and uncultivable land within 5 km radius of substations at various locations in Madhya Pradesh.
Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company Limited (MPPMCL) shall sign a 25-year power purchase agreement at a tariff discovered through competitive bidding followed by reverse auction. The tariff ceiling is fixed at INR 3.07/kWh (US$ 0.042/kWh).
The developer’s work scope includes design, engineering, construction, testing, commissioning of the solar plant (including the construction of bay and related switchgear at sub-station), along with comprehensive operation and maintenance for 25 years.

The robot is fully autonomous and weighs only 5 kg (with batteries), portable enough to carry in a backpack. 
Shreem can be operated through a web-based app from any remote location, and overcomes the problem of accessibility for dangerous or difficult-to-reach rooftop installations. The bot, being Bluetooth-enabled, can also be operated manually using a mobile app or through an RF remote-operated controller. It can be preset to start at a desired time of the day automatically.
Shreem uses airwash technology to clean the panels, requiring no water or any harmful chemicals. It consists of two sets of wiping brushes (axial and radial) made of microfiber cloth. Controlled airflow blows the dust off the panels efficiently. The radial brush ensures any leftover dust on the edges is also blown off.
The bot uses an intelligent algorithm and sensors to detect edges and move in a straight path covering the entire area. It aligns automatically to account for undulations or uneven surfaces. Further, it is intelligent to differentiate between the end of the table and gaps between tables. The bot uses a computational neural network to train itself about the number of rows, columns, modules, inclination angle, path planning, and direction for effective operation.
Shreem comes with a solar-powered docking station, which keeps monitoring weather parameters like the rain, wind speed, etc. The bot will return to or continue to be in the docking station if the weather is unsafe for its operation.
Shreem can clean around 200 panels an hour. It is powered by a 10Ah lithium-ion battery pack with a life of around 2000 cycles.

New research from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory looks at where to locate battery energy storage to provide the highest value.
The study finds that adding four-hour-duration batteries sized to 50% of the capacity of a solar or wind project raises the value by $3–$22/MWh depending on the year and region, with an average value of $10/MWh. The highest boost was found in California ($15/MWh), where the value of adding storage to solar rises in tandem with increased solar penetration.
The study said an even higher value comes from siting the same batteries separately, in a nearby high-value location.
It said this strategy results in higher value than co-located projects in nearly all markets and years. Values ranged from $2–$50/MWh, with an average value boost of $12.50/MWh. The highest values were found in constrained regions, like New York’s Long Island. Lower values occurred in Texas in certain years of the study period.
The report said that the “value penalty” of co-located projects can be reduced through a number of strategies, including recharging batteries from the grid during low-price hours, or sizing the interconnection capacity so both the generator and the battery can deliver power to the grid at the same time.
Separating generation from storage usually delivers higher value, but it may also lead to higher costs, the report said. That’s because a project developer will need multiple sites and grid interconnections, and may lose construction cost savings. A rough estimate found about $15/MWh in cost savings could be realized from using a single location.
The report said that a big part of the savings stems from the federal tax credit for renewable energy production that can also be applied to batteries, so long as the batteries are directly charged by the renewable generator. The tax credit, worth as much as $10/MWh, can tip the scale toward co-location, making coupled projects more attractive to a developer than separate locations.
The report said that at the end of 2020, 34% of solar and 6% of wind capacity were being developed in the U.S. with co-located batteries. In the West, 70%–90% of proposed solar is paired with storage, including almost all grid-scale solar projects in California. Almost two-thirds of all grid-connected batteries in California are part of hybrid solar + storage systems, rather than in potentially higher-value locations. In other regions, the share is typically less than 40%.
