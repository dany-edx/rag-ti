The plant has been commissioned for The West Bengal Power Development Corp. Ltd (WBPDCL). It is built upon a raw water pond (number 3) at the Sagardighi Thermal Power Project owned by WBPDCL in the Murshidabad district.
French floating PV specialist Ciel & Terre completed the plant engineering, float supply, anchoring and mooring, and supervision of the 5.4 MWp floating solar plant.
The plant uses a solar array consisting of 16,880 number of 320Wp BHEL-make PV modules over an area of 10.22 hectares. Hydrelio Equato floats, locally manufactured under ‘Make in India’ campaign, are used to support the panels.
“This plant will supply competitively priced electricity to around 1,000 homes and avoid more than 5838 tons of CO2 emissions. With the 5.4MWp plant, WBPDCL can save over 48 million liters of water from evaportaion, which can be used during the cooling water requirement in summers,” stated Deepak Ushadevi, managing director of Ciel & Terre.
Following the successful commissioning of the 5.4 MWp floating solar plant, WBPDCL has issued tenders for two floating solar projects, 10 MW at Sagardighi thermal power plant and 5 MW at Singareni thermal power plant.
Ciel & Terre commissioned its first pilot 452 KWp project at CIAL Cochin in 2019, followed by installation of a 14.7 MWp floating solar project in May 2021. Currently, it is executing a mega floating project of the size of 75 MWp in South India, with Hydrelio floats produced at Kerala factory. This year, the company also launched a global R&D center in Bangalore for innovative engineering and new product development activities.

Depositing the various layers that make up a PV cell stack onto a silicon wafer is among the most complex and expensive areas in PV cell & module manufacturing. The processes used here often require the creation of a vacuum, the use of flammable or otherwise hazardous precursor materials, high processing temperatures and other challenges.
A group of scientists led by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, in collaboration with the Technical University of Ilmenau in Germany had these factors in mind when it looked at the deposition of silicon dioxide (SiO2), which can be used as a passivation layer or a protective layer in various types of silicon PV cells. The group notes that plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is the most common process used with this material, but requires both high temperatures and a vacuum.
The group looked into alternative processes including spray pyrolysis, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), sol-gel deposition, and atomic layer deposition, eventually settling on atmospheric pressure deposition (APCVD) as the best option for further investigation. “APCVD holds the advantage of using gases as reactant precursors in contrast to liquids,” the group explains. “Consequently, crack-free dense films with good step coverage can readily be obtained.”
Using APCVD, the group was able to demonstrate a low-temperature SiO2 deposition process that also eliminated the use of highly flammable hydrosilane as a precursor material. And since the equipment does not have to withstand very high temperatures, the entire setup could be made of low-cost thermoplastic material produced using 3D printing, making it easily adaptable to different wafer shapes and sizes.
The group investigated two different applications for the setup in solar cell manufacturing. First, single side texturing – wafers were coated on one side with around 180 nanometers of SiO2, and then annealed at 180 degrees Celsius. Secondly, the process used to deposit a protective layer to prevent parasitic plating of metals when laying down the cell fingers and busbars.
In the first application, the wafer was then treated with an alkaline texturing solution, which etched about 100 nm of the SiO2 layer and left a smooth, uniform surface. And in the second application, the SiO2 layer was shown to effectively protect against unwanted metal deposition. “The SiO2 coated areas of the cells were practically free of unwanted metal deposition,” the scientists stated. “Whereas there was massive parasitic plating in the uncoated areas.”
Cell efficiencies were measured between 19.3% and 19.8% – below what has already been achieved in PERC cell production. However, the group notes that its focus was on measuring the performance and reliability of the coating processes, meaning there was less overall focus on the cell efficiency. Full details of the work are found in the paper Application of hydrosilane-free atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition of SiOx films in the manufacture of crystalline silicon solar cells, published in Thin Solid Films.
“The newly developed APCVD setup provides a simple and tailorable approach for the deposition of SiO2 films on virtually every substrate material at room temperature,” the group concludes. “Because of the used non-flammable and inexpensive gases, the costs of the deposition equipment and of the operations are low. The presented simple APCVD SiO2 process can find several applications in photovoltaics.”
And work is ongoing to bring the process to an industrial scale, as part of a collaboration with Hannover-based coatings company Alethia, which is currently set to run until May 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/10/electricity-derivatives-will-offer-power-offtake-certainty-for-renewable-investors/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 10, 2021",Electricity derivatives will offer power offtake certainty for renewable investors,"The introduction of derivatives to India’s short-term power market will make it easier for renewable project developers to enter into offtake arrangements with the state-owned distribution companies (discoms), according to a new briefing note from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“The launch of new financial instruments will enable developers to hedge their offtaker risk without requiring the signing of long-term contracts with discoms for the financial closure of projects,” said author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist, Lead India at IEEFA.
Long-term (usually 25-year) power purchase agreements (PPAs) between power producers and discoms comprise 88% of electricity transactions in India. PPAs provide investors with the certainty of power offtake over a long duration and de-risk them from price volatility. 
However, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) currently has 15-16 GW of auctioned capacity waiting to be signed by discoms. This backlog of unsigned PPAs is now impacting the development of new renewable energy projects.
Discoms are struggling with huge financial losses and have become increasingly reluctant to enter long-term PPAs with renewable energy developers as renewable tariffs hit a record low; solar tariffs in India dip to a new record low of INR 1.99/kWh at the end of 2020. 
The electricity derivatives market in India is likely to take shape in 2021. Under the proposed structure, the physical delivery of electricity will be separated from the financial settlement. 
Garg sees the sale of power in the futures market as a positive step that will help hedge the offtaker risk and provide flexibility and certainty of supply to both discoms and developers. This would also help develop the price signal needed to incentivize supply into peak demand periods, which is the key to enabling battery deployments and demand response management. 
“Discoms with their power optimization tools can also participate in derivatives markets and hedge their risk. This will help discoms to lower their power purchasing costs and prevent them from being saddled with the inflexibility of long-term PPAs as electricity demand profiles change. Discoms will have the flexibility to buy power based on demand,” she added.
Under the proposed structure, long-term contracts in the physical (spot) market will be traded on power exchanges under the jurisdiction of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), while in the financial (derivatives) market contracts are set to be traded on commodity exchanges regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
The physical and financial electricity markets will complement each other, according to Garg.
“A spot market at power exchanges and the derivatives market will feed into each other. It will be a virtuous cycle in which the derivatives market will establish forward prices, more participants will shift from PPAs to exchanges, increasing liquidity in derivatives and subsequently increasing liquidity in the spot market at power exchanges and vice versa.”
Financial products such as futures, options, and swaps don’t require physical delivery of electricity, so this opens up the market to hedgers, speculators, and other participants who can add liquidity without owning electricity assets.
“The financial market will increase trade volumes and will be lucrative for players including developers, discoms, open access buyers, traders, investors in the power sector and others who also have the ability to take on risk. It will also enable the sale of hybrid products. With an increasing share of renewable energy in the total generation mix, multiple products including wind, solar, and biogas, along with battery storage, are likely to see more demand,” said Garg.
The rollout of the financial market follows the launch last year of the Real-Time Market and the Green Term-Ahead Market.
