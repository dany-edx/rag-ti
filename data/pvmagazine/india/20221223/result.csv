(NGHC) announced this week the appointment of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as the sub-EPC contractor for its massive green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia. Under the terms of the contract, L&T will execute power grid and power generation works for the plant on an EPC basis.
NGHC’s primary EPC contractor and system integrator Air Products (a joint venture partner) signed the agreement with L&T. 
Located in NEOM, NGHC’s mega-plant will integrate up to 4 GW of solar and wind energy to produce up to 600 tons per day of carbon-free hydrogen in the form of green ammonia as a cost-effective solution for transportation globally. Green ammonia output is expected up to 1.2 million tonnes. 
Air Products will be the exclusive off-taker of the project. It intends to transport the generated green ammonia around the world to be dissociated to produce green hydrogen for the transportation market.
The plant at NEOM is scheduled for commissioning by 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/23/longi-claims-worlds-highest-efficiency-for-p-type-indium-free-hjt-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"DECEMBER 23, 2022","Longi claims world’s highest efficiency for p-type, indium-free HJT solar cells","From pv magazine International
Longi has revealed that it has achieved power conversion efficiencies in mass production of 26.56% for a gallium-doped p-type HJT solar cell and 26.09% for an indium-free HJT cell, both based on M6 full-size monocrystalline silicon wafers. The results have been confirmed by ISFH.
“Addressing the long-term pain point of HJT cells, Longi’s R&D team focused on market demand and technological innovation to achieve the new conversion efficiency for its commercial gallium-doped silicon wafer, 0.44% higher than the 26.12% announced in September this year,” the company said in a statement.
The Chinese PV module maker announced a power conversion efficiency of 26.12% for the same solar cell in September, and an efficiency rating of 25.47% in March.
For the indium-free HJT cells, the team replaced traditional indium-based transparent conductive film with alternative materials. It claims the different materials are cheaper and more environmentally friendly.
“The development also offers a potential solution to the industry’s dependence on indium for large-scale mass production, signaling a way forward for HJT to move towards terawatt scale production levels,” said Longi.
In November, Longi claimed a record-breaking 26.81% efficiency rating for an unspecified HJT solar cell. In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for a p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it reported a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.
