https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/17/sterlite-power-wins-green-energy-transmission-project-in-rajasthan/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 17, 2023",Sterlite Power wins green energy transmission project in Rajasthan,"Sterlite Power, a private-sector power transmission company in India and Brazil, has been awarded a transmission project for the evacuation of power from renewable energy zones in Rajasthan. It won the project through the tariff-based competitive bidding process and received the Letter of Intent from PFC Consulting (a wholly owned subsidiary of Power Finance Corporation).
The company’s scope includes building the project on a build-own-operate-transfer basis for a period of 35 years. 
The entire transmission system forms a critical part of the roadmap released by the Ministry of Power in 2022 for the integration of over 500 GW RE Capacity into the national grid by 2030. The project will involve the construction of a 350 km, 765 kV transmission corridor from Fatehgarh III to Beawar in Rajasthan. It will enable the evacuation of a part of 20 GW of renewable power from renewable energy zones in Fatehgarh (9.1 GW), Bhadla (8 GW), and Ramgarh (2.9 GW) areas of the state.
This is the second green energy project for the company and its first in the state of Rajasthan. 
Sterlite Power commissioned its first green energy project (The lakadia-Vadodara power transmission project) in Gujarat. “Since its commissioning, the 300 km long project is playing a vital role in supplying 5,000MW of reliable and green power from the renewable energy-rich state of Gujarat to the Indian national grid. It is also one of the largest transmission corridors built in India to date,” stated Sterlite Power.
Sterlite Power has a robust portfolio of 30 completed, sold, and under-construction projects covering around 14,602 circuit km of transmission lines across India and Brazil.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/17/relaxation-of-almm-order-a-near-term-positive-for-solar-power-developers-says-icra/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 17, 2023","Relaxation of ALMM order a near-term positive for solar power developers, says ICRA","The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), vide its order dated March 10, 2023, has exempted solar projects to be commissioned till March 31, 2024, from the requirement to source modules from the Approved Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) list. It took the step given the challenges faced by solar power developers in sourcing modules from domestic manufacturers. 
The MNRE move is a near-term positive for the developers and provides them the flexibility to source modules at the most cost-competitive rates, say ICRA analysts. 
The cost of imported modules, even after considering the impact of basic customs duty (BCD), remains competitive compared to modules sourced from domestic manufacturers using imported solar PV cells. This is following the sharper decline in module prices over the past six months compared to the decline seen in solar PV cell prices, according to ICRA analysts.
The prices of the mono PERC modules witnessed a moderation over the past five to six months, reducing from the peak level of 27-28 cents per watt to about 23-24 cents per watt in December 2022 and further to 22 cents/watt in March 2023, says ICRA quoting the data from Infolink. Cell prices declined to 12.0-12.5 cents/watt in December 2022 from 16 cents/watt in September 2022, but increased to 14 cents/watt in March 2023.
For the domestic manufacturers to be competitive, the cell prices must remain below 12 cents/watt, assuming the prevailing module prices sustain without any further decline, say ICRA analysts.
The domestic module manufacturing capacity has seen a significant jump over the last two years; the module manufacturing capacity approved under the ALMM increased to 22.4 GW as of February 2023 from 11.5 GW in March 2022, comprising only domestic manufacturers. While this augurs well for the solar power sector, the lack of backward integration and limited capacity for cell manufacturing keeps the module manufacturers dependent on imports for sourcing solar PV cells. Also, the jump in module exports, given the higher realizations, has impeded the availability of modules in the domestic market.
ICRA analysts say the abeyance of ALMM requirement could adversely impact the order inflow for domestic manufacturers in the near term but the healthy demand from export markets is likely to partially offset this impact. The module exports witnessed a sharp increase in 10M FY2023 supported by increased demand from the US amid the restrictions imposed on module sourcing from China as well as the ramp-up in the domestic manufacturing capacities.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/17/the-case-for-using-gas-based-plants-to-serve-peak-power-demand/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 17, 2023",The case for using gas-based plants to serve peak power demand,"Allocating India’s additional domestic gas supply to the power sector would enable some existing stranded and underutilized gas-based plants to serve as the flexible generation, providing an interim solution to firm variable renewable energy while battery storage scales up and becomes cost-competitive—according to a new report by the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). 
“Energy storage will be critical to managing higher levels of renewable generation,” says report author Purva Jain, Energy Analyst and Guest Contributor at IEEFA. “To tide over the period until storage options become more widely available and affordable in India, some existing gas-based power plants could serve the peak demand or provide grid-balancing ancillary services.”
“However, any transitional use of gas should be limited to sectors with no competitive alternatives or where gas use supports renewable energy uptake or helps maintain grid flexibility,” Jain adds.
India’s 24.9 GW of gas-based power plants are either stranded or operating at sub-optimal levels due to the shortage of affordable fuel. Of these, 31 gas-based power plants – totaling 14.3 GW capacity – are completely stranded, locking INR 500 billion ($6.3 billion) in bank funding. 
Operating 12.5 GW of existing gas capacity as peaking plants, complemented by 20 GW of four-hour battery storage systems, could help India meet the maximum peak demand anticipated in the financial year (FY) 2029-30, according to the report. 
With an additional 30 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meters Per Day (MMSCMD) of domestic gas supply expected in 2023, the report says the government should consider revising its gas allocation policy to supply the fuel to some of the underutilized and stranded power plants. 
The report recommends the government adapts a scheme it had proposed in 2019, which sought to bundle gas-based power produced using imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) with solar power. Given the soaring LNG costs and that global gas prices will likely remain high for the next few years, domestic gas would be a far more cost-effective way than LNG to meet peak demand.                                                                           
“Blending domestic gas-fuelled electricity and solar power would result in an average tariff below INR 5/kilowatt-hour (kWh) rather than buying at INR 12/kWh, as capped in the spot market for now. This would considerably increase power supply reliability, and the country will not have to go into bouts of load shedding witnessed in the summer months of April-July 2022,” says Jain. 
The report says the government’s plans to set up a separate higher price market for gas-based power plants and battery storage could be useful for serving peak demand and maintaining grid stability – but only until gas and battery prices soften. The move allows higher tariffs than the current spot market ceiling rate, as the costs for both gas-based plants and battery storage are currently high. 
“This will incentivize developers and investors to utilize existing gas-based plants and deploy more storage technologies,” says Jain.
The report also recommends that the government expedite efforts to utilize green hydrogen for fertilizer production instead of grey hydrogen from natural gas. Instead, the government could allocate the required domestic gas to the power sector under a “no cut” category.
