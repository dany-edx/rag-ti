The 160kW solar rooftop at Club Bellezea (the clubhouse in the gated community) is powered by 320 numbers of Trina 500 Wp solar modules coupled with 320 Enphase IQ7A micro-inverters. It has generated 24.43 MWh of solar power from September 11 to November 9, 2021, saving INR1,95,440 on electricity costs. Subsequently, Nambiar Bellezea is expected to save approximately INR11,72,640 per annum and INR2,93,16,000 over 25 years on electricity to power the clubhouse. A representative from U-Solar shares that the clubhouse’s solar rooftop has also helped offset 19 tons of carbon emissions. 
The installation at the Nambiar Bellezea powers the entire 1,00,000 square feet clubhouse, which includes several pools, including a 25-meter half-Olympic size pool and a temperature-controlled indoor pool, gym, hall for yoga and Zumba, 24 fully furnished suites, banquet hall, indoor badminton courts, squash courts, convenience store, salon, ATM, and a launderette. The under-construction restaurant, bar, and spa too, when completed, will be powered by the installed solar rooftop system.
Enphase IQ 7’s burst technology lets micro-inverters produce more at dawn, dusk, and in low-light conditions for a longer solar day. IQ micro-inverters also include built-in rapid shutdown so that, in the event of an emergency, solar power can be turned off instantly and easily, keeping utility workers and first responders safe.
Commenting on the solar installation, Sanjeev Jha, Head of Operations at U-Solar, said, “For installers, Enphase IQ micro-inverters are a smart option. These are plug-and-play, easy to install, and offer the best inverter technology that ensures maximum power generation from our panels. And for residential properties, IQ micro-inverters are also inherently safer because they operate at the same low-voltage AC power as the home.”
The clubhouse managers and villa homeowners can track solar energy production and monitor the solar system’s health using the Enphase’s solar monitoring mobile app, MyEnlighten.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/11/icra-monitored-solar-plfs-remained-stable-in-fy2021/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",ICRA-monitored solar PLFs remained stable in FY2021,"Ratings agency ICRA today said the power generation performance of its monitored solar portfolio of 3.3 GW remained stable in FY 2020-21. About 52% of the sample capacity performed better than the estimated plant load factor (PLF) during the year, continuing the trend of the previous two years. 
In comparison, the power generation performance of the ICRA-monitored wind power portfolio of 3.2 GW was adversely hit during FY2021 primarily because of lower wind speeds. Only 11% of the capacities exceeded their respective estimates compared to 34% and 48% in FY2020 and FY2019, respectively. 
ICRA cited grid curtailments in some states and operating issues with certain OEMs among the other reasons for the underperformance of some of the wind plants. Nonetheless, the performance of the majority of ICRA-monitored wind power producers improved in H1 FY2022 on a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis, which is expected to lead to improved wind PLFs in FY2022 over FY2021, it stated. 
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president & co-group head – Corporate ratings, ICRA, said, “The PLF variability risk is relatively lower for solar power projects than wind projects as observed from the generation data for ICRA-monitored portfolio over the past few years. Moreover, the wind power projects are exposed to seasonality in generation with the majority of the generation reported during the high wind season from May to September.”
“In the context of grid curtailments, which has been also one of the factors for under-performance of wind assets in state of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the recent rules notified in October 2021 by the Ministry of Power on implementation of ‘must run’ status for wind and solar power plants as well as the order issued by Appellate Tribunal of Electricity (ATE) in August 2021 against grid curtailments in Tamil Nadu remain positive for the sector and are likely to act as a deterrent against grid curtailment by state distribution utilities.”
The median PLF in the key wind power generating states of AP, Gujarat, and Maharashtra dropped by 15-20% in FY2021 on a Y-o-Y basis. The drop for the wind assets in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh was relatively lower. On the other hand, the median PLF for wind assets in Rajasthan and TN remained flat.
The solar power portfolio is more widely spread across various states against the wind capacity that is concentrated in six to seven high potential states. The median PLFs in the key solar power generating states remained largely stable varying between 17% and 20% across states, depending on the location and DC-AC ratio.
Vikram V, Vice President & Sector Head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA, added, “The credit metrics for a wind power project remain highly sensitive to its PLF level. For a typical wind power project, a 100-bps reduction in PLF level would impact the debt service coverage ratio of the project by 4-5 bps. Considering a 15-20% reduction in generation as observed in a few key wind states in FY2021, the DSCR would get impacted by 25-30 bps. Nonetheless, the credit profile of ICRA-rated wind IPPs remained largely stable in FY2021 led by reasonable buffer in cash flows for most IPPs, funding support from the parent for assets having a stronger parent, and available liquidity cushion.”

The announcement was made by John Kerry, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, at the UNFCCC COP26. With this, the USA has become the 101st country to sign the ISA framework agreement to catalyze global energy transition through a solar-led approach.  
The ISA is an inter-governmental treaty-based international organization with a mandate to catalyze global solar growth by helping to reduce the cost of financing and technology for solar. It aims to mobilize more than $1 trillion of solar power investment by 2030 to address the issues of energy access, energy transition, and energy security in emerging markets and developing economies.
Signing the ISA framework agreement, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, said, “It has long been coming, and we are happy to join the International Solar Alliance, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the lead in making. We worked out the details and this is a process we are pleased to be a part of. This will be an important contribution to the more rapid deployment of solar globally. It will be particularly important for developing countries.”
India’s union cabinet minister for environment, forest & climate change, Bhupender Yadav welcomed the United States of America as the 101st member of the ISA, saying the addition will strengthen the ISA and propel future action on providing a clean source of energy to the world.  
Ajay Mathur, Director General, the ISA said, “The US’ endorsement of ISA’s framework and approach is a heartening development, especially as our 101st member nation, which is a significant milestone in itself, demonstrating that nations across the world are recognizing the economic and climate mitigating value of solar, as well as this energy source’s potential as a catalyst for the global energy transition. We are now even more committed to translating this confidence into tangible projects and developments on the ground, accelerating the momentum of solar adoption that has been built so far. We hope remaining nations and economies will follow suit, and align with us to achieve swift, affordable, and effective climate action, while also achieving their respective economic growth and long-term development priorities.”
The framework, first circulated for countries’ support in 2016, emphasizes delivering global relevance and local benefit to all countries through collaborations. ISA’s key interventions focus on readiness and enabling activities, risk mitigation, and innovative financing instruments to facilitate the promotion and deployment of solar technologies in target markets. 
The framework has already delivered results, with ISA building a solar project pipeline of nearly 5 GW installed capacity. It envisions a transnational network of solar power grids. This project, known as the ‘Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid’ (GGI-OSOWOG), was launched recently by the UK Presidency of COP26 and India Presidency of the ISA. 
The GGI-OSOWOG initiative aims to harness solar energy wherever the sun is shining, ensuring that generated electricity flows to areas that need it most.
The United States has joined the Steering Committee of the GGI-OSOWOG, which also includes Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and India as member countries. 
The ISA was launched by India’s prime minister Narendra Modi and former president of France Francois Hollande on November 30, 2015, at the 21st session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP-21).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/11/how-pv-performs-close-to-radio-tv-antennas/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021","How PV performs close to radio, TV antennas","From pv magazine International
An international research team led by Centre Universitaire Polytechnique de Kaya (CUP-K) in Kenya has studied the extent to which the performance of a PV system can be affected by the presence of nearby electromagnetic emission sources such as telecoms base stations or TV/radio antennas.
The researchers noted that base transceiver stations (BTS) are being built for 4G and 5G broadband cellular networks. And they said that off-grid PV systems are more frequently being used to provide the energy needed by these stations in isolated areas with no connection to power networks.
The scientists considered, through 3D modeling, an electromagnetic field with an energy of less than 12 eV, and a frequency ranging up to 3.10 Hz. Its field orientation was perpendicular to the junction of the solar cells. An isotropic antenna radiating power in free space was the emitting source.
The researchers said the presence of the magnetic field initially causes an increase in the PV system’s electric voltage and then makes the current produced by the solar panels decompose into two components.
“One is transferred to the external load, named the transferred current, and the other is lost in the pn junction,” they explained. “The magnetic field strength is weak, but it cannot be neglected and be deleted in the electromagnetic field produced by the BTS as assumed in some studies.”
Their analysis also showed that the variation of the electromagnetic field depends on the distance between the source and the PV system.
“In the presence of an electromagnetic field, an important current in the open circuit is created which can reach the short circuit situation current when the distance source-PV cell is weak,” the research team said, adding that the electromagnetic field is strong enough to cause an accumulation of the carrier’s charge at the junction by deflection. “That accumulation of the carrier’s charge will have an increase of the voltage as a consequence. Thus, the electric field is the main cause of the presence of the current in an open circuit situation.”
The academics said that the reported increase in the conduction current does not result in an improvement of the PV system efficiency. In turn, it causes an increase in the lost photocurrent density.
“The conduction current provides an increase of the current and contributes to the increase of the quantity of the extracted photocurrent of the solar cell,” they said. “The heating of the junction causes the quality degradation of the PV cell mainly due to the electric component.”
They said one should not install a solar power generator near an electromagnetic field emission source. They revealed their findings in “Polycrystalline Silicon PV Cell Efficiency in 3D Approximation versus Electromagnetic Field under Monochromatic Illumination,” which was recently published in International Journal of Photoenergy.
