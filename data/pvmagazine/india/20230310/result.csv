The hybrid project is located in Karnataka with the capacity bifurcation of 170 MW solar and 340 MW wind power. It is scheduled for commissioning within 24 months from the PPA execution date. 
Tata Power-DDL is a joint venture between Tata Power and the state government of Delhi that supplies electricity to a populace of over 7 million in North Delhi. 
TPREL won this project at INR 3 ($0.037)/kWh through a competitive bidding process, followed by a letter of award (LOA) by Tata Power-DDL. This win is an extension of the earlier LOA for 255 MW received in Dec. 2022.
With this win, TPREL’s total renewables capacity has reached 6,303 MW with an installed capacity of 3,909 MW (2,981 MW solar and 928 MW wind) and 2,394 MW under various stages of implementation.

The project is located in the Gudadur village and consists of 48 MW of solar and 128 MW of wind capacity. It is expected to achieve commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2023.
“Once completed, the Gudadur hybrid project will generate enough clean energy to satisfy the electricity requirements of over 500,000 households yearly or the equivalent of reducing around 73,688 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions compared to thermal generation,” stated Vena Energy.
The Gudadur Hybrid Project is Vena Energy’s first hybrid renewable energy project in India. It is also Vena Energy’s first green project financing arrangement in India, supported by five mandated lead arrangers, including the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd (HSBC), BNP Paribas Bank, Mizuho Bank Ltd (Mizuho), Sumitomo Mitsui Bank Corp. (SMBC), and Axis Bank Ltd. BNP Paribas, Mizuho, and SMBC acted as green loan coordinators, HSBC as the account and modeling bank, and Axis Bank as the lenders’ agent.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/10/thermax-enters-green-hydrogen-market-in-partnership-with-australias-fortescue-future-industries/,"ELECTROLYZER,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 10, 2023",Thermax enters green hydrogen market in partnership with Australia’s Fortescue Future Industries ,"Thermax Ltd, a Pune-based energy and environment solutions provider, announced it would explore green hydrogen projects, including new manufacturing facilities in India under a partnership with Australia’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI).
The two parties have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on this collaboration. 
Under the MoU, Thermax and FFI plan to explore opportunities to jointly develop fully integrated green hydrogen projects for commercial and industrial customers in India. The production of green hydrogen at an industrial scale would be a significant step forward in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries in India, such as refineries, fertilizers, and steel. They also plan to collaborate in developing new [electrolyzer and subsystem] manufacturing facilities to support green energy projects in India. 
“The Performance Linked Incentive (PLI scheme), under India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, could be leveraged for setting up any new manufacturing capacity,” stated Thermax.
These manufacturing facilities would cater to the domestic requirements for electrolysers and subsystems and could potentially be used for export internationally. 
Fortescue Metals Group’s experience in managing large-scale projects in its iron ore business provides FFI – Fortescue’s green energy arm – with a strong platform to expand into manufacturing projects in green hydrogen.
FFI is in the process of constructing a world-leading Green Energy Manufacturing Centre in Gladstone, Queensland. The first phase of the project involves the construction of an electrolyser manufacturing facility, with a targeted initial output capacity of 2 GW per annum.
Thermax will bring its vast experience in EPC and supply chain to the collaboration. 
Expressing his thoughts on the collaboration, Ashish Bhandari, MD & CEO, Thermax, said, “The collaboration with Fortescue Future Industries is perfectly timed to leverage the massive potential of the Indian green energy market that presents a multitude of opportunities, backed by favourable policies and incentives. Furthermore, the recent approval of the National Green Hydrogen Mission by India’s Union Cabinet, which aims to increase domestic production of green hydrogen to 5 MMT per annum by 2030 and reduce fossil fuel imports by over Rs. 1 lakh crore, is a significant boost. With all these factors working in our favour, we are confident that our association will be successful.”
FFI CEO Mark Hutchinson said, “FFI is on a mission to replace fossil fuels by producing green electrons from renewable energy and then converting these green electrons into green hydrogen. Through the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the Indian Government has shown that it is committed to developing its green hydrogen industry to help the country decarbonise. We are thrilled to be working with Thermax and believe that this MOU with a company of such high standing will help us in our mission to eliminate emissions.” 
About Thermax Limited: Incorporated in 1966, Thermax Group, headquartered in Pune, India, is a leading conglomerate in the energy and environment space. It offers integrated solutions in heating, cooling, power generation, water treatment and recycling, air pollution control, and chemicals with a focus on ensuring clean air, clean energy, and clean water.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/10/pv-product-prices-resume-downward-trend-says-trendforce/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 10, 2023","PV product prices resume downward trend, says TrendForce","From pv magazine Global
TrendForce said it expects prices of polysilicon, solar cells, and modules to drop slightly on the month in February, when Chinese manufacturers unexpectedly raised prices across the entire supply chain.
“Polysilicon prices began to plummet in December last year, so the major polysilicon suppliers started to limit market supply,” the analysts said, noting that the price decrease was related to a strong increase in polysilicon capacity across the Chinese industry. “Subsequently, polysilicon prices in China started to rally before the Lunar New Year holiday this January, rising rapidly to the current range of CNY 220 ($31.55) to CNY 240 per kg.”
They said they believe that the average price of polysilicon will fall by 3.2% from CNY 222/kg in February to CNY 215/kg in March. Wafer prices, meanwhile, will likely drop by 4.3%, from CNY 6.22 per piece to CNY 5.95 for M10 products and from CNY 8.2 to CNY 8 for G12 products.
Average prices for solar cells should decline 3.6% from CNY 1.12 per watt to CNY 1.08 for both M10 and G12 products. The price of M10 and G12 monocrystalline panels, meanwhile, should fall from CNY 1.77 per W in February to CNY 1.74 in March.
“Wafer suppliers significantly raised their capacity utilization rates because polysilicon supply was expanding again. Therefore, wafer prices will not be able to maintain their upward momentum as supply becomes more plentiful,” TrendForce said. “The temporary tightening of wafer supply also put pressure on cell supply. Nevertheless, there was already widespread anticipation for this round of hikes, so cell buyers mostly accepted higher prices.”
The analysts said module prices will align with the usual range following a drop in prices of materials and components.
“Falling module prices will effectively spur installation demand, and the peak season for installations is expected to arrive earlier compared with the preceding years,” they explained, warning that the Chinese PV industry could face sharp price fluctuations over the short term. “Therefore, module suppliers are mostly optimistic about the market situation from this March onward.”
“In sum, there is still a considerable degree of uncertainty in the development of the global PV market this year,” they concluded.
