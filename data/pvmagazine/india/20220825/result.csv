The company recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government of Rajasthan on the proposed investment.
Ravi Verma, senior executive vice president, strategic affairs & policy advocacy, Avaada Group, told pv magazine that Avaada would set up around 6 GW of renewable energy capacity for captive consumption by its green hydrogen and ammonia site. The renewables capacity will come up at different locations in Rajasthan. 
The green ammonia plant will have a production capacity of 1 million tons per annum. It is planned to be located in the Kota district. 
Avaada expects its green ammonia investment in Rajasthan to provide direct employment opportunities to about 3,500 people and indirect jobs to over 10,500 people.
Avaada Group is an integrated energy platform with business interests ranging from manufacturing solar cells, modules, and electrolyzers to renewable power generation, green hydrogen, and green ammonia production.
Avaada has developed an impressive portfolio within five years, and the firm plans to reach 11 GW by 2025 and 30 GW by 2030. It has a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility with an annual capacity of 5 GW for cells and modules. The capacities are expected to start commercial production by early next year. Avaada Group plans to scale its PV manufacturing to 10 GW by 2030, with backward integration into polysilicon, ingots, and wafers.

And some of these reforms can potentially help electricity distribution companies (DISCOMS) save billions of dollars, finds a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“India added a record 15 GW of renewable energy capacity in the fiscal year 2021-22. This rate of clean energy installation will need to accelerate further for the country to meet its climate targets. Managing large amounts of variable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind on the grid requires new technical and financial solutions,” says the report’s author Kashish Shah, Research Analyst, IEEFA.
The report reviews the current electricity market design and structure for the scheduling and dispatch of power. It says electricity market design must evolve to address new challenges for the grid as renewable generation capacity rises. 
The report recommends that policymakers accelerate several pilot programs aiming to reform power scheduling and dispatch, potentially saving billions of dollars for DISCOMs.
Currently, 90% of the electricity traded in India is through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). However, the two-part tariff structure of thermal power PPAs has locked DISCOMs into long-term capacity payments. Combining this with self-scheduling of power dispatch at a regional level by the DISCOMs restricts sharing of generation resources at a country level. This results in a sub-optimal outcome as expensive power plants are utilized more, resulting in higher power procurement costs for DISCOMs.
The report notes that policymakers are trying to address this issue through various models of power dispatch. A Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) pilot pooled 58.1 GW of inter-regional thermal power stations and saved INR 20.7 billion ($260 million) between April 2019 and February 2022.
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has also proposed a Market-based Economic Dispatch (MBED) mechanism to pool all the generation resources, potentially reducing power procurement costs by INR 120 billion ($1.6 billion) annually.
“There has been no update on the proposed pilot of the MBED mechanism. If the CERC has not yet staged the pilot, it should do so at the earliest as it would significantly improve cost and resource efficiency,” says Shah.
The report also recommends that policymakers increase the share of open market platforms in the electricity market, which would help the renewable energy sector.
“The introduction of competitive day-ahead and term-ahead markets to trade clean power on open market platforms has been quite successful. There are three different power exchanges – Indian Energy Exchange, Power Exchange India and Hindustan Power Exchange – that facilitate the trading of green power. In our view, a larger shift to open markets will allow competition and add dynamicity to electricity trading,” says Shah. 
“More importantly, they provide a time-of-day price signal for energy storage technology solutions, such as utility-scale batteries and pumped hydro storage, as well as demand-side management.”
To maintain grid stability, system operators in India still procure ancillary services from the un-requisitioned surplus capacity of coal-fired power plants.
“We believe battery energy storage and pumped hydro storage technologies are better suited to providing ancillary services than coal-fired power plants as they have significantly shorter response times and higher ramp-up and ramp-down rates,” says Shah. 
“The CERC’s new regulation for Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) paves the way for a competitive and modern mechanism. India should move to the new mechanism sooner rather than later.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/25/solar-power-plants-with-smart-batteries-its-just-a-matter-of-time/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"AUGUST 25, 2022",Solar power plants with smart batteries: It’s just a matter of time,"From pv magazine Global
At present, solar power plants are dominating the market, with the electricity they generate being used directly by households and the excess energy diverted to the electricity grid. However, due to these solar power plants, electricity grids are becoming increasingly overloaded.
According to the CEO of Energy Networks Australia, Andrew Dillon, “If too much energy is fed back into the grid in the middle of the day, it could cause frequency and voltage disturbances in the system, which could lead to transformers tripping off to protect themselves from being damaged, thereby causing localised blackouts.”
Therefore, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, among other countries, have plans in place to prevent people from transferring excess energy to the electricity grid. It is predicted that other countries will follow suit. As a consequence, those who operate solar power plants are, and will increasing be, wondering what to do with the solar electricity that is produced.
A smart battery is a solution that will help direct the electricity generated by a solar power plant during the day into the battery, to use it in the evening. This concept makes it possible to protect the electricity grid and to expand the use of solar power plants even more quickly.
Smart batteries are currently available on the market in capacities ranging from 1.2kWh to 13.5kWh. It is estimated that they can operate successfully for up to 10 years.
After years of testing, Inion Software has developed different battery management algorithms for a team of scientists, which allow for wider and more efficient use of batteries. In our view, a battery should not only be able to store electricity, but also buy it from the grid or sell it.
The algorithms developed accurately predict the behavior of human electricity consumption, as well as the load of the electricity grid, price of electricity, work of a solar power plant, and the lifetime of a battery. With all the information available to the battery, the best outcome is that the customer will pay less for electricity. Here are five battery management scenarios that the algorithms deal with:
Examples of different scenarios:
The different scenarios described above allow for a wider application of the batteries. This not only makes it possible to further expand the construction of solar power plants, and thus protect the electricity grid, but also to ensure people and businesses are paying even less for electricity. Our tests have shown that a smart battery can reduce electricity prices by up to 25%.
If a battery permits the charging and discharging of energy, it is possible to make practically any battery smart. The most important thing is the algorithm that controls the battery.
