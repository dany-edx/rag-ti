https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/23/ih2a-proposes-5-billion-hydrogen-transition-fund/,"FINANCE,GREEN HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 23, 2024",IH2A proposes $5 billion hydrogen transition fund,"The India Hydrogen Alliance (IH2A) has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, to increase the budgetary support for the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) and create a $5 billion National Hydrogen Transition and Development Fund.
The $5 billion National Hydrogen Transition and Development Fund, similar to the EU Green Hydrogen Fund, should support large-scale hydrogen projects and H2 hub development, H2 supply chains beyond electrolyser manufacturing, sectoral hydrogen transition plans, skilling and hydrogen infrastructure development in the country, stated IH2A.
IH2A’s proposed National Hydrogen Transition Funding mechanism is akin to the EU Green Hydrogen Fund which supports green hydrogen projects of national importance and hydrogen hubs.
IH2A has recommended that the proposed National Hydrogen Transition and Development Fund should support co-development of at least five large National H2 Hubs (beyond the two Hubs planned in the existing NGHM), together with state government and project developers (both private and state-owned), and offer offtake-linked incentives for anchor industrial offtake entities and contracts-for-difference (CfD) funding.
The fund should also provide CAPEX support for greenfield hydrogen infrastructure such as H2 pipelines and storage facilities that will lower the cost of green hydrogen supply to offtake users.
State governments should be supported in developing domestic hydrogen equipment and supply chain equipment manufacturing clusters, for balance-of-plant equipment (beyond electrolyzers)
The fund should also support a sectoral hydrogen transition plan with CAPEX incentives and offtake incentives, in Steel and Chemicals, in line with the SIGHT Mode 2 guidelines for fertilizer and refinery sectors.
Additionally, the fund should support the creation of a National Hydrogen Transition Skilling programme to create more hydrogen engineering design and engineering services professionals, working with engineering colleges and research institutions
“The Government of India has taken the first step towards demand aggregation and offtake incentives in fertilizer and refinery sectors, with the Mode 2A and 2B Guidelines under the NGHM SIGHT Scheme. The time is right to raise public funding to match the needs of a large economy that has high ambitions for accelerating the hydrogen transition. A $5 billion India Hydrogen Transition Fund would put India at par with the EU, from public funding perspective, which is still short of India’s real requirement as the entire value chain needs to be developed in the country,” said Jillian Evanko, president and CEO, Chart Industries, and founding member of IH2A.
“India needs more hydrogen hubs, accelerated sectoral decarbonization in steel and chemicals, hydrogen infrastructure and domestic equipment manufacturing and specialized skill development. These should be five key priorities for developing the hydrogen economy in India in 2024. We look forward to working with all stakeholders to making this a reality.”
On funding the National Hydrogen Transition and Development Fund, Amrit Singh Deo, Secretariat Lead,IH2A, said, “A $5 billion hydrogen transition fund can be put together by pooling multilateral funding and government energy transition sources, such as allocating proportion from the energy transition constituted by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, and tapping sovereign green bonds.”
Last year, IH2A submitted a plan to develop five $5 billion green hydrogen hubs as economically viable projects. Subsequently, the IH2A Hydrogen Equipment Manufacturing, Exports and Services report estimated a $50 billion domestic manufacturing opportunity for India, over 2024-30 period, on the conservative side, being deployed over 135 domestic hydrogen projects, producing 1 MT green hydrogen production (a fifth of the 5 MMT national target as per the National Green Hydrogen Mission).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/23/prime-minister-narendra-modi-announces-scheme-to-install-rooftop-solar-in-10-million-houses/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 23, 2024",Prime Minister Narendra Modi announces scheme to install rooftop solar on 10 million houses,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced ‘Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana’ under which 10 million households will get rooftop solar. The scheme is intended to not only reduce the electricity bill of the poor and middle class but also make India self-reliant in the field of energy.
“Today, on the auspicious occasion of the consecration of life in Ayodhya, my resolve has been further strengthened that the people of India should have their own solar rooftop system on the roof of their houses. The first decision I have taken after returning from Ayodhya is that our government will launch “Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana” with the target of installing rooftop solar on one crore houses,” said Modi after returning from Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, where he addressed the gathering on the occasion of the consecration ceremony of the newly built Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir.
“This will not only reduce the electricity bill of the poor and middle class but will also make India self-reliant in the field of energy.”
Immediately after his visit to Ayodhya, the Prime Minister chaired a meeting to launch the Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana.

During the meeting, Prime Minister said that the power of the sun can be harnessed by every household with a roof to reduce their electricity bills and to make them truly aatmanirbhar [self-reliant] for their electricity needs.
Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana aims to provide electricity to low and middle-income individuals through solar rooftop installations while offering additional income for surplus electricity generation.
The Prime Minister also directed that a massive national campaign should be started to mobilize residential segment consumers to adopt rooftop solar in large numbers.
As per a recent CEEW study, Indian households can technically deploy more than 640 GW of rooftop solar.
Speaking about the residential rooftop solar potential in India, Neeraj Kuldeep, Senior Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), told pv magazine, “India, both rural and urban, has a massive potential when it comes to installing solar systems on our rooftops. As per a recent CEEW study, Indian households can technically deploy more than 640 GW of rooftop solar. Currently, about 700,000-800,000 households have installed rooftop solar systems and benefited from the government capital subsidy program, resulting in about 4 GW of solar capacity.
Hailing the government’s scheme to solarize 1 crore households, Kuldeep said the new scheme will give the necessary impetus to the rooftop solar sector to reach the tipping point. The 12-14-fold increase in solar-powered households will add 20-25 GW of solar capacity. This will not only help states save on electricity subsidy but also contribute to improving power discoms’ financial health, eventually paving the way for greater uptake of renewable energy in India. It needs the right awareness campaigns.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/23/the-rise-of-back-contact-cell-architecture/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"JANUARY 23, 2024",The rise of back contact cell architecture,"For a long time, solar cell efficiency gains have been the main means of improving module output power not only as an important performance attribute, but also as a sales metric.
Higher module efficiency reduces the balance of system (BOS) costs, thus reducing the overall final PV system costs. After commercializing various cell technologies, leading PV manufacturers now are once again moving back to putting most or all contact elements on the rear of the cell – but now using advanced cell architectures.
These new architectures don’t just boost the efficiency and power output of solar modules, they also result in system-level advantages ─ such as better low light response, temperature coefficient, and degradation rates ─ that increase the energy yield. Every technology advancement that boosts efficiency helps reduce the final levelized cost of electricity generation (LCOE), making solar energy more cost competitive.
High efficiency led the move from traditional back surface field (BSF) cell technology to PERC and other cell types, while TOPCon is currently the technology of choice in the mainstream. However, back contact cell architecture has consistently proven its worth in terms of efficiency.
The underlying principle of back contact technology is the placement of the positive and negative contacts on the backside of the cell, which provides numerous benefits. With both contacts at the rear, the front surface remains unobstructed, maximizing both the cell’s exposure to sunlight and its light absorption. This structure minimizes the surface area where recombination can occur, leading to improved electron flow and increased efficiency. Variants of this technology include Emitter Wrap-Through (EWT), Metal Wrap-Through (MWT) ─ where only the busbar is placed at the rear ─ and Interdigitated Back Contact cells (IBC).
Of the above, IBC is the most promising. In 2022, the most efficient commercial IBC solar module first achieved the 23% efficiency level, and a back-contact based solar module made in China recently even reached the 24% level. In both cases, the module was manufactured by AIKO.
IBC operates on the principle that the charge carriers generated near the front surface can still be collected at the rear side of the cell. The resulting benefits, in short, are:
Creating alternating regions on the rear side with n- and p-doping is the most critical part of realizing IBC. Depending on the emitter doping type, n- or p-passivation materials can be selected ─ such as silicon nitride for the n-surface and aluminum oxide or silicon oxide for the p-surface.
Back contact solar cell technology isn’t new. It was invented in the late-1970s, but it took until the first decade of this century until it was commercialized. Advancements in materials and manufacturing processes have allowed for noteworthy gains in the efficiency levels of IBC cells. Over the last few years, there’s been a significant uptick in the number of companies that have mastered this technology. Among the four most efficient solar modules, three are based on back contact cell technology, and all of them have at least 23% module efficiency.
It is noteworthy that the IBC structure can be adapted to either p-type or n-type wafers and can even be implemented onto different cell architectures, such as TOPCon or HJT. However, the best commercial cell efficiencies so far have been attained by combining the back contact layout with the n-type TOPCon architecture – the approach AIKO has chosen to follow. In its recent World Energy Investment 2023 report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that n-type cells will lead the market by 2033. AIKO calls its current technology ABC, which stands for ”all back contact,” and has attained mass production efficiency of 26.5% for its cells.
AIKO began developing its ABC cell architecture in 2021. This marked a turning point that enabled the company to venture into module-making, and ultimately, to evolve into a one-stop solution provider for downstream customers. Building on this achievement, in 2022, AIKO launched its first-generation ABC module with an efficiency of 23.6%, which has now increased to 24% as announced in 2023.

The key to mastering IBC technology is interdigitated doping of the solar cell. AIKO developed a procedure to isolate and fabricate the interdigitated carrier-selective collector regions to maximize high minority carrier lifetime, and it mastered the rear surface passivation, handling the presence of the opposite polarities of dopants on the backside of the solar cell. The approach safeguards efficiency while also simplifying an otherwise complex and costly process. Another significant cost reduction step taken by AIKO is to employ copper for the cell’s metallization, instead of the more expensive silver common to most other cell technologies.
The back contact structure also presents a unique interconnection opportunity. Since the contacts of both polarities lie on the same side, the ribbons don’t have to be connected from the back of one cell to the front of the next; they can run straight, which avoids bending and allows the cells to be densely packed, improving the utilization rate of the module area.
The superior attributes of back contact architecture include high power density, which reduces costs associated with mounting hardware, cabling, and labor ─ contributing to a cut of about 7% in BOS costs. A temperature coefficient of -0.26%/℃  adds to gains in the power yield. While less efficient solar modules are offered with 25-year performance warranties, there is no one offering back contact cell-based modules with performance warranties under 30 years.
A solar panel built with back contact cells comes with a very uniform look, undisturbed by front contacts, especially when complemented with a black backsheet and black frame. This makes the product highly valued in residential applications. However, the technology can be adapted to all mainstream applications. For example, AIKO currently has in its portfolio four products for residential applications, four for C&I, and one for utility-scale power plants. The residential products are available in dual glass and single glass configurations and are offered in two variants: the black series, which the company says has superior aesthetics, and the white series with higher output power. Within the C&I series, products include glass backsheet modules in both black and white variants, a dual-glass product, and a lightweight module. The company’s 72-cell dual-glass bifacial modules are part of its utility product portfolio.
The Intersolar AWARD 2023 honored AIKO’s achievements for designing the world’s most efficient commercial solar module using back contact cell technology. With the top module efficiencies relying on back contact cells, moving backwards has meant a big leap forward, demonstrating that solar cell technology roads will likely lead to back contacts.

Terra-Gen and Mortenson have announced the activation of the Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, the largest solar-plus-storage project in the United States. Mortenson served as engineering, procurement, and construction contractor for the project. 
The project is a true renewable energy behemoth, spanning 4,600 acres, comprised of 1.9 million US-made First Solar panels. It holds a capacity of 875 MWdc solar, and nearly 3.3 GWh of energy storage. It has a 1.3 GW interconnection capacity. 
California’s grid is expected to receive enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 238,000 homes from the project. This leads to an estimated 320,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions abated annually. 
The energy storage is made up of LG Chem, Samsung, and BYD batteries. This feat of engineering required 98 miles of MV Wire, over 361 miles of DC wiring, and 120,720 batteries. 
Edwards & Sanborn is partially located on the Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County, California, a hub for many of the largest solar projects in the United Staes. It represents the largest public-private collaboration in US Department of Defense history. Since 2020, more than 1,000 craftworkers contributed to the project, and it was executed with more than a million hours of injury-free labor.
“Only in America can we take barren land, embrace the power of the sun, and create an engineering marvel,” said Brigadier General William Kale, Air Force civil engineer center commander. “So, take the time to reflect, see the great work that was done, and understand the significance of this project and what it can lead to. Hopefully, this is just the spark.”
The active project supplies power to the city of San Jose, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, the Clean Power Alliance, and Starbucks corporation, among others.
The project’s first phase added 346 MWac of solar modules and 1.5 GWh of battery storage. Financing for the the first phase was closed in 2021 and included $804 million senior secured credit facilities. This includes $400 million construction and term loan facility, a $328 million tax equity bridge facility, and a $76 million construction and revolving letter of credit facility. J.P. Morgan is providing the tax equity commitment for the initial phase of the project, with Deutsche Bank leading the construction and term financing.
In 2022, Terra-Gen closed a nearly $1 billion project financing for the second phase of the project. It included $460 million construction and term loan facility, $96 million construction and revolving credit facility, and a $403 million tax equity bridge facility. BNP Paribas, CoBank, U.S. Bank, ING, and Nomura led the funding.
In total, the two financing rounds for the project totaled more than $1.7 billion.
