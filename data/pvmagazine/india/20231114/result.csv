Scientists from Yonsei University in South Korea have developed a novel method to produce electricity from engineered green algae via a cellular PV power station. The system is designed for hydrogen production.
“Material costs of about $1,000 are needed per gram of hydrogen,” researcher Hyun S. Ahn told pv magazine. “My coauthors and I are confidently aiming for a hundred-fold improvement in the cost efficiency in scale up, targeting to about tens of dollars of material cost per gram of hydrogen produced.”
Scientists used Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a single-cell green algae capable of generating photoelectrons, for the system. To overcome the barrier of cell walls that photoelectrons cannot cross, they integrated the algae with carbon nanofibers (CNFs). These CNFs serve as conduits, guiding the photoelectrons from the cell into a buffer solution.
They exposed the engineered alga-CNF to solar irradiation and observed an average photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 0.7%, peaking at 0.9%. At this efficiency level, a single alga-CNF cell can produce up to 9.5 W.
“Such power rating can be translated to approximately a milk-carton-sized batch capable of powering a laptop at reasonable cell densities,” the research group stated. “The cellular power stations exhibit a unique advantage that the algae swim and efficiently pack in three dimensions rather than cover a flat surface; therefore, space requirements for energy generation are less stringent than that of planar solar-to-fuel devices.”
The group used the process for the generation of hydrogen by adding platinum (Pt) to the composite, due to its lower cathodic redox potential. Redox, or reduction-oxidation, is a chemical reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between two substances. Due to the differences in redox potential in the composite, a synthesis of metal nanoparticles at the end of the inserted CNF is possible, acting as fuel-forming catalysts. This process uses the generated photoelectrons as a reductant, as they contribute electrons to the Pt surface.
That created two reactions in the solution: a hydrogen evolution and an oxygen reduction. According to the researchers, leaving this process to evolve gradually, hydrogen production accelerated from day six. Peak production was recorded on day 10 and maintained to day 50 for a total of 363 μmol of hydrogen in a 15 mL batch. The fuel production rate scaled linearly with the volume of the batch.
“The photoelectron relay chain in the developed algal cell power stations was highly efficient,” the researchers said. “Continuous photosynthetic hydrogen evolution in excess of 50 days is one of the longest lasting systems. The rate at which our cellular power stations accrued hydrogen was among the fastest reported.”
In addition, the academics found the algal cell’s bioelectrogenic reactors to self-regulate the oxygen level. That results in hydrogen fuel that is available for direct feed into a commercial fuel cell without the need for separation or purification. To demonstrate it, they fed the fuel into a radio-controlled (RC) car.
“Smooth running of the vehicle comparable to that powered by pure hydrogen was observed. This is an unusual case of driving a mobility device by synthetic green hydrogen at the laboratory scale,” they said in “Prolonged hydrogen production by engineered green algae photovoltaic power stations,” which was recently published in Nature Communications. “Solar-to-fuel conversion consuming only CO2 and water as the electron source is a champion achievement. We believe the photovoltaic power station developed here will play a pivotal role in the design of renewable energy portfolio in the future due to the demonstrated scalability along with cost and space efficiency of energy production.”
Ahn said that “the scale-up of the system is rather simple, thanks to the good growth rate of the algae even in high concentrations. Scale-up simply would require increasing the volume of the reactor and the algal cell power station concentration. At industrial optimization, we think that bath-tub-sized reactors should be able to power full-sized fuel cell cars, needing 2 kg to 4 kg of hydrogen per week of driving.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/14/solar-plus-storage-outperforms-diesel-in-military-survivability-analysis/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 14, 2023",Solar-plus-storage outperforms diesel in military survivability analysis,"From pv magazine USA
Analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) demonstrated that solar energy systems, when paired with up to 100 hour long duration energy storage (LDES), outperform military grade emergency diesel generators (EDGs) in both survivability and financial viability in military applications over a fourteen day window.
Historical data comparing the failure rates of EDGs to solar plus LDES technologies demonstrates that, over a 14-day standard military uptime evaluation, solar plus LDES’ survivability probability exceeds 95%, while the diesel generators’ survivability hovers around 80%.

The study also suggests that a more strategically sized solar-plus-storage system could achieve nearly perfect reliability, with uptime approaching 100% over a two-week period. NREL differentiates between the 95%+ ‘Intermediate’ Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), which is currently available for field testing and provides a 38% round-trip efficiency, while the 100% ‘Goal’ BESS, still in the conceptual phase, is expected to provide a 48% round-trip efficiency and cut the energy storage system costs in half. However, since the ‘Goal’ BESS is currently under development, future costs may deviate from these projections.
The analysis also found that the Intermediate solar-plus-storage projects had a positive net present value, meaning that they paid for themselves over the long term. The same could not be said for the EDGs. The theoretical Goal BESS sized projects with 100% uptime over the 14 day window were projected to have a net present value positive over their lifetimes.

NREL presented these findings in the report titled Long-Duration Energy Storage: Resiliency for Military Installations.
Upon release of the report, Michael McGhee, acting deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment & energy resilience at Department of Defense (DOD), emphasized the significance of the NREL evaluation:
Important work by NREL to evaluate LDES, coupled with solar PV (the most likely way to easily and simply generate power without the need for off-base supply chains), to help extend availability of military capabilities at our fixed installations for critical electrical loads. 14 days is our minimum DoD requirement for energy assurance for those needs.
The product modeled is Antora’s heat energy to  thermophotovoltaics BESS. Electricity is used to heat up the storage medium and is later absorbed by thermophotovoltaics panels into electricity, through the usual inverter and grid connection steps. A distinct advantage of this system is the electrical separation of the storage and generation segments, allowing rapid charging from the grid or local solar without affecting thermal PV output.

Currently, Antora’s BESS, with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7, is in beta field testing. NREL’s analysis provides compelling evidence for the DOD to expand field trials on military installations.
Survivability
The study identifies three primary risks for DOD’s EDGs: Failure to start, availability and mean time to failure. It estimates a 0.94% failure-to-start rate, 99.5% availability and 1,100 hours mean time to failure. Diesel system resiliency rates at 70% and 80% over 14 days, assuming a continuous fuel supply, a significant logistical challenge because bases rarely stockpile two weeks’ worth of diesel.
NREL assessed EDGs across three military sites, considering the critical load responsibilities of eight EDGs at Fort Bliss, seven at Patuxent River and four at Holloman AFB. The systems have a responsibility of meeting the site’s critical loads. Across the three sites critical loads were 18.5%, 23.5%, and 37.5% of the military base’s total electrical demand.

For the two-week period, the analysis suggests that operational solar-plus-storage systems during grid outages have a more than 99% probability of continuing to run post-incident, significantly outpacing the diesel generators.
The report recognizes space constraints as a primary limitation for solar on bases, calculating six acres per megawatt of panels. At the Patuxent River naval air station, where land is scarce, upsizing energy storage is a costly necessity, making it more challenging for the energy storage system to cover its costs in the long term. However, most bases do have sufficient space to increase the size of their solar installations.
For this reason, the report also analyzed hybrid systems that combined the solar with the EDGs, finding that in specific instances the results were very strong for survivability. However, the operations and maintenance for these multi-technology systems do pose additional risk and increased costs.
Multiple military branches are already testing long-duration energy storage solutions. For example, a multi-megawatt Cellcube facility, (image featured at the beginning of this article), is under evaluation by the Navy & Marine Corps. Concurrently, the Air Force is examining Redflow’s megawatt-scale zinc-bromine flow battery and control system. This advanced storage equipment, coupled with microgrid software, aims to create a cohesive system at the Air Force base. According to the DOD, Redflow’s solution will enable “a dispatchable solar–plus-storage resource for peak shaving and energy resilience.”

According to the press release, the plants include the 2 GW Al Sadawi plant located in the country’s east and the 1 GW (AC) Al Masa’a project located in northern Hail province. It also includes the 400 MW (AC) Al Henakiyah 2 plant located in western Madinah province and the 300 MW (AC) Rabigh 2 array located in western Makkah province.
Projects will be overseen by SPPC – the government-owned entity tasked with procuring electricity from independent power producers – which will be responsible for the predevelopment, tendering and subsequent “offtaking” of energy, SPPC said in the announcement.
The projects comprise one-quarter of all energy capacity (12.6 GW) awarded as part of the NREP renewable energy program. NREP, according to its website, is designed to “maximize” the country’s renewable energy potential.
The Saudi Arabian government aims to generate 27.5 GW of renewable energy by 2030, the country’s leading solar lobby group said. This is a significant leap ahead of the nation’s current installed capacity, which was estimated at 390 MW at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Association.
