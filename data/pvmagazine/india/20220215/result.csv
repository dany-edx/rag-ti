Some of the identified DRE-based livelihood applications with potential for scale-up include solar cold storages, solar tunnel dryers, mini rice mills, multi-purpose food processors, DRE-enabled climate-controlled vertical farming systems, solar submersible pumps, solar sewing machines, and solar looms.
The framework is developed to guide the state-level and central government ministries and other stakeholders in formulating schemes and programs for the promotion of distributed renewable energy-based livelihood applications. 
It includes steps for demand assessment; innovation, research and development of DRE technologies to offer tailor-made solutions; pilot and up-scaling of DRE livelihood applications; improving access to finance; skill development and capacity building; etc.
The demand assessment activity will help in mapping the needs of beneficiaries with appropriate fit to DRE livelihood applications. MNRE, in consultation with stakeholders, shall develop a list of DRE livelihood applications, which will be updated regularly.
Guidelines and standards for some of the system components will be specified so as to promote innovation in the sector while also ensuring that only good quality products are scaled up. These components could include solar panels, cables, isolators, etc
Incubation and pilot support for DRE-based livelihood enterprises will be facilitated through collaborations with various organizations/industries. The support could include technical assistance to the entrepreneurs to commercialize their solutions.
“In partnership with financial institutions, a financing facility offering a first loss default guarantee with partial risk coverage to facilitate access to credit for entrepreneurs and end-users would be worked out. With this facility in place, financial institutions may explore the development of collateral-free financial products to help meet short-term financing requirements of enterprises as well as stipulate minimum tenure for various values of loan to end-users to ensure repayments are aligned with additional income of the end-users,” as per the framework.
To further enable end-user financing, the framework proposes recognition of DRE-based livelihood solutions under the existing provisions of priority sector lending; preference to DRE-enabled variants of technologies under existing interventions such as Rural Innovation Development Fund; inclusion of DRE-powered livelihood solutions in the list of products that could be supported under Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana and Prime Minister Employment Generation Scheme (PMEGP).
The MNRE will form an inter-ministerial coordination committee to identify and exploit opportunities for DRE livelihood applications under the schemes of various Ministries and Departments of the Central/State Government. The committee will have participation from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare; Ministry of Rural Development; Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying; Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises; Ministry of Tribal Affairs; Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; Ministry of Textiles; Ministry of Food Processing Industries; Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; and Ministry of Science & Technology.

Verdagy, a company that is developing a water-based electrolyzer for green hydrogen production, has secured cash to scale its technology in a $25 million funding round led by TDK Ventures, Orbia, BHP Ventures, Doral Energy, Tech Ventures, Kholsa Ventures, Shell Ventures, and Temasek.
The technology is designed to provide hydrogen fuel for heavy industrial applications, a sector responsible for about one third of global emissions. The electrolyzer can reduce its carbon impact by being supplied with sources like solar and wind.
Verdagy was spun off from chemical company Chemetry in May 2021 to develop a novel design to water electrolysis. The company’s device splits water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules through an electric current. The membrane-based technology uses large active area cells, high current densities, and broad operating ranges to deliver hydrogen at scale.
The company said its industry-largest cells operate at energy densities 10 times higher than traditional alkaline water electrolysis. The company said it has a load shedding ability of 95% to reduce energy costs and maximize production.
Analysts are now predicting that the global green hydrogen market will reach $89 billion by 2030, said Verdagy. Rising demand and falling costs has led to both renewable energy and electrolysis prices falling 50% to 60% every five years, said the company.
Verdagy operates a pilot plant in Moss Landing, California, a hotbed for large-scale energy storage and solar development.
“We believe that green hydrogen at the right scale and cost is key to decarbonizing industrial processing of steel, aluminum, cement and chemicals – and in combination with captured CO2, enables the production of other chemical feedstocks and liquid fuels for marine and aviation applications,” said Sameer Bharadwaj, CEO of Orbia. “Orbia hopes to contribute to Verdagy’s success with its expertise in basic and advanced materials, large-scale chemical processes and a keen focus on decarbonization technologies that support a sustainable future.”
Orbia said it is simultaneously investing in food security and growth, water management, infrastructure development, data access, health advancement and sustainable energy, energy storage and decarbonization alongside hydrogen electrolysis.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/15/new-poly-fabs-could-head-off-first-half-solar-project-slowdown/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MAX HALL,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",New poly fabs could head off first-half solar project slowdown,"From pv magazine Global
With utility scale solar investment and hydrogen and battery storage capacity all expected to leap this year, Norwegian analyst Rystad Energy is hoping an anticipated rise in polysilicon production facilities will head off the harmful effects of rising commodity prices.
The Oslo-based data company is expecting the polysilicon industry to attain more than a million tons of annual production capacity this year to keep a lid on solar panel prices which leapt in 2021, in part thanks to a shortage of the raw material.
The new poly capacity, though, may not come soon enough to head off what Rystad described as a “potential downturn” in new big solar projects, “at least for the first half of the year,” with the analyst noting the dampening effect rising steel prices are having on the onshore wind sector.
The warning was issued in a note released by Rystad on Thursday in which the analyst predicted 220GW of new large scale renewable energy project capacity will arrive this year, including 12GW of battery capacity, more than 400MW of hydrogen production facilities, and an 18% rise in solar project spending, from $117 billion last year to $138 billion this.
Rystad stated solar makes up the biggest proportion of the 195GW of that total, 2022 renewables project figure which is already under construction, with PV laying claim to 46% of the capacity which is taking shape. Almost half of the projects which have already broken ground this year are in Asia, according to Rystad, chiefly in China and India.
