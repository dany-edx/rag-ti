Monocrystalline PERC G12 wafer prices decreased by 2.24% week-over-week to $0.349 per piece (pc), while N-type M10 and G12 wafer prices dropped by 2.82% and 2.08% week to week-over-week to $0.241/pc and $0.377/pc, respectively.
The only exception was monocrystalline PERC M10 wafers, which trended flat week to week at $0.254/pc thanks to its manageable production output.

As outlined by a market expert, the fundamentals of the wafer market are currently defined by elevated inventory levels, high production costs, and heightened operating rates.
The high inventory level of wafers has placed a lot of strain on the wafer suppliers. A source from a major wafer producer expressed the challenge of sales being very tough, stating that without offering discounts on quotations, securing an order is practically impossible.
According to a source from a small-scale manufacturer, there’s a notable price variance among the quotes for N-type M10 wafers in the market. Despite the mainstream price standing at CNY1.93 ($0.27)/pc, some manufacturers have resorted to quoting as low as CNY1.8/pc to bolster sales.
According to the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, the wafer market’s average operating rate has currently exceeded 85%. The resurgence of downstream demand is one of the factors driving wafer manufacturers to maintain high operating rates, said a market participant.
Furthermore, the polysilicon prices stand relatively robust at present, which necessitates that wafer manufacturers maintain high operating rates to mitigate non-silicon production expenses, the source added.
Additionally, OPIS has gathered from market insights that certain downstream manufacturers are requesting wafer producers to slightly modify the size of current M10 wafers to enhance the power generation area of modules. Currently, wafers sized at 183.5 and 183.75mm are being explored based on the M10 182mm standard. Wafer factories can achieve these sizes without the need for equipment updates.
Moving forward, it’s inevitable that wafer inventory will continue to accumulate rapidly. A source observed that some wafer factories are contemplating production cuts to reduce inventory. It remains to be seen if the wafer production output in March can meet the 70 GW or more that the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association has projected.

The three plants will be set up in the Khulna, Moulvibazar, and Rajbari districts. The cabinet committee on government purchasing said the projects were awarded tariff rates of around $0.10/kWh.
All of the plants will be set up on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis.  The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) will buy electricity from the plants for a period of 20 years under the “no electricity, no payment” approach. This means the BPDB will purchase the total net energy output of the facilities, but will only make a payment for the electricity delivered to the delivery point.
Energon Renewables (BD) Ltd and PWR will build a 100 MW solar farm in Khulna district, southwestern Bangladesh. A consortium formed by Thien Phu Vietnam New Energy Joint Stock Co and Dream Finder will build another facility in Moulvibazar District in the northeastern part of the country. China Datang Overseas Investmen and Engreen Engineering will construct the third solar farm in Rajbari district, central Bangladesh.
In February, the same committee approved a 50 MW solar plant proposed by Paragon Poultry in Beel Sulongi district.
Power-hungry Bangladesh approved 2.19 GW of large-scale PV projects in 2023. This increase was due to new measures that were recently introduced to help domestic independent power producers build and operate new renewable energy plants.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/16/maharashtra-launches-1-gw-pumped-storage-tender/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-03-16,"Maharashtra tenders for 1 GW pumped storage, 5 GW solar power","Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (MSEDCL) intends to avail an energy storage facility to meet its Energy Storage Obligations and electricity demand from suitable standalone pumped hydro storage plants connected to the nearest ISTS/InSTS substation and located anywhere in India. It has therefore tendered for the selection of pumped storage developers to provide long-term ISTS/InSTS connected energy storage capacity of 1,000 MW/8,000 MWh (for 8 hours discharge with maximum 5 hours continuous discharge per day) from pumped hydro storage plants located anywhere in India on an on-demand basis for a period of 40 years.
The developers will be selected through tariff-based competitive bidding.
MSEDCL will enter into energy storage facility agreement on an annual fixed charge basis with the selected bidders for a period of 40 years.
The contracted capacity will be provided by the developer on a build-own-operate-maintain (BOOM) basis. The developer will be responsible for financing, development, design, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operation, and maintenance of the storage capacity.
MSEDCL intends to avail the energy storage facility to meet its storage RPO, manage surplus electricity available in the grid, meet electricity demand, manage intermittency of RE power and meet ancillary requirements, etc.
In a separate tender, MSEDCL has invited bids from developers to supply 5 GW of solar power from PV plants located in any part of the country. It will enter into power purchase agreement (PPA) with the solar developers selected through competitive bidding for the total capacity of 5 GW.
“Generating stations coming on stream on or after 01.04.2025 are required to supplement their
conventional generation with minimum supply of RE to the extent of 10%. RGO shall be assessed in terms of annual share of RE generation as a percentage of total annual generation (including both conventional and RE). Therefore, MSEDCL has decided to procure 5000 MW of solar power capacity..This will help MSEDCL in tying up large scale capacity in one step with optimal mix and it is expected to get better rates also due to benefit of larger scale. This will also attract potential generators of coal based power as they will be able to fulfill their RGO obligations,” stated MSEDCL.
