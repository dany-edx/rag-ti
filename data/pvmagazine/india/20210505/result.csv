The deadline—earlier due on May 5—is now revised to May 19, 2021. 
The proposed capacity—to be developed in turnkey mode—shall come up in the Cuddalore and Tiruvannamalai districts of Tamil Nadu.
The total capacity of 50 MW will be awarded to a single successful bidder selected through a reverse auction on the cumulative capacity.
The work scope includes complete transfer of ownership/lease of encumbrance-free land in favor of SECI, design, engineering, supply, construction, erection, testing and commissioning of the plant. The contractor shall also be responsible for the comprehensive operation and maintenance of the plant for ten years.
To be eligible, the bidder should be a body incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 2013.

Bolivia has announced plans to resume lithium extraction, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy and state-owned Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) last week.
The call is aimed at companies that have direct lithium-extraction technology (EDL) and that can conduct pilot tests at the Uyuni, Coipasa and Pastos Grandes salt flats, the Bolivian government said.
International players such as Russia’s Uranium 1G, China’s Gangfeng Lithium and TBEA, and U.S.-based EnergyX recently participated in an online meeting that YLB and the ministry held with potential investors. Experts at the meeting outlined the characteristics of EDL technology.
“EDL technology is a step toward innovation that will provide important opportunities to generate technical and technological growth and that is what we are here to present today,” said Minister of Hydrocarbons and Energy Franklin Molina.
This is the second attempt to exploit lithium in Bolivia. YLB and Germany’s ACI Systems agreed in October 2019 to set up a joint venture to exploit lithium from Bolivia. Around $1.2 billion was to be invested in a high-tech complex at the Uyuni salt flat, with the main product to be lithium-ion batteries. Under the terms of their agreement, YLB was set to take a 51% stake in the joint venture. Just a month later, however, the government stopped the project by decree, without giving any explanation.
In April 2018, the Bolivian authorities said that ACI Systems had been chosen to commercialize Bolivian lithium from among the eight expressions of interest the government had received. The agreement would have had a duration of 70 years.
Salar de Uyuni is believed to be the world’s largest lithium deposit. The original plan was to produce 30,000 to 40,000 tons of lithium hydroxide a year from 2022, with investments of €300 million to €400 million.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/05/dutch-lpg-major-acquires-majority-stake-in-sunsource-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,INDIA,NETHERLANDS",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 5, 2021",Dutch LPG major acquires majority stake in SunSource Energy,"SHV Energy, a Dutch family-owned multinational and global LPG distributor, today announced it would invest in Noida-headquartered distributed solar solutions provider SunSource Energy.
The investment is part of SHV Energy’s strategy to leverage its global platform to realize new opportunities within the distributed renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. It also allows SunSource Energy to meet its growth ambition.
SHV Energy acquires a majority stake in SunSource Energy upon completion of the transaction. Co-founders Kushagra Nandan and Adarsh Das will continue to run SunSource Energy and remain shareholders. The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
The investment provides SHV Energy entry into India’s fast-growing renewable energy market, focusing on solutions for C&I customers, capitalizing on the experience of SunSource Energy in decentralized energy projects. SHV Energy already operates in India through its SUPERGAS brand, a leading local LPG player founded in 1996.
“We look forward to collaborating with our new SunSource Energy colleagues to address the evolving energy needs of commercial and industrial consumers,” said Bram Gräber, CEO, SHV Energy. “India is a key market for SHV Energy, and this investment underpins our long-term commitment to the region and advancement of renewable energy solutions.”
The investment will help SunSource expand its C&I solar portfolio to 550+ MWp by 2023, with an overall ambition to grow it to over 1 GW. 
“They (SHV Energy) will be financing 550 MW of capital expenditure in two-three years and 1 GW going forward. We will be part of SHV group company and may have the leverage to reach out to a larger C&I base,” said Kushagra Nandan, Co-Founder and President, SunSource Energy.
Adarsh Das, Co-Founder and CEO, SunSource Energy, added, “We are happy to have a like-minded strategic long-term investor on board who believes in our model of sustainable development and decentralized energy solutions. This investment will enable us to leverage SHV Energy’s global presence and expertise to emerge as a leading global distributed solar company.”
As part of this transaction, Neev fund (a private equity firm backed by State Bank of India and UK’s Department for International Development), the original investor of SunSource, has obtained a successful exit.
Founded in 2010, SunSource Energy was initially focused on design and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of solar projects, and since 2018 it has successfully expanded to also invest in C&I solar projects to sell energy to its customers under the independent power producer category. SunSource also develops and invests in off-site C&I projects known as open access solar projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/05/leclanche-unveils-modular-plug-and-play-solution-for-utility-scale-storage/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 5, 2021","Leclanché unveils modular, plug-and-play solution for utility scale storage","From pv magazine International
Swiss battery manufacturer Leclanche has launched a new modular, plug-and-play solution for large scale energy storage which is claimed to have a reduced carbon footprint and environmental impact.
The LeBlock solution consists of two kinds of five-foot, interchangeable battery blocks that the manufacturer describes as easy to transport via boat or truck and to be installed on a slab or pad with the support of a crane. Both solutions, the company went on to say, allow for shipping “as a standard 20-foot ISO container and serve as the heavy-duty enclosure for the installed system.”
The blocks are pre-assembled and the batteries are already embedded when the product is shipped, with wiring and connectors also being pre-installed.
One of the two systems is called BatteryBlock and is presented as a pre-installed, liquid-cooled battery that racks up to a storage capacity of 745 kWh and is equipped with a fire protection system. The second solution, dubbed CombiBlock, consists of a series of battery blocks containing a centralized liquid cooling unit.
“LeBlock is designed to assist utility and [help] energy project managers seeking a less complex, [and more] reliable and cost-effective solution to replace or increase the reliability of the grid while helping to reduce carbon footprint and the impact of power generation on the environment,” said the company’s CEO, Anil Srivastava.
The manufacturer said that both solutions feature a fire-resistant construction, an emergency stop function, a fire detection and suppression system, isolation monitoring, and a ‘deflagration panel’ for relief of any internal pressure. “The system complies with all common international standards for transport and battery integration, including UN38.3, UL9540A, IEC62933, NFPA 855, NFPA 68 and more,” it further explained.
