The enterprise value for this acquisition is approx. INR 417 crore.
The plant is owned by SkyPower Southeast Asia III Investments Limited and SkyPower Southeast Asia Holdings 2 Limited and operated through special purpose vehicle Sunshakti Solar Power Projects Private Limited.
The project benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Northern Power Distribution Company of Telangana Limited (NPDCTL) at a fixed tariff of approx. INR 5.35/kWh, with the remaining useful life of approx. 20 years.
Torrent Power’s latest addition follows the acquisition of a 50 MW solar asset from UK-based developer Lightsource BP in the Indian State of Maharashtra.
Torrent Power, part of the diversified Torrent Group with group revenues of INR 20,500 crore (approx. US$ 2.7 billion) and a market cap of INR 75,000 crore (approx. US$ 10 billion), is one of the largest companies in the country’s power sector with presence across the entire power value chain of generation, transmission, and distribution.
Torrent Power currently has an aggregate installed generation capacity of 4.1 GW, consisting mainly of clean generation sources such as gas (2.7 GW) and renewables (1.0 GW). It also has 400 MW of renewable energy plants under development. With the acquisition of the 50 MW solar power plant, its total generation capacity, including an under-development portfolio, will reach 4.6 GW with a renewable portfolio of more than 1.5 GW.

He said investors need security, and there is a need to put in mechanisms to drive investments to ensure that the growth in these regions is green. The minister also pitched for the creation of renewable energy banks.
The minister said that the cost of technologies like storage is among other challenges to driving energy transition in developing countries, adding that building scales is important to bring down prices. Nations also need to share their best technologies to make systems like fuel cells more efficient.
The minister, along with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, was addressing a panel discussion during their visit to the International Solar Alliance (ISA) Secretariat in Gurugram, Haryana. The panel discussion was attended by Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi, Secretary-Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India; ambassadors of EU member countries of ISA; and industry representatives.
The minister highlighted India’s success in building RE capacity through the bidding route.
In her keynote address, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “India and the European Union are closely aligned in the fight against climate change. Both India and the EU have embarked on their way to net-zero emissions. And in both India and Europe, solar energy will play a key role in getting there. Now, we need to step up EU-India cooperation in developing solar energy. We can learn how to finance, promote, and deploy solar energy and secure global supply chains and material needed for solar panels.”
MNRE Secretary stated that the global community is reposing increasing faith in International Solar Alliance as a critical instrument in the fight against climate change. He added that the visit of the EC President to ISA headquarters would lead to a renewed commitment from countries across the world to strengthen ISA’s efforts.
Industry leaders who were present included CEOs of the Clean Energy International Incubation Centre, EDF-India, Greenko, Reliance, Renew Power, Schneider Electric, Tata Power, and Vikram Solar. They shared their thoughts on key issues related to solar energy development.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/25/new-solar-module-cooling-tech-based-on-porous-nanochannels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 25, 2022",New solar module cooling tech based on porous nanochannels,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from Siracuse University in the United States have developed a solar module cooling technique based on spray-cooling heat flux dissipation on porous nanochannels.
The nanochannels device was attached to the entire surface of the rear side of a monocrystalline panel measuring 180 mm × 290 mm x 5.45 mm. Several devices can be used on the same module depending on the required extent of cooling. Spray droplets are dispersed over the nanochannels device in order to eliminate the need for a continuous supply of a coolant. The cooling effect is provided by the thin-film evaporation-based phase-change heat transfer occurring in the porous nanochannels device.
“The heat flux dissipation due to the employed nanochannels is introduced for the thermal management of the PV panel,” the scientists explained, noting that the performance of the nanochannels was analyzed in two different cases of spray cooling corresponding to the uniform spray droplet diameter of 400 (Case 1) and 20 μm (Case 2) achieved earlier. “The amount of heat flux removal during such a process is found to be dependent on the surface temperature.”
The final steady-state temperature of the proposed two cases was found to be 30.5 C and 20 C, respectively, which compares to 51.5 C for a reference solar module without any cooling. “Clearly, the finer spray droplets in Case 2 provide a higher heat flux dissipating ability and exhibit a greater extent of PV panel cooling approaching the theoretical limit,” the US group emphasized. “The enhancement in Case 2 as compared to Case 1 also aligns well with the finding in terms of the heat transfer coefficient, thus reiterating the significance of the reported technique of PV panel cooling.”
For Case 2, the average cooling was found to be of up to 31 C and the overall enhancement in the electrical power yield to be 32.8%. No information was provided on the costs of the proposed device nor on its commercial viability.
The technique was introduced in the study “Thermal Management of Photovoltaics Using Porous Nanochannels,” published in energy&fuels.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/25/zinc-ion-battery-for-residential-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 25, 2022",Zinc-ion battery for residential applications,"From pv magazine Global
Canada-based Salient Energy has developed a zinc-ion battery for stationary energy storage in residential applications.
“The batteries are currently manufactured at our facility in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, with a capacity of 100 batteries per month,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Currently, we are in the process of ramping up production at this same facility to the pilot scale to support pilot projects in the residential space. We are also developing our first gigafactory plant design, which will be located in the USA or Canada.”
According to the manufacturer, its zinc-ion battery acts the same way as existing lithium-ion storage systems. “The battery can respond almost instantaneously to store or deliver clean power as needed. Since it has similar power capabilities to Li-ion, it is also well-suited for short-duration storage, which is a term for energy storage systems that can completely charge or discharge in just a few hours,” the spokesperson explained.
“Generally, zinc-ion energy storage systems function the same as lithium-ion, with the important differences between the two being in cost, safety, and supply chain abundance as opposed to performance. Additionally, its water-based chemistry eliminates the risk of fire, making it a safe alternative to existing systems.”
The battery measures 26cmx24cmx1.2cm and weighs in at 1.3 kg. Its rated capacity is 60 Ah and the nominal voltage is 1.3 V. The volumetric energy density is 100 Wh/L and the gravimetric energy density is 60 Wh/kg. The shelf life for two weeks is 100% and that for six months is 95%.
“Our initial focus is on the residential market, specifically starting with targeting homebuilders who are developing net-zero homes and communities,” the spokesperson continued. “We are starting with residential because of how important safety is to this market – we know that our zero fire-risk systems will greatly simplify installation and peace of mind to homeowners. We plan on expanding from residential into industrial energy storage and utility scale systems built for the grid.”
Zinc-ion has lagged behind other storage technologies due to challenges in controlling side reactions that both limit reversible charging at the anode and cause the cathode to fall apart. Zinc-ion, however, still has the potential for good energy storage performance out of cheap, abundant materials.
According to a recent study from the University of Bremen in Germany, the two main hurdles that must be overcome for zinc-ion batteries in future research are the increase of the specific energy of the full Zn-ion cell and the prevention of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction occurring during the Zn electrodeposition step.
