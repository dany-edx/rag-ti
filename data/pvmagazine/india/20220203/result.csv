Announcing the decision in its fourth quarterly report, Scatec cited a lack of supply of domestic solar panels and a 40% import duty on solar panels to be imposed from April as the reasons for putting the project on hold. Due to these, the project has been moved from backlog to pipeline, the developer stated, adding it still viewed India as a very robust market.
Scatec has a 50% stake in the Rajasthan solar project being developed by Acme. The project, its first in India, was scheduled for commissioning in 2022. It will benefit from a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Solar Energy Corporation of India.
Scatec stated the main reason for putting the Rajasthan project in the pipeline was “the realization or confirmation that the import duty was not going to be lifted for some of the projects in that [it’s 900 MW project] category.”
It added, “There will be a change in the market in terms of where are the modules being sourced from, China or all the production being built up in India. We are a bit uncertain how quickly that is moving. That’s why we have decided to take this large project into the pipeline from the backlog.”
Also, “There is a gap in between the price level that we have seen in modules from China and the expected price level for India modules. We expect that over time, production lines for modules in India will approach the same cost level as in China. But that needs to be confirmed. Without knowing that, we have decided to move the project from backlog to pipeline.”
As shared by Scatec last year, the 900 MW solar project has an estimated total CAPEX of US$ 400 million, with 75% debt financing from an Indian state-owned lender. Scatec holds a 50% economic interest in the project, with Acme retaining the balance 50%. 
Acme’s scope of work includes turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) work. Scatec will ensure delivery as per international standards of Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) and Environment and Social (E&S), as well as optimization of engineering, procurement, and operations of the plants.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/03/with-sovereign-green-bonds-the-sun-continues-to-shine-for-renewable-energy-financing-in-india/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022","With green bonds push, the sun continues to shine for renewable energy financing in India","The Budget announcement on issuing sovereign green bonds will support the growth in India’s renewable energy sector, which already continues to outpace all other global economies, says a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
Green bonds are among the most widely used instruments for funding green infrastructure. The union budget 2022 unveiled by India’s finance minister includes a plan for issuing sovereign green bonds for projects that will assist in reducing the carbon intensity of the economy.
Sovereign green bonds have been issued by several countries in the recent past such as France, Germany, the UK and Indonesia, among several other nations, and will prove to be an essential source of capital for emerging countries to fund their energy transition journey.
Report co-author IEEFA’s Shantanu Srivastava says the sovereign issuance will assist green energy companies in India gain access to cost effective financing.
“While no other details have been shared regarding the issuance size and allocation for specific industries and technologies, this is a welcome move,” says Srivastava. “And it in fact echoes what has already been happening. Several industry players have raised capital through the green bond route in the past.”
IEEFA’s new report finds India’s renewable energy financing market has transformed massively over the past decade to include a plethora of different players vying for a piece of the growing sector.
“This environment fosters opportunities, especially in solar, that investors have yet to tap,” says report co-author, infrastructure finance specialist Ankur Saboo.
The report notes that in January 2010, the National Solar Mission (NSM) was launched with an initial target of 20 GW of installed solar power by 2022 but the target, revised twice, now stands at 100GW of solar PV to be installed by the end of this year.
The growth has been supported by an equally large amount of domestic and global capital, as both debt and equity, invested in Indian renewable energy infrastructure. Debt, the main fodder for renewable energy projects, has come through various channels as the industry matured and as financiers from all quarters gained a better understanding of its risk return dynamics, stated the report.
Private non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) were the first entities to test the waters by lending to renewable projects, when capital from other conventional sources such as banks found it best to avoid exposure to a nascent and evolving technology.
Financing has transformed significantly since then as sources expanded. Banks (private and public), the bond market (domestic and global), international lenders, development finance institutions (DFIs) and other sources of debt now compete for a piece of the growing renewable energy sector. Private NBFCs, the flag bearers at the start of the journey, have been overshadowed by larger banks, completely changing the renewable energy finance landscape.
Mutual funds entered the market through the domestic bond route soon after the banknote demonetisation undertaken by the Government of India in 2016, helping renewable energy companies by providing lower rates, increasing lender competition, adding a new avenue for funding operating projects and helping companies reduce exposures with certain lenders where exposure norms were hit.
“The biggest boon for the renewable energy sector has been access to global bond markets,” says Srivastava.
“The international bond market has demonstrated immense depth, proactiveness and boldness towards the sector, thanks to global understanding, high yield offerings and the initial success and pedigree of large players.
“With sovereign green bonds in the mix now, several global investors will be interested in taking exposure to the Indian market, given the instruments’ sovereign ratings,” says Srivastava.
“With increasing complexity and project sizes, the meaningful presence of these different players bodes well for continued growth of the sector. For a capital-intensive area, a highly competitive funding landscape is arguably the biggest growth driver,” adds Saboo.
In India’s journey from 100 GW to 500 GW of renewables, “critical factors for sustained financing include lenders adapting to the evolving renewable market, tapping environment focused investors, building a dedicated infrastructure finance bank in India and careful evaluation and financial structuring of the technological shift towards Indian modules and inverters, states the report.
The report states lenders must continuously research the evolving renewable market. On a more immediate basis, there are still untapped opportunities in green field projects, hybrid, storage and round-the-clock bids, and household plus commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftop solar projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/03/vanadium-redox-flow-battery-to-control-extreme-power-ramps-in-rooftop-pv/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022",Vanadium redox flow battery to control extreme power ramps in rooftop PV,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Évora (UÉvora) in Portugal have developed a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) configuration that is able to control the power output of a PV installation by maintaining the ramp rate within a non–violation limit and within a battery state of charge (SoC) range.
They explained that a solar system’s ramp rate may have a negative impact on the lifetimes of household appliances and grid stability. “The redox flow battery technology has advantages in the decoupling of power and energy ratios, large cycle life, low maintenance, and limited self-discharge,” they explained. “As for disadvantages, it has a low power density.”
“The vanadium redox flow battery technology can be upscaled up to any capacity, as it can be designed with independent power and energy requirements, an advantage over lithium-ion technology,” the research project’s corresponding author, Ana Catarina Foles, told pv magazine. “The sizing of a battery for this purpose of self-consumption and control of power ramps must be done taking into account the load profile, the characteristics of the solar photovoltaic system, such as installed power, inclination, and orientation, among others, as well as the site characteristics, such as solar radiation, meteorology, and limits imposed by law or regulation on power ramps or grid integration.”
The 5 kW/60 kWh battery was connected to a rooftop PV system with an MPPT inverter capable of receiving power commands in real-time. The battery operates through three inverters synchronized to the local three-phase grid. It was built with two electrolyte tanks containing a mixture of vanadium ions and sulfuric acid, two pumps for electrolyte flowing, and a stack as the energy conversion unit. The latter was fabricated with 40 cells electrically connected in series, and hydraulically connected in parallel.
The battery was provided by UK-based redT energy, which was recently renamed Invinity. The device has a rated capacity of 60 kWh,  an operating voltage of up to 60 V, and a capacity of 1.8 cubic meters for each tank. “The rated capacity of this battery is used to its fullest, without causing any degradation of its capacity, lifetime or performance,” Foles explained. “The technology type is very tolerable to over-discharge, and overcharge avoidance is achieved through the open-circuit voltage reference control outside the stack. Vanadium ions exist in both electrolyte tanks and crossover through the membrane stack does not lead to contamination.”
The VRFB is also equipped with a reference cell, which is hydraulically connected in parallel with the stack, subjected to the same electrolyte flow, without being subjected to charge or discharge voltage, and allows to make direct real-time voltage measurements.
The storage device was tested to control the ramp rate of a 6.7 kW building-integrated PV microgrid installed at the university campus.  The simulation was performed to analyze how the battery balances the system load to ensure firm power output at the load.  Three different strategies were applied: maximization of self-consumption; maximization of self-consumption with ramp-rate control; and self-consumption maximization with ramp-rate control and battery charging based on weather forecasts. Accordingly, three different algorithms were developed using Matlab software.
“The inputs of the simulation model include the constraints details of the UÉvora microgrid, the PV generation and load profiles, the developed VRFB electrical model, and the ramp rate calculus and its premises,” the academics specified, noting that the VRFB architecture may be reproduced in similar projects, with the increased advantage of being an easily scalable product.
Through their measurements, the Portuguese scientists found that approximately 5% of the PV power ramps that occurred were above the rate of 10%/min of the PV nameplate capacity and that the first strategy performs only a self-consumption maximization without any form of ramp rate control. The second strategy, by contrast, was able to perform ramp rate control by imposing a 10 %/min of the PV nameplate capacity ramp rate limit, while also providing additional stability over the grid energy exchange.
As for the third strategy, it was not only able to perform ramp rate control and maximize self-consumption but was also capable of implementing an SoC control to prepare the battery to better deal with the next–day PV power ramps. “This strategy demonstrated to be able to control 100% of the ramps with rates above 10%/min, maintaining the self-consumption ratio of the PV system at around 61%,” the scientists affirmed.
“The VRFB can be used in different energy management strategy scenarios, and to better complement the solar photovoltaic generation,” Foles emphasized. “In this study, we show that for the goal, which is to control PV power ramps, and given the profiles understudy, more gains are achieved if applied with the third strategy. However, VRFB can be used with the first and the second strategy if the goals are distinct. VRFB technology is a promising energy storage technology for building integration, and this work proves successful results on its real operation implementation.”
The research’s findings can be found in the paper “An approach to implement photovoltaic self-consumption and ramp-rate control algorithm with a vanadium redox flow battery day-to-day forecast charging,” published in Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks.
