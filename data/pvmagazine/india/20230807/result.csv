https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/07/china-module-prices-hold-steady/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 7, 2023",China module prices hold steady,"China module prices held steady this week as market players weighed the challenge of raising prices against increasing upstream costs.
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for modules from China, stayed at $0.163/W. TOPCon module prices likewise remained at $0.170/W.
While the market eyes rising prices in the upstream segments, most manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see approach, according to OPIS’ market survey. Mono M10 cell prices increased 1.73% this week to $0.0939/W. The cell segment has the lowest inventory level across the whole supply chain, meaning cell prices could increase further, a source said.

Yet hiking module prices is challenging as the market deals with oversupply and intense rivalry among sellers, concurred multiple sources. Numerous recent low price bids for China projects from vertically integrated players have eroded the breathing room for manufacturers who only make modules and lack the advantage of low production costs, according to a source.
International markets are similarly gloomy as they sit on significant module inventories. Due to the backlog from this year’s first and second quarters, one maker stopped replenishing its European warehouses this June, a source at the firm said. Echoing the sentiment, another source said regions like Europe and South America “do not simply have the conditions for price increases due to the enormous backlogs of modules.”
According to the production schedule of module makers. China is expected to produce roughly 47 GW of modules in August, according to one source. Module makers could cut manufacturing if cell prices continue to rise, the source added.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

Australian startup MGA Thermal said it has secured new funds to provide a foundation for the next phase of its growth. The funds will facilitate the commissioning of an automated production line at its factory in Tomago, New South Wales, accelerating operations well into 2024.
MGA CEO Erich Kisi said with the new production line – which will be capable of manufacturing more than 1 MWh of MGA Blocks every day – fast approaching completion, the latest round of investment will enable the company to strategically expand its commercial division and invest in engineering and implementation.
“With the imminent completion of our production line, we’re on track to produce 1,000 blocks per day which can then be assembled into 24/7 renewable energy storage,” he said.
The company is commercializing a ‘miscibility gap alloy’ approach to thermal energy storage, storing heat in blocks made largely from aluminium and graphite and dispatching it to generate electricity.
MGA’s patented thermal energy storage blocks, about the size of a large house brick, consist of small alloy particles embedded within graphite-based blocks enclosed in a fully insulated system. Once heated the alloy particles can store heat for days with minimal energy loss. Heat exchangers are used to absorb heat from the blocks, with the heated gas or fluid suitable for industrial heat applications or to drive a steam turbine to generate electricity.
The company is in the final stages of commissioning a demonstration unit at its Tomago base that it said will provide a tangible example of the thermal energy storage system in action and substantiate its scalability for potential customers and partners.
MGA said the demonstration unit will include modular blocks stacked into large assemblies within MGA-designed thermal energy storage (TES) systems.
“These TES systems are able to store millions of kilowatt hours of energy in a cheaper and longer-lasting way compared to other dispatchable solutions,” the company said. “A stack of 3,700 blocks in our demonstration unit, about the size of a shipping container, stores enough energy to power more than 135 homes for 24 hours.”
Mark Croudace, MGA deputy CEO and chief commercial officer, said there is no shortage of demand for the company’s technology.
“Renewable energy sources come with their limitations, especially when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow,” he said. “Plugging this gap is the reason we exist. MGA Technology is perfectly aligned to generate 24/7 clean steam for harder-to-abate industrial sectors, a rapidly growing very large market domestically and globally.”
The latest funding round attracted support from existing investors including Main Sequence, Varley Holdings, Melt Ventures and New Zealand’s Climate Venture Capital Fund while Understorey Ventures and Australian advisory firm Pollination Group have signed on as new investors.
Pollination CEO Martijn Wilder said MGA’s technology has enormous potential to support the uptake of clean energy in Australia.
“The energy transition for the country’s heavy industry to clean energy is a huge challenge and one that requires us to rethink the way we store energy,” he said. “MGA Thermal provides on-demand zero carbon heat which can decarbonise many industrial uses as well as provide clean electricity generation.”

Solar PV may represent the main pillar of Israel’s electrical system in 2050, especially if combined with energy storage and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies.
This is the main conclusion of new research from Afeka Tel-Aviv Academic College of Engineering that expects PV to cover at least three-quarters of the country’s electricity demand by the end of the first half of the century.
In the study “The potential of renewable electricity in isolated grids: The case of Israel in 2050,” published in Applied Energy, the research team estimated that Israel may offer a total area of 1,129 km2 for solar energy deployment, most of which is located in the Galil Golan and the Negev regions.
The research did not include an economic assessment of the potential transition, stating uncertainties regarding cost evaluations as well as micro and macro-level developments. Gur Mittelman, the corresponding author, highlighted macro-level variability as the main reason for avoiding an economic analysis.
“From the state’s point of view, the transition to renewables is far exceeding the scope of the energy economy,” Mittelman told pv magazine.  “This fundamental observation is missed by many researchers who only try to compare the fossil electricity cost versus the costs of renewable energy plus storage”.
Available land for PV
This availabe surface, according to the scientists, offers the technical potential for deploying 172.5 GW of photovoltaics, of which 132.1 GW may come from conventional installations, and 40 GW may be from agrivoltaics. If deployed, this huge amount of solar power would require energy storage with a combined capacity of 500 GWh. Intensive storage capacity would be required to compensate for the intermittent nature of solar energy. “Peak demand in Israel usually occurs in the evening,” they said.
They also estimated the country’s total electric demand for the year 2050, including electromobility, at 183.3 TWh and considered vehicle-to-grid (V2G) as a major source of storage. “In the V2G concept, the battery cost is actually embedded, or sunk,” Mittelman added. “There is a need for smart charging stations infrastructure, which are expected to be developed anyway as more and more electric vehicles are predicted to enter the market”.
Electromobility
The team assumed Israel may have 7 million electric vehicles (EVs) circulating in 2050, of which 6.6 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and 0.4 million plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), with their respective battery sizes being 75 kWh and 15 kWh, which in turn would result in a theoretical V2G capacity of 501 GWh.
It calculated an annual mileage of 16,200 km for the private sector and a fuel economy of 180 and 200 Wh/km for BEVs and
PHEVs, respectively, with annual demand in the private sector being 20.5 TWh, and 22.7 TW with the addition of public EVs.
Scenarios
The study predicts under its “more realistic” scenario that 80% of Israel’s 2050 electrical mix could be based on renewable energy, with around 57.6% being covered by conventional solar PV and 17.6% by agrivoltaic solutions. The remaining minimal share of renewables would be covered by wind, sea wave energy and other minor sources. Solar would use only half of the area available for deployment and the total energy storage capacity needed would amount to 216 GWh.
The most optimistic and less likely scenario provided by the study predicts solar may reach an 88% share of the country’s electricity mix by 2050, with the storage capacity reaching its maximum potential of 500 GWh.
Another mid-term scenario also projects that solar may reach a 47% share by 2030, with storage capacity reaching 60 GWh.
“To our best knowledge, several energy resources, such as agrivoltaics and sea waves in Israel, were analyzed in detail for the first time,” the scientists concluded, referring to the novelty of their work. “Thus, the current work could be referred as a roadmap for the future Israeli electricity sector. “
