https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/24/round-the-clock-tenders-can-help-india-meet-the-increasing-demand-for-firm-renewable-power/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",Round-the-clock tenders can help India meet demand for firm renewable power,"A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) thinktank, and consultant JMK Research, has highlighted the role mixes of different electricity generation sources and storage can play in overcoming the intermittency challenge of variable renewables, such as solar and wind, to ensure grid stability.
Clean power blended with either conventional, fossil fuel-fired thermal plants with low load factors, or renewables plus energy storage systems can provide the firm, round-the-clock power needed by electricity distribution companies, according to the report.
“There is increasing emphasis on [the] firming of VRE [variable renewable energy]-integrated power,” said Jyoti Gulia, lead author of the report and the founder of Haryana-based JMK Research. “This will be even more the case now that India has pledged, at COP26, to install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity, and to meet 50% of energy requirements from renewables by 2030,” she added, referring to the pledge made by the government at the recent climate change summit held in Glasgow. “In India, we have seen renewable energy tenders evolve from plain vanilla solar or wind, to hybrid, to assured peak power, to round-the-clock.”
Utilities are now driving a new set of tenders to manage their 24-hour power supply requirements with renewable energy sources that meet 80-85% annual capacity utilization factor (CUF) conditions during peak and off-peak hours, added Gulia.
The report, co-written by Vibhuti Garg, energy economist and India lead at Cleveland-based IEEFA; and JMK research associate Akhil Thayillam, examined the key conditions of the two round-the-clock tenders held by state body the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
The study points out the term “round-the-clock” may be misleading as successful projects in the two procurement exercises are required to provide a CUF of at least 80% and 85%. The CUF is the volume of electricity actually generated by the power plants in a year, expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible output, under ideal conditions.
Having modeled the generation and storage technologies available, the authors of the study concluded a renewables-plus-fossil fuel mix could be most effective to meet the needs of the SECI tenders.
“Growth in new thermal power capacity is neither viable nor sustainable,” said Garg. “The thermal power sector in India is already grappling with numerous stranded coal-based assets and an increasing amount of coal capacity that is being left idle. Bundling renewable energy with electricity generated in coal-based plants that have low PLFs [plant load factors, an indication of how often power plants generate at full output] to provide firm RTC [round-the-clock] power is one way to make use of some of this idle capacity.”
Garg said the government recently issued guidelines which enable fossil fuel-based energy to be replaced by renewables under existing power purchase agreements (PPAs). 
“As part of this change, thermal power generation companies are allowed to set up renewable energy generation capacity, either by themselves or through other renewable developers, by open bids, and [can] supply the electricity generated to consumers under their PPAs.”
In the longer term, as the cost of batteries continues to decline, the authors of the study said battery energy storage systems are likely to become the most viable option for providing critical, non-intermittent power.
The report stated India needs time-based incentives to better match renewable energy supply to demand. Looking at the different approaches to demand-based power supply which have been applied in countries such as the U.S., Germany, and Chile can help India find a path forward.
To further enhance grid balancing, India could also explore options beyond the physical aggregation of generation resources and storage technologies, such as virtual power plants – cloud-based networks of grid-integrated generation and storage assets.
“To make round-the-clock a reality in India,” said Gulia, “the renewable energy industry needs to work alongside policymakers, investors and other stakeholders to provide cost-effective power procurement models that target grid [imbalances], along with [aiming for the] improvement of capacity utilization and reliability of power infrastructure.”

Tata Power’s solar arm is nearing a deal with the Tamil Nadu government for its proposed 4GW integrated solar photovoltaic cell manufacturing unit in the State, going by a Times of India report that said negotiations are in an advanced stage. The daily newspaper reported Tata Power solar fab will likely come up in Gangaikondan near Tirunelveli.
“The investment by Tata would be around Rs 3,000 crore (US$403 million) with an employment potential of 2,000 locals,” Times of India quoted Tamil Nadu government sources.
Tata Power Solar had placed a bid for 4 GW manufacturing capacity under the government’s production-linked incentive and has been put under the waiting list following the auction which saw Jindal India Solar, Shirdi Sai Electricals, and Reliance New Energy Solar emerge as beneficiaries through the allotment on bucket filling basis.
The waiting list will likely be cleared following the same bucket filling method, with the government approving the expansion of financial outlay under the PLI Scheme from INR 4,500 crore (US$604.25 million) to INR 24,000 crore (US$3,222.67 million).
Currently, Tata Power Solar has a solar cell and module manufacturing facility in Bengaluru. In April this year, it announced the expansion of the existing fab with the addition of new lines capable of producing high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC (passivated emitter rear contact) modules. With this, Tata Power Solar reached aggregate capacity of 530 MW for cells and 580 MW modules. 
Tata Power’s latest investment news follows Vikram Solar’s plans to have a 4.3 GW backward integrated solar module manufacturing facility in the state in the next five years. Out of this, it has already launched operations for an annual module capacity of 1.3 GW at Indospace Industrial Park in Chennai. The 3 GW addition will be aimed at backward integration and will include cell and wafer capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/24/uk-business-claims-to-offer-worlds-most-sustainable-lithium-ion-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MAX HALL,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",UK business claims to offer ‘world’s most sustainable lithium-ion battery’,"From pv magazine International
An advanced-battery company based in the West Midlands of England claims to have developed “the most sustainable, low-waste lithium-ion battery in the world.”
Aceleron says its “compression technology method” has enabled it to produce products in which every component can be accessed for repair, replacement or upgrade. The company claims its ‘Essential’ product is fully recycable, effectively giving the device an “infinite lifespan,” according to co-founder and chief technical officer Carlton Cummins.
Cummins said the Essential is the same size as a group-31 device – 330 by 173 by 240mm – and weighs around half as much as a traditional battery, with the company website listing a 15kg figure for the 12 V/100 Amp-hour (Ah); 24 V/50 Ah; and 48 V/25 Ah products listed on its website.
The developer states the Essential offers “up to” four times the cycle life and three times more continuous power than equivalent lead-acid devices.
The company says the modular design of the Essential means it can be used in series to power applications ranging from onboard motor home systems up to providing an uninterrupted power supply for data centers.
“As technology evolves, we have the ability to upgrade individual components without the need to discard the entire battery, staying true to our company ethos of promoting reuse and re-manufacture over waste, contributing to the increasingly crucial circular economy,” added Cummins.
That circular manufacturing approach has also been used in the Bromsgrove-based business’ new residential product, the Offgen, which Aceleron claims can offer storage capacity ranging from 4-11 kWh, thanks to its modular design.
The fact each battery pack in the residential system can be upgraded adds value to the investment, according to the developer, which said its home storage product can be installed in one electrical-grade cabinet which contains the device or devices, a hybrid inverter, a communications interface, and the switchgear.
The company founder with a flair for an eye-catching quote said of the residential system: “A house lasts for many decades and we believe your battery system should too.”
This copy was amended on 22/11/21 to reflect the fact Aceleron, formerly based in Birmingham, has moved its headquarters to Bromsgrove.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/24/detergent-for-solar-module-cleaning-and-protection/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PV MODULE CLEANER,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 24, 2021",Detergent for solar module cleaning and protection,"From pv magazine International
Portuguese start-up ChemiTek has raised €1.2 million in a funding round that saw the participation of Portugal-based investment firms Ganexa Capital, Statusmaneuver, and EDP Ventures, the venture capital arm of national utility EDP.
“It is an investment to expand our reach in the international market, for the enhancement of our sustainable solutions, especially in the solar sector and for new hires,” said ChemiTek CEO César Martins.
The company specializes in the production of a detergent product for cleaning and antistatic protection for photovoltaic modules, solar tiles and solar thermal panels. “Solar Wash Protect is applied by the installers of photovoltaic plants, by solar panel cleaning companies, and solar parks with their own maintenance teams,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “In the case of private individuals, the liquid is purchased by the PV system provider.”
According to the manufacturer, the detergent removes all kinds of organic dirt, such as bird droppings, sand, dust, pollen, and resin from the modules and, at the same time, thanks to its antistatic properties, it reduces the adhesion of dust to the glass, keeping panels cleaner between cleaning cycles. “It also reduces water consumption by about 50% and increases energy production by up to 5%,” the spokesperson went on to say. “The first reason that caught the attention of our researchers who created the product was that a dirty solar panel loses energy production capacity and that if you wash it with just water or with conventional products, the energy production is not as great as with our SWP.”
The product must be mixed with water and has to be applied to the modules using a brush or a mop to remove or loosen the dirt. Then the module must be rinsed with water to remove any dispersed dirt or excess of product left on the panels. The remaining water can be left to dry or be removed with a squeegee.
The detergent is available in two versions: the SWP50, with a mixing ratio of 1kg of concentrated product to 50 liters of water; and the SWP300, with a mixing ratio of 1kg of concentrated product to 300 liters of water.
The product was recently certified by the German laboratory TÜV Sud, according to the EN 61215 standard and is also claimed, by the company, to have letters of conformity from 12 of the world’s 15 largest panel manufacturers.
“ChemiTek allows not only to increase the output of solar panels, maximizing the generation of renewable energy, but also to reduce the need for cleaning and maintenance interventions in solar parks, which will be fundamental for us to accelerate the introduction of solar energy in our networks,” said Luís Manuel, executive director of EDP Ventures.
