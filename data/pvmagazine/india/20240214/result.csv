2,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/14/5-ways-to-recycle-li-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RECYCLING,INDIA",,2024-02-14,5 ways to recycle Li-ion batteries,"With India reinforcing its commitment to become a ‘net-zero’ country by 2070, it is enthusiastically embracing innovative approaches to build a sustainable future. In its quest to meet sustainability goals, the country has pledged to become an EV-first nation by 2030, focusing on expediting the transition to clean transportation.
Here, it is important to understand that Li-ion batteries are at the heart of the EV ecosystem. Hence, as the country marches towards deeper penetration of electric vehicles into the market, there is an incessant need to accelerate the manufacturing of Li-ion batteries to meet the rising demand projected in the market. Owing to this, the recycling of Li-ion batteries has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years.
Considering the blowout development of EVs, the disposal of the huge amount of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) brought about by the exhaustion of the life-cycle of LIBs will soon become a huge problem that plagues society.
Recycling end-of-life LIBs can help address this material scarcity by reducing dependence on lithium mining by 25%, and cobalt by 35%. It would also ensure the local availability of recycled critical materials. Lithium has very limited availability on the earth. Therefore, we need to “Look Beyond Mines” and save this precious metal for our next generations.
Battery recycling plays an imperative role in achieving a two-fold purpose. On one hand, it can give the desired impetus to the expansion of the EV industry, on the other hand, it can immensely contribute to curbing the impact on the environment due to the manufacturing of new batteries. Therefore, industry players are invariably working towards upscaling their recycling capacity to be at par with the evolving battery technologies.

To further fortify the recycling of Li-ion batteries, it is very important to closely monitor the external conditions where the temperature and high humidity can immensely meddle with the recycling prospects of the battery. Therefore, to ensure effective recycling of Li-ion batteries, industry players should install dehumidifiers to curb the moisture menace throughout the process.
Cathode dismantling forms an intricate part of battery recycling. To initiate the process, NMP is used as an important organic solvent to facilitate the recovery of the metal. But in the presence of moisture, NMP becomes inherently hazardous which can severely impact the environment and give rise to serious health issues like cancer. At the same time, during the dismantling process, hydroxide is released, which, on coming in contact with moisture, creates hydrogen. Understanding that hydrogen is highly inflammable in nature, even a small spark can trigger blasting of the space.
Furthermore, weather condition disruption can deteriorate the powder form of extracted components via humidification and/or oxidation through moisture in the air. This will finally affect the quality of recycled metals. Therefore, deploying desiccant dehumidifiers is essential to conduct battery recycling in a highly controlled environment.
Deciphering the importance of Li-ion battery recycling, let’s look at the different ways to recycle batteries.
Hydrometallurgy is majorly involved in breaking down the battery into powder of black mass. It is an extractive metallurgy process that uses aqueous solutions to recover metals. The technique chemically dissolves or leaches materials to extract metals by means of precipitation or electrically reducing the metals. The process is followed by leaching with acid to extract metal in an aqueous solution. The solution is then purified and refined to concentrate and separate metals from the materials.
Pyrometallurgy employs heating and smelting operations to perform the separation of the metal. It melts the materials used to extract metals. In such processes, a high temperature is maintained to enable oxidation and reduction reactions for initiating the reduction of metal from oxides. The method involves calcination where lithium is extracted by burning batteries. The ashes produced as a result are further removed in the subsequent processes.
There is an alternate method as well, in which roasting, or oxidation roasting is done where a reaction with metal-bearing components is carried out for transformation to metal oxides that can be later dissolved and extracted by leaching. Here, crushing and grounding are done before leaching out oxidized base metals that leave behind a residue that is rich in precious metal.
This is a physical process where different components of the black mass are separated with the help of gravity separation. This is an efficient method for recovering separated materials, that too without causing any chemical changes. In the process, it enables recovery of cathode material which can be used with minimal treatment.
The method employs electrodialysis to transport dissociated ions across semi-selective ion-exchange membrane pairs that are placed between two electrodes. Here, the primary electrodialysis cell is made up of anion-and cation-exchange membrane that is separated by a partition allowing the free flow of solutions. The diffusion of cations through the cation exchange membrane towards a negatively charged cathode accumulates in the anion exchange membrane. In turn, developing valence or size-selective ion exchange membranes helps in recovering valuable metals of smaller size.
Carbothermal reduction is used as an alternative to overcome technical demerits in the pyrometallurgical process. The method recovers metal by using graphite as a reductant in the carbothermal reaction. It promotes the formation of metal rather than enabling conversion to metal oxides. This immensely increases the recovery yield of metals.

6,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/14/electrolyzer-manufacturing-capacity-could-outpace-demand-by-2030/,"ELECTROLYZER,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,2024-02-14,Global electrolyzer manufacturing capacity could outpace demand by 2030,"From pv magazine USA
Global electrolyzer manufacturing capacity could outstrip demand by two times by the end of a decade, according to a new report from Clean Energy Associates.
The report, which looks at the technology trends and policy impacts in the green hydrogen space, forecasts that global manufacturing capacity for green hydrogen will touch 54 GW by 2027. China is likely to account for almost half of that global capacity, and when combined with North America and Europe, will reflect some 93% of the electrolyzer capacity global market share, its authors noted. The country currently accounts for 61% of manufacturing capacity across the world, due in part to a complete supply chain and relatively low costs.
However, especially given the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and the policy support that provides the green hydrogen sector, North American manufacturing capacity is also set to rapidly grow, the report noted.
While hydrogen can be made using multiple raw materials, including coal and natural gas, green hydrogen – that is, hydrogen produced with renewables – has increasingly become a priority for the U.S. as a potentially critical part of the clean energy transition. Green hydrogen is made by electrolyzing water using renewable energy like wind or solar.
The report also compared different electrolyzer technologies, including alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM). It estimates that alkaline electrolyzers, which are largely clustered in China and Europe, will remain the most prevalent technology over the next decade, thanks in part to lower costs and the potential for efficiency improvements. PEM electrolyzers, meanwhile, are manufactured more globally but depend on electrodes that use rare materials, which could be a potential challenge.
While the report estimated that electrolyzer manufacturing capacity could outpace demand by 2030, it also noted that the actual usable capacity is likely to be less than nameplate capacity.
“The forecasted electrolyzer demand is highly uncertain, as it can be affected by policy implementation, downstream industry developments, low-cost renewable energy availability and operation of existing projects,” the report said.
The industry as a whole has been focusing on the issue of ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity. One of the key challenges it faces in doing so is accessing the necessary capital – however, a couple of announcements last year indicate that trend could be changing. For instance, Verdagy revealed plans to open a new plant in Newark, California, early this year to build large volumes of advanced water electrolyzers.
Electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen, meanwhile, completed an oversubscribed $380 million Series C financing. The company is building a 1.2 GW facility to produce commercial electrolyzer systems in Devens, Massachusetts, with deliveries expected later this year.
Some experts are also looking at alternatives to the rare materials used in PEM electrolyzer technology – like clean chemistry company Mattiq, which announced in October that it is developing a portfolio of alternatives to iridium, one of those materials. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the current iridium production levels could support manufacturing some 3 GW to 7.5 GW of electrolyzers every year. Mattiq, however, is looking at alternative catalysts that could be used in these electrolyzers instead.

A team of researchers from Nanjing University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill published a review of single-junction perovskite PV commercialization progress. They assessed the feasibility of commercialization based on the three pillars of efficiency, stability, and cost. Assessments of carbon footprints and potential for recycling were also carried out.
The research group sees the stability issue as the most pressing one. “It is closely followed by the need to improve large area film processing,” lead author Pengchen Zhu told pv magazine.
The team began with establishing device area size criteria for terms like “cell” or “module.” Size matters when it comes to discussions of commercialization readiness. Research cells or lab-sized cells are the smallest, named “small cells”. They measure less than 1 cm2. Next in size are “cells” measuring from 1 cm2 to 10 cm2.  A “large module” is considered to be over 14000 cm2. In between are minimodules, submodules, small modules, and standard modules.
Then the academics identified potential applications and the critical commercialization challenges. Furthermore, they reviewed the work being done to overcome the challenges, including strategies to fabricate high-quality films over a large area, and further improve power conversion efficiency and stability.
The group also discussed at length encapsulation methods and materials, scalable deposition methods, and strategies to improve film quality and cost evolution. “Some of the most surprising findings of the review are in the cost analysis and life cycle assessments,” said Zhu. The team evaluated cost reduction scenarios, including comparisons and projections on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for perovskite-silicon tandem modules.
“We talk about the environmental impact, including toxicity issues, and resource demand in this section, proposing some recycling strategies to reduce this negative impact,” said Zhu, referring to calculations of energy payback, carbon footprints, and comparisons with conventional PV modules.
The study also includes summaries of the commercialization status of several manufacturers, such as Europe-based Saule Technologies and Solaronix, Japan’s Panasonic and Toshiba, along with China-based perovskite manufacturing companies Utmolight, Wonder Solar, Kunshan GCL, and Microquanta.
When asked about how the PV industry could accelerate the commercialization of the perovskite technology, Zhu suggested that closer cooperation between academia and industry in key areas could make a difference. For example, by providing the latest modified-polyolefin and butyl rubber products for encapsulation research, while cell manufacturers could provide customized bottom silicon cells.
Manufacturers could share non-confidential processing data with perovskite researchers, which would help with research into fabricating large modules, enabling early input from equipment and materials suppliers.
Looking ahead Zhu expects the perovskite research community to continue to enhance device stability, with a focus on real-life conditions to understand and solve issues related to things like thermal, light, and moisture exposure.
Their review was presented in the paper “Toward the Commercialization of Perovskite Solar Modules,” published in Advanced Materials. The initiative can be seen as complementary to the perovskite-silicon tandem-oriented commercialization review recently published by a team from Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).
