TPREL will set up a 3.125 MW captive solar plant in Himayatnagar of Maharashtra to power society with clean energy. It will undertake the construction, operation, and maintenance of this captive solar power plant, which is expected to generate about 7.5 million units (MUs) of electricity and offset 6.15 metric tonnes of CO2 in the first year itself.
The project is scheduled for commissioning by October and will provide green power at approximately 40% less price than the existing tariff to Vivarea Condominium.
With the installation of this group captive solar plant, Vivarea Condominium will become India’s first residential society to use captive solar energy for domestic usage.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/11/india-to-add-45-gw-of-corporate-renewables-over-five-years/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 11, 2023",India to add 45 GW of corporate renewables over five years,"A new report by Bridge To India says renewables installation for corporate offtake will grow at 22% annually over the next five years to add a total of 45 GW by 2027.
Open access (OA) and rooftop solar will continue to be the dominant sources of renewable power for corporate consumers.
“Renewable energy certificates (RECs) have had a complex trading history because of frequent and unclear regulatory provisions. Further, corporates are not keen to incur extra costs for renewable power obligation (RPO) compliance. Green power trading on the exchange commenced in August 2020 but the volumes are very small due to limited availability of untied capacity,” said the analysts.

The report estimates India has installed 16,099 MW of overall renewables capacity for offtake through open access and 8,269 MW of C&I rooftop solar as of September 2022.
Open access is a mechanism under which consumers can buy electricity directly from power producers, rather than electricity distribution companies (discoms).
“Utility-scale private-sector developers are bullish on the open-access market primarily to diversify offtake risk away from state Discoms. Most of them have exited the rooftop solar business due to small scale and intensive management effort,” said the analysts.
The analysts expect the new RE capacity addition for corporate offtake to remain geographically concentrated.
“Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka remain the most attractive markets. Under-penetrated markets in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh are also expected to see more growth. Other states like Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Punjab with a history of regressive policy actions are expected to see limited growth but could open up with favorable policies,” according to the analysts.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/01/11/trina-solar-starts-producing-210-mm-n-type-topcon-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 11, 2023",Trina Solar starts producing 210 mm n-type TOPCon solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
Trina Solar has started producing n-type i-TOPCon solar cells in its factory in Suqian, in China’s Jiangsu province. It will use the cells, which are based on 210 mm wafers, to produce the new generation of its Vertex N solar modules for commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications. It says the new line will have power outputs ranging up to 605 W, and an efficiency of up to 22.4%.
“Benefiting from the innovative cell size and low-voltage, the Vertex N 605W modules are perfectly fit for 104-meter-long trackers, with no waste of space,” Trina Solar said in a statement. “Six to 12 more 605W modules can be connected on the trackers than is the case with conventional n-type 72-cell and 78-cell modules.”
The new factory is another step in Trina Solar’s focus on n-type technology.
“As p-type PERC approaches its efficiency limits, it is critical that production of n-type cells, which began to be commercialized last year, be stepped up,” it said.
Trina Solar expects its 210mm n-type technology module capacity to reach 30 GW this year. It started building the Suqian facility in July 2022 and installed the manufacturing equipment at the end of November. In August 2022, the company achieved a 24.24% efficiency record for a 210 mm n-type i-TOPCon solar cell.

JinkoSolar has unveiled three new n-type solar module variants featuring tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology.
The new Tiger Neo Series includes 54-cell products with power outputs of up to 445 W and a maximum efficiency of 22.27%. The 72-cell panels in the line have a nominal power rating of 615 W and an efficiency rating of up to 23.23%. The line also includes larger 635 W modules with maximum efficiencies of 22.72%.
All of the products are based on 182 mm wafers, as with previous Tiger Neo products. JinkoSolar said that all of the panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.29% C and a bifaciality factor of 85%. They also feature a short circuit current of 13.93 A.
The new products come with a 15-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty. Degradation for the first year is reportedly 1% and linear degradation is 0.4%.
“We are once again raising the standard of N-type performance with the latest generation of our Tiger Neo panels, which deliver better system performance – even through the most demanding conditions,” said the company’s CMO, Gener Miao, without providing additional technical details.
