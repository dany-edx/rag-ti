These EV charging stations use ATUM integrated solar roof, enabling the entire electric vehicle charging proposition to transition to 100% solar. ATUM Charge will supply power wherever required and since the process is decentralised, it is less draining on the grid.
ATUM Charge has deployed these EV charging stations in Maharashtra (36), Tamil Nadu (44), Telangana (48), Andhra Pradesh (23), Karnataka (23), Uttar Pradesh (15), Haryana (14), Odisha (24) and West Bengal (23).
“The locations were chosen with the company’s strategy of focusing on Tier 1 and Tier 2 towns and cities in mind, as well as the encouraging rate of EV adoption in these states in mind,” stated the company.
In the coming months, ATUM Charge plans to expand into additional cities and states.
Each ATUM Charge EV Charging Station requires approximately 200 square feet and takes about a week to install. The cost of each station varies depending on the available area.
Vamsi Gaddam, founder of ATUM Charge, said, “With the launch of 250 ATUM Charge EV charging stations, we have renewed our pledge to support the EV ecosystem in India. EVs are a necessity because they help save the environment from harmful emissions while also reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and lowering our fuel costs. What makes ATUM Charge truly unique is that it is powered by ATUM – the world’s first electricity generating solar roof. The steady phasing out of thermal power stations and replacing them with solar powered stations is our end goal. We aim for zero emissions, net zero facilities, a sustainable network, and a greener forever. Change has begun and the wheel is ours to steer.”
ATUM Charge has currently installed 4kW capacity panels that can charge up to 10-12 vehicles (2/3/4 wheeler) per day, given that any EV today takes 6-8 hours to charge fully. The company will install an additional 6kW capacity, allowing it to charge 25-30 vehicles per day.
ATUM Charge is also partnering with various other charging station owners to supply them with ATUM solar roof.
ATUM Charge stations are fabricated using Vnext boards – a range of fibre cement boards which are excellent eco-friendly alternatives to gypsum, wood, and plywood.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/04/05/tata-power-commissions-160mw-ac-solar-project-for-ntpc/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 5, 2022",Tata Power commissions 160MW AC solar project for NTPC,"Tata Power Solar Systems Limited (Tata Power Solar), a solar manufacturing and EPC arm of Tata Power, today announced it has commissioned a 160MW AC solar project at Jetsar in Rajasthan.
The project was won by state-run power producer NTPC under tariff-based competitive bidding conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India in 2019. Tata Power Solar System developed the project for NTPC under the EPC model.
The installation uses around 6,75,000 monocrystalline PV modules and is expected to produce 387 million units of energy per year.
“The Jetsar project was completed within a period of 15 months, which is a testament to Tata Power Solar’s exceptional project execution capabilities. The project engineers worked under tough climatic conditions, including the movement of men and machinery to the project site,” Tata Power stated.
Tata Power Solar’s project scope included engineering, design, supply, construction, erection,
testing, operations and maintenance, and commissioning.
Founded in 1989, Tata Power Solar was originally formed as a joint venture between Tata Power and British Petroleum Solar (BP Solar). Headquartered in Bangalore, it now operates independently as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power.
Tata Power Solar is one of the largest solar manufacturers in India, with a production capacity of 580MW of modules and 530MW cells. It has a portfolio of more than 8.3GW of ground-mount utility-scale, over 950MW of rooftop and distributed generation projects across the country, and has installed over 65,000 solar water pumps in India.

Manila-based AC Energy said it will also focus on solar development in Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Laos. It wants to go forward with late-stage projects with ib vogt and plans to invest $200 million in equity, in addition to debt funding. They plan to build 1GW capacity under their new partnership.
In Bangladesh, ib vogt is now working on a 50 MW solar project in Feni district, Bangladesh. The German developer is still trying to secure land for the PV array amid an ongoing dispute over land ownership, according to officials.
The government will buy electricity from the project at a rate of $0.1094/kWh over 20 years.
“ACEN has a strong history of partnering with best-in-class energy developers to build renewable energy projects across the Asia-Pacific region,” said ACEN Renewables International President and COO Patrice Clausse. “Ib vogt has a proven track record of developing solar projects across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and we are very excited to partner with ib vogt.”
