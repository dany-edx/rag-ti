https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/30/challenges-in-land-acquisition-for-solar-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"MARCH 30, 2022",Challenges in land acquisition for solar projects,"It has become increasingly critical to integrate a highly technological-backed infrastructure to generate solar power and meet high energy demands. India drives the energy sector’s growth at a global level on account of being one of the most affordable producers of solar energy worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue to fall, the country recognizes the advantages of installing solar power systems over running coal-fired plants. 
One of the primary challenges that renewable energy projects such as solar and wind parks face is the need for land. Private players are generally prohibited from acquiring large tracts of land in rural areas due to the existence of state land-ceiling laws. Hence, there are systematic measures that address these gaps in land allotment for large-scale solar and wind projects towards a more sustainable response to the exponential rise in renewable investments.
Scaling up India’s ambitious climate change agenda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized how India will increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW and meet 50% of its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Under his leadership and the various schemes and incentives laid down by the Central government, we are seeing a rapid push towards renewable energy power generation in India. 
It would be crucial to point out here that just the solar sector accounts for 60% (280GW) of India’s promised 500GW by 2030. Therefore, 25GW of solar capacity must be installed each year to meet the said target. There are ongoing efforts and policies to install solar rooftops on public buildings, airports, railway networks, educational institutions, residential sectors, and commercial complexes. Nonetheless, the Indian solar sector faces several challenges in developing and managing large-scale solar facilities.
Some of the major challenges faced by solar developers in India during land acquisitions include:
1. Connectivity for evacuating power generated: The bidding process for solar plants favors the company that owns at least half of the land required for the size of the connectivity. This presents two serious challenges: first, securing the land before winning the bid becomes a capital cost for the investor, and second, winning a bid without a land bank becomes an uphill challenge when it comes to land acquisition. The state government does not play a proactive role and usually takes a back seat in these transactions and usually acts as a third party during the process of companies seeking evacuation at state GSS. Our solar policy needs a transparent and uniform push from the center due to the lack of a uniform solar policy across states.
2. Attaining environmental and local clearance from authorities: When it comes to obtaining a land parcel for a solar plant, there are numerous legalities to consider. The land is governed by various issues of environment, wildlife, legal title, ceiling limit, SEBI monitored assets of PACL, government land allotment, state laws on ancestral property sale, khatedari rights, and more. The never-ending conflict between conservationists and land seekers is unavoidable, and this challenge continues to remain to date. 
3. Right of way (ROW) for the transmission line: Studying land laws and shortlisting potential sites gives a head start on the solar project. This is followed by a geotechnical survey, revenue road and bypassing land analysis, and a low-tension transmission line. Connecting the switchyard to the State Transmission Utility (STU) and Central Transmission Utility (CTU) is the most difficult ROW challenge. A 20-kilometer power line requires at least 67-70 towers, which requires approvals from various government and private agencies and local body authorities, further creating an even greater challenge for the industry.
4. Overlap of land record: While getting the sale deed registered in the company’s name is one aspect, getting the actual possession of the land parcel is another challenge. Another major issue in land acquisition is figuring out which land belongs to which village. 
Different records maintained by adjoining villages lead to an overlap of land records between the villages. Constant redrawing of village boundaries, coupled with non-digitized property paper records, leads to the overlap. Reaching an amicable solution between villages requires a team of all patwaris (including the present one and the past ones) under the command of the district collector to ensure that the land quantum registered is correct and readily available. There are many layers involved, which include dealing with local tehsildar, sub-divisional magistrate, and local patwari who get involved to effectively get the land demarcation process accomplished. 
5. Lack of technology or digitalization: One of the significant challenges is the lack of technology or digitalization solution. The multiple records and information are available across various departments including online and offline. Problems like threat to the Great Indian Bustard habitat, colonization, stress on common water resources such as Indira Gandhi Canal Project, forest, environment, PACL, and others must be effectively clubbed into a singular platform for efficiency and speedy land record checks and acquisitions. 
The aforementioned factors lead us to the inevitable conclusion that land acquisition continues to be a significant challenge for solar developers in India. While the Central and the State Governments have taken several proactive steps to make it easier for solar developers to acquire land for their projects, land aggregation remains the single biggest roadblock in implementing large-scale projects, resulting in a slowdown in the industry.
Datta Infra is a leading land aggregator and land development player across India, catering to the growing demand of the country’s top renewable corporations. It has successfully delivered and is spearheading some crucial projects ranging from land consolidation to providing transmission and connectivity solutions to players like Tata Power, SunSource Energy and NTPC.

A team of researchers from The University of Queensland (UQ) has designed an atomic-thin cathode material that reduces corrosion in lithium-ion batteries and has demonstrated improved high-voltage cycling stability with capacity retention of almost 80% after 1,000 cycles.
Prof. Lianzhou Wang said he and his team from the School of Chemical Engineering and Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) have demonstrated a rechargeable lithium-ion battery which remains stable for more than 1,000 cycles.
“We’ve designed a uniquely-grown atomic-thin functional layer on the surface of a high-voltage cathode, which is the source of lithium ions and a critical aspect that limits the cycle life in a battery,” he said. “This new approach features a minimal protective coating at a scalable process, paving the way for the deployment of these abundant high-voltage materials for next generation high energy batteries.”
Wang said corrosion in one form or another is the primary reason that batteries degrade but the new process would increase the life-span of batteries in everything from smart phones to electric vehicles (EVs).
The new technology involves the application of an epitaxially-engineered wetting layer on a lithium nickel manganese oxide (LNMO) cathode material. The research team said the atomic-thin wetting layer offers long-term suppression of the transition metal dissolution from the cathode without impacting its dynamics.
Wang said when tested in full lithium-ion coin cell configuration the coated LNMO, in combination with a graphite anode and a non-aqueous electrolyte solution, enables a capacity retention of about 77% after 1,000 cycles at 290mAg−1 and a final discharge capacity of about 80mAhg−1 with an average coulombic efficiency (CE) >99%.
Wang said with industry under increasing pressure to decarbonise, the development of lithium-ion batteries of lower cost, higher energy density and longer cycle life is vitally important.
“We’re confident the nanotechnology will have widespread applications across industry, including in consumer electronics, electric vehicles and the energy storage sector,” he said.
Dr Rosalind Gummow, technical specialist with Brisbane-based company VSPC, which is focused on developing and commercialising advanced cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, welcomed the development.
“New methods like the use of epitaxial surface layers to improve the cycling efficiency and cycle life of high-voltage cathodes are vital in the quest to improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries,” she said. “The methods developed here also have potential to stabilise other cathode materials that degrade rapidly with cycling.”
The scientists explained their findings in “Epitaxial growth of an atom-thin layer on a LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode for stable Li-ion battery cycling,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/30/world-will-need-5-2tw-of-solar-this-decade-to-avoid-climate-breakdown/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 30, 2022",World will need 5.2TW of solar this decade to avoid climate breakdown,"From pv magazine Global
The world will need 5.2TW of solar power generation capacity by 2030, and 14TW by mid century, to have any chance of limiting global average temperature rises this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) said today.
The Abu Dhabi-based international body launched the latest edition of its World Energy Transitions Outlook report at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue event and director-general Francesco La Camera, writing the foreword, spelled out: “Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate.”
The world will have to install 450GW of new solar capacity each year – most of it utility scale – for the rest of this decade, with China and India to lead Asia to a roughly half share of the world’s installed PV capacity in 2030, the report’s authors estimated.
Elsewhere, North America will need to install 90GW per year of solar to claim a 14% share of the world’s operating panels at the end of the decade, and Europe’s 19% slice of the pie will require 55GW of annual solar capacity additions.
European funding will also help North Africa make its contribution to the 70GW of annual solar capacity additions which will be required across the Middle East and Africa with European energy demand ensuring grid connections with North Africa flourish.
To have a hope of avoiding the worst effects of climate change, Latin America will need 20GW of new solar annually this decade and a further “more than 2GW” will be needed each year across the Oceania and Pacific region, the Irena report estimated.
Of course, it is not just solar that the world needs and, with the 348-page report calling for massive electrification and energy efficiency efforts, enabled by the full suite of clean energy sources, hydrogen, and biomass, we will have to start devoting $5.7 trillion per year to the energy transition for the rest of the decade, according to Irena.
That can be feasible if the $700 billion per year channeled into fossil fuels is immediately diverted to the transition, the publication stated. Public investment in the transition will have to immediately double, too, said Irena, to attract the remaining money needed from the private sector, which would bear most of the financial burden.
In return for the investment sought – including to ensure there are 147 million electric vehicles (EVs) per year hitting the roads in 2050, that $131 billion is invested annually in EV charging by that point, and that 350GW of green hydrogen electrolyzers are operating as early as 2030 – the world can anticipate a jobs dividend.
Irena has estimated the 12 million job losses it anticipates in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries will be comfortably outweighed by “close to” 85 million new energy-transition roles this decade, including 26.5 million in clean energy.
It is all a matter of political will, Irena pointed out, with policymakers also needing to usher in sufficient international grid connections and flexibility; training; utility scale batteries; electricity demand-side management; digital tools; peer-to-peer power trading; community ownership of renewables; time-of-use energy tariffs; and net billing systems.
