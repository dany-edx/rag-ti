Saatvik’s product portfolio includes mono PERC, bifacial, and polycrystalline solar PV modules now certified by the PV Cycle to reduce waste and safeguard the environment.  
PV Cycle issues PV Cycle certification for manufacturers becoming part of its recycling scheme that offers collective and tailor-made waste management and legal compliance services for companies and waste holders worldwide. The organization promotes and supports the global development of sustainable PV waste management and issues the PV Cycle membership to manufacturers. 
PV Cycle operates worldwide for collecting, shipping, recycling, and treating PV panels and other waste flows, providing members and waste holders with the best available techniques without high costs.
“Getting certified by PV Cycle will contribute to a sustainable PV waste management system. Saatvik has always worked on innovative ideas using the most advanced technologies to avoid maximum wastage. Dumping modules in waste harms the environment and requires huge dumping space. With PV Cycle membership, this concern can be now well managed,” said Prashant Mathur, CEO of Saatvik.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/07/leading-re-companies-receivables-period-to-shrink-20-this-fiscal/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",Leading RE companies’ receivables period to shrink 20% this fiscal ,"The receivables period for leading renewable energy (RE) companies is set to reduce a fifth from 180 days a year ago to 140 days as of March 2023, a level last visible pre-covid. Two-thirds of the improvement will be because of increased offtake by central counterparties. The rest will be due to state-owned electricity distribution companies (discoms) implementing the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) scheme, according to a new report by CRISIL. 
The incremental cash flow will allow RE companies to build capacity for growth and reduce leverage, added the report. 
CRISIL estimates are based on an assessment of ten leading RE companies in its Ratings portfolio, which are expected to build 50-55% of the renewable energy capacity in India in the next two to three fiscals. 
The report notes payment cycles had stretched in the past two fiscals because state discoms in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh (accounting for 23% of the overall capacity exposure) held back payments to RE developers following liquidity crunch or contractual disagreements. This increased the overall receivables cycle for assessed companies by over 10% from the March 2019 level to 180 days as of March 2022.
“Receivable levels could have deteriorated more but for the increase in the proportion of central counterparties (Solar Energy Corporation of India and National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd) to 40% of the operational portfolio in March 2022 from 20% in March 2019. This fiscal, we expect the share of central counterparties in operating RE capacities to rise to 50%, which will improve receivables to 155 days as of March 2023, keeping other things constant,” says Manish Gupta, senior director of CRISIL Ratings.
CRISIL expects the central counterparties to maintain their payment track record, given the benefit of diversity, payment security funds, and higher bargaining power because of their scale and flexibilities, such as being beneficiaries in a tripartite agreement between state government, central government, and the Reserve Bank of India. 
Late Payment Surcharge is the interest payable by a discom to a power generator on the amount outstanding after the due date for power procured from it.
“Some states have subscribed to the government’s LPS scheme under which they are to clear past dues of power generating companies and regularise their fresh dues. Under the scheme, Power Finance Corporation/REC Ltd will provide loans to state discoms to help pay off dues of generating companies over a period of 1-4 years. Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, which have subscribed to this scheme, may potentially clear dues worth INR 2,000 crore in fiscal 2023. This will help improve the receivable level of key RE companies by another 15 days,” says Ankit Hakhu, director of CRISIL Ratings.
Confidence remains high in the regularisation of state discom dues, given the penal provisions in the LPS scheme, such as cessation of short-term power access, curtailment on medium- and long-term power access, and additional liabilities for the delay in payments. 
CRISIL says some of the assessed companies have started receiving payments and communication on scheme implementation from select state discoms. The calculations assume these companies will commission 7 GW for central counterparties during fiscal 2023. A delay in implementing these capacities because of the rise in module costs could affect the estimates.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/07/solinteg-launches-new-residential-hybrid-inverter-series/,"INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",Solinteg launches new residential hybrid inverter series,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese inverter maker Solinteg has unveiled a new single-phase hybrid inverter line for residential applications.
It said the Integ M 3-8kW has a modern appearance, advanced performance, easy installation, and stable long-term operation.
“It supports PV input current up to 15 A, which is compatible with all mainstream solar modules in the market to prevent power loss due to the current limit of high-power modules,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
There are seven versions of the inverters, with nominal power ranging from 3 kW to 9 kW, an efficiency rating of 97.6%, and a European efficiency of 97.0%. They measure 534 mm × 418 mm × 210 mm and weigh 27 kg.
The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the MPP voltage range is between 100 V and 550 V. The inverters also feature IP65-rated protection and have cooling systems based on natural convection.
“On the battery side, products with a wide battery voltage range of allow flexible battery capacity configuration,” the spokesperson said. “Furthermore, with a big charge/discharge current of up to 30A, the inverter can charge and discharge the battery in a shorter time with a higher power which can satisfy the higher demand of energy consumption or trading.”
The new product also features 10ms UPS-level switching, which results in an imperceptible speed of power switchover when power outages occur. It can therefore ensure the continuous operation of the uninterrupted load, the manufacturer said.
“From the user’s point of view, the product’s intelligent design such as bidirectional data management of OLED display and APP and WIFI configuration via APP makes the setting, debugging, monitoring, and management of the equipment more convenient,” the spokesperson added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/07/sharp-unveils-black-framed-410-w-half-cut-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",Sharp unveils black-framed 410 W half-cut solar panels,"From pv magazine Global
Sharp has unveiled a new version of the NU-JC410 solar panel, a half-cut monocrystalline PERC product with a 21% efficiency rating and 410 W of power output.
“The lightweight NU-JC410B module is built with a white backsheet and a black frame,” the manufacturer said. “It is suitable for long and short frame side clamping and is designed for residential, small-scale commercial and industrial rooftop installations.”
The IEC61215- and IEC61730-certified panels feature 108 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. They measure 1,722 mm ×1,134 mm ×30 mm and weigh in at 20.7 kg.
The panels can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C. The company offers a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.341% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, said Sharp.
“With the new black-framed half-cut cell NU-JC410B panel, we are expanding our product portfolio with a module for easy handling and installation for residential and small-scale C&I rooftop installations, which offers high performance and reliability,” said Andrew Lee, sales director EMEA for Sharp Energy Solutions Europe. “Based on a customer-driven product concept, we always endeavor to improve the performance and design of PV modules in order to create more value for our customers. The black frame module meets the requirements of design-oriented customers.”
*The article has been amended to reflect that the module’s weight is 20.7 kg and not 21.8 kg as we previously reported.
