Letting developing countries set their own climate agenda as they pursue economic growth is important and will allow them to cut their costs in energy transition by reducing their dependence on external resources.
“It is important to support countries in prioritizing economic growth rather than penalizing them for doing so. By fostering economic development, countries can strengthen their resilience, enhance their capacity to address climate issues, and reduce their dependence on external resources. Without economic growth, countries will find it difficult and will be reluctant to own the climate agenda,” said V. Anantha Nageswaran, chief economic advisor to the Government of India, in his keynote address.
“India is still a developing country and we are yet to reach our peak emissions. The scale of energy requirements cannot be met with renewables alone. Fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in the short term, and we expect them to slowly exit in the medium term as we gradually phase in renewable sources while also addressing the related issues. For example, the intermittency of renewable energy and thus the need for enough battery storage is yet to be figured out as is the huge cost of battery storage at the present juncture, making vast shifts to renewable technologies uncertain.”
The energy transition will be just when it improves the lives of the people, creates employment and increases incomes.
Subhash Kumar, director, ACME Solar Holdings, and former chairman and managing director, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, said, “India has done very well in harnessing solar energy. In biofuels we have done tremendously well as far as economy is concerned but compressed biogas (CBG) is an area that can make a huge difference. Domestically secured compressed biogas (CBG) is not only a solution to the energy but also puts income in the hands of people.”
As regards infrastructure, Kumar said, “Multiple conversions of energy are possible. At the end of the day, energy as molecule or electron should be used at the earliest possible opportunity wherever it is found to be the most appropriate, because there is a huge inefficiency and cost involved in conversion and long-distance supply chains are not at all desirable if there is a local market available.”
For countries like Africa, the lack of infrastructure offers the opportunity of sustainable transition as, unlike the developed world, they need not reinvest in retiring their existing infrastructure and build from scratch new one for clean energy.
Joseph Nganga, Vice President- Africa, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, said, “In Africa we don’t have fully established infrastructure. It’s an opportunity to build the right low-carbon energy from the ground up.”
Nganga cited access to low-cost finance as one of the challenges for energy transition in Africa. Further, economies of scale and hence lower costs are not possible due to the nature of projects. Projects are MW-scale due to smaller grids, unlike in India where GW scale projects are common.  Lack of domestic manufacturing is another challenge.

The ISS ESG rating provides ESG performance assessments for global institutional investors. Drawing from a pool of about 700 standards and industry-specific indicators, it applies around 100 environmental, social, and governance-related indicators for each of its ratings. Ayana was the only Indian company to be rated A (-), apart from the other two European renewable energy firms.
Ayana Renewable Power is backed by the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), British International Investment (BII), and Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF). It offers utility-scale solutions in solar, wind, hybrid, and round-the-clock (RTC) clean energy and is also working on pilot green-hydrogen project. It is currently involved in the development and management of close to 5 GW (AC) of solar, wind and hybrid power projects across several Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. The company targets a 10 GW AC portfolio by 2025.

French hydrogen specialist HDF Energy expects to commission a factory for multi-megawatt fuel cell mass production in summer 2024 in Bordeaux, France.  
“The end of construction of the factory is in January, we need then five months to install the industrial part,” HDF Energy CEO Damien Havard told pv magazine.
The hydrogen fuel cell plant is waiting for support from the European authorities. The facility has been pre-listed as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).
“The European Commission is closing the third wave of IPCEIs. HDF Energy is part of the fourth wave. We hope to reach the final agreement with European authorities in the beginning of 2024,” said Havard. “These subsidies will be used to deploy fuel cells for train and marine markets.”
The company has a diversified strategy. It said it is focused on proposing power-to-power and hydrogen-to-power solutions “worldwide,” in order to supply baseload renewable electricity to grid operators.
In non-EU-countries, it will also be a developer of renewable installations and a producer of green hydrogen infrastructure geared toward the production of low-carbon hydrogen.
“We will be our own first clients,” said Havard.
Havard noted that HDF Energy is working on projects in 30 countries. He said the first project under construction is in French Guyana, followed by Indonesia and Barbados.
“Our turnkey hydrogen power plant in French Guyana will supply green, stable baseload electricity by integrating an intermittent renewable energy source (a solar park) with substantial on-site energy storage in the form of green hydrogen, which will be transformed again in electricity through our fuel cell systems,” said Havard. “We are currently constructing the project to deliver 10 MW a day and 3 MW a night. We reached financial closing 18 months ago.”
In Indonesia, HDF Energy wants to become a developer and the operator of hydrogen and electricity production facilities.
“In Indonesia, we signed an MoU with the local grid operator to deploy 22 projects for more than 2 billion euros. It is an official partnership,” said Havard. “It is an important milestone because the Indonesian grid operator does not sign MoUs all the time, maybe one or two a year.”
HDF Energy also has a power-to-power project in Namibia, which will produce green electricity for local use.
“We need to sign a PPA, finalize the investment and start the construction,” said Havard. “We hope to finalize the investment next year.”
He noted that HDF Energy focuses on power-to-power solutions in South America, Africa and Asia because such projects do not need subsidies.
“On the other hand, in Europe, most of our developments are aimed to offtake hydrogen supplied by others, and transform it into electricity on demand (peak or baseload) integrating our multi-MW  fuel cell systems,” said Havard. “There are enough hydrogen producers in Europe for now. We will deploy our first hydrogen-to-power projects in Europe in 2028-30.”
The company is also betting on proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEM) technologies, but does not see a problem in a reliance on critical materials.
“It is a preoccupation, but not a big risk,” concluded Havard.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/03/sharp-claims-33-66-efficiency-for-silicon-tandem-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 3, 2023",Sharp claims 33.66% efficiency for silicon tandem solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp announced it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 33.66% for a silicon tandem solar cell.
The company claimed in a press release that this is the world’s highest efficiency for a stacked solar cell that combines a tandem double-junction solar cell and a silicon solar cell. The result is said to break the world record of 32.65% that Sharp achieved under a project supported by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in 2022.
“The prototype solar cell module has achieved high efficiency by efficiently converting light of various wavelengths into energy by a new structure which has compound two-junction solar cells on the top layer and silicon solar cells on the bottom layer,” the manufacturer said.
“Additionally, the thickness of the tandem double-junction solar cells can be reduced to less than one-third that of conventional triple-junction solar cells, reducing material costs.”
The cell has a double-step junction of indium/gallium/phosphorous and gallium arsenide as the top layer and silicon as the bottom layer.
