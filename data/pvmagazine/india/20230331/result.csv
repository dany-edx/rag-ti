This project, upon commissioning, will be North India’s largest floating solar power plant. 
Hartek’s scope of work includes complete EPC of the 15 MW AC floating solar plant and comprehensive operation and maintenance.
The project is expected to generate 33 million units of electricity per year, helping to offset carbon dioxide emissions by 763,000 tonnes annually.
Hartek Solar recently commissioned a 2 MW floating solar plant for Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science & Technology Promotion Society (CREST) in Chandigarh.

L&T has secured orders to establish 765kV and 400kV gas-insulated substations, to serve as pooling substations, in the Khavda RE zone.
It has also won an order to establish 765kV gas-insulated and air-insulated substation bays at the pooling and remote end substations for the RE zone in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh.
The combined scope of these substation packages includes more than 7 km of gas-insulated bus ducts, bus reactors, and protection & automation systems.
Large renewable energy (RE) zones such as the upcoming Khavda RE park and the RE zone in the Kurnool district house several solar and wind projects from various developers in contiguous land parcels. The power generated from such individual projects is collected at pooling substations, located in the vicinity, and then re-distributed to intra-state and inter-state transmission networks.
L&T has also bagged orders to develop distribution infrastructure in two circles of Rajasthan discom.

INR 915 crore) loan from Japanese banks to finance its 90 MW Omkareshwar floating solar project in Madhya Pradesh and 100 MW Raghanesda solar project in Gujarat. The combined cost of these projects is estimated at INR 1,288.35 crore.
While 60 % of the debt arranged will be financed by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the balance will come from commercial banks of Japan, viz, MUFG Bank and San-in Godo Bank.
The two projects being financed by JBIC are scheduled for commissioning in the year 2023 itself and will produce about 450 million units of electricity in their first year of operation.
For this green finance, SJVN and JBIC virtually inked the ‘Facility Agreement’ under JBIC’s Global action for Reconciling Economic growth and Environmental preservation (GREEN) program.
SJVN targets 25 GW of power generation capacity by 2030, more than half of which is bound to come from solar and wind resources. It emphasized more association with JBIC for green financing in the near future.

The transaction, at an enterprise valuation of around INR 10,150 crore, is JSW Energy’s largest acquisition yet. 
JSW Energy arm JSW Neo completed the acquisition in a two-step process with the acquisition of Mytrah Energy’s 15 SPVs and 13 ancillary SPVs having a total installed RE capacity of 1,449 MW. 
“The said 28 subsidiaries of Mytrah Energy have now become subsidiaries of JSW Neo and accordingly step-down subsidiaries of JSW Energy,” stated JSW Energy.
JSW Neo infused optionally convertible debentures (OCDs) with a right to convert into equity in the balance two SPVs having renewable energy assets of 304 MW and executed forward sale agreements for these SPVs. 
Mytrah’s 1,753 MW portfolio comprises 1,331 MW of wind capacity and 422 MW (487 MWp DC) of solar capacity operating primarily in the southern, western, and central parts of India. The assets benefit from a long-term power purchase agreement with an average remaining life of 17 years. 
The acquisition of Mytrah assets will leapfrog JSW’s current operational capacity by over 36% from 4,811 MW to 6,564 MW. Moreover, with about 2.9 GW of under-construction projects which are likely to be commissioned in phases over the next 12-18 months, JSW Energy is well ahead of its target to reach 10 GW operating company by FY2025 with the share of renewables increasing to 61%, stated JSW Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/31/case-study-demonstrates-5-energy-yield-boost-for-n-type-topcon-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 31, 2023",Case study demonstrates 5% energy yield boost for n-type TOPCon modules,"From pv magazine Global
A case study conducted at a 30 MW PV project developed by China Guodian Corporation (CGC) compared the performance of p-type PERC and n-type TOPCon modules under the same installation conditions. The study demonstrated an increased energy yield of just 5% for the n-type modules, over a two-week period in February 2023.
The 30 MW project studied was developed by CGC in Jixian, Tianjin Province. The project features 20 MW made up of two different 545 W, p-type PERC modules from unnamed manufacturers, with the remaining capacity made up of 555 W n-type TOPCon modules supplied by JinkoSolar. All of the modules are installed on fixed tilt racking at a 30 degree angle, and connected in strings of 26 modules with one 225 kW string inverter for every 17 strings.
The performance of the two module types was analyzed during the first two weeks of February 2023. During this period, the n-type modules were shown to have generated an average of 169.53 kWh per kW installed, a 5.02% increase on the 161.43 kWh/kW achieved by the best-performing p-type module at the site.
 
Module manufacturer JinkoSolar, which supplied the n-type modules to this project, says this data illustrates the reported advantages of TOPCon over PERC in action. The manufacturer cites the n-type modules’ higher efficiency and better bifaciality as key reasons for the increased performance. Better bifaciality (around 70% for PERC and 80% for TOPCon) could account for a yield increase of 1- 1.5%.
With only two weeks of data, collected during the coldest part of the year in Tianjin Province, other advantages are more difficult to take directly from this case study. However, JinkoSolar also cited its n-type modules’ lower degradation rate – 1% in the first year followed by 0.4% per year as likely to bring a yield increase of around 1.8% over PERC’s typical degradation of 2% in year one followed by 0.45% per year.
Finally, it cited the lower temperature coefficient of n-type modules – 0.29% performance loss per C of temperature increase, versus 0.35% for PERC modules – as responsible for a further 2% yield boost, noting that this advantage would be more visible at the project studied in the summer months when temperatures can reach 30 C and higher.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/03/31/floating-pv-system-mysteriously-washes-up-on-hong-kong-beach/,"FLOATING SOLAR,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 31, 2023",Floating PV system mysteriously washes up on Hong Kong beach,"From pv magazine Global
Several portions of a floating PV installation mysteriously landed on two beaches near Hong Kong last week, according to the local environmental organization Kitti Green World, which published pictures of the wrecked installation on its Facebook account.
The pictures show an array with at least 100 solar panels that are apparently still linked together via the floating structures.
According to local media outlet Line, Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is currently investigating where the PV system came from and how it could have ended up on this beach. So far, nobody has claimed the PV asset.
Several members of Kitti Green World’s Facebook group are blaming the appearance of the array on illegal waste disposal. It is more likely, however, that the PV system lost its anchoring and has been drawn by sea currents from another location to the two beaches located at the Sha Chau and Lung Kwu Chau Marine Park, which is situated on open waters on the western side of Hong Kong.
