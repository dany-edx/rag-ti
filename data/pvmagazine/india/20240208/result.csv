Paired Power, a US solar charging infrastructure manufacturer, has developed PairTree, a standalone, solar-powered canopy and EV charger that takes an average of four hours to install.
Like Paired Power’s other products, PairTree is a solar-powered EV charger, but it doesn’t need an electric grid connectivity to function. The off-grid product can provide backup power in remote areas and military sites.
The solar canopy features bifacial solar panels in 4.6 kW units combined with a UL 9450-listed battery energy storage system and one or two “Level 2” EV chargers. The solar panel’s bifacial design means reflected light can reach the bottom surfaces of each panel without shading from mounting systems or other infrastructure obstructing it.
Paired Power said its bifacial panels can increase PairTree’s energy yield by as much as 15%, allowing its 4.6 kW units to perform as effectively as a 5.3 kW solar array.
Depending on the capacity of its battery energy storage system, which the company says maxes out at 42.4 kWh, the product provides between 75 miles (120.7 km) and 230 miles of daily range. PairTree’s operating temperature ranges between -6.6 C and 48.8 C.
Users can control charging via a software app they install on their phones. Tom McCalmont, the CEO of Paired Power, told pv magazine USA that each PairTree is connected to the cloud using similar commercial security services that protect online banking systems.
“All traffic between the charging stations and the data in the cloud is encrypted, as is all access to the data that we provide for monitoring system performance,” he said.
The base price for a unit ranges between $28,000 and $78,000 based on the battery size and number of chargers. Installation generally costs up to $5000 per system, with exact numbers dependent on location. However, Paired Tree states that customers may be eligible to claim a 40% tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Investment Tax incentive.

The report highlights that in developing and emerging economies, commercial financiers are mostly backing utility-scale wind and solar projects at the expense of smaller-scale projects, such as mini-grid solar, which offer economic, social and environmental benefits for all, especially in those economies that still face energy poverty.
“Blended finance is typically for projects with combined developmental objectives, which otherwise do not get funded via conventional financing channels, or for those sectors where the risk-return profile of a project is yet to be established but they need to scale,” says the report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, director, South Asia, IEEFA.
“Its primary role is to bridge the gap between the level and direction of finance flows required from a social perspective and the flows determined by prevailing market conditions,” she adds.
According to the report, Blended finance fits in as a financing tool for the aforementioned types of projects by pooling public and private capital in a risk-adjusted return structure, while adding an element of concessional capital to the pool.
“Commercial entities focus on risks and returns, and gauge risk based on factors such as proven business models, visibility of cash flows, and credentials of borrowers, which often are not strong in the case of several small scale and emerging interventions in clean energy,” says the report’s co-author, Namita Vikas, founder and managing director, auctusESG.
“Blended finance’s bespoke structuring approach, involving public and private capital, addresses the perceived financial risks, and thus provides comfort to raise commercial capital at scale. Using blended finance judiciously based on contextual factors would not only facilitate finance for energy transition at scale, but would create energy access to millions suffering from energy poverty while enabling a climate-smart planet,” she adds.
Blended finance incorporates a wide range of stakeholders, such as a nodal implementation agency, commercial capital providers (microfinance institutions, banks and non-banking financial companies), catalytic capital providers (multilateral development banks, philanthropies), project developers, local communities, customers, auditors and consultants.
“Blended finance can essentially help pay for positive social benefits by combining commercial borrowings with concessional instruments such as grants or subsidised loans from the government, philanthropic resources and multilateral development banks,” says the report’s
co-author, Shantanu Srivastava, lead analyst, Sustainable Finance & Climate Risk, IEEFA.
“At the same time, blended finance is not a grant, and demands reasonable financial returns, even if the desired returns may, at times, vary from market returns,” he adds.
The report focuses on mini-grids as a renewable energy resource that aligns with a just transition in areas where the cost and reliability of central grid power is a bottleneck. It provides a go-to market strategy for capital providers looking at energy transition as an opportunity. It shows how blended finance’s bespoke structure can help aggregate smaller projects at commercially viable scale: a win-win for all and a shining example of trickle-down economics that actually works.

Researchers at the Kitty Kiellands Hus University in Norway have suggested using the ocean space for setting up pumped-hydro stations for utility-scale storage at deepwater.
The new concept, dubbed subsea pumped hydro storage (SPHS), consists of utilizing ocean hydrostatic pressure to channel a flow of water into a rigid tank located on the seabed. This tank is initially filled with air and the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the tank is used to create a water flow into the tank.
“By opening valves connecting the ocean and the tank, water will start to flow into the tank thereby compressing the gas,” the scientists explained. “To charge the system, pumps will pump out the fluid in the tank causing the gas to expand and the pressure in the tank to decrease until it reaches the initial pressure.”
After going through the tank, the water is channeled via pumps through a Pelton turbine, which produces electrical energy that can be exported to the grid or the desired load.

“To operate, the pumps require electrical energy which is supplied from an external source, such as local renewable sources or the grid,” the group said, noting that Pelton turbines are more suitable for the proposed SPHS concept, as they extract energy from the impulse of moving water, as opposed to water’s dead weight like the traditional overshot water wheel. “From this point of view, a low flow rate is preferred as it would take longer for the tank to fill with a low flow rate compared to a high flow rate.”
The academics used non-dimensional analysis and empirical methods to evaluate the system’s potential energy density, state of charge (SOC), and the efficiency of Pelton turbines under varying operating conditions. Their analysis excluded water depths exceeding 2,000 m, due to the high costs and complexity of ultra deepwater construction. “The suitability of a location of an SPHS system is decided by a combination of factors including, but not limited to, supply, demand, available or planned infrastructure,” they also explained.
The analysis showed that the system can potentially achieve an energy density 2600 Wh/m3 for a facility at 1000 m water depth.

The novel concept was presented in the study “Harnessing ocean depths for energy: A theoretical framework for evaluating the feasibility of Subsea Pumped Hydro Storage,” publihsed in the Journal of Energy Storage.
“The results disclose globally suitable locations for an SPSH system in terms of energy density, emphasizing the necessity for additional research to thoroughly evaluate location-specific parameters for determining the economic feasibility of the concept,” said the researchers. “The analysis of Pelton turbine efficiency shows that high theoretical efficiencies can be achieved, especially when the degree of filling is limited to 90 %.”
