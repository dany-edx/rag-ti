The commercial and industrial (C&I) sector is the biggest adopter of rooftop solar, accounting for 71% (4,842 MW) of the cumulative installed capacity. Residential rooftops aggregated to 1,107 MW and public sector installations 843 MW—according to the latest rooftop solar map produced by Bridge To India.
The capital expenditure (Capex) model—wherein consumers finance and own the system and hire an EPC company for the installation—amounted to 72% (4905 MW) of cumulative installations. The balance of installations (1887 MW) were in Opex (operating expenditure) mode, wherein a third-party company (developer/RESCO) owns, installs and operates the system at consumer premises.
Maharashtra is India’s rooftop solar capital, with 958 MW of generation capacity made up of 872 MW of C&I systems and 86 MW of public sector arrays. With 556 MW of rooftop capacity, Rajasthan ranks next, followed by Tamil Nadu, with 537 MW. 
Annual installations
In the year 2020, Maharashtra led with new capacity addition of 147 MW out of the nationwide installation of 1352 MW. It was followed by Karnataka (81 MW), then Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu (74 MW each).
Capex mode installations stood at 988 MW (73%) and Opex mode 364 MW (27%)
In EPC installations, Mumbai’s Tata Power led with 7.8% of the market, closely followed by Hyderabad-based Fourth Partner Energy (7.4%). Mumbai’s Mahindra Susten (3.4%) installed the third most capacity.
In Opex (developer-mode) installations, Fourth Partner Energy claimed 19% of the market, followed by Singapore-based Cleantech Solar (14%) and Gurgaon’s Amplus Solar (10%).
Chinese manufacturers continued to dominate the inverter market, with Growatt supplying around 17.8% of the year’s 1352 MW market, followed by Solis (17.4%) and GoodWe (17.2%).

The two companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to execute e-mobility projects in India. The partnership aims to deliver efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable E-Mobility solutions to Switch Mobility’s various commercial vehicle customers. 
Siemens will provide the charging infrastructure technology for Switch Mobility’s electric commercial vehicle customers. The infrastructure will be supplemented with a management software solution to enhance the energy-efficient operations of the chargers. 
Siemens will also collaborate with Switch Mobility on the implementation of new business models such as eMobility-as-a-Service (eMaas), integrated depot energy management, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) as well as on-site/off-site renewable energy sources by leveraging batteries from commercial vehicles. 
Switch Mobility has over 230 electric vehicles already in operation in India and the UK, and sees immense growth opportunities for its expansion in India, Europe, and many Global markets. The company aims to make electric products more affordable through Siemens’ innovative solutions. 
As part of the MoU, Siemens Financial Services, the financing arm of Siemens AG, will consider a minority investment in OHM Global Mobility, the eMaas platform company to be formed as a subsidiary of Switch Mobility Automotive Limited.

The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, revealed yesterday that power purchase agreements for seven large-scale solar power projects in various regions of the Kingdom were signed by the government and several undisclosed developers.
“The output capacity of these projects, in addition to the projects of Sakaka and Dumat Al-Jandal, will amount to more than 3,600 MW,” he said in a statement, adding that one of the projects – the 600 MW Al Shuaiba PV IP project – will sell power at a world record low price of $0.0104/kWh. The project was selected by the Ministry of Energy in Round 2 of the procurement scheme that is being held under the umbrella of the country’s National Renewable Energy Program (NREP).

Indian innovators, manufacturers and service providers are eligible to participate.
The innovators will be required to showcase their technologies in real field conditions. MNRE will shortlist the promising technologies and allow the selected innovators to install solar pumps under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evem Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM KUSUM) rural solar scheme. 
Only those innovative products which are available for testing and field trial will be eligible for participation. Test reports for the improved solar pumping system must be available with the innovator. New technologies for which patent/IP-related filings have been done (patent may not have been awarded) will also be eligible to participate.
Innovators declared successful by the evaluation committee will be invited by the Ministry to install up to 50 number of improved standalone solar pumps as per the Guidelines of the PM-KUSUM Scheme and the Guidelines for innovative solar pumps. Those who accept the Ministry’s invitation will be empanelled and allocated sites for the installation of solar pumps. They will also be required to provide comprehensive maintenance for the installed pumps for five years.
Applications must reach the ministry by April 22, 2021.
