(REC) will support Avaada‘s diverse energy transition ventures with a total investment of INR 20,000 crore. Avaada and REC signed a memorandum of understanding for this investment on the sidelines of the 4th meeting of the G20 Energy Transition Working Group (ETWG) in Goa. 
Avaada will utilize the REC investment to spearhead a plethora of renewable energy projects across India in the next years. These ventures include green hydrogen and its derivatives, solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing, and an assortment of solar, wind, and hybrid projects. 
“The substantial endorsement from REC underscores Avaada’s unwavering dedication to a greener and more sustainable future for India. For over a decade, REC has extended steadfast support to Avaada, either directly or via the KFW and World Bank line. Through these strategic alliances, Avaada is poised to transform India’s renewable energy landscape, solidifying its role as a key contributor in the global fight against climate change,” stated Avaada.
Avaada Group is an integrated energy company in India that through its renewable subsidiary, Avaada Energy, manages a myriad of large-scale renewable projects across the nation. The group has also forayed into the green hydrogen/ammonia sector to serve both the domestic and international markets.
Recently, Avaada clinched a funding round of $1.3 billion, inclusive of a $1 billion investment from the Canadian asset management fund, Brookfield. This funding is aimed at boosting its green hydrogen and derivative business, with Thailand’s GPSC, part of the PTT Group , also contributing $300 million.

This is purportedly the capacity left unallocated after Hyundai Global Motors Company, one of the four winners of the 50 GWh PLI tender last year, withdrew from the scheme.
The MHI will organize a stakeholder consultation with industry representatives on July 24, 2023, for their input and suggestions before starting the re-bidding process for the remaining 20 GWh capacity.
The consultation will be chaired by the Secretary, MHI. 
“The Ministry is committed to finalizing the bidding documents and proceeding with the rebidding process at the earliest,” stated an MHI release.
In May 2021, the government had approved the PLI Scheme for achieving a manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh of ACCs and 5 GWh of niche ACCs with an outlay of INR 18,100 Crore. The first round of the ACC PLI bidding was concluded in March 2022, and a cumulative battery cell capacity of 50 GWh was allocated to Hyundai Global Motors Company (20GWh), Ola Electric Mobility (20GWh), Reliance New Energy Solar Limited (5GWh), and Rajesh Exports (5GWh) for incentives support under the scheme. Hyundai Global Motors Company, however, withdrew from the scheme. The other three companies were allocated a total capacity of 30 GWh, and the program agreement with them was signed in July 2022.

Masdar, Mitsubishi Chemical Group Corp. (MCG), and Inpex have agreed to explore production of the “world’s first commercial-scale polypropylene” made from CO2 and green hydrogen in Abu Dhabi. The green hydrogen and CO2 will be converted to e-methanol, which will subsequently be converted to propylene and polypropylene. Polypropylene is used to manufacture everyday items such as bottles, jars, and food packaging. Masdar and Inpex also said that they had signed a collaboration agreement to conduct a joint study on the entire value chain from the production of hydrogen and procurement of CO2 to the manufacture and transport of e-methane. Separately, Masdar and Mubadala Energy have also agreed to explore opportunities relating to decarbonization and energy transition initiative.

The HyTrA project will ensure a stable power supply for Alu-Cab, a manufacturer of aluminum vehicle bodies for off-road applications in Cape Town. Alu-Cab will use excess energy from PV systems to locally produce and store hydrogen. The HygO project meanwhile, will use the oxygen generated during electrolysis for wastewater treatment and generate electricity. It will be operational at the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST) from the end of 2023 and will be deployed in a remote area in the Erongo District in mid-2024.

Rystad Energy has revealed that European warehouses currently host around 40 GW of Chinese-made solar panels.
The Norwegian consulting firm said that the stored solar panels are worth about €7 billion. It noted that solar module imports from China continued to increase this year, despite the high inventory levels.
“Imports in January were 17% higher compared to 2022, with February up 22%, March surging 51%, April up 16%, and May growing 6% over last year,” Rystad Energy explained. “If current import levels continue, 2023 will be a record-breaking year for imports and inventory. Annual imports look set to hit 120 GWdc, far surpassing expected capacity installations of 63 GW (DC).”

Rystad Energy said that Europe is “desperate” to secure PV components at affordable prices. It warned that made-in-Europe products may not be immediately available.
“Although efforts are underway to build a reliable solar supply chain in Europe, the need for panels now means leaders cannot wait until 2025 or later to buy European,” said Marius Mordal Bakke, senior supply chain analyst at Rystad Energy.
