The solar plant is to be developed under the Open category, allowing the use of solar cells and modules of any origin.
The successful bidder’s work scope includes design, engineering, manufacturing, supply, packing and forwarding, transportation, unloading, storage, installation, commissioning, and five years of comprehensive operation and maintenance of the plant.
The total contract period is 2055 days, including 270 days for plant commissioning and 1825 days for operation and maintenance.
The project cost is estimated at INR 92 crore (including operation and maintenance cost for five years) for a maximum generation of 46.75 million units.
To be eligible, the bidder should have installed and commissioned, as an EPC contractor or developer, a cumulative grid-connected solar capacity of a minimum 16 MWp, out of which at least one plant should have been at least 10 MWp. The reference plant must have been in successful operation for at least six months before the technical bid opening date.
Or, the bidder should have executed in the last ten years an industrial project, either as a developer or as an EPC contractor, of a minimum value of INR 73 crore in a single project. The reference project should be in successful operation for at least one year before the technical bid opening date. Further, the bidder should have executed at least one electrical sub-station of 33 kV or above voltage level, which should be in successful operation for at least one year before the technical bid opening date.
The bidder’s average annual turnover during the last three years should be at least 30% of the estimated cost put to the tender.

Phytonics, a spin-off from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), has launched an anti-reflective film for solar modules after more than seven years of research and development work.
The start-up said it was inspired by the world of plants, more precisely from roses, in developing a film that it claims can improve the performance of a PV module by up to 10%.
The film was made by mimicking the nanostructures that can be found in the outer tissue of the rose petals’ epidermis, which are able to couple all incident light into the tissue and to let only the colored light emerge again. They were able to study this structure by using a scanning electron microscope.
The anti-reflective film was developed for various surfaces. “Our film makes it possible to combine the advantages of high-gloss and matt surfaces, namely to achieve intense colors without annoying reflections,” explains co-founder Ruben Hünig.
When it is applied to a solar cell, the film offers a broader absorption spectrum and a higher angle of light-incidence tolerance. Micro and nanostructures were fabricated to recreate the epidermis of the rose petals over a large area.
The film is claimed to suppress the reflection for all wavelengths and angles of incidence of light almost completely. This, according to the manufacturer, makes it far superior to conventional anti-reflective coatings.
The company specified that solar modules are only one possible application as the film can also be used for posters, display boards, traffic signs, pieces of furniture, packaging or facades. “The film gives surfaces of all kinds an anti-reflective coating and gives them a noble, velvety appearance,” it stated.
The anti-reflective film is mechanically flexible and is also suitable for curved surfaces. According to Phytonics, it is dirt-repellent and highly resistant to environmental influences such as UV light, moisture and temperature fluctuations. It is manufactured using an inexpensive roll-to-roll printing process and can be applied to all types of materials using standard lamination processes.

‘Nxtra by Airtel’ currently operates ten large and 120 edge data centers across India.
The company has inched a step closer to meeting its goal by commissioning a 14 MWp captive solar power plant in Uttar Pradesh to meet the energy requirements of its core and edge data centers in the State.
The facility at Tilhar in the Shahjahanpur district is the first of the two solar plants being set up by Airtel in partnership with AMP Energy.
The second plant at Begampur is expected to go online in the next quarter. This will provide a significant boost to Airtel’s initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint. Airtel had acquired 26% equity stake in AMP Solar Evolution as part of its commitment to green energy-based solutions.
Data Centres, which play a key role in the digital ecosystem, have large power requirements. The initiative by Nxtra contributes to Airtel’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.
Aligned to the Paris Climate Accord, Airtel is implementing clean fuel-based power solutions for its towers, data centers, switching centers, and other facilities. In FY 20, the company has achieved an average carbon emission reduction of 114% from the base year 2011-12 against the Department of Telecom’s target of 30%.
