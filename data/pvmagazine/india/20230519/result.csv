We target at least 20% of this financing to be carried out by REC.”
REC’s focus areas for renewables financing include solar, wind, hybrid solar-wind, storage solution, green hydrogen, and green ammonia.
India has set an ambitious target to become net-zero by the year 2070. It targets 500 GW of the installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources. As of now, the nation has installed a renewable energy generation capacity of about 175 GW. Another 325 GW capacity will come in the next seven years. 
“Against this backdrop, REC has a very significant role to play in the energy transition,” said Dewangan.
REC’s sanction in the renewable energy space grew from INR 7,034 crore in FY 2017-18 to INR 21,317 crore in FY 2022-23. The company’s loan book in the RE space increased from INR 7,506 crore in FY 2017-18 to INR 29,073 crore in 2022-23, accounting for 6.7% of its overall loan book of INR 4.35 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023. Continuing with this trend, REC aims to expand its loan book under the renewable energy portfolio to INR 2.4 lakh crore by the fiscal year 2030, forming about 30% of its overall loan book of INR 10 lakh crore on March 31, 2030. 
REC closed FY 2022-23 on a high note. It recorded a net profit of INR 11,055 crore, its highest-ever yearly profit and an increase of 10% year-on-year. Aided by growth in profits, its net worth grew to INR 57,680 crore as on March 31, 2023, an increase of 13% YoY. 
REC is a non-banking finance company under the power ministry, focusing on the power sector. It has also forayed into the non-power infrastructure growth. In line with the government of India’s focus, REC continues to grow its renewables business.

The proposed Au/NiO/FASnI3/ZnO0.25S0.75/FTO solar cell device structure revealed an exceptional open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.2419 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 28.35 mA/cm2, Fill Factor (FF) of 89.64%, and power conversion efficiency of 31.57%, suitable for next-generation lead-free and eco-friendly solar cell device applications.
The researchers designed and investigated the Au/NiO/FASnI3/ZnO0.25S0.75/FTO device structure using SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance simulator at AM 1.5G illumination, 1000 W/m2 incident power, and 300 K temperature
The performance parameters of the proposed solar cells device structure were investigated with variations in the active layer (FASnI3) thickness, defect density, and doping concentration; and variations of NiO HTL and ZnO0.25S0.75 ETL thickness, electron affinity, and doping concentration to obtain higher performance. Moreover, the influence of series and shunt resistance and temperature on the performance parameters of the proposed solar cell device structure was inspected.
“The FASnI3 parameter variations revealed that to attain high solar cell efficiency, optimal FASnI3 thickness, defect density, and doping concentration are desired, facilitated by the decent number of photons absorption and restricted non-radiative recombinations,” Robin Khosla, part of the research team and assistant professor at National Institute of Technology (NIT) Silchar, told pv magazine. 
“Additionally, the thickness, electron affinity, and doping density variations of NiO HTL publicized that electron affinity-assisted trifling valence band offset and low series resistance of NiO promote good solar cell efficiency. Moreover, the ZnOS ETL scaled thickness, reasonable electron affinity, and moderate doping concentration showed superior device performance enabled by inconsequential conduction band offset and recombination current. A low series resistance, high shunt resistance, good thermal stability, and fewer interface defects marked excellent performance and reliability of the FASnI3 solar cell devices.”
The research findings are reported in Results in Optics. The research team included Robin Khosla, Srinivas Mattaparthi, Dipesh K. Sinha, and Aditya Bhura.

The selected developer will execute the project on a build-own-operate basis. It will sign a 25-year power purchase and sale agreement (PPA) with the UNE.
The developer’s scope of work includes design, financing, construction, installation, commissioning, and operation of the PV plant for the 25-year PPA duration.
The project is being executed under Program-06 of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which supports the implementation of grid-connected solar PV projects in ISA member countries.
The government of Cuba targets 2.1 GW of solar PV capacity by 2030. Achieving this target would require the implementation of the solar PV project in a phased manner. Being a member country of ISA, the government of Cuba has sought the support of ISA. Under this program, ISA, through its consultant NTPC Limited, is implementing solar parks of 1.15 GW capacity along with battery energy storage system (BESS) support of 150 MW/150 MWh in Cuba.

Scientists from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China have simulated a solar cell based on an absorber using a perovskite material known as CsSnI3, which is an inorganic perovskite that has low exciton binding energy, a high absorbance coefficient, and an energy bandgap of 1.3 eV.
“The cell we designed is suitable for commercial production, however, this requires intensive experimental work,” researcher Azhar Ali Haidry told pv magazine.
The researchers used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium, to simulate several cell designs with different electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs).
Through a series of simulations, the Chinese team found that the best possible cell configuration was provided by a device based on a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a titanium oxide (TiO2) ETL, the CsSnI3 absorber, an HTL based on nickel(II) oxide (NiOx), and back electrodes.
“The perovskite CsSnI3 thickness of 1,250 nm is found optimum for obtaining the highest performance with each ETL and HTL thickness of about 50 nm,” the academics said. “The absorber layer with around 1200−1300 nm thickness, TiO2, and NiO with 50 nm thicknesses are considered favorable to obtain high PV efficiency.”
The best-performing device built with this architecture achieved an efficiency of 31.09%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.084 V, a short-circuit current of 31.17 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 88.68%. The researchers said the performance depended mainly on the absorber thickness, the perovskite material’s energy bandgap, the acceptor level density, and the cell’s central trap energy levels.
They described the cell in “Device Simulation of a Thin-Layer CsSnI3-Based Solar Cell with Enhanced 31.09% Efficiency,” which was recently published in Energy Fuels.
“The findings will provide the guideline for the fabrication of the CsSnI3-based PV device in the laboratory,” the scientists said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/05/19/qcells-builds-pilot-line-for-perovskite-silicon-tandem-pv-cells-in-south-korea/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 19, 2023",Qcells builds pilot line for perovskite-silicon tandem PV cells in South Korea,"From pv magazine Germany
In November 2022, Qcells and a group of European research institutes in Thalheim, Germany, started a four-year research project to manufacture highly efficient tandem solar cells and modules.
The group established a pilot manufacturing line in Thalheim through the so-called “Pepperoni” (Pilot line for European production of perovskite-silicon tandem modules on industrial scale) project.
The company’s parent, Hanwha Solutions, has also announced plans to invest $100 million in the deployment of a pilot production line for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells at its factory in Jincheon, South Korea, by the end of 2024.
“This investment in Jincheon will mark an important step in securing technological leadership,” stated Qcells CEO Justin Lee. “With global R&D network spanning from Korea, Germany and the U.S., Qcells will ramp up its efforts to produce high-efficiency advanced tandem cells.”
Earlier this year, Germany’s Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin and Qcells presented a tandem cell with up to 29.3% efficiency rate. The results have been certified by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
The device is based on a silicon bottom cell relying on Hanwha Qcells’ monocrystalline Q.antum half cell technology and a perovskite-based top cell.
“This latest record efficiency result, of 28.7%, is an improvement of almost one percentage point compared with the 2020 record value of 27.8%,” the module maker said in a statement. “This boost in tandem efficiency has been enabled by improvement of both the perovskite and the silicon subcells.”
