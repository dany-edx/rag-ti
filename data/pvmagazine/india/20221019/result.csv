NTPC REL is a wholly owned subsidiary of state-run power producer NTPC. As part of this project, Hitachi Energy will provide ten 315 MVA 400/33/33 kV transformers manufactured at its transformers factory in Vadodara. This will be the largest rating of transformer, used in solar power evacuation so far.
“The transition from fossil fuels to renewables has only just begun and we are proud to be part of this ambitious project by NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd,” said N Venu, Managing Director and CEO, India and South Asia, Hitachi Energy.
Hitachi Energy develops solutions needed to integrate renewables at scale. “As of today, around one third of green power in India flows through Hitachi Energy technologies, such as transformers. The made-in-India power transformers are critical components in power systems. They pool the generated power from the renewable source and step it up at the pooling station to synchronize and feed into inter-state/intra-state transmission system. Their availability and longevity have a major impact on grid reliability and better voltage control even with intermittent supply while the company’s eco-design transformers enable sustainability requirements,” stated Hitachi.
The transformers are manufactured using fossil-free electricity in Hitachi Energy’s factory in Maneja.

At the meet, leaders across the energy sector emphasized the need to enhance India’s share of renewable energy, both to mitigate climate change and to attain energy security at ACE 2022. 
“India must focus on energy security, energy independence, and energy reliability to the consumers, even while focusing on energy transition,” said Ghanshyam Prasad, chairman of Central Electricity Authority. “Commercial and Industrial (C&I) have an opportunity to consume renewables to attain the green tag.”
A recent report by WRI found a dominant preference for on-site RE solutions among both corporate and SME users, whereas open-access (OA) off-site projects are more popular with large corporations. The report attributes this difference to the procedural complexities of OA transactions, the larger capital availability in corporations, and the need to meet larger energy demands.
The report also found that the awareness of green tariffs (GTs) in the commercial and industrial sector is strikingly low, with up to 82% of corporate consumers and up to 94% of SMEs unaware of GTs as a concept and desirous of proof of concept before committing. [Through GTs, C&I consumers can opt to buy RE electricity directly from Discoms by paying a premium to the utilities.] The WRI report found that 62% of corporate consumers and 55% of SME consumers were unwilling to pay any premium for GTs.
Based on these and other findings, the report recommends key measures for organizations, Discoms, and state energy departments.  
On Day 1, sessions at ACE 2022 included enablers of energy transition in India, offshore wind, the role of states’ RE agencies in India’s energy transition, and scaling energy transition in Indian cities. 
Day two of ACE 2022 would include sessions on creating effective finance models for newer forms of renewables technology, like distributed renewable energy; pathways to deep decarbonize heavy industries; and tools that power distribution companies could use to effectively handle the impending surge in energy demand from electric vehicles on their grids.

An international research team has fabricated a tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cell through a new technique enabling the control of tunnel oxide deposition at the atomic scale.
“This new technology is aimed to solve the issues posed by the traditional low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) methods,” researcher Liao Baochen told pv magazine. “These are, among others, high maintenance costs and low deposition rates, especially for in-situ doping.”
The scientists described the proposed method as an innovative tube-type industrial plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technique. They claimed that it can provide high-quality, dense tunnel silicon oxide (SiOx) films at a low cost and high throughput.
They said it could be easily integrated into tube-type PECVD systems used for monocrystalline PERC solar module manufacturing.
“One deposition tool is sufficient to complete the deposition of all the thin film layers, making its fabrication process more competitive than conventional methods,” the researchers said.
The group built the cell with a G1 n-type wafer with a thickness of 170 μm and an area of 440.96 square centimeters. They deposited all the films at a temperature of 200 C and a cycle time of 25 seconds. They then controlled the SiOx thickness by adjusting the number of atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycles and annealed all samples in a tube furnace at 920 C for 45 minutes to facilitate crystallization and dopant activation.
As a final step, the academics screen-printed the cells on both sides with an aluminum-silver (Al-Ag) alloy paste for the front electrodes and Ag paste for the rear electrodes. They then fired the devices at a peak temperature of around 800 C using an industrial fast-firing furnace.
The research team tested the cells under standard illumination conditions and the best-performing device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 42.65 V, a short-circuit current of 17,74 A, and a fill factor of 81.0%.
The scientists also used 60 cells to build a 613 W TOPCon module that achieved an efficiency of 22.8%, an open-circuit voltage of 41.21 V, a short-circuit current of 18.17 A, and a fill factor of 79.5%.
“The cells were half-cut by laser and double-side laminated with two tempered glass panels to form bifacial modules,” they said.
They presented the new manufacturing process in “Atomic scale controlled tunnel oxide enabled by a novel industrial tube-based PEALD technology with demonstrated commercial TOPCon cell efficiencies > 24%,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The group includes academics from Nantong University, Chinese cell maker Tongwei, Singapore’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia, and China-based module maker Risen Energy.

Despite the pressure the pandemic has placed on supply chains and income levels, the number of people who source electricity from solar energy kits has continued to grow and has now reached 490 million.
According to the “Off-Grid Solar Market Trends Report 2022: State of The Sector” report – published by the World Bank’s Lighting Global, International Finance Corp. (IFC), GOGLA, Efficiency for Access Coalition, and Open Capital Advisors – the number of people who use solar energy kits had grown by 70 million by the end of 2021, up from 420 million in 2019.
The report attributes this result to continued sales, the longer lifespan of larger products, and current customers beginning to move up the “clean energy staircase.” This is where they have paid off or made savings from their initial solar energy kit and are able to purchase a new, often larger product and additional services. For instance, 3.8 million customers have gained access to solar TVs in 2020 and 2021.
The adverse effects of the pandemic were most pronounced in 2020, translating into a 22% decline in solar energy kit sales. However, in 2021, the off-grid solar sector bounced back with a 10% increase in sales, the report finds.
In pursuit of universal energy access by 2030, off-grid solar technologies are expected to play a critical role as population growth, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, off-grid solar represents the cheapest solution for 41% of new household connections between 2020 and 2030.
But for many homes and businesses, the price of solar energy kits remains prohibitive. The pandemic has also exacerbated the affordability challenge in the form of declining income levels and job losses. Therefore, the availability of consumer financing options, such as PAYGo, has never been more important.
Assuming consumer finance is readily available, between 177 million to 277 million currently unconnected people are still unable to afford a Tier 1 solar energy kit, the report shows. In the absence of consumer finance, affordability levels drop even further. That is to say, of 733 million unconnected people around the world, only between 3 million and 167 million could afford to buy a Tier 1 multi-light and charging system upfront.
“This indicates that end-user financing is essential to provide the poorest population with Tier 1 energy access, but that PAYGo is not sufficient to close the affordability gap,” the report said.
Meanwhile, investments into the industry continued to grow, surpassing $2.3 billion since 2012. However, most of the finance went to seven companies operating at scale, while those in their seed and start-up phase have found attracting financing more difficult.
From 2016 to 2020, the industry saw yearly investment volumes plateauing between $300 million and $350 million, before reaching $457 million in 2021. This year is set to be another record-breaking year, the report states.
In other findings, the report found that solar water pumps and solar cooling seen as “emerging” technologies two years ago, have rapidly matured and are now classified as “near-to-market” – and are already improving food production and storage. Furthermore, the PAYGo technology that unlocked consumer financing for solar energy is now being leveraged on a variety of electronic devices, and to offer digital financial services.
Finally, the report highlights the need for end-user subsidies, noting that “there is growing recognition that more public funding will be needed to reach remote and lower-income customers, and to bridge affordability gaps.”
