https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/01/solar-module-price-increases-to-affect-returns-on-4-4-gw-of-solar/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 1, 2022",Solar module price increases to affect returns on 4.4 GW of solar,"Solar developers in India face cost pressures due to rising cell and module prices, even as supply chain issues begin to ease, according to a new report by ICRA.
Prices of mono-PERC modules have increased by more than 40% to $0.27 to $0.28 per watt over the last 18 months. This has mainly been driven by disruptions to operations across the Chinese solar value chain and the spike in the cost of polysilicon, which is a key input for module producers. 
In addition, the increase in solar PV cell and module prices, along with the imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported cells and modules, is leading to cost pressure for solar power projects awarded over the last 12 to 18 months.
While the bid tariffs have increased from the lows of INR 1.99 per kWh in Dec. 2020 to INR 2.2-2.5 per kWh, the extent of the increase in bid tariffs remained lower than what ICRA estimates is necessary to mitigate the increase in module prices,” said Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president of ICRA. “The risk of moderation in returns is significant for projects aggregating to 4.4 GW awarded over the past 18 months, wherein the tariffs are below INR 2.2/kWh.”
Modules for projects awarded after April 2021 must be sourced from domestic manufacturers under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). As most domestic manufacturers do not have backward integration beyond cells, their dependence on wafer and cell imports will likely continue over the medium term. 
As a result, international pricing trends for polysilicon and wafers/cells could remain a key thing for solar power developers in India to monitor. Given procurement of modules from domestic manufacturers as required under ALMM notification and use of imported cells by such manufacturers, an increase of $0.01 in cell prices would require a 5 paise to 6 paise increase per kilowatt-hour in bid tariffs to maintain the same level of returns, said ICRA.
Given the fixed and single-part tariff under the power purchase agreements for solar power projects, the uptrend in interest rates also remains a challenge for developers. It will put additional upward pressure on bid tariffs. Vikram V, vice president and sector head-corporate ratings at ICRA, estimates that an increase of 150 basis points in the interest rate could lead to up to a 20-paise increase in the bid tariff, assuming that other factors remain the same.
Despite the cost headwinds, he said, solar tariffs will remain highly competitive for the state distribution utilities, compared to the marginal cost of procurement from thermal stations, which are at the bottom 25% of the merit order dispatch of electricity. The variable cost of procurement from these coal-based power plants is more than INR 3.0/kWh across key Indian states.

NREL researchers have reviewed more than 3,000 scientific publications on the life cycles of the most common solar and lithium-ion battery technologies. They have found that alternatives to recycling could help to build an effective circular economy for PV and battery technologies.
The review does not dismiss recycling, but it promotes other less-explored aspects of manufacturing and hardware usage. The researchers said the emphasis on recycling, while valuable, may overlook the challenges and opportunities that research into other strategies could reveal.
“If you can keep them as a working product for longer, that’s better than deconstructing it all the way down to the elements that occurs during recycling,” said Garvin Heath, senior environmental scientist at NREL. “And when a product does reach the end of its life, recycling is not the only option.”
The researchers said that designing products with fewer overall materials, especially hazardous materials, will improve their environmental impacts more than recycling can. Recycling itself is also an imperfect process, as there are currently no integrated recycling processes that can recover all the materials for either technology, and existing research has focused more on lab-scale methods, rather than commercial-scale approaches.
“People often summarize the product life cycle as ‘take, make, waste.’” Heath said. “Recycling has received a lot of attention because it addresses the waste part, but there are ways to support a circular economy in the take part and the make part, too.”
The Biden Administration has also committed $3.1 billion in funding to increase American-made batteries and components, bolster domestic supply chains, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs. The plan is to support the creation of new, retrofitted, and expanded commercial facilities as well as manufacturing demonstrations, and battery recycling.While all of these initiatives support increased recycling on the commercial level, there have yet been no federally funded initiatives to lower materials’ usage in PV and storage applications, although such conclusions could be reached by organizations funded by either of these announcements.
In September 2021, NREL scientists published research that describes how to motivate the market first to reuse solar panels, and then recycle them by guiding national industrial policy to create a financially viable end-of-life solar panel industry.
The research was published in Nature Energy and offers a real number for policy makers to consider: a $10 to 18 per panel subsidy to pay for recycling at the end of the panel’s life.
The researchers’ projections showed that 40% of all solar panels could be reused and recycled using subsidies equal to $18 per panel for 12 years. At that price, a profitable and sustainable solar panel recycling industry could establish itself by 2032.
The NREL research said that specific tools could be effective at minimizing the landfilling of solar panels. The first simply would ban solar panels from landfills. The second option would subsidize solar panel recycling in order to lower the effective cost of recycling solar panels as the industry scales.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/07/01/single-axis-trackers-on-commercial-rooftops-increase-generation-by-37/,"HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,SOLAR TRACKERS,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 1, 2022",Single-axis trackers on commercial rooftops increase generation by 37%,"From pv magazine Global
Alion Energy’s single-axis tracker racking product was originally designed to be deployed in regions where heavy installation equipment was more challenging to access, but labor might be more available.
One aspect of this design philosophy is that the system is light and can be easily carried and assembled, and doesn’t require metal pilings to be driven deep into the ground. And interestingly, this carries over to commercial rooftops.
Mark Kingsley, Alion Energy CEO, said in a post on LinkedIn that a commercial real estate group had installed a standard rooftop, 10-degree fixed tilt monofacial solar array, as well as a competing Alion Energy system.
The results were as expected – 37.5% greater generation on a per watt basis from the single-axis tracker, on a pristine white thermoplastic roof versus standard modules. Of course, the real breakthrough is that they were able to get single-axis trackers installed on a commercial rooftop at all.
The rooftop in their example has a lot of skylights, and the overall structure is not facing due south. In this configuration, Alion Energy suggests that it can fit 4.55 MW of modules on the Maryland structure with a standard 10-degree installation. This system is projected to generate 1.34 kWh per watt each year.
Alion has designed a system that is 5.4 MW – a full 18% increase in wattage due to systems ability to be installed directly over skylights without needing the standard setback. Additionally, this hardware is projected to generate 1.54 kWh per watt installed per year.
In this case, that works out to 37% more electricity from the same rooftop. And when the trackers are directly attached to the roof – a 2.15 pounds per square foot dead load. Add in one Alion’s customized robotic cleaners, and the company says the levelized cost of electricity from the system falls to 4.67¢/kWh and generates 40% more electricity than a standard rooftop solar install.
And while this rooftop was selected to show off their hardware, it’s still an interesting best case scenario for us to consider.

The floating solar project is being constructed in two phases on the reservoir formed by the Omkareshwar dam across the Narmada river. RUMSL issued letters of award to NHDC, AMP Energy, and SJVN to develop a total capacity of 278 MW in the first phase. NHDC Limited will develop Unit-D, AMP Energy Unit-E, and SJVN Ltd will develop Unit-F of the project.
RUMSL Chairperson Sanjay Dubey said in the first phase, 278 MW capacity is proposed to be completed by Sept. 2023. This capacity development is expected to attract investment of about INR 1,600 crore ($203 million) in the state.
Omkareshwar project is a multi-purpose project in which irrigation and hydroelectricity generation are already taking place. Now along with the production of solar energy, tourism will also get a boost. 
The Omkareshwar floating solar project is being implemented under the Centre’s Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPP) Scheme. M.P. Power Management Company Limited will purchase the entire 600 MW power generated from the project.

The initiative is supported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
ReNew will provide financial support and familiarization with its renewable facility in the area, while SEWA is the lead implementation partner. UNEP will monitor and evaluate the project.
Women salt pan workers work in the physically challenging and extreme temperatures of the remote Rann of Kutch marshes. This program is intended to train them as solar panel and solar pump technicians at Dhokavada village in the Patan district of Gujarat.
Currently, these women save an average of INR 10,000 ($128) in around 10 months, while a solar panel technician can earn up to INR 18,000 (US$ 130) a month.
The program will start with training 60 women. Eventually, around 1,000 women will be skilled in the new clean energy transition roles. The Government of India’s National Skill Development Corporation will also support the program.
This unique and inclusive project will address multiple Sustainable Development Goals under one umbrella, including no poverty, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work, economic growth, and climate action.
Vaishali Sinha, chief sustainability officer, ReNew, said, “This program brings these inspiring women, who face real hardship in a traditional livelihood and earn a meagre income, into the heart of the clean energy transition to better their lives and brings them into the fight against climate change. This program, that is scalable, is sustainability from the ground up, rather than top-down, and we are proud to partner with UNEP and SEWA to support this.”
“This is just one effort, and we need many more such multiple stakeholder programs across the corporate sector to accelerate the energy transition and, equally important, make it more just and diverse.”
