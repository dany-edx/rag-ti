A group of researchers led by Germany’s Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) has fabricated a triple-junction perovskite-perovskite-silicon solar cell that achieved a record-breaking efficiency of 24.4%.
To date, multi-junction perovskite-based photovoltaics using three, four, or even more junctions have so far been lagging in performance compared to monolithic perovskite-based double-junction solar cells.
“The key challenges in processing triple-junction architectures are the sequential processing of high-quality perovskite thin films in the increasingly complex multi-layer architecture, light management and current matching of the monolithically interconnected sub-cells, as well as the development of low-loss tunnel/recombination junctions,” Ulrich W. Paetzold, leader of the next-generation PV group at KIT, told pv magazine. “We highlight that to date the most critical junction is the middle perovskite subcell, since it is processed on top of the Si bottom cell and needs to withstand the subsequent processing of the wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite top cell.”
In the study “Triple-junction perovskite–perovskite–silicon solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 24.4%,” published in Energy & Environmental Science, Paetzold and his colleagues explained that the cell was based on a perovskite top cell with an energy bandgap of 1.84 eV, a perovskite middle cell with bandgap of 1.52 eV, and a silicon bottom cell with a bandgap of 1.1 eV.
The bottom cell had a thickness of 200 μm-thick. It was etched with potassium hydroxide, and was based on electron-collecting poly-Si on oxide (POLO) junctions. For the middle and top devices, the scientists used one of the most promising halide perovskites – the α-formamidinium lead iodide known as α-FAPbI3. The recombination junctions were formed by sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) layers.
“ITO also serves as anchoring oxide for the sequential hole transport layer (HTL), especially for the double HTLs of NiOx/self-assembled monolayer (SAM),” the academics explained. “A double HTL based on a combination of sputtered nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and carbazole (2PACz) is used in both perovskite subcells, offering an excellent charge carrier extraction, a robust barrier for the solvents of perovskite precursor, and a very good yield for the devices.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the triple-junction cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 24.4%, an open-circuit voltage of 2.84 V, a short-circuit current of 11.6 mA cm–2, and a fill factor of 74%. The research group stated this is the highest efficiency ever reported to date for this kind of triple-junction device.
The cell was also able to retain 96.6% of the initial efficiency in dark storage aging at 85 C for 1,081 h.
“Taking advantage of optical simulations and experimental optimizations in triple junction, the current mismatch was minimized, and current generation was maximized,” Paetzold said. “Key to this achievement was our development of a high-performance middle perovskite sub-cell, employing a stable pure-α-phase high-quality FAPbI3 thin film.”
Paetzold also explained that the middle perovskite sub-cell is beneficial to providing a suitable middle bandgap, very good thermal stability, excellent interfaces to both recombination junctions, and a low density of defects and pinholes.
“Our study opens the door to a new era of perovskite-based high-efficiency triple-junction PV,” he concluded.

The project was built by the team at SG Ornate Solar Solutions (a joint venture of APL Apollo Tubes and Ornate Solar). It is expected to generate over 100 million units of electricity over the life of the project, contributing to offsetting 4,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
Installed above the SSD-5 steel cold forming unit of Jindal Steel & Power at Angul, Odisha, the InRoof Solar plant eliminates the need for underlying metal sheets, using the patented interlocking mechanism developed by the engineering team of Ornate Solar. The design guarantees waterproofing through its inherent structure, using surface-component structures for drainage.
The double layered protection system comprises upper rail support components secured by side pressure blocks and middle pressure blocks, with aluminum alloy cover plates placed between component connections and EPDM membrane strips installed along the perpendicular length of the solar panels to prevent water ingress.
Horizontal gutters are used on the lower level to direct excess water into the main gutter, which then guides the surplus rainwater to the drainage gutter. This multi-structural approach is said to  effectively address leakage concerns and achieve comprehensive waterproofing.
The InRoof structural system can be deployed for system installations as small as 10 kW all the way up to 10,000 kW using modular assembly techniques with specially developed tools that allow 25,000 sq ft. on average to be installed in just 7-10 days.
Ornate Solar commissioned the project in less than 120 days from the date of award. The company has now over 5,00,000 sq. ft of operational InRoof solar projects and 10,00,000 sq ft. under construction.

French industrial group Socomec has developed a modular energy storage system with a capacity of up to 1,116 kWh.
The Sunsys HES L Skids system combines battery cabinets with a converter cabinet and an AC power distribution cabinet.
“All cabinets within the energy storage system are shipped assembled, mounted, and internally cabled on an adapted SKID,” the company said. “This guarantees minimum installation time, limits investment in civil works, and ensures optimum quality. The upgraded design also means the system is easily transportable and deployable, allowing for it to be installed on alternative sites.”
The manufacturer said that each battery cabinet comes with a rack of 186 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Up to six battery racks can be connected together, for a maximum storage capacity of 1,116 kWh.
The converter offers a capacity of 100 kVA when connected to one battery, up to 200 kVA when connected to two, and up to 300 kVA for set-ups of up to six batteries. The optional AC cabinet has multi-source paralleling and islanding, among other options.
“This solution is for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, commercial and industrial buildings, and microgrids,” the company said. “Once on site, all that remains to do is to connect the AC power and communication cables.”
The system uses liquid cooling thermal management, with a storage temperature of -20 C to 60 C. The company said it can operate at temperatures of -20 C to 45 C without derating.

Mono PERC M10 and G12 cell prices trended flat at $0.0482 per W and $0.0473/W, respectively, while TOPCon M10 cell prices remained constant at $0.0584/W week to week.
According to a market participant, neither the supply nor the demand for cells has changed significantly as of right now. What will be clearer by month-end is the change in operating rates set by cell and module producers, the source added.

A manufacturer that had already sold Mono PERC M10 cells for the high price of CNY0.4 ($0.056)/W prior to the Lunar New Year said that, although they intend to raise prices even more, their ability to do so will depend on how order talks play out over the next two weeks.
Another source from the cell segment is skeptical about whether cell prices will continue to rise, saying that increases are restrained by the present price and potential future price of modules.
The fact that an increase in end-user demand in 2024 cannot be substantial will weigh on cell prices, according to an upstream insider. “The most bullish forecast I’ve heard so far is that end-user demand would rise by roughly 20% in 2024” compared to 2023, the source added.
Even if prices rise in response to increased demand, only integrated businesses are able to ensure sales volume and profitability, a market observer stated, who went on to say that stand-alone cell producers can only strive for profits by lowering the purchase prices of wafers.
