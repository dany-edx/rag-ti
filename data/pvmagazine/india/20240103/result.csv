Four large solar projects worth INR 35,000 crore will be set up in different districts of Bundelkhand and Eastern Uttar Pradesh in the first phases, stated Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA).
“The state government had received investment proposals to the tune of INR 40 lakh crore at the Global Investor Summit (GIS) held in 2023 and solar power and other clean energy projects under the ‘Akshay Urja’ Scheme accounted for a significant share of the total investment,” said Anupam Shukla (IAS), Director, UPNEDA, Government of Uttar Pradesh.
Shukla said, Uttar Pradesh currently generates close to 2,152 MW of solar energy, out of which 372 MW is in open access. Bundelkhand region has witnessed the maximum number of solar plants amounting to nearly 60% of the total solar energy generated in the State.
The State’s solar energy generation, which stood at close to 279 MW in 2017, has witnessed a multifold rise over the last six years backed by a slew of incentives, rebates, concessions, and promotions offered under the new Solar Policy of the state government.
“Under the current investment pipeline, Sonbhadra in Eastern Uttar Pradesh will witness the setting up of an off-stream close-loop pump storage project by Greenko Group generating 3,660 MW of electricity at an estimated outlay of INR 17,000 crore. A 1 GW floating solar plant on Matatila Dam in the Lalitpur district to be set up by TUSCO Ltd is likely to come up at an estimated investment of INR 6,500 crore. Bundelkhand Solar Energy Ltd will set up a 1.2 GW solar power park in the Jalaun district, while ACME Cleantech Solutions will set up two off-stream closed-loop pump [storage projects] in Prayagraj and Meerganj area.”
The Uttar Pradesh government is set to establish a 50 MW floating solar plant in Bhakhira Bird Sanctuary in Eastern UP. The State District Administration and Uttar Pradesh New & Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA) is looking to set up a ground mounted or a floating solar plant in Bakhira lake area and the Lucknow Solar Power Development Corporation Limited (LSPDCL) will be conducting a feasibility study on the same.
“The state government is also looking to energise all the 1,994 odd cold storages with a total storage capacity of 1.65 crore metric tonnes, with solar energy. Under the Solar City program, a 40 MW solar power plant is being established on 165 acres of land in Ayodhya by NTPC. The land has been identified, and the project is underway. Part of the project has already commenced and the remaining is expected to be operational by March 2024,” the UPNEDA Director added.

Under the MoU, both ATGL and Shigan will explore various areas of collaboration, including development of CNG/LNG-based retrofitment solutions, e-mobility-based solutions for last mile delivery players, and use-cases for green hydrogen as fuel for ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles.
While the primary focus of retrofitment solutions will be transportation and mining applications, the two partners will also explore applications like stationary engines, locomotives, and marine equipment.
“The partnership will focus on adopting natural gas for transportation and mining applications through sustainable solutions for fleet operators, including those deployed by Adani Group companies in sectors like cement, ports and logistics,” stated a media release.

Owned by the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), New Delhi, the project spans the islands of Kavaratti and Agatti, with a combined solar capacity of 1.7 MW and a 1.4 MWh battery storage facility at Kavaratti.
SunSource Energy executed the project on engineering, procurement & construction (EPC) basis.
The Lakshadweep Energy Development Agency (LEDA) will source power generated from these solar plants, marking the region’s shift from diesel-based power to a sustainable, eco-friendly energy source.
Over its projected technical lifetime, the initiative is expected to save around INR 250 crore by reducing the region’s diesel consumption by up to 190 lakh litres and lowering the existing electricity cost.
SunSource Energy, a subsidiary of the 125-year-old Dutch multinational SHV Energy, provides solar-based energy and storage solutions to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. Headquartered in Delhi NCR, the company manages the entire lifecycle of distributed solar projects, with a robust portfolio of projects deployed, contracted, and under development across 20+ states in India.
