The company is setting up a pressurized alkaline electrolyzer manufacturing facility with a capacity of 1 GW per annum. It will manufacture electrolyzers at this facility under a technology license from McPhy France.
“By the time this financial year runs out, we would have produced the first few electrolyzers,” said R. Shankar Raman, whole-time director and chief financial officer at Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
Raman said electrolyzers produced at their factory will have the potential to be a global product. The initial products are intended for use in the domestic market.
Last fiscal, Larsen & Toubro also forayed into the green hydrogen business by commissioning a pilot green hydrogen plant at its Hazira campus. The pilot plant produces 45 kg of high-purity green hydrogen daily. The company has also entered an MOU with Norway-based H2Carrier to develop floating green ammonia projects for industrial-scale applications.
Raman said 2024-25 would be a more appropriate time for Larsen & Toubro to size the opportunity in EPC for green hydrogen.
“So far as EPC is concerned, the world is beginning to come to terms with green hydrogen. It is still not, according to me, widely implemented. It is widely spoken. I think there is enough pressure in the system for people to get more green in their fuel efficiency and fuel usage, etc. So, this trend will begin to pick up,” said Raman.
Raman added that it might take up to three years for Larsen & Toubro to see some scaling up in this opportunity.

Solar supply chains have experienced unprecedented volatility, resulting in broken contracts, project delays, and frayed relationships between module suppliers and buyers. Upstream raw material vendors and global shippers have pressured module suppliers, and buyers have borne the brunt of unwanted consequences just to secure products.
While supply chains have recently shown signs of stability, suppliers are in no hurry to return to more neutral contracts. As such, it’s incumbent upon buyers to take proactive measures.
Suppliers may keep all options open until contract signing date, repeatedly revising terms. This can come as a surprise, particularly to buyers with limited recent procurement experience. The reasons vary from delays caused by over-utilized supplier staff to tactical and strategic considerations. Revisions can range from pricing to small details. Some suppliers accept terms and change them after initial payments. To mitigate such risks, buyers should diversify procurement efforts.
Cash-constrained suppliers may want payment in regular installments rather than the traditional down-payment and balance upon delivery. In the US, they might demand full payment before customs clearance, due to regulatory risks.
Whenever shipping terms allow, however, it’s advisable to avoid paying significant amounts before production or shipment. Buyers should insist on scheduling the last payment for each batch after delivery, as their leverage shrinks considerably once final payment is made.
Contracts usually stipulate products be delivered new and undamaged. This can be verified under the delivered duty paid (DDP) and delivered at place (DAP) Incoterms – terminology used to facilitate international trade – with visual evidence during unloading. However, suppliers may insist on payment even if products arrive damaged or even if the wrong product is shipped.
Buyers should insist on terms that ensure verification that deliveries meet agreed-upon specifications and are suitable for use, before final payment.
Suppliers have begun to require financial guarantees for delivered but temporarily unpaid products. However, it is not as widespread for suppliers to provide financial guarantees to buyers whose project success depends on timely delivery. Even if a supplier offers a down-payment guarantee, it may apply to a limited number of cases and exclude liquidated damages for delivery delay.
Although suppliers may disagree with providing widely applicable financial guarantees, buyers should carefully scrutinize guarantees they receive, including financial and parent company guarantees.
In ever-evolving PV supply chains, buyers may be unconcerned about the production location of their product until the supplier informs them about a delay caused by an original equipment manufacturer. They may not realize their order is the first to be produced at a newly built factory experiencing high defect rates.
It is crucial for buyers and sellers to align their interests to ensure the product is delivered without defects and meets all specifications at the first attempt.
Contracts should identify factories and both parties should verify their suitability, including certification, quality, and licenses, if applicable, before production begins, in order to minimize issues and delays. A detailed technical and quality exhibit should include ways to objectively evaluate quality controls, preparedness of production facilities, and product quality.
Serial defect warranties are now common in larger contracts. The premise is simple: if a certain percentage of modules exhibit the same type of defect from a common underlying cause, all affected modules should be replaced or repaired, regardless of whether the defect has yet occurred. However, some suppliers suggest alternative remedies that do not consider the entire population. They may propose to fix only the defective modules and “monitor” the rest, undermining the fundamental concept of a serial defect warranty.
Buyers should ensure the serial defect clause allows for dependably solving the underlying root cause, regardless of whether a defect has yet manifested, and may require that the remedy include reimbursement for labor costs during replacement.
In recent years, many contracts have included price indexing to address the volatile and generally increasing costs of polysilicon (or wafers or cells) and shipping. However, with cost declines now in progress or on the horizon, suppliers who previously insisted on such clauses have now largely abandoned this practice.
Buyers may now consider proposing price indexing clauses, which could be particularly beneficial for contracts with longer lead times. Suppliers are unlikely to accept indexation mechanisms without a floor, though, as they may pose significant risks.
Both suppliers and buyers must clearly understand – and have evidence of – the composition of the silica-based supply chain. Buyers should consider what remedies are necessary if an audit finds a breach or a shipment is unable to enter a project country. As the situation is continually evolving, both parties should agree on procedures in case of enforcement changes or third-party allegations.
There are two sides to every contract negotiation. Contracts may share certain standard practices but tweaking the finer details is key to minimizing your risks. Whether a buyer or seller, taking time to understand the other side’s priorities can help secure a deal that works for everyone.

The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for polysilicon manufactured outside China, declined for a fifth week running to $35.789 per kilogram (kg) on May 9, edging 0.12% lower on-week. The fundamentals of scant deals and limited availability continue to govern the market. A source who had concluded a recent transaction confirmed that it had no transactions into China at the moment with demand only coming from outside of China.

The situation of the hung global market clashes starkly with the domestic China polysilicon market. Average polysilicon prices there, assessed by OPIS as China Mono Grade, plummeted a steep 8.81% to CNY158.83 ($22.86)/kg this week. Sustained across eleven consecutive weeks, the drop highlights how China’s producers are under significant pressure, facing challenges of their own as they sit on surplus material that is tricky to clear.
A “price war” for polysilicon, according to one source, has already begun. Manufacturers are promoting second-grade polysilicon which is more difficult to sell, offering their product at lower prices because this part of their inventories has been accumulating since the third quarter of 2022.
Wafer output in May is expected to hit around 49-50 gigawatts (GW), according to one source. There is a widespread consensus in the market that wafer prices still have room to decrease because current wafer manufacturing output is sufficient and polysilicon prices upstream have continued to slip.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
