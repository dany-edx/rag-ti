As of 2020, India had deployed a rooftop solar capacity of 7,920 MW, with at least 75% of the installations done in the commercial and industrial segment.
New rooftop installation rate in the commercial and industrial segment was impacted in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. However, deployment is expected to bounce back this year as a new generation of technologies makes rooftop solar even more cost-effective for corporates looking to cut their electricity costs. 
“Adoption of onsite [rooftop] solar solutions is the low-hanging fruit for consumers that want to optimize their electricity costs or increase their procurement of renewable power,” said Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India at IEEFA.
“The pandemic has increased the price sensitivity of C&I consumers who already pay higher tariffs to cross-subsidize agricultural and residential consumers. Saving on electricity costs is absolutely critical for them.”
Falling PV module and battery prices make the transition to PV installations even more appealing. 
“Solar module and battery prices have already fallen, and with the government’s new Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic solar manufacturing, solar technology prices are expected to drop even further,” said Garg.
Other factors expected to boost the uptake of rooftop solar among C&I consumers are more accessible financing options and corporates wanting to switch to 100% renewable energy to meet their RE100 commitments.
The C&I segment is exploring bifacial and large-wafer, high-wattage (400+/500+Wp) modules to optimize costs and maximize output (kWh/m2), especially for sites with space constraints. 
The IEEFA-JMK report provides case studies of projects in India that have applied these emerging technologies.
“Some of these solutions such as higher-wattage modules and bifacial modules offer considerable value-addition in terms of energy generation,” said lead author Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.
The report notes that higher-wattage modules in onsite solar installations in India increase plant generation by 1% while reducing the cost of balance-of-system (PV system components except modules) by 1%. These benefits are particularly significant for space-constrained sites.
“As identified in the report’s case studies, bifacial modules increase total energy generation by 4-5% compared with a project equipped with monofacial modules, and so reduces the levelized cost of energy (LCOE),” said Gulia.
Battery storage, integration of solar PV with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are the other trends picking up pace.
The report expects the integration of battery storage in rooftop projects also to pick up pace as battery prices fall dramatically to US$100/kWh by 2023.
There is also a huge opportunity for rooftop solar+battery energy storage systems (BESS) to replace diesel gensets, which represent 90 GW of aggregate capacity in behind-the-meter applications in India.
According to IEEFA’s distributed energy resources (DER) specialist Gabrielle Kuiper, other nascent onsite technological models likely to be explored by developers in India include rooftop solar integrated with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and the adoption of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).
 “Government policy initiatives are already boosting the adoption of EVs,” said Kuiper. “Combining rooftop solar with storage and EVs is a cost-effective solution.
“And BIPV presents an attractive long-term opportunity for corporates that are planning to set up new commercial buildings and offices in India.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/28/electric-vehicles-now-account-for-1-of-overall-vehicles-annually-sold-in-india/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EV CHARGERS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 28, 2021",Electric vehicles account for 1% of overall vehicles annually sold in India,"India is registering a small but steady growth in the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). 
EVs accounted for about 1% of the overall vehicles sold over the last three years. And as of July 19, 2021, the total number of EVs registered in India over the last three years stood at about 520,000.
This information was shared by the road transport and highways minister in the Parliament recently. 
The government is promoting EV adoption through various schemes and incentives as it seeks to cut dependency on fossil fuels. 
As of July 9, 2021, the government, through its Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles (FAME) initiative, has supported the purchase of a total of 3,61,000 EVs with incentives cumulating to about INR 600 crore (US$ 81 million). Category-wise, the number of subsidized EVs included electric two-wheelers 2,35,000, electric three-wheelers 20,000 and electric four-wheelers 106,000. Further, 862 electric buses amounting to a demand incentive of about INR 492 crore were deployed as of June 30, 2021.
The FAME scheme was launched in 2015. At present, its second phase, with total budgetary support of INR 10,000 crore (US$ 1343 million), is being implemented for a period of five years w.e.f. April 1, 2019. 
FAME-II focuses on supporting the electrification of public and shared transportation. It aims to support, through subsidies, approx. 7,000 e-buses, 500,000 e-3Ws, 55,000 e-4W passenger cars and one million e-2Ws. In addition, it supports the creation of charging infrastructure to address range anxiety among EV users.
Under FAME Phase-II, overall 87,659 EVs (including e-2W, e-3W, and e-4W) have been supported till July 20, 2021, by way of incentive. Karnataka has sold the maximum number of EVs (19,270) with subsidy support under FAME-II. Tamil Nadu follows next with 13,515 EV sales.
A total of 2,877 EV charging stations with capital subsidy amounting to about INR 500 crore (US$ 67 million) have been sanctioned for 68 cities across 25 states and union territories under Phase II of the FAME India Scheme. Under Phase-I of the FAME India Scheme, 427 charging stations were installed. 
To promote EVs in the country, the Government has reduced GST on electric vehicles from 12% to 5% and GST on EV chargers/charging stations from 18% to 5%. Further, private charging at residences and offices is allowed as per a power ministry notification on charging infrastructure standards. The housing & urban affairs ministry has amended the Model Building Byelaws 2016 to establish charging stations and infrastructure in private and commercial buildings.
Battery-operated vehicles will be given green license plates and be exempted from permit requirements. Besides, States have been asked to waive road tax on EVs, which, in turn, will help reduce the initial cost of EVs.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/28/solar-manufacturers-warn-of-12-18-months-disruption-for-standalone-products/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JULY 28, 2021",Solar manufacturers warn of 12-18 months disruption for standalone products,"From pv magazine International
A survey of more than 30 off-grid solar product manufacturers has prompted predictions the disruption caused by materials shortages and raised shipping costs could continue throughout next year.
Netherlands-based off-grid solar body GOGLA – formerly the Global Off-grid Lighting Association – surveyed the suppliers of products such as solar lanterns, water pumps, TVs and fridges, as well as complete solar home systems (SHS’), last month, to ask about the impact of global chip shortages and other material-related issues.
Of the 24 companies which responded to a question about how long issues such as price rises, delayed deliveries, reduced product performance and stock shortfalls could continue, nine businesses said a year, eight said 18 months, and two respondents said two years. Five companies were more upbeat and predicted the turbulence would clear after the end of this year.
Although a well-publicized global shortage of chipsets and controllers – which feature in inverters – dominated manufacturer concerns, respondents to the GOGLA survey also mentioned rising polysilicon prices affecting solar panel production costs and an escalating copper price driving up the cost of cabling.
As a result, a dozen manufacturers said the performance of their products would be affected by material shortages, versus 15 respondents who said there would be no such impact. Changes to performance could include a need to “provide slightly less power [from] each [solar] module” as well as removing a dimmer feature for solar lights; replacing information displays showing remaining electricity credit with LEDs; and reducing cabling and mounting flexibility.
Manufacturers voiced concern about whether such changes to their products would affect the quality assurance guarantees issued by testing agency Verasol, given that can be a key requirement in the suitability of such items to receive donor funding.
With African installers having already told pv magazine about the rising project costs they are having to pass on to clients as a result of soaring shipping costs, respondents to the GOGLA questions predicted product price rises ranging from 9% for solar lanterns up to 52% for solar-powered TVs. An expected 14% price rise in the cost of full-service SHS’, and of 15% for water pumps, will cause further concern to NGOs aiming to get the world back on track with the fading UN ambition of universal access to electricity this decade.
Manufacturers also expect an 18% rise in the price of solar-powered fridges, a 16% hike in the cost of fans, and an 11% uplift in solar-powered multi-light systems, according to GOGLA, which announced the results of the survey this month.
In terms of supply disruption, manufacturers expected stock to be at its tightest for the rest of this year for SHS’, TVs and multi-light systems, although they predicted shortfalls will continue into next year. Solar water pumps are likely to be in short supply in the second half of next year, the respondents predicted. At present, manufacturers say, it is taking 2.5 weeks longer than usual to receive solar panels, there is a one-month delay in battery deliveries, and a 21-week hold-up for chipsets and controllers.
