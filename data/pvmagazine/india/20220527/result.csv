Indosolar, an Indian PV cell manufacturer, has incurred significant losses, eroding its net worth. As of March 31, 2021, it had a negative net worth of INR 99,779.49 ($1,285). Lenders initiated insolvency proceedings against Indosolar in October 2018 under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.
Waaree‘s acquisition of Indosolar will help it to expand its solar cell manufacturing capacity to 5.4 GW, from current plans for 4 GW. The deal will also complement its planned expansion into solar module manufacturing. Waaree expects to start manufacturing within about six months at the Indosolar plant. It said it now needs to assess the infrastructure, including utilities, and ensure that appropriate equipment for its expansion plans are in place.  
Waaree currently operates four PV module manufacturing facilities in India, in Surat, Chikhli, Tumb, and Nandigram. It has shipped solar modules to customers in 19 countries and has been ranked as a Tier-1 PV module manufacturer by BloombergNEF (BNEF) for four consecutive years, from 2018 to 2021. Recently, it was recognized as a top performer in PV Evolution Labs’ (PVEL) 2022 PV Module Reliability Scorecard.

The plant in the Indian state of Karnataka is part of a broader wind-solar hybrid project. It is installed on approximately 1,000 acres of land spanning three villages. The power will be consumed by JSW Steel under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
DeepBlue 3.0 modules boast an efficiency rating above 21.0% and a power output of up to 545 W, with a 72-cell configuration. They feature PERCIUM+, a PERC high-efficiency cell technology. They also use Ga-doped silicon wafers to effectively reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and increase customer revenue.
JA Solar had 95 GW of cumulative global shipments by the first quarter of this year, and its shipments to India continue to rise. In 2021, JA Solar’s share of the Indian market reached 17%. According to Mercom’s India Solar Export-Import Tracker, Indian solar imports surged 210% on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter. JA Solar once again ranked in the top three for PV module shipments.

Capital costs for 100 MWdc solar projects are set to rise 6% this year, according to one analyst.
US-owned Wood Mackenzie issued a note this week which also estimated China will add 75 GW of the 110 GW of new solar to arrive in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022.
The world will pass a terrawatt of solar generation capacity this year, the Edinburgh-based company added, and North America will see its share of the world’s new solar capacity double from the 11% recorded last year.
It was not clear from the note whether the project capital cost rise predicted would apply solely to the US.
The analyst said it had observed a “substantial amount of [solar] module volumes for utility scale projects” postponed after Californian manufacturer Auxin Solar in February lodged an anti-circumvention petition to the authorities.
Auxin has claimed Chinese companies are manufacturing products on home soil and only putting the final touches to them in Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia before labeling them as made in the latter-named nations to get around US anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
An anti-circumvention investigation is under way and Wood Mackenzie said the development is also prompting some manufacturers to shift “importer of record” responsibility onto panel buyers.
Germany will lead the European push for solar this decade, Wood Mackenzie predicted, because of a new governing coalition and the nation’s dependence on Russian gas.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means the Russia and Caspian Sea regions will add no new solar capacity this year, the analyst said.
Rising solar costs will be partially offset by plans to add, this year, production lines sufficient to produce an extra 200,000 metric tons of polysilicon per year, plus 1 GW more cells, 1 GW more wafers, and 500 MW more modules.
The analyst noted moves by India this year to tax solar imports and bolster domestic production would also “shift the pricing and supply dynamics in the US and India.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/27/solar-developers-buying-up-land-in-bangladesh/,"HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 27, 2022",Solar developers buying up land in Bangladesh,"From pv magazine Global
The rise of solar in Bangladesh has prompted some entrepreneurs to start buying up land before attending to the specifics of project development.
Imran Chowdhury, country manager for the Singaporean development unit of Chinese inverter maker Sungrow, told pv magazine land shortages in Bangladesh mean the company is addressing site concerns before plant development.
“Sungrow Renewables have plans to develop bankable IPP [independent power producer]-based solar project development in Bangladesh for providing affordable green energy to the national grid.” said Chowdhury.
The popularity of solar was reflected by an announcement by junior energy minister Nasrul Hamid that the government will approve more solar plans, above and beyond the 1.4 GW of generation capacity due to come online by 2025.
The planned pipeline of 28 under-construction projects includes sites which are ready to start commercial production and others at an advanced stage of building, according to industry insiders.
The largest of the announced projects are reportedly between 50 MW and 100 MW in size.
Addressing the fifth energy transition council ministerial meeting this week, Hamid said solar contributes 554 MW of the nation’s 788 MW of clean power generation capacity.
The politician said more than six million solar home systems supply electricity to 12% of Bangladesh’s 170 million people.
Net-metered rooftop solar arrays add up to 42 MW of capacity, Hamid said.
The junior minister said: “Special emphasis is given on [the] generation of green power in the next Power Sector Master Plan,” adding that strategy would outline the government’s next zero-carbon plan.
The minister noted clean energy is also a priority in the nation’s Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan.
Climate prosperity plans (CPPs) are being prepared by the nations of the Climate Vulnerable Forum of countries on the front line of the effects of rising temperatures.
Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina oversaw the forum’s first CPP as part of a bid to change the narrative from stressing the vulnerability of climate-affected nations to making them climate resilient.
The nation continues to attract overseas investment in clean power with Chinese developer Guopu Energy in November 2021 proposing to invest $50 million into Bangladeshi renewables.
Bangladesh plans to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables.
