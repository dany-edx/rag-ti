The Q2 2021 addition is a 53% increase compared to 341 MW installed in Q1 2021, and India’s highest-ever rooftop solar capacity installed in a quarter, according to Mercom India Research’s Rooftop Solar Market Report Q2 2021.
Installations were significantly higher than the previous quarter despite the second wave of the COVID-19 and related state lockdowns. The report cited targeted lockdowns and industry preparedness as the factors reducing the impact on installation activity this time around.
With Q2 addition, rooftop solar installations in the first half of the year have reached 862 MW, surpassing the total rooftop solar capacity installed in all of 2020 (719 MW) when the market was severely affected by COVID-19 lockdowns. 
The report forecasts if the market has no other adverse Covid-related events for the rest of the year, 2021 could turn out to be the second-largest year for rooftop solar after 2018.
“The rooftop solar segment had a strong quarter, and demand is up. Finalizing the net metering cap at 500 kW has removed uncertainty for installers and paved the way for future growth. However, haphazard rooftop solar policies across states and a lack of support from distribution companies are holding back the sector from realizing its true potential to bring in new investment, create jobs and drive the clean energy economy forward,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.
The Indian state of Gujarat led the rooftop solar installations in Q2, followed by Maharashtra and Haryana.

California-based provider of portable solar-plus-storage systems, Bluetti, has unveiled a new portable solution with a capacity of 6 kW/24.6 kWh, which is claimed to provide one hour of use from a space heater and 10 hours of use from a full-sized fridge.
The manufacturer said the power system can receive a solar input of 2.4 kW and is able to provide a seamless, uninterrupted power supply during power outages.
The solution consists of the company’s AC300 power station, with a capacity of 6 kW, that can be linked to Bluetti’s own portable solar modules, and a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery module, called the B300, with a storage capacity of 3.072 kWh.
“Bluetti AC300 is 100% modular and can accept up to four B300 battery modules per unit, adding up to a total of 12.288 kWh,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “While connected to two B300 battery modules, the AC300 can be charged with both solar and AC simultaneously, adding up to 5,400 W of power input.”
The AC300 unit weighs in at 21.6kg and comes with a 3 kW pure sine wave inverter which the manufacturer said is able to adjust the AC charging rate with no need for a power brick. It relies on a dual-core controller which combines digital and analog signals to control the MPPT module, the inverter and the DC-to-DC module. The system can be controlled through a specific application, via either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. 
According to Bluetti, the proposed solution operates at 35 decibels. By comparison, the sound produced by a typical washing machine is 70 decibels, the company added. Furthermore, Bluetti said the device requires minimal maintenance as it has not many moving parts, unlike fossil fuel generators. The AC300 paired with one B300 battery module costs $2,899, and a system with two B300s retails for $3,648.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/21/solar-on-new-build-homes-has-significantly-shorter-payback-period/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",MAX HALL,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2021",Solar on new-build homes has significantly shorter payback period,"From pv magazine International
The compelling economic case for global policymakers to follow the lead set by California in mandating solar on newly-built homes has been laid out in a report by U.S. analyst Bloomberg New Energy Finance and French electrical equipment company Schneider Electric.
The Realizing the Potential of Customer-sited Solar study claims the five-year payback period for solar arrays retrofitted onto buildings in the Golden State is halved for systems installed at the initial construction stage of buildings, because of reductions in marketing, sales, labor and construction costs. Thus, according to yesterday’s report, solar systems on new-builds in California can offer an internal rate of return (IRR) of 40% per year on their investment cost, rather than 20% IRR offered by retrofitted systems.
BloombergNEF and Schneider have calculated the 18.5% IRR for retrofitted solar systems in France could rise to as much as 28% if photovoltaics were to be made compulsory on new-build homes.
The thrust of the report is the need for legislators to introduce policies to unlock global rooftop solar potential which, the authors of the study claim, could drive 2 TW of household and commercial on-site solar by mid century, plus around 1 TWh of local energy storage.
France and California, together with Spain, Australia, and the U.S. state of New Jersey, were examined in the study, with the authors noting successful incentives had helped drive around 500 MW of rooftop PV in the former market by last year, with French businesses able to enjoy a nine-year payback for on-site commercial systems. The economics of home solar in Australia have prompted a wave of more than 2.5 GW of residential arrays.
The ability of residential and commercial energy storage systems to enable on-site solar to help balance the grid should also prompt politicians to encourage batteries, said BloombergNEF and Schneider, with policy nudges suggested including adjusted rates paid by utilities for excess power exported to the grid; time-of-use electricity prices, “aggregation” payments to homes and businesses for use of their storage systems; and demand charges levied on businesses for consuming electricity during peak hours.
In a nod to the initial feed-in tariffs offered for solar electricity in many markets as the technology first emerged – most of which were withdrawn at short notice, with some governments retroactively reneging upon contracts – the report cautioned legislators against laying down incentives which could fuel “an unsustainable boom,” given solar and storage technology appears set to get cheaper over time.
