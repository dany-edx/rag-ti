https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/10/solar-modules-to-face-40-customs-duty-cells-25-from-april-next-year/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 10, 2021","Solar modules to face 40% customs duty, and cells 25%, from next year","Solar module and cell imports are set to attract basic customs duty of 40% and 25%, respectively, from April 2022, as India’s finance ministry has given the green light to the proposal.
India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) today confirmed its proposal to impose the duties on cells and modules–with no “grandfathering” exceptions for projects which have already been tendered–had been agreed by the Ministry of Finance. Quoting the latter, the MNRE said customs notification of the move would be issued in due course.
The 25% levy on cells will replace a 14.5% safeguarding duty on products from China, Vietnam, and Thailand which is due to expire on July 30.
Pinaki Bhattacharyya, chief executive and MD of the Indian division of Canadian solar developer Amp Energy Group said the imposition of customs duty would raise costs for domestic solar manufacturers as well as project developers, raising energy costs.
“This move will slow down the race towards the 175 GW target, by 2022,” said Bhattacharyya, referring to the national renewable energy capacity ambition. “Although this removes considerable uncertainty … the rates are too high and will increase the cost of solar power for discoms [electricity distribution companies] and consumers alike. This will increase the cost of manufacturing power as well as [power for] other industries in India. [Though] the government’s intent is positive, and they want to encourage domestic manufacturing, the method should have been different. The government should have provided direct manufacturing subsidies to manufacturers to help them scale up their capacities and this would have been beneficial to the sector.”
The extent to which Indian solar depends on imported components was illustrated by the slump in new project capacity last year as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted shipments. The government is applying the customs duties to help domestic manufacturers compete with regional rivals and avoid such supply chain problems in future.
Under the Paris Climate Change Agreement, India has committed to achieving 40% of its electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030. The nation aims to install 100 GW of solar capacity by next year as part of a 175 GW clean energy fleet, en route to a planned 450 GW of renewables capacity this decade.
The Optimum Energy Mix report drawn up by government advisory body the Central Electricity Authority states India’s electricity requirement by 2029-30 will be 817 GW, including the 450 GW from renewable energy sources, out of which, 280 GW would come from solar. The nation would have to add around 25 GW of new solar annually to hit that target.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/10/longi-solar-was-indias-biggest-module-provider-in-2020/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MONO PERC,CHINA,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 10, 2021",LONGi Solar was India’s biggest module provider in 2020,"China-based LONGi Solar has been ranked as India’s leading module supplier by JMK Research based on the shipments in the year 2020.
The high-efficiency mono-crystalline solar cells and modules supplied over 1,500 MW (DC) modules to India last year, accounting for over 15% share of the total 9,478 MW shipments. LONGi, with a 15.6% share, was followed by rival Jinko (12.7%) and Adani (10.2%), according to JMK Research report.
In addition to claiming the top supplier slot for utility projects, it gained a good market share in the rooftop solar market. 
The vertically integrated solar player, which started its Indian footprint in 2019, bagged the top supplier title in a short span of less than two years.
“2020 is a memorable year for LONGi’s business in India. We sincerely thank all our partners and customers who made this possible. In 2020, LONGi was also ranked number one in terms of global shipment. LONGi is the highest investor in the PV Industry on R&D and we work tirelessly to provide our customers with the best technology for their projects,” said Pradeep Kumar, director India and Sri Lanka for LONGi’s Solar division.
JMK’s quarterly solar reports show 2020 was the first year when shipments of high-efficiency monocrystalline PERC modules in India overtook multi-crystalline modules. 
“Key factors contributing to this significant market shift from multi to mono are the narrowing price differences between the two, higher efficiency of mono modules, and the complete shift to mono production by leading Chinese suppliers,” read a statement by LONGi Solar.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/10/sharp-develops-445-w-half-cut-panels-for-large-scale-pv/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 10, 2021",Sharp develops 445 W half-cut panels for large scale PV,"From pv magazine International
Sharp has launched the NU-JD445 solar panel, a half-cut monocrystalline PERC product with a 20.1% efficiency rate and 445 W of power output.
The new product relies on nine-busbar technology, which should make the modules less susceptible to micro-cracks. Like all half-cell modules from the Japanese manufacturer, the products have three small junction boxes, each equipped with a bypass diode. These enclosures transfer less heat to the upper cells, which helps to extend the lifetime of panels while improving overall system performance, it is claimed.
The panel has a size of 2,108×1,048mm and a weight of 25kg. The module is suitable for a system voltage of up to 1,500 V and has a temperature coefficient of -0.347% per degree Celsius.
