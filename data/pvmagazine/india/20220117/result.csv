https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/01/17/pli-scheme-for-battery-cells-receives-bids-for-130-gwh-of-capacity/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 17, 2022",PLI Scheme for battery cell manufacturing receives bids for 130 GWh of capacity,"The Indian Ministry of Heavy Industries’ tender to develop a cumulative 50 GWh of advance-chemistry battery cell manufacturing units in India under its production-linked incentive scheme has received bids for 130 GWh of capacity.
Bids were received from a total of ten companies, including Reliance New Energy Solar Limited, Hyundai Global Motors, Ola Electric Mobility, Lucas-TVS, Mahindra & Mahindra, Amara Raja Batteries, Exide Industries, Rajesh Exports, Larsen & Toubro, and India Power Corporation.
Under the Scheme, the selected bidders will have to set up the manufacturing facility within two years from the appointed date. The incentive will be disbursed thereafter over a period of five years on the sale of batteries manufactured in India.
The PLI Scheme for battery storage, with a budgetary outlay of INR 18,100 crore (around US$ 2438 million), is intended to achieve greater domestic value addition, while at the same time ensuring that the levelized cost of battery manufacturing in India is globally competitive.
Commenting on the bidding response, Rahul Walawalkar, founder and president, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) said, “This is great news and a major milestone for the Indian energy storage and e-mobility industry… IESA was anticipating 2-3 bids of 15-20 GWh, 3 bids of 10+ GWh and another 3-4 bids of 5-10 GWh totaling 100 GWh+ capacity to be bid in the ACC PLI.”
IESA estimates the annual demand for ACC batteries in India to grow from under 10 GWh currently to over 50 GWh by 2025 and over 150 GWh by 2030. Thus, Walawalkar said, the ACC PLI Scheme will be seen as the foundation stone on which India builds a global hub for R&D and manufacturing of advanced energy storage technologies.
“ACC PLI program also will kick start investments in the supply chain as the program has a mandate of minimum 60% domestic value addition for receiving the government incentive,” said Debi Prasad Dash, Executive Director, India Energy Storage Alliance.
Currently, battery storage finds use in sectors like consumer electronics, electric vehicles, storage for renewable energy, data centres, which are expected to witness robust growth in the coming years, and with that, the demand for battery storage is expected to surge. As per Indian government estimates, India imports INR 20,000 crore (around US$2694 million) worth of battery storage equipment every year. If, through PLI in ACC battery storage, advanced battery storage technologies can be manufactured domestically, India can significantly reduce its reliance on imports and become a key supplier for advanced storage technologies for driving the growth of green energy and clean transportation around the globe.

Accordingly, only the models and manufacturers included in the ALMM list will be eligible for use in government projects, government-assisted projects, projects under government schemes and programs, open access, and net-metering projects, installed in the country. 
These include projects set up for sale of electricity to the Government under the Guidelines issued by Central Government under Section 63 of Electricity Act, 2003 and projects under Component A of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) program.
The MNRE, in its drive towards reducing India’s dependence on solar imports and achieving self-reliance, had made it mandatory for solar module manufacturers to get registered under the ALMM to be eligible for a wide range of government-backed projects.
The decision on expanding the ALMM scope has been lauded by representatives from North India Module Manufacturers Association (NIMMA), Indian Solar Manufacturers Association (ISMA), All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), and industry leaders.
Welcoming the decision, Hitesh Doshi – President, All India Solar Industries Association said, “We are thankful to the government for taking this step which will help consumers to get better quality and reliable supplier, lenders and investors will have more confidence on their investment as modules are a major and most important component of solar power projects. Domestic Industry is suffering for a long time due to almost 90% of imports of solar modules. Local manufacturing capacity in India, which is more than our requirement, now will have some business.
Manish Gupta, President, North India Module Manufacturers Association (NIMMA), said, “The move will help provide necessary ammunition to the Make in India movement. It will also help smaller manufacturers expand capacities and improve business as the industry will see an uptake in demand.”
Bharat Bhut, cofounder and director, Goldi Solar, a Gujarat-based solar manufacturer, said, “The ALMM policy amendment by MNRE is a significant announcement in the interest of all stakeholders. The announcement has come at an appropriate time, just when BCD [basic customs duty] will be implemented. The combined effect of both these policies will be massive, and I am sure India will grow to become a solar manufacturing hub in the coming years.”

Lithium-oxygen, or lithium-air batteries (LABs), are one of many pathways to improving today’s energy storage technologies. Lithium and other metal-air batteries are favored in research for their potential for high energy densities, but low efficiency and poor cycle lifetimes have proven to be tough obstacles to overcome in developing such technologies.
With this in mind, scientists from Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science and Softbank have developed a rechargeable lithium-air battery. They claim it has an energy density that greatly exceeds that of conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Like other LABs built at the research level, the Japanese consortium’s battery relies on lithium for the negative electrode and oxygen for the positive porous carbon electrode. The 10-cell stacked device has a size of 4 cm x 5 cm and single-layered cells with a 2 cm x 2 cm electrode.
“In the stacked cell configuration, oxygen needs to be transported in the horizontal direction in the gas diffusion layer,” the scientists explained. “Then, oxygen needs to be further transported to the vertical direction to go through the whole part of the positive electrode.”
When operated at room temperature, the champion battery exhibited a weight energy density of 500 Wh/kg, which is about twice that of current lithium-ion batteries. The performance has been described as the highest in the world in terms of energy density and number of cycles.
“Although there are many reports that demonstrate the successful operation of a LAB with prolonged discharge/charge processes for more than 100 cycles, their energy density at the practical cell level was lower than 50 W h kg−1. In contrast, for the LABs with an energy density over 300 W h kg−1, the cycle number was less than 20 cycles,” the researchers said.
They claim that the storage device has potential applications in residential power storage systems, electric vehicles, drones, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. They described it in “Criteria for evaluating lithium-air batteries in academia to correctly predict their practical performance in industry,” which was recently published in Materials Horizons.
