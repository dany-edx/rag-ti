The INR 596 crore ($75 million) project will come up at the Omkareshwar reservoir in Khandwa district.
NHDC started accepting bids for the project earlier this year. It awarded the project to Tata Power Solar Systems through a tariff-based competitive bidding process. It is scheduled for commissioning within 13 months from the award of the contract.
Upon completion, the project will supply electricity to M.P. Power Management Co. Ltd.
With this win, Tata Power Solar’s total utility-scale solar project portfolio has reached 9.8 GWp. Its total order book now stands at INR 14,908 crore.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/14/battery-energy-storage-systems-as-an-alternative-to-diesel-generators/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TAMIL NADU",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Battery energy storage systems as an alternative to diesel generators,"A new study by Auroville Consulting compares Li-ion-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) and conventional diesel generator (DG) sets as power backup solutions for commercial and industrial (C&I) entities in Tamil Nadu. It evaluated the economic and environmental performance of the two systems and proposes BESS charged with solar as the most attractive power backup option. 
For the analysis, the analysts assumed a load for the C&I entity and simulated four different scenarios based on the fuel cost and different electricity tariffs in Tamil Nadu. They compared the levelized cost of generation (LCOE) for the DG set and the levelized cost for storage (LCOS) of the BESS for different simulations of backup while considering a range of capital costs. 
The results indicate that the LCOE of DG sets varies between INR 49.58/kWh ($0.62) to INR 57.63/kWh. The LCOS of BESS varies between INR 39.71-61.72/kWh when charged at a solar tariff of INR 3.95/kWh. When charged at an industrial tariff of INR 6.67/kWh, the LCOS of BESS varies between INR 43.71-65.71/kWh, and when charged at a commercial tariff of INR 8.40/kWh, it varies between INR 46.25-68.25/kWh. 
The LCOE of the DG set is found to be most vulnerable to diesel prices, while the LCOS of the BESS is largely dictated by the market prices of the Li-ion battery packs.
When considering the average capital costs of both backup systems, the analysis indicates that the per unit cost of energy from a BESS charged at the solar tariff is the most economical option for all hours of autonomy. 
The per unit cost of DG is less than the per unit cost of BESS when charged from the grid at the industrial and commercial tariff for all hours of backup. However, the analysts stated, the BESS can become a more economical backup option even when charged from the grid if the state government shifts the subsidy from DG generators to BESS. (In Tamil Nadu, the state government provides capital subsidy on DG generators for medium, small, and micro enterprises.)
The BESS and DG were also assessed in terms of externalities. Emission levels for BESS varied depending on the source of electricity used to charge the system. BESS charged with solar provides the cleanest form of backup power since no emissions are generated during power generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/14/yotta-energy-unveils-new-3-phase-microinverters/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2022",Yotta Energy unveils new 3-phase microinverters,"From pv magazine Global
US storage system manufacturer Yotta Energy has unveiled a new dual-power, three-phase microinverter for commercial rooftop PV applications.
“The new DPI microinverters will be available in both 208 V and 480 V versions and will incorporate several key features, including integrated phase monitoring/phase balancing, NEC 2020 690.12 rapid shutdown compliance, and UL 1741-SA (Rule 21) compliance,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “Each DPI supports four high-capacity solar modules.”
The inverters measure 359 mm x 242 mm x 46 mm and weigh 6 kg. They have a peak efficiency of 96.5% and a nominal maximum power point tracking (MPPT) efficiency of 99.5%.
The operating voltage range is between 26 V and 60 V and the maximum input voltage is 60 V. The maximum continuous output power for the 208 V device is 1,728 VA and 1,800 VA for the 480 V product. The inverters also feature cooling systems based on natural convection and come with 10-year warranties that are extendable to 25 years, the manufacturer stated.
“This utility-interactive microinverter has Reactive Power Control (RPC) technology that exceeds recent NEC Rapid Shutdown requirements” the company said. “Microinverters are a safe bet over high-voltage string inverters and eliminate the risk for DC arc faults.”
The inverters are manufactured in Taiwan for Yotta Energy under a strategic original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partnership with Seattle-based microinverter specialist APsystems.
