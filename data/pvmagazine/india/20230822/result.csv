Researchers can deposit phase heterojunctions on solid substrates to enable durable PV installations, or on flexible substrates for applications such as portable electronics or the Internet of Things. The key benefit of the phase heterojunction approach lies in its use of a single material on both sides of the junction, albeit in distinct crystalline phases. This eliminates the necessity for doping and mitigates the adverse effects of ion migration.
The research team selected the β- and γ-phases of CsPbI3 perovskite material to form the two polymorphs. The approach involved combining the anti-solvent-free dynamic-hot-air (DHA) processed β−CsPbI3 front absorber with the triple-source thermally evaporated γ−CsPbI3 rear absorber in a simple phase-heterojunction configuration, explained Sawanta S. Mali, the corresponding author of the study. This DHA method enhances the quality of inorganic perovskite thin films and improves device performance under ambient conditions.
To establish phase stability in the β−CsPbI3 front cell, the researchers introduced a Zn(C6F5) molecular additive. For the γ−CsPbI3 rear cell, they employed triple-source guanidinium iodide (GAI)-assisted thermal evaporation deposition. The addition of a small amount of GAI led to enhancements in morphology, optoelectronic properties, efficiency, and stability.
The device exhibited remarkable performance metrics, including a power conversion efficiency of 21.59%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.220 V, a short-circuit current of 21.72 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 81.5. The team also underscored the excellent stability of the encapsulated device, which retained more than 90% of its initial efficiency after 200 hours of storage under ambient conditions.
The researchers described the solar cell and the related manufacturing process in “Phase-heterojunction all-inorganic perovskite solar cells surpassing 21.5% efficiency,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. The research team includes academics from the Chonnam National University in South Korea, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Pennsylvania State University in the United States, and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
“In future work, different polymorphic phases of either organic−inorganic and/or all-inorganic halide perovskites could also be the best alternatives for highly efficient PHS devices,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/22/unveiling-indias-carbon-credit-revolution-from-local-initiatives-to-global-impact/,"CLIMATE CHANGE,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COST AND PRICES,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY EFFICIENCY,GREEN BUILDING,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,WORLD",,"AUGUST 22, 2023",Unveiling India’s carbon credit revolution: From local initiatives to global impact,"Carbon credits serve as a potent market-driven incentive, effectively catalyzing the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These credits operate within the framework of international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, thriving within carbon markets where projects designed to curtail emissions yield tradeable credits. These credits, in turn, can be purchased by entities seeking to offset their own emissions, thereby showcasing their unwavering commitment to fostering sustainability. The proportion of global annual greenhouse gas emissions covered by carbon credits has risen from 5% in 2005 to 22% in 2022.

However, the attainment of carbon credits is a formidable achievement, as projects undergo rigorous evaluation by impartial auditors to ensure strict adherence to established standards. Upon successful verification, these credits are introduced into various markets, effectively directing investments toward emission reduction initiatives and sustainable undertakings, particularly within developing nations.
Beyond their symbolic significance, these credits carry tangible benefits, acting as a catalyst in propelling the global transition towards a low-carbon future. By attaching quantifiable value to emission reductions, they serve to invigorate international collaboration in the ongoing battle against climate change. The adoption and incorporation of carbon credits into our practices signify an inspiring journey towards safeguarding our planet and embracing an eco-friendly, sustainable tomorrow.
The popularity of the credits could be estimated by the fact that India alone has a market share of 17% globally with 35.94 million USD currently (the global market stands at 2 billion). By some estimates, the global carbon credits market would reach 100 billion USD by the end of 2030 as per Confederation of Indian Industry. It has also been estimated by MarketsAndMarkets that global market size would reach 1,602 billion $.

The world of carbon credits thrives under international climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, incentivising greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Diverse emission reduction projects, from renewable energy to waste management, undergo rigorous validation to ensure authenticity. Once verified, carbon credits are issued based on reduced CO2e emissions.
These credits take centre stage in carbon markets, where they can be traded voluntarily or for compliance purposes.
Revenue generated from credit sales supports sustainable development and further investment in emission reduction projects. The market dynamics influence carbon credit prices, while their co-benefits include job creation, improved air quality, and advancements toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This captivating symphony of carbon credits urges humanity toward a brighter, more sustainable future.
In India, the carbon credit system operates primarily under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The process of carbon credit generation and trading follows a structured flow, adhering to guidelines set by relevant regulatory bodies. The journey begins with Project Identification and Development, where projects contributing to GHG emission reduction are selected. These encompass renewable energy projects, energy efficiency improvements, and waste management schemes, aligning with CDM and regulatory criteria.
The Project Design Document (PDD) is pivotal, outlining the project’s objectives, methodologies, baseline emissions, additionality assessment, and emissions reductions. Validation and Verification are critical turning points, with designated Operational Entities (DOEs) conducting independent assessments and rewarding projects that meet criteria with validation reports. Implementation and Monitoring are essential, with robust systems ensuring accurate emission reduction reporting. Verification and Certification culminate in Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issuance based on verified emission reductions.
Carbon Credit Trading showcases CERs’ value, drawing entities to offset emissions or meet regulatory commitments. Retirement or Surrender of CERs concludes the journey, ensuring the integrity of emissions accounting. The effectiveness of the system is amplified by the Types of Projects Allowed Under the Carbon Credits Scheme, including Renewable Energy Projects, Energy Efficiency Projects, Waste Management Projects, and Afforestation Projects.
Indian authorities governing carbon credits play a vital role. The Designated National Authority (DNA) endorses projects and provides approval. The CDM Executive Board oversees global projects, ensuring compliance and issuing CERs. Accredited Operational Entities (AOEs) validate and verify projects, while the National CDM Authority coordinates projects within India, offering guidance and support.
While the carbon credit market in India is still in its early stages, it is growing rapidly. As of now, several players issue carbon credits in India:
• The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI): This think tank has issued over 3 million carbon credits from its projects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors.
• The World Resources Institute (WRI): This non-profit organization has issued over 2 million carbon credits from its projects in the forestry sector.
The carbon credits that these entities have issued can be traded on a variety of exchanges, including the Chicago Climate Exchange, the European Climate Exchange, and the Intercontinental Exchange. Some of the trading places for carbon credits in India are:
• National Stock Exchange (NSE): The NSE launched a carbon trading platform in 2017.
• Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE): The BSE launched a carbon trading platform in 2018.
• Power Exchange India (PXIL): The PXIL launched a carbon trading platform in 2020.
As more and more companies and organisations look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, the demand for carbon credits is expected to increase.
In the fight against climate change, carbon credits play a significant role in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. The process starts with Project Identification and Development, where projects for emissions reduction are chosen, adhering to country-specific guidelines.
A crucial step involves preparing a comprehensive Project Design Document (PDD) outlining project objectives, methodologies, baseline emissions, additionality assessment, and anticipated reductions. Validation and Verification by accredited Operational Entities (DOEs) ensure compliance and project eligibility. Following approval, projects implement and monitor activities, reporting emissions reductions accurately. Verification and Certification by thirdparty verifiers lead to the issuance of carbon credits, held in central registries.
Carbon Credit Trading allows developers to trade credits in carbon markets, enabling entities to offset emissions.
Retirement or Surrender of Carbon Credits demonstrates compliance with reduction commitments, ensuring emissions accounting integrity. Regulatory bodies like the EPA (US), BEIS (UK), European Commission, and CER (Australia) oversee carbon credit programs. A variety of projects, from renewable energy to afforestation, contribute to global emissions reduction efforts.
Collectively, these countries incentivize emissions reductions, promoting sustainability for a low-carbon future. Carbon credits prove a powerful tool in combating climate change, inspiring global commitment to environmental preservation. Carbon Pricing Mechanisms have seen a monumental rise since its advent in 1990 as can be seen in figure 2 as per World Bank which clearly shows that companies around the world has embraced carbon credits.

The Indian carbon credit system, operating under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), stands ahead in several aspects:
1. Extensive Use of CDM: India actively utilizes the CDM framework, registering numerous emission reduction projects. Leading in CDM project registrations reflects its proactive stance in adopting clean technologies and attracting international investments.
2. Emphasis on Sustainable Development: India’s system prioritises sustainable development co-benefits. Projects generating carbon credits must showcase positive impacts on social, economic, and environmental aspects, aligning emission reductions with broader development goals.
3. Inclusion of Diverse Project Types: India’s system covers a wide range of projects, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management, and afforestation. This comprehensive approach ensures emissions reduction across sectors.
4. National CDM Authority: India has a dedicated authority facilitating and coordinating CDM projects. It streamlines processes, provides guidance, and enhances efficiency.
5. Integration of Policies and Incentives: India implements policies like feed-in tariffs and renewable purchase obligations, creating a favourable environment for renewable energy projects and incentivizing emission reductions, fostering the carbon credit market’s growth.
The Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), outlined in the draft by the Ministry of Power, stands as a pivotal force shaping India’s regulatory framework concerning carbon credits. A significant stride in this direction was taken through the introduction of the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill in 2022, which established the groundwork for the forthcoming Indian carbon credit market. The draft blueprint envisions the establishment of the India Carbon Market Governing Board (ICMGB) as the central entity responsible for the oversight and regulation of the carbon credit market.
This board boasts representation from critical ministries including Environment, Forest, and Climate Change; Power; Finance; New and Renewable Energy; Steel; and Coal. The multifaceted responsibilities of the ICMGB encompass policy formulation, regulatory framework establishment, and trading criteria definition for carbon credit certificates.
Playing a key role within this framework, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) assumes the roles of both the ICM Administrator and Secretariat for the ICMGB. The BEE will be entrusted with devising protocols and processes for project registration under the voluntary mechanism, devising trajectories and objectives for entities operating within the compliance mechanism, as well as the issuance of carbon credit certificates. Additionally, the Bureau will be instrumental in crafting mechanisms to ensure market stability, alongside delineating procedures for Accredited Carbon Verifiers.
The role of the ICM Registry, tasked with maintaining meticulous transaction records and establishing links with other registries, falls under the purview of the Grid Controller of India Limited. Overseeing trading activities and safeguarding the interests of both sellers and buyers, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is designated as the ICM Trading Regulator. The draft underscores the significance of the compliance mechanism, which obligates entities to curtail GHG emission intensity in adherence to established norms. Complementing this is the envisioned voluntary mechanism, designed for non-obligated entities to enrol on projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions and thereby acquiring carbon credit certificates.
India’s approach gained traction subsequent to COP26, marked by the identification of 12 GHG mitigation activities eligible for trading within the ambit of the Paris Agreement’s Article 6.2 mechanism. This endeavour is oriented towards the creation of a robust domestic market that bridges financial gaps concerning the nation’s ongoing energy transition. Through these initiatives, India showcases a steadfast commitment to the decarbonization of its economy and the fostering of sustainable development in the collective mission to combat climate change.

The company recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop four pumped hydro storage projects aggregating to 7 GW in the State of Maharashtra. It has also entered into MoUs with Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Odisha state governments to develop pumped storage projects. 
NHPC expects its first pumped storage commissioning by the year FY 2028-29, which will be located in Maharashtra.
“Once you start the construction activity [for any pumped storage plant] on the ground, it is going to take not less than four to five years. So, that is after the start of construction activities, but before that, there are certain investigation matters, certain clearances, and certain compliances. So, all that we have started doing. That period is something like one to one-and-a-half years,” informed RK Vishnoi, chairman and managing director of NHPC.
“There are four states where we have already moved ahead, and this is going to be one big business opportunity for NHPC in the near future…Our teams are there on the ground, they have started working on this. So, pumped storage is going to be the mainstay for NHPC now in the near future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/22/deployment-trumps-solar-manufacturing-in-eu-priorities/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,WORLD",,"AUGUST 22, 2023",Deployment trumps solar manufacturing in EU priorities,"From pv magazine 07-08/23
China has dominated the solar module supply chain for the last 15 years but the status quo is shifting as multiple emerging factors pose a threat to the nation’s dominant position. These include increasing scrutiny of solar supply chain sustainability and traceability along with a growing global subsidy race, with the United States, India, and European Union announcing plans to provide funding support to their own manufacturers.
A suite of policy levers has recently been used by global markets to support the growth of domestic PV manufacturing directly and indirectly, including the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the Basic Customs Duty and Production Linked Incentive scheme in India.
At the policy level, Europe is lagging. The REpowerEU initiative sets ambitious 2030 targets for renewables but does not say much about supporting local manufacturing. The recent Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) proposal aims to spur local manufacturing. While that is a step ahead, it could take up to two years before the European Commission approves the policy. In other words, the European Union has set very ambitious targets for renewables installations in Europe until 2030 but such targets will not automatically increase demand for products manufactured locally.
The United States is ahead in timing and financial support so US incentives have the potential to become a risk for European manufacturing to scale up as the country is already pulling investment resources from major players. That risk increases the longer it takes to get EU policy and incentives firmed up.
To provide some context, the EU is targeting a minimum of 45% self-sufficiency across all manufacturing nodes despite the fact there is currently almost no ingot or wafer capacity to process polysilicon in Europe. It would require the building of more than 40 GW of annual ingot, wafer, and cell capacity – plus another 30 GW of module capacity – to reach these targets.
To have any chance to get anywhere near this ambitious target, the European Union would need to introduce a combination of high manufacturing incentives and barriers of entry for lower-cost imports (such as its proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism to punish products with higher carbon footprints) as well as potentially setting quotas for local content in public tenders.
The large production cost gap between regions is the biggest challenge to overcome to spur local module supply chain manufacturing. A recent S&P Global Commodity Insights report revealed production costs in Europe could be as much as 50% higher than in mainland China – mostly thanks to higher EU power prices and labor costs.
The recent low-price module environment could become another unexpected hurdle to the reshoring of European module supply chains. High polysilicon prices have kept module costs elevated in the last two years, closing the gap between best-cost manufacturing locations in mainland China, Southeast Asia, and other regions (including Europe and the US). If the anticipated low module prices return, it will make onshoring module supply chain manufacturing increasingly challenging.
Local manufacturers could be competitive in other dimensions, however. European module production costs are higher compared with other regions but may hold advantages due to a reduced carbon intensity of the end products. This sustainability dimension will be particularly relevant given the current trend to tax imported materials and components with higher carbon footprints. European governments could also set quotas for locally-made, low-carbon content in public tenders – the current NZIA proposal includes a clause related to carbon footprint and equipment origin for public tenders plus a 15% to 20% sustainability and resilience weight-scoring system.
Another dimension where EU manufacturers can be competitive concerns technology. There are opportunities for EU manufacturers to lead the development of new technology such as perovskites or new wafer technologies with lower cost production methods and higher efficiencies. Partnerships have emerged in several European markets aiming to commercialize next-generation cells and modules based on silicon-perovskite tandem technology. These ongoing research partnerships could promote European technological leadership across emerging cell and wafer technology, enabling a lower levelized cost of energy and reduced supply-chain risk.
Despite all the policy uncertainty, there were around 20 GW of module manufacturing capacity announcements in Europe to May plus a surge of new announcements in the last few weeks. These figures show evidence of new manufacturing activity in markets including Romania, Germany, France, and Italy. Even if all these announcements come online, however, Europe would still be highly dependent on imported cells from mainland China or Southeast Asian countries.Recent discussions at the Intersolar Europe exhibition confirmed this view. Few among the main industry stakeholders (developers, utilities, investors, supply-chain companies) expect any major reshoring of module supply chain capacity in the next few years. The general industry view is that the European Union will prioritize the achievement of ambitious renewables deployment targets to 2030, ahead of reshoring-manufacturing ambitions that would make the energy transition more expensive.

German solar module maker Heckert Solar, PV product distributor Wattkraft and Europe’s largest solar glass manufacturer Intefloat have unveiled a plan to build a vertically-integrated solar module production across several locations in Germany.
The consortium said it will invest around €2 billion ($2.18 billion) in the manufacturing facilities.
Thanks to this new investment, Heckert Solar’s existing manufacturing plant in Langenwetzendorf, Thuringia, will see its capacity increase from 400 MW to 2.8 GW. Furthermore, the consortium will build a 5 GW facility to produce polysilicon and solar cells at a facility owned by Heckert Solar in Frankfurt am Oder, eastern Germany.
Moreover, Interfloat is planning to produce antimony-free, low-iron, textured solar glass for the combined value-added chain at one of its industrial sites in Brandenburg.
The consortium also said the new production facilities will manufacture glass-glass modules with an efficiency of 24% and a carbon footprint below 18 grams/kWh, which it says complies with the highest ESG sustainability standards.
The three companies did not reveal more details about the project.
