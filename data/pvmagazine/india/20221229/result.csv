Inverter-based resources such as solar and wind are replacing conventional synchronously coupled generators throughout the whole power production system. An increase in the demand for battery energy storage systems that can produce long-term reliability and efficiency goes hand in hand with this trend.
New technology is evolving to supplement resources from nuclear and fossil fuels as well as renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy, as energy storage becomes an essential component of the entire grid. Utilising many energy generation sources without interrupting the supply of electricity during periods when renewable energy production is low will increase resilience.
In addition to becoming the talk of the power production business, battery energy storage systems (BESS) cut across as crucial for achieving net-zero sustainable energy targets. Let’s recap the key battery storage trends in 2022.
India, China, and South-East Asian nations play a significant role in the rapidly expanding worldwide battery swapping business. The Government of India has recommended this technology in their yearly budget for 2021–22.
Battery switching is a system that allows customers to swap their worn-out car batteries for brand-new ones that have been completely charged. The demand on the electric grid is reduced while the charging time is greatly reduced, thanks to this technology. The technology currently only permits integration in two- and three-wheeled vehicles.
Although the Indian strategy-builder Niti Aayog hasn’t provided any specific figures about anticipated subsidies and investments in the technology, one can make an educated guess based on how quickly the technology is gaining traction.
Every Electric Vehicle on the road needs a source of energy. The electrolyte makes up the majority of the weight of the battery, therefore replacing it will make the battery lighter overall.
The weight of the battery pack is greatly decreased by solid-state batteries since the liquid electrolyte is replaced with a solid electrolyte such as glass or ceramic. Additionally, because solid-state batteries are significantly smaller, battery makers can stack more cells per square metre. When liquid electrolytes are exposed to high temperatures, a phenomenon called as vaporisation occurs, which causes the liquid to convert to gas and causes the battery pack to burn.
At higher temperatures, solid-state batteries work significantly more safely and can support heavier loads. Due to this fact, battery manufacturers are shifting towards incorporating solid-state batteries in their pursuit of accomplishing optimised energy storage efficiency.
The main technology used in both BESS and EVs is lithium-ion. 2022 was noteworthy in that it marked the beginning of the industry’s pursuit of novel battery chemistries. These include iron-air batteries, flow batteries, and sodium-ion batteries. These battery technologies are progressively advancing to the commercial production stage, however they are not yet at the same level as lithium-ion.
The pick of these is actually flow batteries, which have a limitless energy capacity and a longer life cycle than their lithium-ion rivals. Before flow batteries are profitable from a commercial standpoint, more work needs to be done.
Flow batteries can be set up as single tanks, which are typically used for smaller applications, or as twin tanks, which are typically on larger footprints. Flow battery system designs vary based on the use and scope of the project. More relatively small flow battery facilities are anticipated to be erected in the near future until a significant commercial track record is established and use cases, costs, and returns on investment are validated.
EVs have more robust battery requirements than conventional markets, and batteries significantly degrade within the first five years of operation. The batteries may not meet EV criteria at that point, but they still have a long serviceable life. In stationary energy storage applications like reserve energy storage, which only require rare battery cycling, they can be given a second chance at life.
Battery packs can be modified, recycled, and optimised for a second life while retaining roughly 70–80% of their original capacity. Consumer electronics, telecom towers, permanent energy storage, and less demanding mobile energy storage can all make use of a battery’s remaining capacity.
Used in off-grid, household, and distribution grid markets, repurposed EV batteries can help reduce environmental consequences and increase supply security. These batteries increase material efficiency and have significant positive social and economic impacts on the energy and automobile industries. The second life technology opens up a number of opportunities and market potential for battery insurance, as well as a new source of income for early adopters of EVs.
The battery’s voltage, current, temperature, SoH (State of Health), and SoC (State of Charge) are all tracked by the battery management system (BMS). By keeping the temperature steady, it is essential for the battery’s charging and discharging processes. When the battery temperature rises, the BMS manages the heat by regulating the flow of coolants through the system.
The processing capability of battery management systems can be exponentially increased by utilising cloud-based technologies’ processing power. Inferences can be made by cloud-based BMS using BMS data collected from other vehicles in the network. Cloud-based BMS will be able to identify locations where the battery temperatures are greater than usual using a high-fidelity computer simulation of the battery pack.

It is, in essence, an economy that places a strong priority on reducing carbon emissions while also creatively accommodating all socioeconomic groups. By improving the efficiency of resources and energy use, it seeks to lower pollution and carbon emissions.
The rising economies around the globe for the last 15 years have been major contributors to the sharp increase in worldwide carbon measurements. According to recent data, carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement was 418 parts per million in January 2022, an increase of around 11% from the 378 parts per million recorded since 2007. This statistic has been rising steadily, with a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 0.73% from 2016 to 2021.
A low-carbon economy is a type of advanced, innovative economic development model that is distinguished by increasing the effectiveness of energy use and developing clean energy sources based on minimal energy use, pollution, and emissions. The recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) 2022, held in Egypt, placed emphasis on the transition to a low-carbon economy by pointing out that, in order to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, about USD 4 trillion per year in renewable energy investments must be made up until 2030. Additionally, a global shift to a low-carbon economy is anticipated to require investments of at least USD 4-6 trillion per year.
For the years 2021–2030, India’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) serves as the framework for the transition to cleaner energy. The revamped framework will present a chance to improve India’s manufacturing capacity and boost exports, along with many other government measures including tax breaks and incentives like the Production Linked Incentive scheme for the promotion of manufacturing and adoption of renewable energy. Overall, it will boost the number of green jobs in fields like renewable energy, clean energy industries, the automotive industry, the production of low-emission goods like electric vehicles and incredibly efficient appliances, and cutting-edge technologies like green hydrogen, etc.
The new National Development Plan will be executed over the years 2021–2030 via programmes and schemes of pertinent Ministries/Departments and with the necessary assistance from States and Union Territories. To increase India’s efforts in both adaptation and mitigation, the government has developed a number of projects and programmes. In accordance with these plans and programmes, suitable measures are being taken in a number of sectors, including, among others, water, agriculture, forestry, energy, business, sustainable mobility, housing, and resource efficiency. The aforementioned actions have caused India to steadily continue to isolate economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions.
For sustainable development, a low-carbon economy is not an option but rather a requirement. The shift to a low-carbon economy offers both a significant opportunity and a tremendous challenge. An opportunity exists in that the commercialization of low-carbon solutions, such as clean energy technology, has the potential to both further stimulate a significant emerging market and promote the change of the global energy system.
At the same time, this shift poses a huge challenge since it will cost a lot of money to change economies that have been dependent on an energy system that has mostly been built on fossil fuels.
The key to a successful transition towards the adoption of a low-carbon economy is a collaboration between the public and private sectors, as well as opportunities to engage with other countries across the world. This will involve close coordination between policy, technology, and capital.
