https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/10/22/most-significant-roadblocks-to-indias-solar-energy-goals/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"OCTOBER 22, 2021",Most significant roadblocks to India’s solar energy goals,"As part of the Paris Agreement, India has committed to producing 40% of its installed energy capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. India’s 2022 target of renewable energy (RE) is 175 GW which includes 100 GW of solar power. Recently, India has also set an aspirational goal of installing 450 GW of RE by 2030.
According to the Central Electricity Authority’s Optimum Energy Mix report, the country’s electricity demand would be 817 GW in 2029-30, with 450 GW coming from renewable energy sources of which solar would contribute 280 GW i.e. over 60%. To reach this solar energy target, an average of 25 GW needs to be installed every year. We need to build enough manufacturing capacity back home to be ready on the supply side.
Presently, the annual domestic manufacturing capacity of solar inverters stands at 5 GW, while for solar cells and modules it is 3 GW and 10-15 GW, respectively. We need to scale up our manufacturing capacities keeping the RE target in view.
India’s solar business is now largely dependent on solar equipment imports. According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), India imported $2.5 billion worth of solar wafers, cells, modules, and inverters in 2019-20. However, interruptions caused in international trade due to COVID-19, particularly on imports of solar modules and solar cells, hampered India’s solar capacity expansion. To meet our RE aspirations and address increasing power requirements, we need to shift our reliance on imports and boost domestic production through policy measures.
The country lacks manufacturing for polysilicon, ingots, and wafers, which are the crucial phases of the solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing chain and are both capital and energy-intensive. Furthermore, inadequate integrated set-up, latest technology, and economies of scale, high cost of land and electricity, limited capacity utilization, high finance costs, and a shortage of skilled manpower result in increased manufacturing costs.
The main challenge impeding the achievement of the solar target in India is policy uncertainty. Discoms in many locations discourage net-metering and power banking because they fear losing their high-paying customers. The current solar legislation differs by state, and the process of buying power between states is inefficient, creating a barrier for consumers. Policy changes create confusion among all parties and generate needless delays. To address such challenges, a pro-consumer, lean, and consistent solar strategy is necessary, one that promotes investment while minimizing the complexity of laws.
When looking at the financing situation in India, loans for fossil-fuel-powered vehicles are easily and quickly accessible, whereas securing a loan for a solar project is difficult even when the technology is visibly more efficient, reliable, and sustainable in the longer run.
When compared to other nations, solar tariffs in India are extremely low, making them unsustainable for developers and could potentially lead to compromised quality of the solar system. As a result, companies have to manage viability concerns in terms of profits and tariffs.
There is a scarcity of qualified Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPCs) personnel. Youth training and upskilling are essential to fulfil the demands of an ever-rising RE industry.
To begin with, it is important to build a strong grid infrastructure. This could be accomplished through financial incentives and technological advancements. Promoting and supporting solar cells, modules, and other hardware manufacturing units, modernizing grid networks, incentivizing R&D efforts, and other infrastructure-related measures should also be considered.
In addition to this, international and domestic investors are putting their money into large-scale RE projects. For these reasons, giving tax holidays and other benefits to RE investors is crucial. These utility-scale renewable energy projects have seen the lowest tariffs and are critical to our energy transformation. Through strong financial measures such as green bonds, clean energy funds, and institutional loans, the Indian solar energy sector will wisely invest in efficient and evolving solar technology.
Another pertinent point is the huge subsidies presently granted to fossil fuels should be transferred to renewable energy. In 2019, the RE subsidy was only 12% of the subsidies given to coal and oil.
Furthermore, it is necessary to train and upskill the youth to fulfil the demands of a flourishing RE industry. A key role would be played by expanding the MNRE’s Surya Mitra training program and delivering certification through empanelled institutions. 
In conclusion, for more organic growth of the renewable sector, the RE targets should be enforced through the State Governments. This would be more widely accepted, and dealing with local and political issues would be easier. India, being a tropical nation, solar energy is the easiest to harness among the renewable energy sources. Thus, the solar sector will become an indispensable and essential component of the Indian economy in the upcoming future and will meet our energy requirements.

The four-day event was presided by R.K. Singh, power, new and renewable energy, the government of India, and the president of the ISA Assembly. A total of 108 countries participated in the Assembly, including 74 member countries and 34 observer and prospective countries, 23 partner organizations, and 33 special invitee organizations.
The ISA aims to reduce the cost of solar technology and finance to facilitate the deployment of more than 1 TW of solar generation capacity and mobilize more than $1 trillion of solar power investment by 2030 in its member countries.
The fourth assembly saw the ISA going a step further to take panel and battery waste management in its fold. Two new programs were launched: Management of Solar PV panels & battery usage waste & Solar Hydrogen program. The new Hydrogen initiative is aimed at enabling the use of solar electricity to produce hydrogen more affordably at US$2/kg than the current rate of US$ 5/kg. 
The discussions at the Assembly highlighted that the MSME clusters can replace diesel gensets with hydrogen, which are viable even at today’s solar hydrogen prices. The ISA’s waste management program is intended to address the challenges of the growing volume of waste and toxic materials, lack of waste-specific legislation, and high cost of waste treatment.
In his address to the assembly, India’s power minister R.K. Singh, “It is time for all of us to get together to make energy access using solar and renewable energy available. We have successfully done this in India, and it can be replicated globally. Solving the problem of energy access is more important than the energy transition. The energy transition is meaningless for those without energy. The ISA can enable energy access for 800 million people worldwide.” 
“It is time for developed countries to direct the energy transitions funds they had committed at previous climate conferences. ISA will cover credit guarantees and help in driving green energy investments in these countries.”
The US$1 trillion of investment in solar by 2030, targeted by the ISA, would be significant in bringing the world closer to energy transitions needed.
“These investments will also enable infrastructure such as transmission, batteries, micro and mini-grids to get the solar electricity delivered when and where it is needed. Through initiatives such as the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG), which are structured to foster interconnected solar energy infrastructure at a global scale, grid interconnection will be key for transitioning to clean energy systems,” said Dr. Ajay Mathur, Director General, ISA.
To achieve the ISA goals, France announced it will be granting 1 million euros to the ISA’s capacity-building program.
“In collaboration with UNIDP, we aim to mobilize regional and national energy centers for research and innovation. France remains fully committed to the implementation of solar projects in allied countries and hence, the required funds have been granted. Keeping development of infrastructure in mind, France welcomes India’s launch of the green grid initiative. Thus, I call upon our partners to support our efforts,” said French Minister of Ecological Transition and Co-President at the ISA Assembly, Barbara Pompili.
The European Union (EU) will also grant 1 million euros to the ISA’s capacity-building program.
U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry commended the work that every country here is doing as part of the International Solar Alliance.
“Solar energy is the most powerful tool that the world has in its toolkit to combat the climate crisis. Building a solar-powered economy won’t just slash carbon emissions, it’ll open enormous economic opportunities. The ISA is unique in its focus on spreading solar to emerging economies including small island states,” he said.
An update on the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative was also discussed at the Assembly. The concept of a single global grid for solar was first outlined at the First Assembly of the ISA in late 2018. It envisions building and scaling inter-regional energy grids to share solar energy across the globe, leveraging the differences of time zones, seasons, resources, and prices between countries and regions. OSOWOG will also help decarbonize energy production, which is today the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
Aiming to synergize its efforts and actions with other similar initiatives globally, OSOWOG has joined hands with GGI to form a unified GGI-OSOWOG initiative, which aims to contribute to the collaborative, rapid development of resilient grids globally – building on continental, regional and national grid infrastructure programs. 
George Freeman, Member of Parliament; Minister for Science, Technology & Innovation for The United Kingdom, said, “Under the Modi-Johnson leadership, UK and India will together bring the ‘Green Girds Initiative’ and ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ at COP26. This is aimed at mobilizing the global technical, financial and research cooperation because it is only by working together that we will deliver the scale and pace of the clean power transition aim.”

When you power a back-up system, it is not only necessary to have sufficiently high AC power but also to provide excess power. Why is this? And what is a good value for power and duration of the possible excess power?
Pierre-Olivier Moix: We consider a back-up system as an off-grid system for a limited period. The system should be able to power the required demand and not the opposite – just having limited demand that can be supplied by the system. And this is why it is not possible to fix a value, it depends on every project and specific demand. The good news is that the value can be adjusted with the time, depending how the demand is evolving. In our case, there is no limit, because you can even add units in parallel if the demand increases heavily.
You have launched a new product, which you say provides such “real autonomy and back-up power,” also for grid-connected single family houses in northern and southern Europe. Which customers do you think will be willing to pay the surcharge for this advanced back-up performance?
We are all now aware of the trends in electricity prices. The sector is transforming, from a centralized and heavily subsidized market towards a multi-actor, dynamic scenario. The electrical demand for single family houses is also shifting, especially with the arrival of electric mobility. People looking to drastically reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing autonomy or independence will rely even more on storage systems in the future. A storage system without ‘small print’ limitations will provide the freedom to decide the electrical model based on their own circumstances without considering external factors.
You not only emphasize the quality of the back-up power, but also the energy management functions. What do customers want, in that respect?
Everything is becoming smarter, and this is also happening with electrical devices. To centralize and control all of the intelligence available is still a challenge and far from being standardized. We have incorporated straightforward energy strategies that can easily be implemented to have the first layer of smart energy management without any additional controller. These strategies will have a real impact on the energy profile, making it possible to increase energy self-sufficiency by between 20 and 50%.
What are the typical dimensions of a solar and battery home system that you would recommend, when one wants to profit from the performance of the next3?
The next3 architecture has been conceived for a three-phase demand, with a lot of flexibility. In terms of power, we can supply up to 24-30 kW peaks and 10 kW peaks in a single phase. The flexibility is also available on the storage type, not only in terms of battery technology, as our inverter can work with lithium, lead-acid and many other battery technologies. In terms of storage capacity, our flexible charge and discharge profile makes it possible to configure the profile for each battery storage system, so the client, and not the system, is responsible for deciding their own autonomy.
Technically, what are the main design differences of your new product compared to standard solar and energy storage home systems?
It is not fair to directly compare existing energy storage home systems with our solution. We propose to apply the off-grid model in grid-tied applications, we are a step ahead in terms of autonomy and autarky. In our case, the battery is a must and the grid is an accessory that we could use as an asset. Our device requires a battery to work, the system architecture is different. This is why we offer solar autarky without conditions. For designing such a system, we advise to focus on the demand and autonomy required. Solar, if available, is often the most interesting energy source, in terms of maximizing the output. Other variables, especially the battery capacity, will depend on the autarky rate desired. The system should be able to match the energy requirements foreseen in the next 10-20 years. The battery capacity, however, is a modular asset that can evolve with the system.
To provide advanced back-up performance, do you have to pay the price of reduced efficiency, due to an over-dimensioning of the components? How important is efficiency for such a product? How have you measured and quantified your system’s efficiency?
Based on our long experience with energy storage, the efficiency is important but is not a critical element compared to the demand and energy management. However, with our innovative system architecture based on a DC link, we are able to reach efficiencies from solar to loads and from solar to the grid, that are at the same level or even higher. The main impact in system performance comes from smart management not only of the solar resource available, which is pretty well managed by all, but also the storage asset. Efficient use of the storage can lead to a huge boost in the total system efficiency and the autarky rate.
Would you also use this system for pure off-grid solutions, or do you have other products for these cases?
In off-grid most of the time, we need to handle an AC source as well (generator, hydro turbine, etc). In fact, we consider the grid as another AC source that should be integrated in the system. The device can therefore perform for both off-grid and on-grid applications and the main advantages of integration, flexibility and smart energy management are very useful in both cases. Our well known Xtender battery inverters were also a very important factor in the beginning of the self-consumption industry. Different regulations and simple applications were a hurdle. With the next3, we believe that we provide a very relevant solution for solar autarky, and are well prepared for the challenging future trends.
Which off-grid applications are present in Europe that installers should keep in mind?
Agricultural and field applications, mobile applications, C&I [commercial and industrial] portable and temporary applications, remote set-ups. There is an off-grid sector that will remain off-grid.
