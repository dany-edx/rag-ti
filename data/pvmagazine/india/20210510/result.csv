https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/10/solar-101-working-the-angles-to-maximize-your-solar-systems-output/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 10, 2021",Solar 101: Working the angles to maximize your solar system’s output,"In the first articles of our Solar 101 series, (“Is my roof ready for solar?“) and (“Attaching your solar system to your roof”) we discussed how the age and physical characteristics of a roof affect the design and payback of a prospective solar system. We considered weather concerns and panel setbacks to better estimate the number of solar panels that will fit on a roof.
Now, we will take a look at the relationship between a panel’s latitude, pitch, and azimuth to its solar electricity output.
In a perfect world, solar panels always face the sun at a perpendicular angle. But most prospective solar buyers are stuck with pre-existing realities: a home they already own, and a roof with preexisting conditions. Partial shade, a less-than-ideal azimuth, or a less-than-ideal roof pitch are often the norm for a residential installation.
But that begs the question: To what extent will these factors affect my system’s return on investment?
Most of us are looking to maximize electricity generation on an annual basis. Thus, the best azimuth is due south and the ideal pitch is roughly equal to your home or business’s latitude. We can test this hypothesis using the U.S. Department of Energy’s PV Watts tool to estimate solar electricity generation.
Here is what it looks like:

PV Watts is not a perfect tool; it is a rough guide, but it is close enough for our purposes. If you live in a region with heavy snow, dust, tree cover, or other sunshine-blocking variables your electricity production will be lower.
Let’s start this analysis with a completely average city – Normal, Illinois – as our test site. For this analysis, we adopt the default variables in PV Watts, changing two variables: the Tilt (deg) of the roof and the array type to Fixed (roof mount).

A rule of thumb for optimizing the angle of your solar panels is to mount them at an angle equivalent to the site’s latitude, facing due south. The latitude of Normal, Illinois, is 40.5°.
As you can see in the chart below, the peak generation from this roof is not exactly 40.5°, but is somewhere between 35-36°. According to this “Normal” data, a panel’s pitch can range anywhere from 20° to 50° and still generate more than 97% of its peak potential.

One interesting observation from this chart is that if your solar panels are horizontal (corresponding to the far left of the chart) or 90° vertical (at the far right), your system will still produce a decent amount of electricity. Compared to the maximum output value of 5,623 kWh/year, a flat roof produces 15% less and a vertical wall of solar panels produces 38% less. Not optimal, but not useless.
Keep in mind that horizontal panels on a flat roof will collect dirt. That’s why at least a few degrees of pitch are needed to allow rain to rinse off dust and pollen. A slight angle will also prevent rainwater from settling on the solar panels and leaving a residue as the water evaporates. One study has shown that panels in very dusty environments with infrequent rain resist dust deposition best when angled at around 26%.
Now let’s consider the direction that the roof surface faces. This factor is called the “azimuth” and refers to the direction the roof surface faces relative to the North Pole, which is located at 0°. This makes due south 180°, west 270° and east 90°.
Returning to our completely average city of Normal, Illinois, we’ll keep the system’s roof angle at 40.5° for our calculations.

As you can see in the table, the Normal house facing due South can generate 5,608 kWh. When facing due east, that value falls to 4,350 kWh, a 22% loss. When facing due west, we get a similar result: 4,303 kWh, a 23% loss.
But that’s Normal, Illinois. Generation losses due to azimuth become less pronounced as we approach the equator. For instance, in San Diego, California, (latitude 32.7º) a default system modeled using PV Watts fell from 6,314 kWh to 5,511 kWh. That drop was just under 13%.
In the case of San Diego, elevated land to the east blocks some sun, at least compared to the beautiful open ocean to the west. This means a due south solar system actually, slightly, underperforms in terms of electricity generation. We found that the peak value was somewhere closer to an azimuth of 197-198º.

Other factors will affect your roof’s solar generation, including shadows from trees, neighboring houses, and even your own house’s features. Make sure that your solar contractor accounts for all these factors when giving you a quote and a financial model.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/10/recycling-rare-earth-elements-from-dead-lithium-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 10, 2021",Recycling rare-earth elements from dead lithium batteries,"From pv magazine International
US-based raw materials supplier American Resources Corporation is developing a technology to recycle rare-earth metals such as neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), and dysprosium (Dy) from lithium-ion batteries at the end of their lifecycle.
The patented technology, which the company acquired from the Purdue University in February, consists of a process to separate pure rare earth metals and critical elements from coal byproducts, recycled permanent magnets, and lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles or power plants based on renewable energy.
The technique is described as a two-zone ligand-assisted displacement chromatography (LAD) that is able to produce metals with high yields and purity of over 99%. Displacement chromatography is a preparative technique that is commonly used to place a sample onto the head of a column and then displace it through a solute.
The system is based on a zone-splitting method and is claimed to have an overall production capacity that can exceed 100 kg of rare earth elements per m3 per day. It requires three chromatography columns, an extractant, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and other unspecified environmentally friendly chemicals.
Compared to conventional acid-based methods, which make use of two-phase liquid–liquid extraction processes, the LAD is said to have no detrimental environmental impact. Traditional techniques, on the other hand, have also difficulties in separating rare-earth metals, due to their high similarities in chemical and physical properties, according to the researchers.
“Collectively, our process chain of technology and feedstocks enables us to help restore the domestic supply chain of these critical materials in the most sustainable and environmentally friendly and beneficial ways ever developed,” said American Resources Corporation CEO, Mark Jensen. “The team at Purdue is an important part of this, and we look forward to pushing aggressively forward with commercialization of the technology and showcasing the low cost and environmentally sensitive technology.”
In 2019, other scientists at the Purdue University developed a process to extract pure carbon from plastic waste and turn it into anode material for lithium-ion batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/05/10/india-ranked-third-most-attractive-country-for-solar-investment/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RENEWABLES,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,FRANCE,GERMANY,INDIA,SPAIN,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 10, 2021",India ranked third most attractive country for solar investment,"IHS Markit has released its latest Global Renewables Markets Attractiveness Rankings for the period ending December 2020. It ranks the United States as the most attractive market for renewable energy investment due to its sound market fundamentals and attractive support scheme. The USA also retained the top spot in attractiveness for investment in solar PV and onshore wind each.
The rankings assessed different countries’ attractiveness for investment in solar PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind. Each country was evaluated on parameters like current policy framework, market fundamentals, investor friendliness, infrastructure readiness, revenue risks, return expectations, and overall opportunity. 
The overall renewable rankings were based on a combined score for offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar PV that weighted the technologies based on their expected levels of installations over the next decade.
Germany finished second on the renewable attractiveness ranking. Mainland China, which accounted for more than half of the world’s total non-hydro renewables additions last year, ranked third, weighed down by difficulties in accessing the market. However, it claimed the second spot in attractiveness for solar investment.
India ranked sixth for renewables, third for utility-scale solar PV, ninth for onshore wind, and 15th for offshore wind.
Speaking to pv magazine, Eduard Sala de Vedruna, executive director-Climate and Sustainability Group at IHS Markit, said, ”The only markets ahead of India in the solar rankings were the United States (Rank 1) and mainland China (Rank 2). Both are currently even larger markets for solar than India with more robust support mechanisms, and without the infrastructure preparedness issues and revenue risks.”
Vedruna said, India’s solar rank is boosted by its market size, a very strong target (100 GW by 2022, of which 40 GW is rooftop – expanding to 280 GW by 2030), and a well-defined auction calendar at both federal and state levels to support its ambitions.
However, the Indian solar industry faces various challenges as it scales rapidly to meet the targets. “These include sporadic risks of retroactive tariff renegotiation post-tender as well as curtailment risks in some states, and delays in finding an offtaker (which at times could result in cancellation of the PPA). There is also the possibility of connection bottlenecks as the pace of grid expansion has been unable to keep up with targeted generation projects. Further, intense competition in tenders often leads to very close winning prices and significantly compressed margins for project developers. There are numerous instances of payment delays from financially stressed state utilities, which further compounds revenue risks for investors,” Vedruna stated.
Strong market fundamentals backed by stable procurement mechanisms and long-term clean energy targets made France secure fourth spot, and Spain fifth, in renewables investment attractiveness. Similar factors boosted Japan’s renewables attractiveness to eighth place and the Netherlands to ninth.
“The most attractive markets in IHS Markit rankings have various combinations of a few points in common. These include a significantly large market size and thereby more opportunity for new entrants to capture, availability of attractive subsidies (often with some level of long-term certainty), very attractive market fundamentals, and move to develop and incentivize all technologies including offshore wind,” said Vedruna.
Countries with a strong impetus toward offshore wind got a significant boost, as IHS said the generation source is expected to be the fastest-growing renewable energy technology in the next decade.
The United Kingdom failed to crack the top 10 in the combined rankings due to its relative lack of support for developing onshore wind and PV. It ranked individually as the most attractive market for offshore wind investment.
