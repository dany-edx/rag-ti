Rolls-Royce, which wants to sell its electric flight division to focus on improving profits in its jet engine business, said that hydrogen is not a medium-term option for widebody, large commercial aircraft, rather preferring Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). “I don’t believe in the next 15, 20 years hydrogen will play a role,” commented Rolls-Royce’s CEO Tufan Erginbilgic during the presentation with analysts and investors. The British company teamed up with several companies in the hydrogen sector for different projects, from production based on SOEC technology to the ground test of the the “world’s first run of a modern aero engine on hydrogen.” The company then explained to pv magazine that the company remains committed to developing its hydrogen capability in partnership with easyJet. “We ran the world’s first modern aero engine on green hydrogen last year; we plan to ground test a higher thrust engine on hydrogen next year; and we still have ambitions to take this technology to flight test in the long term. We are on track to deliver our commitment to power a mid-size aircraft on hydrogen in the mid 2030s in partnership with easyJet.”
ACWA Power has launched the first phase of a green hydrogen project in Uzbekistan. It has an annual capacity of 3,000 tons. “Once the second phase is complete, 2.4 GW of wind energy will power the production of 500,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year,” said the Saudi Arabian company. 
The European Commission has included hydrogen and electrolyzer installations in its list of cross-border energy projects for the first time, offering streamlined permitting and regulatory procedures for 65 projects among the 166 Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and Projects of Mutual Interest (PMIs). These initiatives are now eligible for EU financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), and the commission has also approved a Spanish state aid scheme to support hydrogen projects.
Lhyfe plans to produce up to 330 tons of green hydrogen per day at its Lubmin plant in northern Germany, with a targeted commissioning date of 2029. “Part of Lhyfe’s backbone development strategy, this plant will feed into the German core hydrogen pipeline network, for the development of which the German government recently unveiled a €20 billion financing plan,” said the French company. The project site will offer access to existing and future electricity production capacities from offshore wind farms. It benefits from an extra-high voltage grid connection operated by 50Hertz, which already operates a transformer station in Lubmin. The plant will be built on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant.
Spain’s Port of València has became the first port in the world to use a stacker capable of moving containers of more than 30 tons using only hydrogen as fuel. “Hydrogen is stored on board the ReachStacker in high-pressure tanks that can be refilled in 10-15 minutes,” said the port. The port also said that it deployed the first hydrogen-powered terminal tractor, developed by Atena, Enea, and the Parthenope University of Naples. “This Terminal Tractor has a fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain, which allows the vehicle to perform all the intensive tasks that are required during roll-on/roll-off operations. Its hydrogen storage system, made of four Type 3 cylinders (350 bar), has an overall capacity of around 12 kg, which guarantees a continuous operation of at least six hours.”

The South African Government’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy recently announced four projects out of 17 were selected to be developed as part of the first round of the Battery Energy Storage Independent Power Procurement Programme (BESIPPPP).
Projects belonging to two developers have now started construction in various locations in the country’s largest and most sparsely populated region, the Northern Cape.
French utility EDF will develop 257 MW of battery energy-storage systems across three locations. The programs consist of the 77 MW Oasis Aggeneis project near the Aggeneis substation, the 77 MW Oasis Mookodi project near the northwest Mookodi substation and the 103 MW Oasis Nieuwehoop project near the Nieuwehoop substation. Scatec Africa, a unit of Norwegian renewable energy company Scatec, will develop one 103 MW project titled Mogobe BESS near the Ferrum substation.
The South African Government said in the press release an “additional eligible” bidder may be appointed to the Northern Cape Gorana substation once the “value for money negotiation has concluded.” All projects are expected to reach commercial close by May 2024.
The South African government said EDF and Scatec Africa will spend over ZAR4.4 billion ($235 million) on preferential treatment for Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) and black enterprises, with a commitment to give black women 10% to 32% of project shares. The companies have also committed to 15-year development initiatives, according to the announcement.
Announced in March 2023, the BESIPPP program is aimed at increasing the grid capacity in the Northern Cape supply area through energy storage. In February this year, South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster to deal with the country’s acute energy crisis, which has led to chronic blackouts and load-shedding.
South Africa is powered mostly by coal and gas, with the International Energy Agency saying these traditional fossil fuels account for 85% of the country’s current energy mix. South Africa had 5,826 MW estimated installed PV capacity at the end of last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/05/australian-utility-tests-nickel-hydrogen-battery/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 5, 2023",Australian utility tests nickel-hydrogen battery,"From pv magazine Australia
AGL and United State-headquartered energy technology company SLB have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to pilot a nickel-hydrogen battery – expected to be the first of its kind in Australia – at AGL’s Torrens Island site in Adelaide.
SLB will supply AGL with a 180 kW/360 kWh nickel-hydrogen battery for the two-year pilot program which is expected to commence in 2025. The pilot project will test the operational performance of the technology, with the battery providing storage for on-site power use.
Travis Hughes, general manager of AGL’s Energy Hubs unit, said nickel-hydrogen battery technology is an example of the battery technologies the company is exploring as part of its broader ambition to add up to 5.9 GW of firming capacity to its portfolio by 2035.
“This is the first new battery technology AGL is piloting since it established an emerging battery technology team,” he said, noting that nickel-hydrogen technology could be a potential alternative to the lithium-ion solutions that currently dominate the stationary energy storage market.
“Nickel-hydrogen batteries have been identified as a technology which may offer different benefits when compared with lithium-ion batteries such as the potential for a longer cycle life, the potential to withstand a greater temperature operating range – meaning more potential applications and reduced need for cooling – and the potential cost benefits associated with these advantages,” he said. “Exploring and testing innovative technologies as they are developed and bringing them to market at scale is critical as we try to accelerate our efforts to transition our business over the coming decade.”
While the Torrens Island pilot is expected to be the first deployment of a nickel-hydrogen battery in Australia, the technology is not new. Nickel-hydrogen batteries consist of a stack of electrodes inside a pressurised gas tank. The cathode is nickel hydroxide and the anode is hydrogen. When the battery is charging, a catalytic reaction generates hydrogen gas. During discharge, the hydrogen oxidises and converts back to water.
The technology has been used for decades in aerospace applications but the use of expensive platinum catalysts has ruled out the use of the batteries in grid-scale scenarios.
SLB said that has now changed with California-based battery startup EnerVenue having made a breakthrough in catalyst design, swapping out the platinum catalyst for an inexpensive nickel-molybdenum-cobalt alloy catalyst.
EnerVenue said its nickel-hydrogen batteries can last for 30,000 charge cycles, are fireproof, and outperform lithium-ion batteries on a number of key metrics for energy storage at the large scale.
If the potential benefits of the nickel-hydrogen battery are verified during the pilot, the next step for AGL could be to explore the development of a grid-scale project using the same technology.
SLB Vice President of Energy Storage Oktay Sancar said the Torrens Island pilot project will help de-risk the technology by augmenting the solutions with advanced system design, integration and deployment optimisation.
“This type of collaboration will set the stage for the next generation of utility-scale applications,” he said.
The announcement follows the opening of AGL’s 250 MW/250 MWh battery energy storage system at Torrens in August 2023. That system uses lithium iron phosphate technology.
AGL aims to add about 12 GW of generation and firming by the end of 2035 – comprised of up to 6.3 GW of renewables and 5.9 GW of firming.
