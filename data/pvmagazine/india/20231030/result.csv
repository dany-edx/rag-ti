https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/30/india-agrivoltaics-alliance-launched/,"AGRIVOLTAICS,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",India Agrivoltaics Alliance launched,"India would need to devote large tracts of land to solar installations to meet its ambitious renewable energy goals. At the same time, the nation is primarily an agrarian economy with 60% of its land area farmed.
Agrivoltaics can address this unique challenge by optimising land usage through the co-location of solar panels with agriculture or placing solar panels alongside crops and pastoral lands, for growing crops as well as generating solar energy. Co-locating solar panels with agricultural farms also lays a strong foundation for climate-resilient agriculture and doubling farmers’ incomes.
Sensing this opportunity, 12 organizations have come together to form the India Agrivoltaics Alliance  (IAA) to drive agrivoltaics in India. The Alliance was formally launched during the first India Agrivoltaics Summit held this week.
The IAA is supported by the India Climate Collaborative (ICC) and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and brings together organizations across the entire agriculture and solar value chains.
The secretariat of the alliance will be hosted by the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI). The alliance will work with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, to drive agrivoltaics in India.
The IAA brings together all stakeholders across the value chain in the solar and agricultural sectors, including industry associations, research institutes, financial institutions like NBFCs, policy think tanks, and civil society organizations. It will work towards developing effective business models and financial instruments for agrivoltaics, study the socio-economic impact of agrivoltaics on India’s agricultural scenario, and strive for the inclusion of women and youth communities of India in the emerging field of agrivoltaics.
Speaking at the IAA launch, MNRE joint secretary Lalit Bohra emphasized that agrivoltaics is an instrument to popularize distributed renewable energy adoption and sensitize the public at large to adopting RE. Agrivoltaics will also offer the triple advantages of saving water, doubling farmers’ income, and making the power sector financially viable, without compromising on food security. Agrivoltaics will help make India’s Agriculture sector sustainable while using clean electricity and promoting energy efficiency.
Bohra also interacted with farmers across the country who have been beneficiaries of agrivoltaics. Farmers described their experiences and how their economic conditions have been positively impacted by the adoption of agrivoltaics.
Deepak Gupta, director general of NSEFI, said, “The launch of the India Agrivoltaics Alliance is a pivotal moment in our nation’s journey towards sustainable energy. Agrivoltaics is not just a technology, it’s a commitment to harmonizing agriculture and solar energy for a greener, more resilient future. This alliance will be instrumental in achieving this harmony, fostering innovation, and driving the transition towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape in India.”
IAA steering organizations include NSEFI, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), International Water Management Institute (IWMI), Indian Society of Agricultural Engineering (ISAE), Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture (ICFA), The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), Indo-German Energy Forum (IGEF), Skill Council for Green Jobs (SCGJ), Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies (ISEP) Japan, and Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation.

Greenko is one of India’s leading renewable energy companies. 
According to a media release, Gentari and AM Green will jointly invest, in phases, into the green ammonia platform, AM Green Ammonia Holdings BV (AMG Ammonia), established by the founders of Greenko. An affiliate of Singapore investor, GIC, is also an investor in AMG Ammonia. 
AMG Ammonia is projected to produce 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green ammonia using round-the-clock renewable energy by 2030. The platform aims to deliver green ammonia, as it is presently the most mature and stable form of transporting hydrogen. 
Gentari and AM Green bring complementary capabilities across the green hydrogen value chain, including renewable energy, electrolyzers, and ammonia production and marketing capabilities. 
“The 5 mtpa of green ammonia produced is equivalent to approximately one mtpa of green hydrogen, and would represent 20% of India’s target for green hydrogen production by 2030, or 10% of Europe’s target for imported renewable hydrogen. This size and capacity will place AMG Ammonia among the world’s pioneers in large-scale and cost-competitive green ammonia production,” stated Gentari. 
The first export of green ammonia from this platform is targeted by late 2025. The platform aims to serve key OECD markets, such as Germany, Japan and South Korea, as well as Singapore.
“The parties will mutually invest in AMG Ammonia, demonstrating full commitment to realize the platform’s potential and expand their presence in Asia Pacific and Europe,” stated Gentari. 
Post-investment from Gentari, AM Green and GIC, AMG Ammonia will be a fully funded platform for the targeted ammonia production plan. The platform is expected to invest, in phases, into projects across different locations in India. This will ensure a competitive hydrogen supply to the global market.
Gentari targets 30-40 GW of installed capacity in renewable energy, up to 1.2 mtpa of clean hydrogen, and over 10% share of the public charging points and Vehicle-as-a-Service market across key countries in Asia Pacific globally by 2030. Strong collaborations in its focus market of Malaysia and the broader Asia Pacific, will be vital to meeting its objective. In Malaysia, the company sees strong potential for developing a local hydrogen economy. To this end, Gentari has undertaken efforts to position Malaysia as a hydrogen export hub whereby its hydrogen ventures will support a comprehensive national roadmap that includes hydrogen as an energy transition lever for Malaysia.
AM Green, indirectly wholly-owned and controlled by the founders of Hyderabad-based Greenko Group, Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, aims to become one of the most cost-competitive producers of green hydrogen, green ammonia and other green molecules in the world. In India, AM Green is developing production capabilities for green molecules (green hydrogen, green ammonia, biofuels, green caustic soda, e-methanol) for decarbonisation in hard-to-abate industries. The venture will also set up an international renewables and storage business and a JV for making electrolysers with John Cockerill of Belgium.

The researchers used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells that was developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium,  for simulating and modeling the solar cell performance.
The solar cell design comprises a zinc oxide (ZnO) transparent conductive oxide (TCO) window layer, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a CdTe absorber, an electron reflected-hole transport layer (ER-HTL) based on cuprous oxide (Cu2O), and upper/top and back contact materials made of aluminum (Al) and nickel (Ni).
In the proposed cell configuration, both the AI upper/top contact and the Ni back contact provide a low-resistance electrical connection and the ZnO window layer, which reduces light reflection, serves as a TCO layer, thus increasing cell efficiency. The back metal contacts act as the electrode responsible for collecting and transferring electrons generated to the external circuit by the absorber layer.
“To achieve the best performance, it is recommended to set both the acceptor and donor densities for the absorber and buffer layers at 10 cm3,” the scientists emphasized. “These densities can be achieved with a window and buffer layer thickness of 100 nm and an absorber layer thickness of 2500 nm.”
Simulated under standard illumination conditions, the PV device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 31.82 %, an open-circuit voltage of 1.4811 V, a short-circuit current of 28.682434 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 74.91%.
“This level of PV efficiency outperforms other research reports by a significant margin,” the group stated. “Additionally, the proposed structure exhibits a high level of photon absorption, with nearly 100 % quantum efficiency at visible wavelengths.”
The solar cell design was introduced in the study “Effect of various layers on improving the photovoltaic efficiency of Al/ZnO/CdS/CdTe/Cu2O/Ni solar cells,” published in the Journal of Alloys and Metallurgical Systems.

Once this pilot project succeeds, the two companies may look forward to expanding this technology on a large scale along the vast coastline in the southern part of India. 
As per the MoU, SGEL will develop and finance a pilot membrane-based floating solar project of about 2 MW at a suitable location anywhere in India. For this project, Ocean Sun will provide its patented technology and the requisite technological support.
Ocean Sun’s patented technology uses a thin membrane to float its customized PV modules. This leads to many advantages over other floating pv systems, including the overall lowest material usage of any floating PV system, enabling the lowest overall LCOE; simple and quick installation; and increased efficiency from direct water cooling.
“This MoU shall pave the way for technology transfer and cooperation amongst the two countries. Once this pilot project succeeds, the two companies SGEL and Ocean Sun can look forward to expanding this technology on a large scale along the vast coastline in the southern part of India,” stated SGEL.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/30/the-impact-of-soiling-on-pv-module-transmittance/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOILING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",The impact of soiling on PV module transmittance,"Scientists from the Imperial College London and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology have investigated the impact of soiling on solar module glass surfaces in semi-desert regions.
They looked at how soiling may affect the performance of PV panels in optical and electrical power. “We have also conducted an economic analysis in regards to soiling, but we have not published it yet. The findings indicate that the economic loss depends greatly on the individual location,” research co-author Christos Markides told pv magazine. 
The study is based on 60 samples collected from a soiling station in Muscat, Oman.
“Estimating the energy yield from real PV installations remains challenging due to an over/underestimation of soiling losses. Soiling losses strongly depend on particle size, shape and their associated spectra which significantly impact PV performance,” the paper stated. ”In this work, we present results from an extensive outdoor experimental testing campaign of soiling, apply detailed characterization techniques, and consider the resulting losses.”
In the paper, “Characterisation of soiling on glass surfaces and their impact on optical and solar photovoltaic performance” recently published in Renewable Energy, Markides and his colleagues explained that the samples tested were made of low-iron glass coupons. These coupons are commonly used within the solar industry for encapsulating the top layer of a PV module. Glass samples were collected by the end of each month during 2021 and in two seasonal periods in the wet and dry season. For each collection period, the researchers gathered four samples, of 0, 23, 45 and 90 degrees, respectively.
The samples were then sent to London for optical transmittance testing. The analysis showed that the relative transmittance of the horizontal samples decreased by 65% in the wet season, 68% in the dry season and 64% in the entire year.
“In comparison, the vertical coupons showed a relative transmittance drop of 34%, 19% and 31%, respectively,” the research group added. “The average relative transmittance decrease across all tilt angles was 44%, 49% and 42% for wet, dry and one-year coupons, respectively.”

Based on those results, the researchers calculated the expected electricity loss at a standard test condition of 1,000 W/m2 radiation and a temperature of 25 C with a monocrystalline PV module.
“The relative transmittance reductions measured on the horizontal wet-season, dry-season and full-year samples correspond to predicted relative reductions in electrical power generation by 67%, 70%, and 66%, respectively,” they added. “Based on a local tilt angle of 23 degrees, the relative transmittance losses are estimated at around 30% per month, resulting in an equivalent relative PV power reduction of around 30% per month at the studied location.”
The scientists then used X-rays and electron microscopes to characterize the soil particles. As all the glass samples were located in the same place, the scientist assumed that their soiling would have the exact material characterization. They therefore analyzed only horizontal glass coupons for the wet and dry seasons and the entire year.
“According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) findings, the full-year horizontal soiled coupon has a variety of minerals such as silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, calcium magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, iron carbide, and aluminum silicate,” they emphasized. “The elemental map emphasizes the chemical compounds reported by the XRD analysis. Silicon (Si) is the most dominant element, while the rest are carbon (C), oxygen (O), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe).”
The researchers also found that the dry season sample had more PM10 particles – these are particles with a diameter of less than 10 μm – than the wet season sample. “It was also shown that natural cleaning due to periodic rains can eliminate the accumulation of larger particle but not of smaller ones,” they explained in the paper.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/30/indias-solar-module-exports-to-usa-to-keep-rising-till-fy-2025/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,EUROPE,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",India’s solar module exports to USA to keep rising till FY 2025,"India’s solar photovoltaic (PV) module exports to the USA will keep rising before stagnating from 2025 and declining from 2027, finds a new joint report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics.
The report finds that after the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Green Deal—key policies that promote local manufacturing in the USA and the European Union (EU), respectively—the USA and the EU will take two to three years to establish domestic solar PV manufacturing lines catering to their needs. Once the domestic manufacturing of the USA and the EU develops, Indian exports will start declining.
“With annual global solar installations forecast to reach at least 1 terawatt (TW) by 2030, it is clear that there will be no dearth of PV demand in the future. Thus, Indian manufacturers must focus equally on domestic and international markets. Indian PV products will also need to compete in global markets with other large PV manufacturing countries in terms of quality and scale,” says the report’s co-author, Vibhuti Garg, director, South Asia, IEEFA.

The report notes that India’s PV module exports to the USA have grown exponentially recently—16 times (by value) in FY 2023 vis-à-vis FY 2022. In FY 2023, India exported around $1 billion worth of PV modules to the USA, which is around 97% of the entire global module exports from India.
“The USA has traditionally been the largest export destination for Indian PV products. Therefore, after 2027, Indian companies will need to explore the African and South American markets for maintaining the momentum in exports,” says the report’s co-author, Jyoti Gulia, founder, JMK Research.
“By FY 2027, the global transition to green hydrogen will create a huge demand for solar PV panels. This will also open up a considerable market for PV manufacturers for their products,” she adds.
Based on public announcements, the report assesses that the IRA will help add 50 GW of module manufacturing capacity in the USA while the Green Deal will help add 31 GW of module manufacturing capacity in the EU.
“Manufacturing upstream components will be more challenging than making modules due to their complex and expensive production process. As a result, the IRA also opens up export opportunities for Indian companies producing upstream components. Indian companies have also had a headstart of at least one year compared to companies setting up facilities in the USA because of the capacities under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI-l) tranche already awarded in November 2021,” says the report’s co-author, Prabhakar Sharma, consultant, JMK Research.
The report finds that several Indian manufacturers are looking to set up module lines in the USA and cell or ingot/wafer lines in India.
The report also notes that the success of the IRA will influence the future PV manufacturing policy design by Indian regulators.
“The USA is a global leader and superpower, which other countries look up to and try to emulate. The IRA, by all measures, is a landmark legislation on climate change. An initiative of this magnitude by the largest country in the world will motivate others to do the same. Future iterations of PLI may include layered incentives, an extended policy impact period, easier eligibility criteria to avail incentives, etc,” says Gulia.
