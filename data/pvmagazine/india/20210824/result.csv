The project, located in the Village Loharki, spans 756 acres of land. TPREL completed it within the stipulated timelines despite the various challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The plant is expected to generate more than 350 million units of electricity annually, helping to offset 3.34 lakh tons of carbon emission every year. The installation uses approximately 656,700 modules, 48 inverters, and 720 km of DC cable.  
Speaking on the achievement, Praveer Sinha, CEO and MD, Tata Power said, “The commissioning of the 150 MW project in Loharki, Rajasthan has further fortified our position as one of the leading renewable energy company in the country with a strong presence in solar power generation. We will continue to seek the potential of sustainable growth of renewable power in India.”
With this addition of 150 MW, Tata Power’s total installed renewables capacity has reached 2,947 MW comprising 2,015 MW of solar and 932 MW of wind. It has another 1,084 MW of renewable projects under implementation.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/24/allox-minerals-eyes-scale-up-of-lithium-battery-material-production-forward-integration/,"EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,LI-ION CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"AUGUST 24, 2021","Allox Minerals eyes scale-up of lithium battery material production, forward integration","Allox Minerals, a Hyderabad-based natural resource company, has started producing electrode materials for Lithium-ion batteries under a government-owned company-operated model at International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy & New Materials (ARCI) facility.
The company produces indigenous and economical lithium titanium oxide (LTO) anode and lithium ferrophosphate (LFP) cathode materials using a method developed by ARCI and is looking to scale up production according to the demand from the electric vehicle (EV) battery market.
“We have sufficient supply of Lithium to scale up the required production as and when the demand arises,” Anjani Sri Mourya S, director, told pv magazine. 
“We aim to become a leading global producer of precursors for next-generation lithium-ion battery cells while creating the supply chain that enables the future energy requirements of the world, the global storage of renewable energy and electrification of transportation.”
Allox Minerals primarily deals in lithium and other rare earth minerals. The company, through a joint venture led by a corporation of the government of Telangana, is acquiring mining rights of lithium in Bolivia and Brazil, alongside mining of key battery related minerals in India to ensure an uninterrupted supply chain to the existing and upcoming industries. It has already tied up with two companies in Bolivia and Brazil for supply to India.
Mourya said, “Lithium is found in brine and rock form and needs to be processed into lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide at the mining site as transportation of brines and spodumene is technically not possible to be processed at another location.”
“Allox has tied up with prominent technology providers for direct lithium extraction from brines and brine residual from the potential mines in South America that it aims to acquire along with the Government of Telangana.”
Currently, India has no known source of lithium and lacks the capability of the entire value chain from precursors of the raw materials to cell fabrication. As a result, the nation entirely depends on imported cells from China and uses them to manufacture battery packs.
Allox Minerals aims to become an anchor supplier to any cell fabrication companies and any other companies that want to produce anode and cathode materials. The company is also looking to forward integrate up to battery assembly.
“While we look at forward integration, we provide required opportunities for companies to backward integrate and create an entire ecosystem here in India,” Mourya told pv magazine.
ARCI successfully synthesized carbon-coated LiFePO4 by a large-scale flame spray pyrolysis process followed by carbon coating and the electrochemical performance of the resulting material was found to be on par with commercial-scale carbon-coated LFP.
The method is economical and simple and has the potential to fine-tune the properties of the cathode produced.
Mourya said ARCI’s indigenous process is cheaper than with western counterparts’ technology and at par with Chinese companies. Besides, it produces a high-quality product, which is key for the long life and stability of the battery.

Japanese PV module recycling specialist Next Energy and Resources Co Ltd, and Japan-based Japanese conglomerate Marubeni Corporation are planning to use blockchain technology in the process of identifying solar modules at the end of their lifecycle that are suitable for recycling or reuse.
The technology, which is currently being developed with the support of the Japanese Ministry of Environment and the Mitsubishi Research Institute, should be able to inspect the solar modules and provide data on the traceability and components used, as well as verifying that these data were not modified or tampered with.
The use of this transparent technique, according to Next Energy, will enable the identification of a larger amount of modules that can still be reused or recycled, which would result in a reduction of the amount of waste in landfills and, in the case of modules being reused, would also lower their carbon footprint.
No more technical details on the inspection technology were provided.
Next Energy has been active in the PV module recycling business with its ‘Reborn’ set of standards since 2005. It claims to have inspected more than 140,000 used modules to date.

The integrated plant, said to be one of the world’s largest green ammonia projects, will come up in the Special Economic Zone at Port of Duqm. The land agreement was signed with The Public Authority for Special Economic Zones and Free Zones, a Government authority of Oman.
The integrated Oman facility will be powered by 3 GWp of solar and 0.5 GWp of wind energy to produce 2,400 tonnes of green ammonia daily and approx. 0.9 million tons annually. 
The facility is expected to become operational by 2022. When operational, it will export green ammonia to demand centers like Europe and Asia.
The Oman facility would be Acme’s second such project after green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in the Bikaner district of the Indian State of Rajasthan. Green hydrogen at the Bikaner plant will be produced using 5 MWp from a solar plant scalable to 10 MW, which is an integral part of the project. The green ammonia plant, once commissioned, will produce 5 tons per day of green ammonia with an annual output of 1,750-1,800 tons of green fuel. 
Acme plans to start the construction of the Oman plant soon after commissioning its first green hydrogen and green ammonia plant at Bikaner, said Manoj K Upadhyay, founder and chairman, Acme Group.
“The signing of land reservation agreement will allow us to kick start pre-construction activities. We have hired environmental consultants and owner’s engineers Black & Veatch…. The plant in Oman would be developed in phases and the first phase is likely to be commissioned by end of 2022,” Upadhyay added.
Acme Group has built a solar portfolio of 6 GWp in India. Of this, the Company currently holds a portfolio of 5.25 GWp that includes 2.2 GWp of operational capacity and another 3.05 GWp under construction. These projects are spread across 12 states in India.
