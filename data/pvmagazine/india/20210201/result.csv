Two India-led institutions hosted a webinar to examine the question of how to finance utility scale renewables in emerging economies.
Participants considered policy and regulatory challenges, as well as solar financing constraints, at an event organised by the Gurugram-based International Solar Alliance (ISA) alongside the Centre for Energy Finance section of Delhi-based research non-profit the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).
Panelists at Wednesday’s event proposed financial interventions to accelerate renewables investment, emphasizing the measures necessary to attract and scale-up capital flows in developing markets.
Upendra Tripathy, director-general of the ISA – whose membership consists of 121 tropical nations – pointed to three obstacles to financing clean power in emerging markets which the organization is addressing: land and labor, capital and technology.
The membership body – which delivered the webinar as part of its Solar Technology and Application Resources Centers project – is mapping pockets of land suitable for large scale solar and attempting to head off land access rights issues at an early stage. Tripathy said the ISA is also establishing a community-engagement framework to avoid land-related conflicts and is attempting to train workers in solar project construction and maintenance.
The director-general also highlighted the reluctance of offshore investors to commit to clean power in emerging markets because of challenges such as local currency and exchange rate risks.
The organization also advocates the adoption of affordable public-domain technologies to drive solar deployment, according to Tripathy.
In the absence of fully-subsidized small scale solar applications, Tripathy pointed to the potential effectiveness of aggregating groups of clean power consumers – ideally living in close proximity – and presenting them as single investment opportunities to solar installers and investors, as a means of driving down the price of installations.
Arjun Dutt, senior analyst at the CEEW Center for Energy Finance, said solar projects in India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka suffer from varying degrees of the same hurdles to investment, with India showing the way for its Asian peers in how to deal with obstacles such as a lack of predictable development pipelines; inaccurate assessments of demand; and the inadequate scale of domestic capital available to invest, plus its associated finance costs.
Webinar participants also cited electricity transmission constraints as a hurdle to clean power roll-out in developing markets.
Potential solutions included the introduction of renewable portfolio standards, which require power generators to source a percentage of their electricity from clean generation; the establishment of centralized renewables parks, to overcome land acquisition and power transmission risks; and improving contracts to make them more bankable by adding termination provisions, sovereign guarantees, and allocation of change-in-law risks to power purchase agreements.
Lucial Arboleya, economic and financial analyst at the International Energy Agency, called on stakeholders in the global solar industry to focus on emerging markets and developing economies and ISA advisor Kuljit Singh Popli pointed to the World Bank‘s work on improving the bankability of renewables in such markets through policy and market-related approaches. Falling solar costs, added Popli, will accelerate PV adoption but he stressed quality should remain paramount, adding: “A project is as strong as its weakest link so we have to find out the weakest links and then we have to address them.”
State bodies and banks have the power to de-risk renewables and attract investors, said World Bank senior energy specialist Surbhi Goyal.
With the webinar highlighting the crucial role emerging markets will play in the global energy transition, it was pointed out investors must be encouraged to finance clean power projects which include energy storage, as well as backing vital cross-border energy interconnectors.
Dutt wrapped up the session on a positive note, stating: “It is the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that can help us collectively address these common challenges so we can push utility scale renewables in emerging economies, and therefore advance the global energy transition.”

The plants—located at Jalalabad in the Shahjahanpur district and at Sahaswan in the Budaun district—were commissioned almost one month ahead of their schedule.
Both the plants benefit from power purchase agreements with Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) at INR 3.22/kWh and INR 3.19/kWh, for 25 years.
The plants will connect to AGEL’s Energy Network Operation Centre (ENOC) platform, which helps the developer ensure superior operational performance of its entire solar and wind plants spread across diverse locations in India.
“With this [plants in Uttar Pradesh], we have added a capacity of 700 MW capacity since the beginning of challenging Covid-19 pandemic crisis. This places AGEL’s total renewable portfolio of 14,815 MW well on track to reach its vision of 25 GW capacity by 2025,” read a statement.
Speaking on this development, Vneet S. Jaain, managing director and chief executive officer, Adani Green Energy Ltd said, “ The company’s approach of three years of advanced site resource estimation, design planning, supply chain assurance with our team’s commitment and ability to deliver projects with great focus, makes it possible for us to execute the projects ahead of committed schedule. It also asserts our expertise in executing and operating the plants. With this, we continue to strengthen our advancement towards our long-term vision to achieve a renewable capacity of 25 GW by 2025 through a mix of strategic approach and operational excellence.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/01/electric-vehicle-transition-presents-us266-billion-investment-opportunity-this-decade/,"ELECTRIC VEHICLES,ENERGY STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 1, 2021",Electric vehicle transition presents US$266-billion investment opportunity this decade,"Transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) will require a cumulative capital investment of US$ 266 billion (INR 19.7 lakh crore) across EVs, charging infrastructure, and batteries over this decade in India, according to a report by government thinktank NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)
Taking a weighted average of future sales, the report said EVs could account for 70% of vehicle sales across passenger and freight segments in 2030. The analysis is based on the forecasted cost competitiveness and expert interviews.
The report arrived at the EV transition cost by considering the cumulative cost of vehicles, EV equipment supply hardware, and batteries (including replacements) between 2020 and 2030 for this EV adoption scenario.
The report also identifies a $50-billion (INR 3.7-lakh crore) market for EV financing in 2030—about 80% of the current size of India’s retail vehicle finance industry, estimated to be worth about Rs 4.5 lakh crore (US$ 60 billion).
“The need of the hour is to mobilize capital and finance towards EV assets and infrastructure,” said Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. “As we work to accelerate domestic EV adoption and push for globally competitive manufacturing of EVs and components such as advance cell chemistry batteries, we need banks and other financiers to step up to lower the cost and increase the flow of capital for EVs.”
The report states that India’s EV ecosystem has so far focused on overcoming hurdles to adoption associated with technology cost, infrastructure availability, and consumer behaviour. 
It identifies financing as the next critical barrier to accelerate India’s electric mobility transition. End users currently face several challenges such as high interest rates, high insurance rates, and low loan-to-value ratios, it adds.
To address these challenges, the report proposes ten solutions that financial institutions such as banks and non-banking financial companies, as well as the industry and the government, can adopt in catalyzing the required capital.
Recommendations
“Re-engineering vehicle finance and mobilizing public and private capital will be critical to accelerating the deployment of the 50 million EVs that could be plying on India’s roads by 2030,” said Clay Stranger, Senior Principal, Rocky Mountain Institute. 
“The solutions [presented in the report] represent high-leverage areas for interventions in finance, and we believe that many are relevant beyond India.”
The report proposes financial instruments such as priority sector lending and interest rate subvention. It also highlights the need for creating better partnerships between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and financial institutions by providing product guarantees and warranties. Furthermore, a developed and formal secondary market can improve the resale value of EVs and improve their bankability.
Recommendations beyond finance include digital lending, business model innovation, fleet and aggregator electrification targets, and the creation of an open data repository for EVs.

The solar projects will be developed on a build, own, operate basis, using Indian-made cells and modules. They can be developed anywhere in the nation and can be ground-mounted; floating—including on canals; rooftop arrays; or any combination thereof.
The power generated by the projects will be either for self-consumption or use by government entities. The solar electricity will be supplied either directly or via power distribution companies, on payment of mutually agreed usage charges of not more than INR2.20/kWh, plus any third-party charges.
Projects are eligible for viability gap funding (VGF)—to help them become commercially viable—under the CPSU program, up to a maximum INR70 lakh/MW. The actual level of VGF funding awarded will be determined through reverse bidding auctions by project developers.
Half the VGF support will be paid upon award of each engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract, including to in-house EPCs, with the balance released upon projects being commissioned.
The minimum amount of generation capacity developers can bid for is 1 MW and there is no upper limit other than the total 5 GW figure.
