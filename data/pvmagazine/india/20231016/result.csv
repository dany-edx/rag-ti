https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/16/combination-of-half-cut-bifacial-solar-cell-designs-may-contribute-to-hotspot-formation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 16, 2023","Combination of half-cut, bifacial solar cell designs may contribute to hotspot formation","Cutting silicon cells in half, and making them able to generate electricity from sunlight hitting both sides, are two innovations that brought the possibility of increased energy yield at little extra production cost. Consequently, both of these have grown rapidly over the past few years, and now represent the mainstream in solar cell and module manufacturing.
New research, which was among the winners of a poster award at the EU PVSEC conference held in Lisbon last month, has demonstrated that the combination of half-cut and bifacial cell designs may contribute to hotspot formation and performance issues, under certain conditions. And current testing standards, the study’s authors warned, may not be equipped to spot modules vulnerable to this type of degradation.
The researchers, led by Spain-based technical consultancy Enertis Applus, covered parts of a PV module to observe its behavior under partial shading. “We forced shadowing to take a deep dive into the behavior of monofacial and bifacial half-cell modules, focusing on hot spot formation and the temperatures these spots reach,” explained Sergio Suárez, global technical manager at Enertis Applus. “Interestingly, we identified mirrored hot spots that emerge in the opposite position with respect to normal hot spots without apparent reasons, like shadowing or breakages.”
The study indicated that the voltage design of half-cell modules may cause hotspots to spread beyond the shaded/damaged area. “The half-cell modules presented an intriguing scenario,” continued Suárez. “When a hotspot emerges, the module’s inherent voltage parallel design pushes other unaffected areas to develop hotspots as well. This behavior could hint at potentially faster degradation in half-cell modules due to the appearance of these multiplied hotspots.”
The effect was also shown to be especially strong in bifacial modules, which reached hotspot temperatures up to 10 C higher than the single-sided modules in the study. The modules were tested over a 30-day period under high irradiance conditions, with both cloudy and clear skies. The study is soon set to be published in full, as part of the proceedings of the 2023 EU PVSEC event.
According to the researchers, these results reveal a route to performance loss that is not well covered by module testing standards.
“A singular hotspot on the lower part of the module might instigate multiple upper hotspots, which, if not addressed, could accelerate the module’s overall degradation through increased temperature,” said Suárez. He further noted that this could place additional importance on maintenance activities such as module cleaning, as well as system layout and wind cooling. But spotting the problem early on would be preferable to this, and require new steps in testing and quality assurance at the manufacturing stage.
“Our findings spotlight a need and an opportunity to re-evaluate and possibly update standards for half-cell and bifacial technologies,” said Suárez. “It’s essential to factor in thermography, introduce specific thermal patterns for half-cells and adjust the normalisation of thermal gradients to Standard Test Conditions (STC) for bifacial modules.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/16/solar-panel-waste-is-not-a-significant-problem/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RECYCLING,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",,"OCTOBER 16, 2023",Solar panel waste is not a significant problem,"The fastest energy change in history is underway. New solar PV generation capacity is being deployed faster than everything else put together. The price of PV continues to fall, and PV is essentially unconstrained. Thus, solar PV is growing to dominate not just electricity production, but also all forms of energy production, via the electrification of nearly everything.
Typical electricity consumption in advanced economies is 7-12 MWh per person per year. This will need to double to accommodate the electrification of transport, heating and industry. In some countries, additional electricity will be required to decarbonize the chemical industry: metals, ammonia, plastics, synthetic jet fuel, etc. Most of this electricity will come from solar, with limited support from wind and hydro.
For illustrative purposes, we can take an average per capita solar electricity generation of 20 MWh per year in an affluent fully decarbonized country. Assuming a typical DC capacity factor of 16% (rooftop and ground-mounted), then each person needs 15 kW of solar panels with an area of about 70 m2.
The panel lifetime is 20-30 years, and so about 3 m2 of solar panel waste per person per year is generated, with a mass of about 30 kg. This is small compared with the solid municipal waste stream in the USA of about 900 kg per person per year, and very small compared with CO2-equivalent emissions in the USA of 19,000 kg per person per year.
The aluminum frame and electrical cables of retiring solar panels are normally recovered because of their value.
Most of the rest of the panel is glass, which is not toxic and the raw materials of which are inexhaustible. The mass of glass in 3 m2 of solar panel is about 20 kg. This compares with the current US glass waste stream of 30 kg per person per year. Thus, if entirely discarded as landfill, solar panels would increase the glass waste stream, by two thirds, which is significant but far from overwhelming. The high quality of discarded low-iron solar glass may find specialist applications, including as starting material for new generations of solar panels, and in the road sign paint industry.
The solar panels also contain about 1.2 kg of silicon which is a non-toxic and extremely abundant material (n. 2 in the Earth’s crust). The balance of the panel comprises thin layers of protective plastic and a small mass of conductive metals such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al) and silver (Ag) that may be recovered and recycled, depending on sufficient volumes to justify investments in recycling equipment.
A growing market in developing countries is the reuse, or second life, of solar panels. Many utility-scale solar power plants are replacing their 15% efficient panels with 22% efficient bifacial double-glass panels. The same trucks that deliver the new panels take back the retiring panels, which are then sorted and sent for a second life in low-power applications elsewhere.
During the early growth of an industry, the logistics to deal with retiring products might not initially keep up. This currently applies to both lithium batteries and solar panels. However, the pace of adoption of both technologies means that this will change quickly. The mature lead-acid battery industry provides a good example of high collection rates.
As the PV industry grows and matures, businesses will develop for sustainably managing end-of-life solar panels. The amount of PV materials to be recycled will remain comfortably below existing waste and recycling streams and hence no special disposal and recycling technology or logistics is required. Managing retiring solar panels will not be a limitation on the replacement of fossil fuels by solar.
Importantly, the 3 m2 of solar panels per person that is recycled each year has generated 20 MWh of electricity over its lifetime and displaced 20 tonnes of CO2 emissions. This is about 1000 times larger than the waste in the panels, and its avoidance is a spectacular environmental gain.
The waste stream of a wind turbine is similarly small compared with the CO2 displaced during its lifetime. Images of retiring turbine blades and solar panels being buried that periodically circulate on the web in shock articles fail to point out the 1000 larger mass of CO2 emissions that the turbines and panels have avoided.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/16/residential-battery-inventories-soaring-in-europe-says-sp-global/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 16, 2023","Residential battery inventories soaring in Europe, says S&P Global","The second quarter of 2023 was the first quarter on record in which global residential energy storage shipments have declined year on year, down by 2%, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.
Shipments to Europe have slowed significantly, with Belgium and Spain reporting year-on-year declines of 60%, while Italy saw a drop of more tham 40%. In contrast, South Africa has emerged as a standout market, with shipments surging by more than 300% year on year.
Europe’s residential inventory levels, particularly for imported systems, rose considerably by the end of 2022. Coupled with subdued demand in the first half of the year, this surplus inventory contributed to the decline in shipments.
Overall, the shipments to various European markets tracked by S&P Global Commodity Insights contracted by 3% year on year in the first half of 2023. However, German system suppliers bucked this trend, posting a remarkable increase of nearly 30% during the same period.
“By the end of 2022, S&P Global estimates that inventory levels in key European markets had reached nearly 5 GWh,” Susan Taylor, senior analyst for S&P Global, told pv magazine. “It’s worth noting that this also includes products that are in transit from Asia, as well as those waiting to be installed.”
According to Taylor, inventory levels equal to around six months of installations – around 3 GWh – are seen as normal. But the levels that S&P Global calculated in Europe at the end of 2022 were far higher.
“This certainly poses a challenge for the market in the event that demand stops growing as quickly as it had been, as we’ve seen in the first half of 2023,” Taylor said. “Another knock-on effect from the oversupply and high inventory will be aggressive prices, similar to what is happening with residential PV at the moment, as distributors have to clear their stock.”
Despite high inventory levels, new Chinese suppliers are entering the market and scaling quickly to ship large volumes. This trend will further exacerbate high inventory levels in Europe relative to slowing demand, according to analysts.
In the United States, supply and demand is more balanced. However, S&P Global has also tracked quarter-on-quarter declines in residential storage shipments to the US market since the fourth quarter of 2022.
“This is due to a couple of reasons,” Tiffany Wang, an analyst for S&P Global, told pv magazine. “High interest rates are the main driver, which makes the financing for storage systems looks less appetizing. Marketwise, a backlog of NEM 2.0 solar-only installations, plus decreases in electricity prices in central US means that people are delaying storage installations.”
However, the analysts said that the minor oversupply issue will probably be rectified by the end of the year, thanks to higher demand from NEM 3.0 solar and storage installations in California, which will help to deplete inventory.
Globally, S&P Global said it expects residential energy storage installations to rise by approximately 15% in 2023. However, shipment growth is expected to be more gradual as inventory levels are gradually depleted.
“Residential storage growth in mature markets like Germany will continue, driven by a strong residential PV market and supportive subsidies,” Taylor said. “In general, short-term limitations will stem from reduced consumer spending, while longer-term growth will be driven by retrofitting existing PV systems coupled with the increasing advancements in sophisticated home energy management systems incorporating EV charging, heat pumps, and virtual power plants.”
