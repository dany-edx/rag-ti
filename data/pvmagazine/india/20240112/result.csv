Coal, for instance, is one of the dirtiest fuels, but makes up 70% of India’s power generation.
The current wave of global actions against climate change is, arguably, not as urgent as required, but is a step in the right direction. Going by recent events, it is right to say that the world may be hanging by a thread, as Mother Nature continues to react violently to human’s irresponsible behaviour. From wildfires, typhoons, and floods, to heatwaves and other climate change-induced disasters, humanity is paying dearly for its many years of illicit exploitation and maltreatment of earth’s natural and mineral resources.
The chief culprit is the energy sector, with coal, crude oil, and natural gas contributing more than 80% of the world’s energy. According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, these fossil fuels have continued to power economies for more than 150 years. Not only are these energy sources depletable, but their exploitation and usage also cause massive devastation to the ecosystem. From polluting the air and contaminating water bodies, to depleting the ozone layer, a transition to cleaner, healthier, more efficient energy sources is now a necessity.
In India, this has become a major focus for the government and development partners in the last decade, even though there is still a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. As of 2021, more than 77% of India’s energy needs were met by fossil fuels, primarily coal and oil. This is still a far cry from the country’s vision to triple its renewable energy capacity by 2030 and has keyed into the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions Target of 2050. This would mean increasing its solar energy generation to at least 32% and wind to around 12% by 2030.
The central government has long identified solar energy as a topmost priority in the country’s plan to move away from overreliance on fossil fuels. Impressively, solar power has intensified in India over the last five years, increasing its share from barely 1% of the energy/power mix in 2017 to about 5% in 2022.  What is clear is a consistent effort on the part of the authorities to achieve a healthy renewable energy mix in the near future. Between 1901 to 2018, official records show that India’s average temperature rose by about 0.7°C. That is a leap too severe to ignore.
This year alone, landslides and flash floods overtook several cities in India, causing devastating consequences, including deaths and destruction of property. The incidents in Himachal Pradesh are still fresh in memory, as horrific scenes filled television screens of vehicles being washed away, bridges ripped apart, and buildings destroyed. Agriculture, which is the mainstay for many families, was hit tremendously, leaving households in hunger and penury.
Much of this is caused by carbon emissions from the use of fossil fuels. With solar taking a more significant portion of the energy and power mix, climate change can be significantly mitigated. Coal, for instance, is one of the dirtiest fuels, but makes up 70% of India’s power generation. Emissions from coal power plants are some of the most dangerous. By cutting down on such reliance and replacing coal power with solar power, the country can get respite from climate change effects.
India would need to increase its solar power capacity by as much as 36% every year if it intends to achieve its 2030 target of 500 GW. That is a laudable feat, but it requires the concerted effort of every stakeholder; from the central and sub-regional governments to the private sector players and regulators. Solar offers a renewable alternative that neither burns nor emits any gas, is easy to use, and is cost-effective to maintain.
Using solar energy as main or supplementary power, depending on the area, will be a great move. In areas powered by wind, solar can serve as a standby supplementary source, rather than petrol or diesel generators. In suburbs and rural communities cut off from the national grid, solar farms and rooftop installations can be a clean way to power such communities while also safeguarding the planet from the effects of climate change.

As the sodium-ion battery technology continues to mature, new product and manufacturing announcements are coming thick and fast from newcomers and established players alike.
With mainly pilot plants or small manufacturing lines up and running today, US-based battery system developer and manufacturer Acculon Energy has started the series production of its sodium-ion battery modules and packs and unveiled plans to scale its production to 2 GWh by mid-2024.
Acculon’s first two sodium-ion products support a range of applications and are available in small and large modules, capable of building into varying capacities and voltage levels. The product are meeting the safety requirements of UL standards like 2271, 2580, 1973, and 9540, and comply with stringent UN regulations.
The company has been conducting research and development with the technology since its inception in 2009, “culminating in the commercialization of sodium-ion products poised to meet the ever-growing power demands of its OEM customers.”
“We’ve seen the technology readiness level and availability of sodium cells improve impressively over the past two years,” said Acculon President Andrew Thomas. “Along the way, we’ve invested heavily to validate cells in our renowned test lab and conduct pre-certification destructive testing. Our customers demand durable performance and a compelling value proposition–our sodium-ion batteries will achieve both.”
Previously, Acculon Energy revealed some results of its own research into sodium-ion cells, which it described as “promising.”
“On one of the high-energy sodium-ion cell types, we are now about the 300th cycle of 0.5 C rate cycling at room temperature with full depth of discharge and getting 96.3% of maximum capacity,” the company said in a press release in October. “Based on the linear degradation trend, the 80% capacity limit is projected to be reached after about 1650 cycles. This impressive level of durability, if achieved, could open a door to numerous diverse applications.”
There are also other aspects that make sodium-ion batteries a viable alternative to lithium-ion technology, such as superior environmental credentials, enhanced safety, and better raw material costs.
According to UK-based market research company IDTechEx, a sodium ion battery with a layered metal oxide cathode and hard carbon anode will have approximately 25% to 30% lower material costs than an lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. However, significant savings are unlikely initially as the technology will take time to scale.
Taking different chemistries into account, IDTechEx calculates that the average cell cost for sodium-ion batteries is $87/kWh. By the end of the decade, the production cost of sodium-ion battery cells using primarily iron and manganese will probably bottom out at around $40/kWh, which would be around $50/kWh at the pack level, the research company says. By comparison, BNEF’s analysis found LFP average cell prices fell below $100/kWh in 2023.
In its latest report on sodium-ion technology, IDTechEx calculates that the capacities that have been publicly announced by various raw material and battery manufacturers alone add up to well over 100 GWh by 2030. “By 2025, significantly more capacity can be built up than that has been financed so far if investors are found for it in the course of 2024,” the research firm said.

The EIA forecasts the deployment of 45 GW (DC) of utility-scale solar projects larger than 1 MW in 2024. This is projected increase to about 53 GW in 2025, said the agency.

Adding Wood Mackenzie Power and Renewables conservative projections of 6 GW in residential solar and 2 GW in commercial projects, the total solar capacity expected for 2024 is 53.5 GW.
The projected figures for 2025 suggest a potential total of 65 GW of deployed solar capacity.
The EIA also said that utility-scale solar is expected to account for 6% of total electricity generation in 2024 and 7% in 2025. This is set against a backdrop in which overall electricity generation is predicted to grow by 3% in 2024 and remain constant in 2025.

Small-scale solar generation is expected to account for 2% to total electricity generation in 2024, increasing to 2.3% in 2025. This suggests that solar power could represent 8% of the total electricity used in 2024 and 9.3% in 2025. If deployment reaches about 65 GW in 2025, solar power could account for nearly 11% of all electricity generation in 2026.
