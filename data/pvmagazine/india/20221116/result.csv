UBI will implement the partnership under its solar scheme called ‘Union Solar,’ which was launched on a pan-India level to relieve the MSMEs from the stress of higher power costs and grid exigencies. 
“MSMEs can avail the dual services of solar EPC by Tata Power Solar Systems, financed through term loan facility by Union Bank of India, wherein industries can avail up to INR 8 crores of loan amount at best possible interest rates (exclusive for Tata Power customers) with nil or minimum collateral,” said the two companies in a joint statement. 
The scheme also requires minimum down payment of only 15-20% of project cost thus making it very attractive for MSMEs.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/16/bcd-pass-through-to-benefit-up-to-6-gw-of-solar-projects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 16, 2022",BCD pass-through to benefit up to 6 GW of solar projects,"The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)’s move to allow solar import duty pass-through under Change in Law will benefit up to 6 GW of already bid-out PV projects, according to a new report by Crisil Ratings.
Tariffs for these projects will increase by 50-70 paise ($0.0062-$0.0086)/kWh as the developers are allowed to pass on the impact of basic customs duty on cells and modules under ‘change-in-law’. The increased tariff will remain well below the average power purchase cost for discoms in India, according to the report.
The BCD imposition was likely to impact 17 GW of PV projects bid between October 1, 2019, and March 9, 2021. These projects were likely to procure modules post April 1, 2022, and could not have factored the customs duty in their bid tariffs.
“Based on our discussions with industry players, we estimate that for 50-60% of the 17 GW capacity, modules may be procured domestically, keeping it out of the ambit of duty. For another 10-15% of such capacity, modules were imported before the BCD imposition. Hence treating BCD as a ‘change in law’ event will benefit the remaining capacity of up to 6 GW, making the projects economically viable,” said Manish Gupta, senior director at Crisil Ratings.
These projects were bid at tariffs ranging from INR 1.99/kWh to INR 2.92/kWh, with only 20% of the projects being at a tariff of more than INR 2.55/kWh. Thus the increased tariff post-pass-through is expected to be in the range of INR 3-3.2/kWh, keeping them cost-competitive compared to the average power procurement cost for discoms in India.
However, duty pass-through brings partial relief for the project developers already seeing elevated module costs as they are set to import modules from this fiscal.
“Tariff pass-through remains only a partial relief as returns for these projects will remain weaker than envisaged at the time of bidding, as module prices have risen by 50% since then. This is in contrast to the industry expectation of softening prices, in line with past trends, and was not budgeted in tariffs while bidding,” said Ankit Hakhu, director at Crisil Ratings.

Its India leadership team is also being expanded to support the significant scale-up of PV installation.
SunSource provides solar-based energy and storage solutions to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers and manages the entire lifecycle of distributed solar projects.
“This investment to significantly bolster our solar energy delivery capacity reiterates SHV Energy’s commitment to India and to our solar subsidiary, SunSource Energy. Together with the expansion of our local management team, we will now be better equipped to address the evolving energy transition needs of commercial and industrial consumers in India and Southeast Asia,” said Bram Gräber, CEO of SHV Energy.
As part of its leadership team expansion, the company’s existing managing director, Kushagra Nandan, will take on the role of chief executive officer, and Adarsh Das has been appointed chief commercial officer to support the accelerated growth trajectory. Sytze Nijman will move from Netherlands-based SHV Energy to take on the role of chief operating officer.
“This expansion also enables us to continue to benefit from the global SHV Energy network and its vast expertise and resources,” said Kushagra Nandan, managing director and CEO of SunSource Energy.
Headquartered in Delhi NCR, SunSource Energy has a solar portfolio of over 400 MW, including projects deployed, contracted, and under-development, across 24 states in India and Southeast Asia.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/16/french-startup-reveals-rooftop-system-with-pv-panels-mini-wind-turbines/,"HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 16, 2022","French startup reveals rooftop system with PV panels, mini wind turbines","From pv magazine Global
French startup Unéole has developed a solar and wind hybrid innovation for rooftop applications. The company claims the scalable, silent unit can produce 40% more energy than standalone rooftop solar.
“Our solution is made for flat top rooftop buildings more than 10 meters high. The higher they are, the less perturbated the wind will be,” Louis Dubar, a business engineer at Unéole, told pv magazine.
The system includes a scalable galvanized steel structure with a row of 2,000 W wind turbines topped with solar panels, for a total height of about 4 meters. The right number of wind turbines and PV panels per structure is project-specific. The company claims the solution works with all solar panels on the market.
“The project will depend a lot on the building. The roof size and what the final costumer wants will affect the number of solar panels we can install,” Dubar said. “Our solution is to install the steel structure on the strong points of the building that will frame our wind turbines and support the photovoltaic panels.”
The company claims that the energy yield is 40% higher than standalone solar. It said this offsets the higher capex of its hybrid solution.
“With our solution we can install two to four times more photovoltaic panels than a standard [rooftop solar] installation,” said Dubar. “We are installing these panels four meters high from the rooftop, so we can cover every technical structure that is installed on the rooftop.”
For a system installed in a 1,000 sqm rooftop, the company estimates a total cost of €300,000 ($302, 385) to € 500,000. The price includes the cost of the solar panels, wind turbines, steel structure, wiring, and project studies performed by Unéole.
The company is currently developing algorithms to determine the adequate number of wind turbines and PV panels for each project. Last year, it started testing the system in a field in the CD2e LumiWatt site in Loos-en-Gohelle, France.  Unéole expects to commercialize and install the first hybrid solution by late 2023 in France. It plans to expand to neighboring countries in 2024.
