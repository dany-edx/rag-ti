The analysts say the manufacturing will be spurred by increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs). In addition to the robust demand from EV vehicles, the annual battery demand for stationary applications (grid storage, telecom towers, etc) is likely to grow rapidly and become substantial.
EVs saw a significant upturn in prospects in FY2022, driven by government support in the form of subsidies, enhanced awareness, and increasing product launches. ICRA expects EV penetration to grow exponentially across automotive segments over the next decade. EV battery demand in India is expected to touch 15 GWh by 2025 and 60 GWh by 2030.
Achieving economies of scale in battery manufacturing will remain critical in lowering the cost of an EV and helping achieve pricing parity. Additionally, given that the charging infrastructure penetration will only improve gradually, improvements in energy efficiency remain imperative. 
The analysts say locating cell manufacturing close to the original equipment manufacturers (OEM) would allow for the creation of a research and innovation ecosystem. This would aid the development of batteries with improved energy efficiency and better suited to Indian climatic conditions.
“In EVs, advanced chemistry batteries remain the most critical and the costliest component, accounting for almost 35-40% of the vehicle price. At present, battery cells are not manufactured in India, and thus most OEMs rely on imports, and manufacturing operations in India are limited to the assembly of battery packs,” said Shamsher Dewan, Senior Vice President & Group Head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA.
“To achieve mass-scale penetration of EVs and a competitive cost structure, India will need to create its own eco-system of developing battery cells locally. Multiple challenges exist on the road to establishing a cell manufacturing ecosystem, the primary ones being technology complexity, high capital intensity, and raw material availability. The ability of battery manufacturers to enter into agreements/alliances with players across the value chain to mitigate these risks, coupled with the creation of a robust framework for recycling, would remain key,” said Dewan.
Given the expected surge in battery demand for both EV and stationary applications, numerous entities have already committed significant investments in cell manufacturing. The Government of India (GoI) recently signed agreements with three companies for incentives under its Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage. The scheme emphasizes domestic value addition and is expected to support capability development in this sunrise sector.
Lithium-ion batteries have emerged as the battery of choice for EVs, given their high energy efficiency, decent thermal stability, and low self-discharge. “While lithium nickel manganese oxide (NMC) is the most prevalent cathode chemistry currently, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry is expected to gain increased acceptance going forward, given its higher thermal stability and lower production cost. Multiple other chemistries also continue to be under development, even as commercial viability for such chemistries may take time,” states the report.

The sector could generate revenues of $212 billion throughout this period, it claimed.
The report lists green bonds, consumer-centric clean tech, electric mobility, utility-scale solar, microgrids, energy as a service, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, green hydrogen, green gas grid, and carbon recycling as the top 10 areas for investment in renewables and clean technology. These top 10 emerging areas collectively offer a $266 billion investment opportunity by 2030, according to Aspire Circle India.
It said these areas could generate revenues of $146 billion through to 2030. It also estimated the investment potential for electric mobility at $90 billion, consumer-centric clean tech at $61 billion, green bonds at $37 billion, utility-scale solar at $31 billion, green hydrogen at $15 billion, and microgrids at $12 billion.
Aspire Circle India said investment in the renewables space and clean-tech sector will affect 919 million people in India and create 3.4 million jobs by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/09/01/yingli-unveils-n-type-topcon-solar-panel-with-22-0-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2022",Yingli unveils n-type TOPCon solar panel with 22.0% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Yingli Solar has unveiled a new bifacial n-type solar module based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells.
“Our n-type solar modules based on TOPCon cells can be mainly used in large-scale systems and harsh environments, because of their high bifaciality and high reliability,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Chinese solar module manufacturer said its TOPCon 24.5%-efficient cells are based on front-laminated composite film passivation, which enables the back tunnel oxide passivation contact technology to improve the cell open-circuit voltage by more than 710 mV.
“The backside micro-processing and ultra-thin tunneling passivation layer improve the backside efficiency, as well as the cell bifaciality to over 90%,” the spokesperson said.
The 156-cell Panda 3.0 PRO module is available in six versions, with power outputs ranging from 590 W to 615 W and efficiencies ranging from 22.11% to 22.0%. Its open-circuit voltage is between 54.74 V and 56.44 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.72 A and 14.12 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panel measures 2,465 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 35.0 kg. It also features an IP67 enclosure and 2 mm tempered glass. It has a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“Yingli’s TOPCon cell capacity will be 5 GW at the end of this year, and will reach 10 GW next year and 15 GW in 2024,” the spokesperson explained. “All these capacities are located in Chinese manufacturing bases including Hebei province and Tianjin city. The production capacity of modules corresponds to it.”
