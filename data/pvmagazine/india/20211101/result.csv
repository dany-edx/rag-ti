Manjesh Nayak, co-founder and chief financial officer at Oorjan Cleantech, says PV project costs in India have gone up 10-15%, causing an increase in power purchase agreement (PPA) tariffs for solar electricity of around INR0.20-0.30.
“The shortage of coal, and power-rationing in China has heavily impacted [Chinese] production lines and schedules, leading to upward pressure on the prices of solar hardware and uncertainty around delivery timelines. Since the Indian solar hardware brands are heavily reliant on Chinese imports, like solar cells, wafers, and inverter hardware, the domestic hardware industry has also got negatively affected,” said Nayak.
Trade tensions, supply chain problems, severe weather and more will be discussed on Tuesday, November 9, at pv magazine‘s virtual Roundtables USA 2021 event. Join us as solar experts discuss the big issues next Tuesday. For more information and to register free for the event, click here.
The Indian price increase comes at a time when PV developers are rushing to complete projects delayed by Covid lockdowns and also trying to take advantage of a duty-free window of opportunity between the expiry, at the end of July, of a safeguarding levy applied on Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese imports, and the application of basic customs duty on solar products, which will be introduced from April 1. 
“Consumers are caught in a catch-22 situation because of the proposed 40% basic customs duty back in India, and the [raised] GST [general sales tax] rates on one hand, and the uncertainty on the Chinese supply side on the other,” said Nayak. 
The solar developer has called for an urgent geopolitical intervention to ease the pressure on installers, such as by easing imports from non-Chinese original equipment manufacturers and deferring application of the customs duty on solar.
India has recently ramped up coal-fired power to avoid the sort of industrial black-outs which have been applied in China, with domestic coal supply increased despite the heavy rains in August and September which hindered mining activity; a steep rise in demand for electricity driven by the Covid-19 recovery; and increasingly more expensive coal imports.
The cost of imported coal is relevant as domestic supplies of the fuel can meet only 60-65% of annual demand in a nation which still depends on the polluting fossil fuel for around 70% of its power generation. The ramp up in coal production and use will have come at an awkward moment for the representatives India has sent to the COP26 climate change summit which opened in Glasgow this week.
“Power demand in India increased from August 2021 onwards as the country recovered from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic,” stated a recent report issued by ratings agency Care Ratings. “Power demand has been surging since June 2021, with peak demand crossing 200 GW in July 2021. Power consumption for the period August 2021 and September 2021 increased from 106.6 BU [billion units] per month in 2019 ([a] pre-Covid year) to 124.2 BU per month in 2021. While power demand grew, the coal-based power plants (in India) could not stock up on the coal inventory ahead of the monsoon season due to a sharp increase in the international coal prices, as well as freight rates. This put pressure on these power plants to meet the increased power demand as the country ramps up … economic activity with increased vaccination and complete opening up of businesses, post the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April 2021.”
Pinaki Bhattacharyya, managing director and chief executive of developer Amp Energy India, said the situation requires the Indian government to accelerate the deployment of renewables instead, and said the authorities should help renewable energy generators by reversing the planned increase in taxes and duties to enable them to immediately deploy the 20 GW backlog in project capacity and make much-needed power available. 
“Also, it should be a wake-up call for discoms [electricity distribution companies] and corporates to immediately sign renewable PPAs and PSAs [power sale agreements], and [for] consumers to tie up long-term [renewables generation] capacity at predictable prices as a hedge against increasing coal prices and short-term power markets … as the renewable energy costs will keep rising, so now is the right time to lock in long-term renewable power.”

Countries are choosing to make sustainable energy choices over fossil fuels. India too has made significant progress in increasing its share of renewable energy in its energy mix.
According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), India will be the main driver of rising demand for energy over the next two decades, accounting for 25 per cent of global growth. The country is set to overtake the European Union as the world’s third-biggest energy consumer by 2030.
Production of coal and its prices have gradually increased over the years, while solar prices have plummeted year on year. High freight rates charged by railways accompanied by the levying of a myriad of taxes has resulted in higher rates of domestic coal than imported coal.

Much of India’s 33 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power capacity currently under construction and another 29 GW in the pre-construction stage will end up stranded due to competition from renewables, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). Unlike non-renewable energy sources, Solar does not incur source cost or raw material costs. Only capital cost is incurred which is easy to recover in a short period. Solar tariffs in India are now below even the fuel costs of running most existing coal-fired power plants. The solar power tariff hit an all-time low level of ₹1.99 per kWh bid in a Gujarat auction in December.
In fact, it is interesting to note how Coal India Limited (CIL) the world’s largest coal mining firm made global headlines when it announced in March that it would aggressively pursue solar energy and continue to close smaller mines. The company even announced that it would invest in a 3 GW solar energy project in a joint venture with state-run NLC India.
All of these factors clearly indicate that the Return on Investment is better in solar than in coal.
The Indian government has tried to create a conducive environment for enabling flow of foreign investments into the renewable energy sector in the country. As per IHS Markit’s latest Global Renewables Markets Attractiveness Rankings for the period ending December 2020, India ranked third most attractive market for solar investment. India’s solar rank is boosted by its market size, a very strong target (100 GW by 2022, of which 40 GW is rooftop – expanding to 280 GW by 2030), and a well-defined auction calendar at both federal and state levels to support its ambitions.
FDI’s role in bringing in finance, superior technology and other resources is undoubtedly a critical one. The government needs to ease the norms further for investment in the Indian renewable energy sector. This sector would benefit greatly from free capital flow, which would also really push the industry to its maximum growth potential. According to the data released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), this investment stands at over US$ 42 billion since 2014.
Renewable energy can not only meet the country’s burgeoning power demand, but also create employment in rural areas. This will also help the country achieve its Paris Climate Accord target of reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35 per cent below 2005 levels well before the target date of 2030.
Further, the government needs to address any deterrents (such as policy bottlenecks, poor grid infrastructure to keep up with the pace of grid expansion, financially stressed discoms), and bring in more investments across the solar value chain and ensure a much faster transition to an energy mix that is truly renewable, and sustainable.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/01/new-tech-to-recover-pure-silicon-from-end-of-life-solar-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 1, 2021",New tech to recover pure silicon from end-of-life solar cells,"From pv magazine International
Scientists from India’s KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology have developed a new technique to recycle pure silicon from solar cells at the end of their lifecycle.
Unlike other conventional methods to recycle silicon from PV devices, the new technique is not based on the use of highly toxic chemical hydrofluoric acid, which is commonly utilized in the PV industry for both quartz cleaning and wafer etching. In solar module recycling, the corrosive acid is used for separating silicon from the cell by removing the antireflecting coating, silver, lead, and p-n junction.
The corrosive acid was replaced by the Indian group with three different chemicals: a 10 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was applied to the aluminum layer for five minutes at 63 degrees Celsius; a 6 M solution of nitric acid (HNO3) was utilized to remove the silver electrodes and lead; and a solution of 90% phosphoric acid was used to remove the antireflecting coating based on silicon nitride (Si3NA4) for 45 minutes at 70 degrees Celsius.
The outer parts of a solar panel such as glass, ethylene-vinyl acetate glass, copper, steel, aluminum, and plastic were previously removed through thermal degradation.
According to the scientists, the proposed technique is able to deliver recycled silicon with a purity of up to 99.9984%. The recycling cost for 1 kg solar cell with this process is estimated at $68.9 and the total profit after recycling a 1 kg solar cell is calculated to be $185.4. The recovered silicon can be used to manufacture new solar cells or electronic components such as diodes, transistors, and microchips, they explained.
The recycling technique is also said to enable the recovery of aluminum, silver, and lead as aluminum hydroxide, silver chloride, and lead oxide, respectively. It is described in the paper “Recovery of Pure Silicon and Other Materials from Disposed Solar Cells,” published in the International Journal of Photoenergy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/01/sunman-unveils-430-w-glass-free-solar-module/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 1, 2021",Sunman unveils 430 W glass free solar module,"From pv magazine International
Chinese solar module manufacturer Sunman has launched a new panel series with a power output of up to 430 W.
“An innovation combining proven crystalline silicon solar cells with Sunman’s patented composite material, eArc has the same durability and robustness of conventional glass modules,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “However, unlike glass, eArc is akin to a flexible ‘solar skin’ that is 70% lighter and up to 95% thinner.”
The eArc SMF430F module is available in two versions with nominal power of 425 and 430 W and a power conversion efficiency of 19.0 and 19.3%, respectively. Its open circuit voltage is 49.6-49.8 V and the short-circuit current is 10.67-10.64 A.
The new product has a size of 2,125×1,051x35mm and weighs in at 11.2kg. It relies on 144 half-cut monocrystalline cells, a white backsheet, a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy, and a junction box with an IP 68 rating.
The glass free panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. The power temperature coefficient is -0.38% per degree Celsius.
The new module, which comes with a 25-year linear power output warranty and a 12-year product guarantee, is manufactured through a process based on the use of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP), which the manufacturer says reduces light reflection and opens up new assembly options. As with other products from the company, the new panel can be bonded directly to curved roofs. 
“The eArc modules can be the way to make solar energy usable in the long term and economically, particularly in the case of existing buildings or areas that make conventional assembly uneconomical or, for example, impossible due to a load limit,” the manufacturer said in a statement released.
