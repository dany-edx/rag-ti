“Burning characteristics of hydrogen are much different from LPG or PNG wrt flame color (almost invisible), flame temperature (1200-1500 degrees C), flame propagation speed, etc. Also, unlike LPG or PNG, hydrogen cannot be premixed with air before its ignition – else it would form an explosive mixture,” stated NETRA.
“Considering the above, a hydrogen burner was designed and used in a modified cookstove to prepare food. It may also be mentioned that the emission from hydrogen burner is only water vapor with zero carboneous element.”
NTPC has successfully commissioned a blending project that incorporates green hydrogen with PNG (piped natural gas) at Kawas. A green hydrogen mobility project in Leh is set to be commissioned. Besides, another project for setting up green hydrogen-based microgrids in remote locations for Indian Army is in progress.

The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2024 at Gandhinagar.
The hybrid projects will be located in various districts of Gujarat, predominantly in the underdeveloped wastelands of Kutch. These will supply power to the various utilities of India including GUVNL, and for self-consumption by Avaada for its green hydrogen/ammonia projects.
The projects are estimated to generate 17.5 billion units of green electricity per year and help offset around 16.3 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually, contributing significantly to India’s green energy supply and powering nearly 12.6 million households.
Moreover, the project development will generate 1,200 direct and indirect jobs, thereby contributing to local and regional economic development.
Vineet Mittal, chairperson of Avaada Group, said, “Renewable energy along with green hydrogen and its derivatives have emerged as powerful substitutes for fossil fuels, driving rapid decarbonization across various industries and regions…With its abundant natural resources including 300 sunshine days, availability of vast wasteland and long coastline, Gujarat has the potential to significantly contribute towards meeting the global demand for alternative solutions for fossil fuels.”
“At Avaada Group, our dedication to driving sustainable energy solutions takes another significant stride forward with the signing of this MoU.”
Besides this new 6 GW capacity committed in Gujarat, Avaada already has 2 GW of projects under operational or various stages of implementation in the state.

Saatvik will begin supplying the high-efficiency mono PERC 550 Wp modules in February this year. The supplies are expected to be completed within the next nine months.
Enrich Energy is a solar EPC company, which pioneered the solar park concept in India in 2011 and has since then developed solar projects across ten states in India.
Ankit Kanchal, managing director at Enrich Energy, said that this partnership reflects Enrich’s broader commitment towards local procurement and Make in India. He added that they aim to expand their solar EPC business across international borders, and possibly take this strategic tie-up to global markets in the future.
Prashant Mathur, CEO of Saatvik Solar, shared that the modules for Enrich projects will be delivered from Saatvik’s module manufacturing facility at Ambala, where the company recently enhanced its capacity to 3 GW and added n-type TOPCon modules in its product basket.
Mathur said they also intend to build a 2.5 GW greenfield project in Gandhidham, Gujarat.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/15/solar-wafer-prices-stabilize-with-potential-for-future-price-hike/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 15, 2024",Solar wafer prices stabilize with potential for future price hike,"From pv magazine Global
Solar wafer prices this week held steady following four consecutive weeks of falling prices. FOB China prices of Mono PERC M10 wafers trended flat on-week at $0.241 per piece (pc), while Mono PERC G12 wafer prices remained at $0.356/pc.

The primary cause of stable prices is a notable reduction in the availability of Mono PERC wafers, according to numerous sources. Multiple wafer producers have reportedly aggressively decreased operating rates for Mono PERC wafers in favor of switching their manufacturing lines from Mono PERC to n-type wafers.
In addition, some small and medium-sized wafer producers that have been selling their Mono PERC M10 wafers at low EXW pricing of between CNY1.8 ($0.25)/pc and CNY1.85/pc on the Chinese domestic market have successfully lowered their stock, according to a market observer. Consequently, the low-price portion for such wafers has vanished, with the majority of the price negotiation focused on the mainstream CNY1.93/pc, according to OPIS’ market survey.
There have also been reports of an impending price hike for Mono PERC wafers in the market. Multiple sources stated that a slight and temporary price increase for Mono PERC wafers may occur as a result of their decreasing supply.
Furthermore, the wafer market’s total operating rate has decreased as a result of some companies’ unstable n-type wafer production lines. According to the projection of the Silicon Industry of China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, China’s overall wafer production output in January might range from 54 GW to 56 GW, indicating a decline of 7.92% month over month.
According to a market expert, wafer manufacturers still try their best to maintain operating rates at a particular level despite the continuous wafer overcapacity. At present, polysilicon prices make up about half of wafer production costs, the source added, and went on to say that when polysilicon prices are nearly at their floor, it is essential for wafer makers to maintain specific operating rates to reduce non-silicon costs by as much as possible.
It’s an undeniable fact that the market for wafers is currently experiencing a severe overcapacity, according to a source in the polysilicon segment, who added that she is not optimistic about Chinese wafer businesses expanding into production overseas as one of the biggest obstacles is the high cost of producing abroad. Selecting a factory location in regions appropriate for labor-intensive businesses is crucial, said the source, who concluded that the best investment destination for this industry may still be Southeast Asia.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Thermal Systems (MHI Thermal Systems), a unit of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, has unveiled a monobloc air-to-water (ATW) heat pump to replace conventional boilers in new and existing buildings.
The Hydrolution EZY heat pump is available in two versions, with outputs of 10 kW and 14 kW.
The systems use difluoromethane (R32) as the refrigerant and can ensure “exceptional performance,” even at temperatures as low as -25 C, according to the manufacturer.
“The integrated water heat exchanger in the outdoor unit simplifies installation compared to the split-type systems, which requires both refrigerant piping and water piping,” it said in a statement.
MHI Thermal Systems also said that the new heat pumps feature an unspecified improved anti-vibration technology.
“This structure effectively reduces sound power levels, including noise, to 60dB (A) in the 10kW class model, even when running at full capacity,” it said. “Additionally, the addition of a quiet mode, further reducing operational noise, ensures compliance with various noise regulations, particularly important in densely populated residential areas.
MHI Thermal Systems also claims that the new product can produce domestic hot water with temperatures of up to 60 C when outdoor temperatures hit -25 C. It did not provide additional technical details, however.
In March 2023, MHI Thermal Systems unveiled a residential air-source heat pump using propane (R290) as the refrigerant.
