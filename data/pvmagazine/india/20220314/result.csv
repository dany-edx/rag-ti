Cells production capacity will rise to 18GW by the end of 2023 from just 4GW currently, according to JMK Research analysts.
The analysts estimated the two-year capacity addition based on the announcements by industry leaders or new entrants exploring the market.

The Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for solar PV manufacturing is acting as a major catalyst for the whole solar industry, according to JMK Research analysts. With a total budgetary layout of INR 24,000 crore, the scheme is expected to incentivize about 40-50GW of module production capacity.
“New entrants in solar manufacturing in India are targeting GW-scale installation capacities as well as upstream integration, in line with what the Government of India (GoI) is trying to achieve with its PLI scheme for solar modules. In the meantime, the relevant industry stakeholders also need to focus on upskilling the workforce, boosting R&D infrastructure, and most crucially, adopting uniform, long-term policies for the Indian solar sector,” stated the analysts.

TANGEDCO has proposed to set up solar power parks in each district of the State. The solar capacity will be combined with adequate energy storage capacity to ensure an uninterrupted power supply.
“TANGEDCO will initiate measures to set up 20,000 MW of solar power stations and 10,000 MW battery storage systems across a period of ten years, thereby supplying uninterrupted power supply to the consumers,” TANGEDCO chairman and managing director Thiru Rajesh Lakhoni said in a letter directed at all the district collectors in the State last year. 
TANGEDCO has proposed to establish 4GW of solar power stations and 2GW of battery storage systems across the State in the first phase. Its letter to district collectors has asked them to identify land to the extent of 20 to 200 acres suitable for setting up 5MW to 50MW solar park in the district.

OnSight Technology, a California-based startup, has developed an autonomous, tele-operated unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with a radiometric thermal imaging camera. It also has an optical zoom camera, backed by artificial intelligence, to detect, report and observe problems and anomalies in solar plants.
It is powered by solar energy and can move at a speed of 1.6 km per hour for up to 12 hours a day.
“The capabilities lead to the lowest cost and highest quality data in the industry,” said the company.
The company recently updated the solar O&M robot, which can now be booked through the manufacturer’s website. It uses 5G technology.
“It is controlled through our online portal and uses an Xbox controller,” the company said. “Setup is very simple and using the Xbox controller makes learning to move the robot extremely easy.”
OnSight Technology said that the robot can adapt to the needs of specific PV installations. The company also offers training and support to project owners.

Polish electronics supplier Green Cell has launched a residential battery based on lithium iron phosphate cells (LiFePO4).
Called GC PowerNest, the battery has a storage capacity of 5kWh and a voltage of 51.2V. It is scalable in an eight-stack configuration, thus reaching a capacity of up to 40kWh.
The new product is offered in a black casing and its weight is 50kg. It must be mounted on walls and comes with a 10-year warranty. According to the manufacturer, its price is currently €3,289.
The device is compatible with inverter brands such as Schneider Electric, SMA, Goodwe, Growatt, and Victron, among others.
