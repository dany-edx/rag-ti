The ashram, coming up at a remote place in Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, will have all its electric equipment running uninterrupted on solar electricity produced from a small rooftop solar plus storage system.
Solar panel maker and EPC provider Loom Solar was tasked with installing the system, which comprised 6x440W Shark Super high-efficiency panels, a 5kWh (100Ah/51.2V) Atom lithium battery, and a 5kVA high-frequency design (string) inverter. High-rise bi-facial panel stands were used to support the panels.
The solar system produces up to 3 kW and storage capacity is 5 kWh. The consumer needs to run LED lights, BLDC ceiling fans, TV set, and power socket, which meant a power consumption of about 500 watts at the same time. Thus, the total electricity produced by system is enough to run the necessary appliances day and night.
On the challenges faced in installation, Loom Solar co-founder and director Amol Anand told pv magazine, the location being a hilly area, it was a challenge to carry the products on foot from the delivery location to the installation site. The distance was about 1.5 km, and it took approx. 30 minutes (to and fro) to bring the product to the site.”

“Further, there were no electrical shops nearby. So the installation team had to walk approx. 5 km. from the installation location to get any product, if needed, from the Rishikesh market.”
Mobile network connection added to the challenge by making it difficult for the team members to coordinate with each other. When installing the panels, the team needed grid power to run a drill machine to tight M10 fasteners on the installation rooftop. It had to arrange grid power from a 1.5km away area using AC cables.
Also, there was the fear of forest animals and unpredictable climate conditions. All in all, it was a lot of learning experience for the team, said Amol.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/12/ballard-lands-fuel-cell-order-for-tata-motors-hydrogen-buses/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HYDROGEN,HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 12, 2021",Ballard lands fuel cell order for Tata Motors’ hydrogen buses,"Canada-headquartered Ballard Power Systems has landed an order to supply 15 of its 70kW fuel cell modules to power Tata Motors’ zero-emission electric buses. Ballard plans to complete the delivery of all modules by 2022. 
The buses are part of a joint study by Tata and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and planned for deployment in Faridabad, in the National Capital Region of Delhi.
Tata Motors will supply the 15 buses to the Research & Development Centre of IOCL. Tata and IOCL will jointly study the potential of fuel cell technology for commercial vehicles, including testing, maintenance and operation of the fuel cell electric buses in real-world public transport conditions in India’s National Capital Region. 
IOCL will also generate and dispense the hydrogen fuel to be used by the Ballard modules in these buses.
India is in mission mode on researching different aspects of the hydrogen economy, including hydrogen production, storage, and utilization for stationary, power generation, and transport applications.
 he government and the industry are increasingly looking at hydrogen – and particularly green hydrogen produced using renewable energy sources – as an alternative fuel to combat pollution levels in the country, especially in the National Capital Region where winter months see dangerous levels of polluted air. 
Moreover, a new energy transition coalition called India H2 Alliance was recently formed by major industry players, with a focus on commercializing hydrogen technologies and systems to create net-zero carbon pathways in India.
The Alliance will work towards developing blue and green hydrogen production and storage, and building a hydrogen economy that complements India’s national renewable energy and electric vehicle/battery-technology plans. It will also build hydrogen-use industrial clusters and transport use-cases with hydrogen-powered fuel cells.
