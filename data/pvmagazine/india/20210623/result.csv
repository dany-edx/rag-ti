https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/23/concrete-flywheel-storage-system-for-residential-pv/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"JUNE 23, 2021",Concrete flywheel storage system for residential PV,"From pv magazine International
France-based start-up Energiestro has developed a storage technology for residential PV based on a flywheel system based on concrete.
A flywheel system is able to store electricity by converting it into kinetic energy using a motor to spin a rotor. The flywheel rotates at such a high speed that the electrical power is transformed into mechanical power.
The proposed solution consists of a hollow, solid cylinder that is rotated around an axis and connected to an electric motor and generator. “When you have the energy to store, the engine drives the flywheel, which accelerates,” said the company’s co-founder and general director, André Gennesseaux. “In the other direction, the motor can act as a brake to discharge the electricity.”
To date, according to the manufacturer, most of the flywheels used for this kind of storage were made of steel. “But steel flywheels have a limit: their price, while stationary storage users are looking, above all, for the best costs,” Gennesseaux explained. “Some companies are also developing carbon cylinders, which are much lighter but, again, very expensive while our approach is not to work primarily on the weight because in this type of applications, it does not matter.”
According to the general director, carbon flywheels currently cost around €250/kWh, steel flywheels €200/kWh and concrete ones around a few euros. “The particularity of our patented technology is that the concrete cylinder is pre-stressed by a winding of fiberglass and is held in a vacuum to avoid friction,” Gennesseaux stated. Thanks to this, maintenance operations are reduced because the mechanical part is sealed and the lubricating oil is also in a vacuum environment, without risk of oxidation.
The flywheel is guaranteed for 30 years and a change of its inverter is expected after 15 years. “At the beginning, we chose concrete for price reasons, but we quickly found that its life cycle analysis was also positive,” Gennesseaux went on to say. “We are around 10 grams of CO2 per kWh, while lithium-ion batteries are around 40g CO2/kWh, at the same level as steel flywheels.”
Currently, Energiestro offers a standard storage solution with a nominal power of around 10 kW, which corresponds to a charge and discharge cycle in one hour.
The flywheel has a diameter of one meter and weighs three tons, and can be placed in the garden of a private house.
The system capacity should be increased, initially, to 20 kWh, and then 50 kWh, to eventually reach 24 hours of storage. “The size limit will be given by logistics as we have to find cranes capable of burying the flywheels in the ground, which is why we are limiting ourselves to 50 kWh in our current business plan,” Gennesseaux added, noting that the solution will be initially offered in France’s overseas territories and Africa.
The French company received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. “As a beta-test, we have a demonstration project with Voltalia in Guyana,” Gennesseaux said. “In this context, we will install a 10 kWh flywheel which will manage fluctuations on the network for one hour if a cloud passes.”
According to him, in hot and humid regions, the flywheels are much more robust and reliable than lithium-ion batteries. The company is also working in partnership with Engie on the Thémis solar power plant project in the Pyrénées-Orientales (3.4 MWp) where several 10 kWh flywheels will be installed with the objective of verifying the impact of this technology in frequency regulation, compared to lithium-ion batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/23/india-added-1-2-gw-of-renewables-during-covid-hit-april-and-may/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 23, 2021",India added 1.2 GW of renewables during Covid-hit April and May,"India added an aggregate 1.2 GW of power generation capacity in the first two months of the current financial year (April-May 2021), all of which came from solar (1 GW) and wind (0.2 GW), according to a new report by Care Ratings.
The two-month capacity addition has been the highest in the last four years when compared to the same months in the previous years. 
Also, the 1.2 GW of solar and wind capacity addition in the first two months of 2021-22 has been double that of the same period during the previous year. 
As of May 31, 2021, the nation reached a total domestic electricity generation capacity of 383 GW, with conventional energy capacity at 288 GW (75% share in total) and renewable energy capacity 96 GW (25% share), stated Care Ratings analysts.
Coal-based power, the dominant source of electricity in the country, has an installed capacity of 209 GW (55% share in total). 
Solar power generation capacity currently stands at 41 GW and wind power at 39 GW. Since 2016-17, capacity addition to solar power has been surpassing all other energy sources.
The report stated outstanding dues owed by Discoms to power generators as of April 30, 2021, amounted to INR 68,508 crore (US$ 9194 million). The absence of cost-reflective tariffs, high operational expenses, and AT&C losses, along with huge historical outstanding dues, has been pressuring the finances of state distribution utilities over time. 
The outstanding dues were the highest for the Discoms of Tamil Nadu at INR 13,717 crore (US$ 1841 million). The other states with notable outstanding dues are Rajasthan (INR 10,326 crore, or US$ 1386 million) and Maharashtra (INR 9,749 crore, or US$ 1308 million). These three states accounted for nearly 50% of the total outstanding dues.
