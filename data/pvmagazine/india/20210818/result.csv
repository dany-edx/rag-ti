The 380-hectare plant is located inside the Raghanesda Solar Park, developed by Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL). It is expected to generate close to 546 gigawatt-hours of electricity, helping to offset 387,056 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
Engie had won this project in an auction by Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL). The project benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement signed with GUVNL in August 2019. Gujarat Power Corporation Limited signed the Implementation Support Agreement in October 2019.
With this addition, Engie now has over 1.1 GWp of solar PV and 280 MW of wind power plants deployed in India across 17 projects. 
Engie implemented the project through its special-purpose vehicle Electro Solaire Private Limited (ESPL). French multinational investment bank Societe Generale, alongside the Asian Development Bank (ADB), funded the project with long-term debt. 
The plant utilizes PV modules from JinkoSolar and Longi Solar and string inverters from Huawei. Sterling & Wilson was the balance-of-plant contractor. It will also provide operation and maintenance support to the project for a period of five years.
“The project was completed in 14 months, adhering to the environment standard of ADB Safeguard Principle and Equator Principle, with 1.5 million+ safe man-hours by over 800 skilled and unskilled manpower setting up the plant,” read an Engie statement.
The Engie team was able to complete the project as scheduled despite the execution challenges posed by the Covid pandemic, a very high-water table at the site creating a challenging design and implementation issue for the module mounting structures, and the project being situated in a seismic zone.

Speaking about the project, Neerav Nanavaty, country manager, Engie India, said, “After overcoming several challenges at the site, the team is excited to announce the commissioning of this marquee project that is sure to boost the dynamic Indian solar industry and contribute towards decarbonizing India’s energy mix. We would like to thank all the public and private sector stakeholders and the local communities for their support and cooperation in helping us achieve this critical milestone in our renewable growth journey in India.”
Suresh Bhaskar, managing director Renewables – Middle East, Egypt & India, Engie Asia Middle East and Africa, said, “Engie is fully committed to play an active role to support India in achieving its ambitious clean energy goals for 2030. Successful commercial operation of this project is a testament to Engie’s continued interest to pursue renewable opportunities in India and further grow its renewable portfolio of more than 1 GW installed capacity in the country.”

The state-of-the-art EnergyIP Meter Data Management System installed and commissioned by Siemens enables timely and accurate collection of electricity meter data leading to increased visibility of the consumer network and reduction in carbon emissions. The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) program is one of Tata Power-DDL’s key strategic initiatives for grid modernization, read the Tata Power-DDL statement.
This implementation will help the consumers in real-time consumption monitoring and better energy usage management while also providing them outage and low Power Factor alerts. It will also enable faster outage management, it added.
Siemens’ technologies support Tata Power-DDL to achieve their ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) targets of energy efficiency, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved safety for employees and the public. Siemens is also working towards improving safety and reliability in operations for Tata Power-DDL’s critical energy assets.
Speaking about the collaboration, Ganesh Srinivasan, CEO, Tata Power-DDL said, “In partnership with Siemens, we have further strengthened the energy distribution network in our area of operation by leveraging the state-of-the-art technologies. The digital technologies have enabled us to monitor critical functions of energy distribution in real-time, resulting in higher operational efficiency and productivity, and have proven invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The technologies will further help in ensuring more efficient and uninterrupted power supply for our consumers.”
Robert HK Demann, Head, Smart Infrastructure, Siemens Limited said, “The implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is aligned to the Smart Meter National Programme and will play a key role in the deployment of Smart Grids across the country.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/18/cooling-pv-modules-with-plants-coir-pith/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 18, 2021","Cooling PV modules with plants, coir pith","From pv magazine International
An Indian-Malaysian group of scientists has conducted a review of several passive cooling techniques applied to PV modules and has found that two systems, based on coir pith and plants, provide the strongest improvement in terms of power yield.
Five techniques were tested by the researchers on a south-oriented, 50 W polycrystalline module with a tilt angle of 15 degrees located in Kumbakonam, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. They were: placing domestic plants around the panels at a distance of around 10cm; using a greenhouse net placed on top of the panels to prevent overexposure to sunlight; a combination of plants and the greenhouse net; placing water-soaked coir pith underneath the panels; and using phase change materials (PCMs).
The measurements were taken through an infrared thermometer from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and the performance of the five settings was compared with that of a reference panel without cooling assistance. “The overall uncertainty in the analysis is within 2%, based on the accuracy and precision of the instrument used,” the academics specified.
The panel without cooling showed an average voltage of 17.8 V and, with the cooling techniques, this value ranged from 18.1 V to 20.3 V. The highest value and, as a result, the best performance in terms of power yield, was provided by coir pith, which the academics attributed to its moisture-retaining property. The combination of plants and greenhouse net resulted in the second-best performance, at 20 V, followed by PCM cooling and plant cooling, which offered the third and fourth-best results, at 19.8 V and 19.3 V, respectively. The greenhouse net alone was able to generate 18.1 V, which is slightly higher than the module without cooling. “This can be attributed to the fact that the greenhouse maintained temperature and did not allow more sunlight to pass through it,” the research team explained.
The measurements also showed that the average power output of the module without cooling was 32.6 W and that the panes with cooling achieved values between 10.82 W and 36.38 W. This gap was explained by the academics as caused by current variations caused by the cooling systems. “For coir pith cooling, the average output power was 36.38 W,” they emphasized. “When the combination of greenhouse and plant cooling was employed, the average output power was 19.59 W.”
The strongest improvement for the module power yield – 11.34% – was achieved with coir cooling, while plant cooling, which uses air as the medium of coolant, delivered the second-best result with a 7.34% increase in power.  The maximum reduction in the module operational temperature – 14 degrees Celsius – was achieved by the combination of plants with a greenhouse net while the greenhouse net alone was able to reduce the temperature by 12 degrees Celsius. “The coir cooling technique provided maximum power improvement along with the optimum temperature reduction,” the scientists added. “Plant cooling techniques provided better temperature regulation along with considerable power enhancement, compared to the uncooled PV module.”
The review of the passive cooling techniques can be found in the paper Sustainable passive cooling strategy for PV module: A comparative analysis, published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. The research team is formed by scientists from the Sastra Deemed University in India and the Universiti Malaysia Pahang, in Malaysia. The latter published an extensive review on all passive and cooling techniques applied to photovoltaics in October. That study presented active techniques including air-based cooling, liquid-based cooling, forced water circulation, liquid immersion cooling, water spraying, and passive methods such as PCM cooling, heat pipes, heat sink or fins and heat exchangers, microchannel heat exchangers, radiative sky cooling, nano-fluid based cooling, thermoelectric cooling, evaporative cooling, and spectrum filter cooling.
