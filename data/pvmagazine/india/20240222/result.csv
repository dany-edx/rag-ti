It will develop the project through a special-purpose vehicle named Clean Max Bial Renewable Energy.
The power project will be set up in a solar-wind farm located in Jagaluru, Karnataka, owned and operated by CleanMax. It will consist of 36 MWp of solar power and 9.9 MW of wind power plants.
BIAL will source an estimated 90 million units of energy (kilowatt hours) per year from the captive renewable energy power plant. The project will ensure annual supply of approx. 58.3 million units of solar power and 31 million units of wind power, utilising the existing grid infrastructure.
“The initiative will enable yield of approximately 90 GWh of renewable energy annually with a CO2 reduction of 642 lacs kg [64,200 metric tonnes]. This is equivalent of planting approx. 11 lacs trees annually. The Jagaluru wind-solar farm in Karnataka has a total capacity of 290 MW and is a powerhouse for reducing carbon emissions, and is expected to cut down a whopping 54,88,000 tons of CO2 equivalent,” stated Clean Max Enviro Energy Solutions.

GameChange Solar, a Connecticut-based supplier of solar tracking solutions for ground-mounted PV plants, has announced plans to expand to 35 GW of annual US domestic manufacturing capacity for key components. This is an increase of 11 GW from its output in 2023.
GameChange Solar confirmed that US-produced content of its solar trackers will be 70% as a standard for its customers, with more than 85% available upon request.
Since 2012, the company has had a network of more than 30 manufacturing locations across 16 states, including Michigan, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky, where it produces torque tubes, posts, controllers, module mounting equipment such as purlins and SpeedClamps, bearings, stamped parts, and other tracker components.
Last year, GameChange launched the 1P-2Row Genius Tracker, which it said cuts costs and speeds installation by having one controller manage two rows. The 1P-2Row Genius Tracker comes standard with preassembled components including the elimination of all washers.
In 2022 the company announced the MaxDensity system, which is a fixed-tilt racking system for ground-mounted projects. It has a 5-degree or 10-degree east-west landscape configuration. The system is designed to maximize the number of modules packed onto a site, with a ground coverage ratio of up to 98%. The company said that it can be installed in blocks of up to 7 MW, in configurations of up to 12,000 modules.
The company said it has delivered more than 26 GW of solar tracker and fixed-tilt systems to date. For example, Catalyze, a national independent power producer, completed two solar projects in Lancaster, New York, that use GameChange trackers. The installations, one of which is a community solar project, sit on a decommissioned landfill site in Erie County, New York.

The world could install up to 574 GW of new PV capacity this year, according to a new global PV outlook report from BloombergNEF. It said that new solar installations hit 444 GW in 2023, significantly surpassing its previous forecast of around 413 GW.
The research firm said it also expects new global PV installations to reach 627 GW in 2025 and 672 GW in 2026, and then grow further to 718 GW in 2027 and 722 GW in 2028. For 2029 and 2030, it predicts annual PV growth of 820 GW and 880 GW, respectively.
These figures diverge substantially from those released by Wood Mackenzie in January. It predicted flat annual average growth over the next eight years, bucking the trend of rapid growth over the last decade.
“The challenge in making forecasts is that if you keep predicting growth at current rates, you end up forecasting the entire world being covered with solar panels,” Jenny Chase, a solar analyst at BloombergNEF, told pv magazine. “Our 2030 forecast is already over 6.7 TW, well above BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario and relatively comparable with global power generation capacity of 8.5 TW at the end of 2022.”
Chase said that Portugal and Greece could generate 50% more electricity from solar by 2030 than they did in 2022.
“At those levels, we will have negative feedback mechanisms, and those are what is really hard to predict,” she added. “Power will already be priced very low when the sun’s out, and storage isn’t free – so why would anyone build more solar, at least at historical rates of growth? That’s what BNEF’s regional analysts have to grapple with now that solar is not small anymore, and it’s no wonder that they can seem like cowards. Forecasting that the future will be dramatically unlike the past is always difficult.”
