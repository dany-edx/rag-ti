Netherlands-based Rads Global Business BV has developed a multifunctional anti-soiling nanocoating for solar glass that is also claimed to mitigate potential-induced degradation (PID), and to be anti-reflective and anti-corrosive.
“This coating can be used for dry cleaning by robots in large PV plants,” company CEO, Rajbeer Singh, told pv magazine. “It increases the efficiency of wet cleaning by reducing water consumption in the range of 50 to 70% due to the self-cleaning function of the coating,” he said, noting that soiling, scaling, corrosion, abrasion and glass reflection can reduce transmission of light through the module glass in real field conditions in a range of 5% to 20%.
According to him, the coating solution can increase the performance of a PV power project by between 5 and 15% and ensure a reduced cost of cleaning and fewer damages to PV modules due to corrosion and operation and maintenance. “Our coating can reduce the cost of cleaning by 60%,” he explained, adding that revenue increase for a PV project in deserts and the polluted site could be in the range of 8 to 18%.
The technology is patented in the Netherlands and the coating production is planned to be located in India, where a factory is currently under construction. “As the coating is applied to the tempered cut size solar glass, the coating line can be installed with any solar glass manufacturer as well as PV module manufacturer,” Singh said. “The coating is applied through a chemical combustion vapor deposition (CCVD) process and this process makes it highly durable.” According to him, the coating could be applied directly to the module in a panel factory or onto the solar glass in a glass factory.
The coating has already shown extremely good results in real field conditions, according to Singh. It was applied manually to a solar park in Delhi, India, and tested during 2016 and 2021. The test showed that it helped the modules produce approximately 8.9% more power than non-coated modules located at the site.
“This product can be applied to the existing PV fields, which means the existing projects can get extra revenue and reduced cost of operations and maintenance,” the CEO continues. “Since water for cleaning is a serious challenge for all the existing big PV projects in water scares regions, this coating can be a rescue for these projects”
 According to him, the cost of the coating through the coating line may represent between 2 and 3% of the total cost of a PV project.

The Nokh solar park is being developed through Rajasthan Solar Park Development Company Ltd at Village Nokh in the Jaisalmer District.  
The project is to be developed under the Open category, allowing the use of solar cells and modules of any origin. NTPC shall sign a power purchase agreement with the successful bidder for 25 years. It would sell the purchased electricity to the State utilities or any other beneficiaries through back-to-back power sale agreement and/or utilize for its thermal plants’ flexible operation.
Developers must submit bids quoting a fixed levellized tariff for the entire project duration of 25 years.
The project is to be developed in a single 190 MW block over a 362.31-hectare plot. The solar power developer will bear the entire cost of transmission from the project to the interconnection point, including the cost of line construction, losses, etc.
The commissioning period is ten months from the effective date of the PPA. Further, the project must achieve a minimum of 21% capacity utilization factor.

That is 38% lower than 11.4 GW installed during the corresponding period (April-November end) last fiscal, according to a new report by Care Ratings. 
Solar power accounted for 75% or 5.2 GW of the new capacity addition, taking India’s cumulative installed PV capacity to 37 GW as of November end. 
“The lower capacity addition [during FY 2020-21] can be attributed to the lockdown led disruptions in the supply chain (which slowed movement of inputs and has led to an increase in their prices), labor shortages as well as the constrained finances and liquidity pressures faced by the developers. Besides, the restriction on the imports of inputs, viz, for solar power, has aggravated the constraints faced by the developers,” said Care Ratings analysts in the report. 
Coal-based power, which is the nation’s dominant electricity source and accounts for 55% of the total power generation capacity, added just 1.9 GW to generation capacity in the eight months to November 2020. 
Of the cumulative 374 GW domestic electricity generation capacity, renewable energy generation capacity stands at 90 GW (24% of the total).
Discom dues
The report said outstanding dues owed by DISCOMs to power generators have been mounting. As of November 2020 end, these amounted to INR 1.31 lakh crore, a 28% increase from April 2020. 
The outstanding dues were the highest for the Discoms of Rajasthan (INR 40,229 crore), followed by Tamil Nadu (INR 21,825 crore) and Uttar Pradesh (INR 14,329 crore). These three states accounted for 58% of the total outstanding dues.

Chinese solar manufacturer JinkoSolar has achieved 23.1% conversion efficiency for an n-type monocrystalline solar PV module based on its TOPCon mono cell technology, for which a record efficiency of 24.9% was announced last week.
The result has been confirmed by Germany’s TÜV Rheinland and beats the company’s previous record of 22.39% set in January 2020.
“JinkoSolar accomplished this outstanding achievement thanks to its industry-leading vertical integration technology, which integrates the company’s N-type TOPCon high-efficiency cell technology and high-energy-density module design with advanced module welding and packaging technology to increase module optical gain and to reduce module internal resistance loss as well as to increase the proportion of cell area in the module,” the solar module manufacturer said in a statement.
In January 2020, Jinko said it was able to improve the panel performance by applying a new anti-reflection coating and advanced metallization technologies. New Tiling Ribbon (TR) technology was also incorporated into the cell design, which eliminates any inter-cell gap.
