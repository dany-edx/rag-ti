Solar developers Tata Power, TEQ Green Power and Vena Energy Renewables Urja had approached the tribunal seeking urgent listing to get an interim relief against the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission’s order allowing Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd to quash its 700 MW auction and retender the capacity.
Notably, the auction for the 700 MW project, part of a 1 GW planned at Dholera Solar Park in Gujarat, had seen the capacity awarded to ReNew Power (200 MW), TEQ Green (200 MW), Tata Power (100 MW), state-run SJVN Ltd (100 MW) and Vena Energy Renewables (100 MW) at prices up to INR 2.81/kWh. The Letter of Award for the respective capacities was issued to developers in October last year. 
However, as GUVNL discovered a lower rate of INR 1.99/kWh in another auction recently, it filed a petition with the State electricity regulator to seek retendering of the 700 MW capacity, citing that the tie-up at a higher tariff of INR 2.78-2.81/kWh for 25 years under the present bid may have substantial financial implication on the consumers at large. It also mentioned that the PPAs for 700 MW capacity out of 1000 MW are yet to be approved by the [regulatory] commission, to seek order in its favour.
The Commission passed the order in GUVNL’s favour citing the Electricity Act’s objectives that competitive procurement of electricity will ultimately benefit the consumers. It said GUVNL might approach the Commission for the adoption of tariff afresh after taking appropriate action regarding bidding.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/17/indianoil-selects-american-firm-dastur-for-indias-largest-industrial-carbon-capture-and-utilization-project/,"CLIMATE CHANGE,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIAN OIL CORPORATION (INDIANOIL),SUSTAINABILITY,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 17, 2021",IndianOil selects American firm Dastur for India’s largest industrial carbon capture and utilization project,"Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) has chosen US-based Dastur International as the leading partner to carry out the design and feasibility for industrial carbon capture and utilization project at its Koyali refinery with a capacity of 13.7 million tons per annum (mtpa). 
The project is said to be India’s largest CCUS project. Other partners in the project are US firm Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions (Air Liquide) and the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) at the University of Texas at Austin.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), industrial greenhouse gases (GHG) from steel, cement, fertilizer plants and refineries make up more than a quarter of all GHGs and are practical targets for implementing CCUS. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a major use of CO₂ to increase an oil field’s recovery from about 40% to 70% of original oil in place, while also storing the CO₂ permanently underground.
IOCL is India’s leading refiner, operating 11 of the country’s 23 refineries. The refinery at Koyali, near Vadodara, is its flagship refinery and can capture over 5000 tonnes per day (tpd) or more than 1.5 mtpa of CO₂ for large-scale EOR operations. 
The CO₂ captured from its hydrogen generation units will be primarily used for EOR at the Oil and Natural Gas Commission’s (ONGC) oilfield at Gandhar, Gujarat, near Koyali. 
The project will examine the technical viability, economic cost and feasibility of capturing CO₂; develop technical specifications, designs and plans; review and identify necessary approvals and permits required; and analyze the environmental benefits of the CCUS project. In addition to EOR and food and beverage applications, it will consider various alternative applications for the captured CO₂ to make the project technically and economically feasible.
According to S.S.V. Ramakumar, Director (R&D) and Board member of IOCL, this sustainability initiative from IOCL is probably the first-of-its-kind industrial-scale carbon capture project in a large refinery in India. IOCL hopes to capture over 250-500 thousand tons of CO₂ in a year initially and to use the CO₂ for cost-effectively enhancing oil production from ONGC’s oil fields. 
“In this ambitious and path-breaking project, we were pleased to receive global interest from many global firms. We are happy that Dastur Energy along with Air Liquide and the UT Austin, Bureau of Economic Geology will help us analyse and design not only a state-of-the-art commercial-scale capture system but also an economically viable model of carbon capture that can be a fore runner for CCUS in India,” he said.
The project is funded by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), as part of its mission to promote the development of sustainable infrastructure projects and fostering economic growth in partner countries like India. 
“This project is an ideal example of the groundbreaking work USTDA supports and makes possible,” said Todd Abrajano, Chief Operating Officer and Head of the Agency. “This innovative solution – the first of its kind in India – is showing how American technology can help reduce GHG emissions in refinery operations while enhancing the energy security of India through EOR.”
 Atanu Mukherjee, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dastur, said, “Close on the heels of our recent US Department of Energy win to implement industrial carbon capture at Arcelor Mittal Burns Harbor USA and a landmark project at a Middle East national oil major to implement carbon capture for the lowest cost EOR, I am delighted that Dastur will be able to apply its expertise along with Air Liquide and UT-BEG, to chart the path for the first CCUS project in India of this magnitude. Industrial-scale carbon capture and utilization through EOR can be an economically attractive model for India in reducing carbon emissions, enhancing energy security and contributing to the vision of an Atma Nirbhar Bharat.”
 Dastur will draw upon its Austin-based affiliate Dastur Energy’s intellectual property and capabilities in the areas of energy engineering, carbon capture, EOR, energy supply chains, energy economics, and low-carbon fuels for conceiving and designing this project.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/17/quantum-dot-solar-cells-and-the-search-for-stability/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 17, 2021",Quantum dot solar cells and the search for stability,"From pv magazine International
Almost exactly one year ago, scientists at Australia’s University of Queensland demonstrated a quantum dot solar cell at 16.6% efficiency, an achievement that the director of the university’s nanomaterials center called “effectively the difference between quantum dot solar cell technology being an exciting ‘prospect’ and being commercially viable.”
This efficiency achievement, and the opening of realistic pathways to push beyond 20%, has led scientists to begin thinking about how this technology might look outside of a laboratory setting. Research into quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) has expanded its focus to take in the many other factors that would affect the material’s performance in a commercial setting. Most QDSC materials that scientists work with could lend themselves quite easily to low-cost, high-volume production techniques. And the ability to easily tune materials to different bandgaps offers further opportunities in device design. Long-term stability, however, still poses challenges.
Quantum dot materials often oxidize and lose performance when exposed to ambient air, and are also variously sensitive to raised temperatures, moisture and other conditions they would be sure to face installed in an outdoor setting. Unwanted reactions with other cell layers and materials can also pose a problem for QDSC device designers.
A new paper from scientists at TU Dresden in Germany; Stability of Quantum Dot Solar Cells: A Matter of (Life)Time, published in Advanced Energy Materials, examines the stability issues and degradation mechanisms holding back three common classes of QD material.
The paper outlines degradation effects observed in earlier experiments for quantum dot materials based on lead chalcogenides and lead-halide perovskites, as well as lead-free quantum dots. For each material, they outline the major known stability issues, as well as the recent progress and potential solutions to them.
While each of the materials has its own intricacies, the group was able to draw broad conclusions about the stability issues affecting QDSCs. “All three share plenty commonalities in their fundamental causes for degradation. Ambient factors such as oxygen and water, but also increased temperatures or high intensities of illumination can decrease the lifetime of QDSCs,” they explain. “Beyond these external factors, both the intrinsic properties of QDs and their interplay with other materials present in the photovoltaic devices can also serve as causes of degradation.”
The group’s key finding is that stability testing in QDSC’s has so far seen piecemeal development, with focus on different factors. “Unfortunately, the lack of a standardized method to assess stability of QDSCs limits the applicability of the results across the field,” the group explains. “To address this issue, we propose two simple stability tests (stress‐free and realistic) which we believe can increase the comparability, reliability, and reproducibility of results and encourage the scientific community to adopt them.”
Looking to the development of such standards in perovskite solar cells, which are somewhat further along the path to commercialization, the group encourages other QDSC researchers to adopt two standard sets of testing protocols: “stress-free” – where the device’s best efficiency is measured with an encapsulant, under an inert atmosphere at room temperature, and at open circuit bias with illumination only for the length of time needed for a current-voltage sweep.
A second set of tests is then recommended to evaluate the device under more “realistic” conditions. This would expose devices without encapsulant to a controlled humidity environment and temperatures up to 85 degrees Celsius, at maximum power point under continuous ‘one sun’ illumination.
“We hope future research focuses on a more profound analysis of the degradation mechanisms in QDSCs….,” the scientists conclude. “Such a detailed investigation—in combination with accurate characterization of the J–V characteristics evolution—would inevitably enhance the understanding of degradation mechanisms of QDSCs, and expedite the development of mitigation strategies.”
