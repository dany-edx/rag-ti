The company won the latest contracts again from NTPC, for its 250 MW solar project in Ananthapuram, Andhra Pradesh, and a 5 MW plant in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Jakson won the comprehensive maintenance and operation contracts by quoting the lowest rates in an auction conducted by NTPC following the tender launch in February. The contract period starts from June 1for the 250 MW Ananthapuram plant and from Dec. 1 for the 5 MW Andaman plant. Its scope of work includes regular site monitoring for all kinds of maintenance work, with various plant components and equipment, warranty claims, spare parts inventories, and various other onsite ground services to ensure smooth and optimal power generation. 
The 250 MW Ananthapuram solar project is situated at NP Kunta Solar Park in the Satyasai district and spans around 1,298 acres. It was commissioned in May 2016. The project is built on one of the most challenging terrains of Ananthapur. The terrain is highly uneven, with natural streams, dense vegetation, and hills that were untouched during the development of the solar plants to maintain the natural ecosystem.
The 5 MW plant is spread across 25 acres at Garacharma in Port Blair. It was commissioned in April 2013.
Jakson’s O&M business has a strong presence in more than 16 states, with an 100% average performance rating in more than 75 operational sites. Its overall O&M portfolio has grown to 1.6 GW in 2022, from 60 MW in 2014.

The plant generates green hydrogen via alkaline electrolysis technology. It is “pure green” in that it is fully independent of the grid. 
The plant is co-located with a solar project in the state’s Ujjain district. 
“An existing solar plant of Vivaan Solar was disconnected by Hygenco from the grid and fully reconfigured for the green hydrogen plant. In this process, swathing changes were made in the solar plant using technologies not yet prevalent in India,” Hygenco CEO Amit Bansal told pv magazine. “Hygenco executed the project as the sole builder (EPC), owner (investor), and operator of the plant. No EPCs were involved in this case, reflecting Hygenco’s technical capability.”
The plant commenced trial operations on March 31 and was fully commissioned by April 15.  
“This pilot plant will be part of our R&D Center of Excellence in hydrogen technologies,” said Bansal. “We hope to provide clean and affordable hydrogen for end-use industries and facilitate their journey to decarbonize operations.”
Hygenco’s green hydrogen pilot plant is controlled by an advanced energy management and control system (EMCS). The EMCS monitors parameters such as solar PV generation, state of charge, hydrogen generation, pressure, temperature, and purities from the electrolyzer and makes autonomous decisions in real time to achieve high efficiencies. The technology enables Hygenco to augment the hydrogen yield and deliver cost-competitive hydrogen to the end clients.
Hygenco, based in the Indian state of Haryana, aims to become a global leader in deploying green hydrogen and green ammonia-powered industry solutions. It designs, engineers, optimizes, and commissions end-to-end green hydrogen and green ammonia assets on a build-own-operate and build-own-operate-transfer basis.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/12/world-bank-spells-out-how-pakistan-can-hit-13-gw-of-clean-power/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MAY 12, 2022",World Bank spells out how Pakistan can hit 13 GW of clean power,"From pv magazine Global
A new report published by the World Bank has stated that Pakistan must introduce the renewable energy auctions approved by its energy regulator in 2017 without any further delay if it is to achieve its clean energy ambitions.
The nation’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) approved a switch from paying fixed tariffs for clean electricity five years ago, but a proposed auction system has yet to take shape.
With Pakistan having 1.7 GW of solar and wind generation capacity in September 2021, and aiming to raise that figure to 12.9 GW this decade, the need for urgency is clear and the World Bank report suggests how Islamabad could kick-start the process.
Some 482 MW of solar projects have been granted a tariff but are yet to be constructed. A proportion of a further 72 projects with 4.34 GW of capacity, which have secured approval but not a fixed payment, can be expected to secure auction-determined rewards as bidders under an interim system before a complete switch to an auction regime suggested by the report’s authors.
That would then see Pakistan award 1 GW per year of solar via annual auctions from 2024 to 2030, en route to achieving 20% of the nation’s electricity from non-hydro renewables by 2025, and 30% this decade, as part of overall clean energy targets of 50% and 60% which would include hydropower facilities.
The World Bank suggests a twin-track approach which would see big renewable energy parks identified chiefly in the wind-rich provinces of Balochistan and Sindh plus smaller project capacities auctioned within reach of electricity substations with spare capacity. The clean energy park auctions would be solar or wind specific to ensure a mix of facilities to maximize generation and transmission while the substation tenders would be technology neutral but could be expected to heavily favor solar plants.
The report suggests government entity the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) be responsible for overseeing the clean energy park tenders with provincial electricity distribution companies fulfilling the role for substation capacity procurement, with a federal body to take charge of renewables auctions further down the line.
The generation capacity tendered should be in blocks of at least 50 MW, the report’s authors suggested, with 300 MW to 600 MW slices in the large parks and tariffs should be set no later than 33 weeks after each auction process begins. The auctions should each feature a maximum bid price, set with reference to previous exercises, and the resulting power purchase agreements (PPAs) should last 20 to 25 years, according to the study.
The report’s authors state that, in contrast to a recommendation made in the government’s 2019 Alternative Renewable Energy policy: “We do not recommend stringent local content requirements.”
Local industry
With Pakistan unlikely to develop a local solar industry beyond module assembly from imported components, the report suggests high technical standards be set for the auction bidders, to avoid the dumping of cheap, low-grade overseas products.
The shift to an auction system is complicated by the fact the government has approved changes to its national energy market which should have come into force in April this year but have not taken place. The new regime would see national body the Central Power Purchasing Agency replaced as offtaker for clean electricity by provincial distribution companies, who would also take over management of the auctions from the AEDB.
For an interim period, during which the 4.34 GW of approved solar projects without a tariff can participate in auctions, the PPA on offer will last 25 years and the bid cap has been set at PKR 6/kWh ($0.032), with payments rising by a maximum of 2.5% annually during the contract period.

German battery producer Varta is launching a new residential battery at the Smarter E Europe event, in Munich, Germany.
The Varta.wall product features a die-cast aluminum housing and requires an installation depth of only 10 centimeters. It is described by the manufacturer as one of the most space-saving storage systems on the market.
The high-voltage battery was developed in Germany and is manufactured at an unspecified location in Europe. It is available with a capacity of between 10 kWh and 20 kWh and its output ranges from 5.24 kW and 10.4 kW depending on the PV inverter used. Up to five systems can be connected together.
The storage system is capable of emergency power, with a special boost function leading to increased security of supply in emergency power operation. This increases the discharge rate (C rate), which is 0.5 in continuous operation, to 0.75 for a short time. As a result, the storage system can absorb peak loads, such as those that occur when electronic devices are started.
According to Varta, the installation of the storage systems is flexible and simple. This starts with the PV inverter compatibility, continues with the modularity and also includes the innovative solar module design and connector system.
“As a result, the storage can be installed in less than 30 minutes,” explains Dominik Gluba, Head of Operations Energy Storage Systems.
Varta.wall is compatible with various inverter brands, including SMA and Kostal. Further compatibilities are being prepared. The plug-in system ensures that no wiring of the system components is necessary.
