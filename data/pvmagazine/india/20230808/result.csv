Tata Power will develop these projects at Shirawta, Pune (1.8 GW) and Bhivpuri, Raigad (1 GW) districts with an estimated investment of INR 13,000 crore ($1.57 billion). 
Tata Power stated the projects will leverage the kinetic energy of water to create a stable and reliable power supply. During times of excess energy, water will be pumped from a lower reservoir to a higher reservoir, and during peak demand, the stored water will power turbines, thereby generating electricity. This initiative will significantly enhance energy security by providing peaking and continuous power supply along with other renewables such as solar and wind.

This information was shared by power minister R.K. Singh recently.
The minister said green hydrogen projects will be implemented largely through private investments at suitable locations based on land and water resources availability.
India targets a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT per annum by 2030 under its National Green Hydrogen Mission. The Mission has been allocated INR 19,744 crore initially, including INR 17,490 crore for the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program, INR 1,466 crore for pilot projects and hydrogen hubs, INR 400 crore for R&D, and INR 388 crore for other components. 
The costs of the electrolyzers and input renewable energy are the two major determinants of green hydrogen production cost. The costs of capital, supply and treatment of water, storage and distribution, conversion of hydrogen into suitable derivatives, and enabling infrastructure would also contribute to the final delivered cost of green hydrogen for any particular application. 
The Green Hydrogen Mission seeks to undertake the necessary steps to enable cost reduction in these aspects.
India consumes about 5 MMT of grey hydrogen annually, almost entirely in petroleum refining and manufacturing of ammonia for fertilizers. In fertilizer production, hydrogen is a crucial input for producing ammonia (NH3), which is used to produce urea and other fertilizers. In petroleum refining, hydrogen is mainly used for reducing the sulfur content of fuels (desulphurization) and converting heavier feedstocks into more valuable products.

Using heat pumps to preheat industrial hydrogen (H2) systems could reduce the need for H₂ by more than 20% and lower the cost of process heat for heavy industry by more than 10%, according to new research from the United Kingdom.
The group of researchers, led by the University of Leeds, claims that utilizing heat pumps to preheat hydrogen to very high temperatures could reduce European industry demands by approximately 200 TWh per year, with a reduction of 40 TWh per year in the UK alone.
In the study “Reducing industrial hydrogen demand through preheating with very high-temperature heat pumps,” published in Applied Energy, the scientists said their findings stem from recent developments in the field of thermo-mechanical energy storage, which enable heat pumps to operate at very high temperatures.
“Heat pumps have typically been considered for low-temperature applications in buildings, district heating, and industry, with maximum temperatures of up to around 75–100 C,” the study notes,  adding that combining heat pumps with thermal energy storage has enabled scientists to reach an operating temperature of 500 C with argon as the working fluid.
The researchers said that, while heat pumps are for now far from reaching the extreme temperature required for many industrial heat processes, such as blast furnaces, they can be harvested to preheat combustion air or hydrogen. The article assessed the performance of preheating to temperatures of 300–500 C, and found better cost savings in the higher point.
“For a given combination of electrolyzer capex and electricity price, the relationship between relative cost saving and temperature is found to be linear over the 300 C to 500 C temperature range,” they said. “Adding a reverse Joule-Brayton heat pump to a green hydrogen-based heating system provides cost savings when electricity prices exceed around GBP5 ($6.35)/ MWh. At electricity prices above GBP30/MWh and electrolyzer costs above GBP400/kW, cost savings exceed 5% when preheating to 300 C and 8% when preheating to 500 C.”
Heat pumps based on the reverse Joule–Brayton cycle are commonly utilized for small-scale applications. They usually draw ambient air into a compressor and then convey the hot compressed air into a heat exchanger where it is cooled, thereby delivering heat to a radiator circulating water or a hot water system. Finally, it expands the air through a reciprocating expander to atmospheric pressure and pushes it out to the atmosphere.
The scientists explained that the cost-saving ensured by this heat pump system is possible partly by the fact that heat pumps absorb heat from the environment and therefore reduce electricity demands. In the proposed system configuration, the group assumed that the heat pump transfers heat from a water source such as mine water to an industrial plant. More cost saving is related to the use of less fuel, hydrogen in this case, that is made possible by its preheating.
“Heat pumps appear to be a lower cost preheating option than electric boilers at electricity prices above around GBP25/MWh, with levelized cost savings on the electric boiler option reaching approximately 4% at electricity prices above GBP130/MWh,” the academics explained. “However whether the savings from using heat pumps outweigh their added complexity requires further investigation and should be considered on an application-specific basis.”
They said their work might help decarbonize the world’s economy, as process heat that can utilize heat pumps accounts for around 11% of global energy demand.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/08/australias-latest-tender-for-generation-storage-largely-oversubscribed/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2023","Australia’s latest tender for generation, storage largely oversubscribed","From pv magazine Australia
AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as the New South Wales (NSW) Consumer Trustee in Australia, has announced the number of bidders participating in its third tender to secure renewable projects. It aims to transform its coal-reliant energy system have significantly exceeded indicative targets for both generation and long-duration storage.
The tender was targeting 950 MW of generation and 550 MW of long-duration (at least eight hours) storage, but AEMO Services said it received offers totalling 3.1 GW of new generation capacity and 1.6 GW of long-duration storage.
AEMO Services Chair Paul Moy said the result reflects the scale of investor interest in the NSW energy transition and demonstrates the appeal of the long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) that the state government is offering as it seeks to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
Successful projects will be awarded LTESAs that provide a floor price for output, which Moy said allows for greater investment certainty for developers.
“The strong support is further evidence that the long-term energy service agreements provided through our tender process addresses a key market risk that might otherwise delay or discourage investors from participating in the transition,” he said. “Combined, the bids for generation represent a total capacity of 3.1 GW, against an indicative target of 950 MW for this tender, and bids for long-duration storage represent a total capacity of 1.6 GW, against a target of up to 550 MW.”
Moy said more than half of the projects in the current tender round were submitted in the first tender round, the results of which were announced in May.
“We designed our processes to minimise time and effort for repeat bidders, allowing participants to sharpen their pencils and return with an improved proposition,” he said. “At the same time, it’s a positive sign that a number of new entrants have engaged with the process, demonstrating confidence in our systems and product and an evolving pipeline of projects.”
This tender round is the second for generation and long-duration storage and the third in a rolling schedule that will continue over the next 10 years. The state is also seeking offers for a minimum of 380 MW of shorter duration firming capacity (at least two hours of storage) as it rolls out its energy transition strategy.
The roadmap sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by 2030 to replace aging coal-fired power stations. All of the remaining coal-fired power stations in New South Wales are set to close by 2040 at the latest, with Origin’s 2,880 MW Eraring power station in the Hunter region the next to go with its close scheduled for August 2025.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said the competing bids in this tender round will now undergo an assessment.
“If we aren’t satisfied that there are enough competing projects we can alter our plan accordingly and tender for a higher volume in future rounds,” he said. “Likewise, if we do see sufficient value we can increase the amount of energy supported. In our first tender, this approach produced a line-up of successful projects willing to build the necessary energy generating infrastructure, while putting much less consumer money at risk than traditional CFD’s (contracts for difference) by contracting LTESA strike prices 40% below the levelized cost of energy.”
Successful proponents from the tender round are expected to be announced by the end of this year.

Enel Green Power has developed a new robot for automated solar panel cleaning without the use of water, in partnership with Sicily-based startup Reiwa.
The robot can move on the panel rows independently and does not require human assistance. It is also able to recharge itself via solar panels and return to its docking station at the end of the journey.
The SandStorm system is equipped with a system of brushes that act as the cleaning force.
“The approach normally adopted involves cleaning the surfaces with pressure washers or tractors equipped with hydraulic brushes; both cases entail water consumption and gas emissions from the motor vehicles used,” Enel Green Power said. “Sturdy and versatile, SandStorm adapts – when necessary – even to the non-homogeneous alignment of the trackers of the panels, managing to move independently from one row of panels to the adjacent one.”
Enel Green Power has already tested the system at its Innovation LabEGP research center of Passo Martino, near Catania, and then on an industrial scale in a 1 MW section of a PV plant it operates in Totana, Spain.
“Today EGP is scaling up the application of this technology with an initial contract for the implementation of around 150 robots in two Spanish PV plants, Totana and Las Corchas, for a total capacity of 135 MW,” the company said.
