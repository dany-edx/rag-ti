French renewable energy developer Valorem has unveiled a completely autonomous cold room that is powered 100% by photovoltaic energy.
The Cryosolar solution consists of a 20-foot or 40-foot container equipped with a plug-and-play PV system installed on the roof. It has 180 mm thick insulation and 10 to 35 cubic metres of storage with shelves.
The mobile cold room is indicated as ideal for storage solutions in times of crisis such as natural disasters or health crises, especially in isolated areas for the conservation of sensitive products such as agro-food, medical products, and vaccines.
“Beyond its environmental advantage, Cryosolar allows the revitalization of territories, while encouraging the local economy and the economic development of rural areas”, Valorem stated.
In Senegal, two Cryosolar rooms were deployed on fishing docks this year in partnership with the Senegalese Ministry of Fisheries and the National Agency for Renewable Energies. In Guadeloupe, thanks to funding from the French overseas region and from Ademe, the French environment and energy management agency, a cold room was installed on the island of Désirade for the preservation of fish and seafood.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/21/covid-impact-solar-imports-dipped-75-in-the-april-january-period/,"COVID-19,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PROCUREMENT,CHINA,INDIA,MALAYSIA,MYANMAR,THAILAND,VIETNAM",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 21, 2021",Covid impact: Solar imports dipped 75% in ten months,"India’s solar imports were badly hit by last year’s Covid-19 crisis. The value of imported solar cells and modules—INR2916 crore—from last April to January, was around 75% lower than the figure recorded for all of the previous fiscal year.
That was also down to the impact of an extension to safeguarding duties applied on products from China, Vietnam and Thailand.
China, the largest source of solar imports, saw the value of goods shipped to India from April to January fall 73%, compared with the figure for fiscal year 2019-20, from INR9239 crore to INR2488 crore. The impact was even more profound on goods from Thailand and Vietnam which, with respective values of INR115 crore and INR95 crore, saw falls of 86% and 90%, albeit managing to remain the second and third largest sources of imports.
Solar imports from troubled Myanmar, however, soared 403%, to INR35 crore, during the first ten months of the last fiscal year, from the whole-year 2019-20 figure. Malaysia, which has been exempted from safeguarding duty, appeared to be on course to maintain its pre-Covid shipment levels, with modules worth INR28 crore exported during April-to-January. 
The exporters of Chad (INR179 lakh), France and the U.K. (INR45 lakh each), and Russia (INR17 lakh) also increased their share of the Indian solar cell and module market, although the combined import value of goods from those countries formed a small proportion of the overall April-to-January solar import figure.

The installations will be set up on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis on the land identified and arranged by the developers.
Developers can compete for 250 MW up to all of 1 GW capacity on offer, in 10 MW multiples.
NTPC shall purchase the solar power from these plants at an initial tariff of INR 1.91/kWh for the first contract year, which shall be escalated at 01 paisa/kWh per year for the duration till the 25th year.
The power purchased shall be utilized by NTPC to meet its scheduled generation from Solapur and Kudgi thermal power stations under the scheme of “Flexibility in Generation and Scheduling of Thermal Power Stations to reduce emissions” issued by the Ministry of Power.
NTPC shall take over the special-purpose vehicle (a company specially incorporated/acquired as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the successful bidder for the execution of this project) after the completion of five years from the commercial operation date. 
The selection of solar power developers shall be made based on the lowest quoted ‘special-purpose vehicle handover cost’ through competitive bidding. 
“The solar projects already under construction or yet to be commissioned or commissioned but selling solar power on short-term merchant basis may also be considered for the selection, provided these projects have not been accepted under any State or Central Scheme and also do not have obligation to sell the power to any beneficiaries. A partial capacity (minimum 250 MW) of solar power plants for which PPA has not been signed can also be offered by the bidder,” as per the tender document.
