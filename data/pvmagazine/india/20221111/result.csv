The SolarX Grand Challenge aims to catalyze and accelerate solar adoption by motivating innovators and researchers to add value and much-needed innovation and disruption in the solar sector.
Under SolarX competition, 20 start-ups and innovators from countries across Africa will be selected, and a $300,000 cash grant will be awarded to the winners. The winning entrepreneurs will undergo an acceleration program, be mentored and connected with investors, and be provided access to the African markets.
“The SolarX Grand Challenge is part of our two-pronged strategy to ease solar deployment in Africa. Under this strategy, we are creating a Solar Facility to enable investments to flow into African countries. Along with investments, a local pipeline of projects will simultaneously be needed,” said Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of International Solar Alliance.
“Through the SolarX Grand Challenge’s competitive process, we seek to create a group of entrepreneurs who will create locally relevant business models and a pipeline of projects. With innovation, commitment, and the investments flowing in, we expect this strategy to create demand and supply, which will change the energy dynamics globally.”
The first edition of SolarX will focus on the African region to attract investments in the solar energy sector, reduce the gap between energy demand and supply, and promote a robust start-up ecosystem in Africa.
“With an estimated potential of 7,900 GW of solar in Africa, and only four African nations having a start-up ecosystem, there is a yawning gap between what is needed and what is available. African start-ups attracted less than 1% of global venture investments. With SolarX, we aim to change this scenario,” Dr Mathur added.
Africa, being at the heart of the Tropic of Cancer, has annual average solar irradiation of 2,119 kWh/m2 and holds the potential of thinning the energy gap with yearlong access to sunlight.
ISA has partnered with Invest India, the National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency of India, under the Department for Promotion of Industries and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, for the SolarX Grand Challenge.
ISA has also partnered with the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA) for the challenge. WAIPA facilitates the exchange of best practices in attracting foreign investment and advises Investment Promotion Agencies on formulating investment policies.
The SolarX Challenge will shortlist entries by April 2023 and declare winners by June 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/11/addressing-challenging-terrains-optimizing-production/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022",Addressing challenging terrains; optimizing production,"India aims to achieve 450 GW of renewable energy capacities by 2030, of which about 280 GW is expected to be solar energy. The country has huge potential for solar power due to its geographical location and terrain.
While solar energy continues to gain currency the world over, a key hurdle is the availability of contiguous land receiving high irradiance suitable for solar PV plants. Solar plants need large chunks of contiguous lands that receive high irradiance.
Utility-scale solar PV plants are usually built on flat and open spaces, but as demand for solar energy rises, projects are developed in areas where topography presents multiple challenges. Such uneven terrains can reduce the usable land area and cause shading on solar panels, resulting in low energy yield.
The land available for solar power construction is often a wasteland that inherently has design and construction-related restrictions and challenges. In the early stages of designing a solar project site, several phases such as site feasibility and offtake strategies are critical for delivering a successful project.
Site layout can influence the areas of design and budget and can often be infeasible or dangerous for equipment and laborers. Hence, there is an urgent need for solutions that manoeuvre terrain flexibility and enable EPC companies, developers, and operators to maximize production in challenging locations.
Certain markets, such as Florida in the United States, have naturally leveled land, which makes the installation of solar PV plants easier.
However, flat terrain isn’t always an option. Solar PV plant sites in hilly regions need to undergo civil engineering to make the ground leveled for mounting. Undulating topography and grading land can alter rain run-off patterns on the site and displace native species. This often leads to installation delays and swelling project costs.
Some key terrain-related challenges during the construction of solar PV plants are land accessibility, low water table, land undulation, the load-bearing capacity of the soil, the mineral content of the soil, and its impact on below-ground corrosion.
Topography is of great significance for designing of solar power plants. A solar PV site’s topography is capable of affecting project economics and deciding whether a project will be profitable. To illustrate, if the soil is not suitable for making a concrete foundation or if there is uneven terrain that requires grading, it can either cause project overruns or increase the project cost. Often in such cases, if there is an area of land that cannot be used at all, the plant ends up with a smaller capacity.
Topography is also crucial for estimating solar yield as shadow can impact the final result. Manufacturers often provide intelligent tracking algorithms to decrease this impact. For the above reason, during the site survey, it is crucial to check whether the terrain is feasible and suitable for the installation and placement of solar panels.
Based on decades of engineering experience in the solar industry, companies are developing new tools for solar power plant design on terrains with complex topography. Software are being developed with the ability to accurately calculate the groundwork associated with each possible implementation within the plot.
The 3D backtracking algorithm allows the positioning of trackers at an optimal angle to maximize electricity production. This tool also analyses different combinations of panels, trackers or tables, inverters, and storage systems.
Another such solar energy player has come up with a PV plant design software for conceptual and detailed design and analysis for solar PV plants. These tools empower EPC companies and designers to work within unconventional site boundaries, further promoting flexibility in the face of challenging site conditions.
The software combines thoroughly validated PV simulation algorithms with a user-friendly modern interface. It is an efficient and traceable method for reliable modeling in complex terrain and for accurate energy calculations and allows quick configuration of PV plant designs and simulation of PV layouts. The tool saves time in taking a plant to design by using an automated layout for fixed-tilt mounting systems and trackers.
Companies also use ground-mounted racks and install clusters of landscape panels fitted differently to the ground and placed close to each other. Arrays are installed on slight, steady grades with posts deeper into the ground, following the contour of the land.
A 290 MWp solar power plant in Gujarat, recently installed by Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy Ltd (SWRE), is a good example of how various terrain-related challenges can be successfully mitigated.
As the uninhabitable land for plant construction had naturally occurring challenges, the state government was keen to convert this into industrially usable land for setting up gigawatt-scale solar power plants. The area receives a high level of solar irradiance and has huge swathes of contiguous and barren land.
SWRE adopted a different and radical approach to overcome the challenges at the project site. As the land fell under seismic zone IV, the pile depth was increased to various depths and diameters. Further, the local soil had lower SBC, and the ground condition had a liquefaction factor, which would have resulted in limiting the building foundation. Hence, for the building design to sustain these challenges, the MCR building foundation was supported with a higher diameter and deeper length pile foundation with pile caps.
Further, the plant was almost at sea level, adjacent to the local pond area with saucer-shaped pockets. Heavy rains and all the other challenges led to water stagnation and marshy soil conditions, causing hurdles in accessing the land.
To overcome these challenges, elevated roads with culverts were constructed and land ploughing was done for quick percolation and evaporation of stagnated water. In addition, waterproof insulation-type cables were used for underground usage and high-pressure pumps were installed to remove water from stagnated areas.
In another such example, SWRE successfully commissioned a 300 MWp solar power plant in Karnataka, even as the land was situated on hilly and rocky terrain. Small rivers passing through the project site caused disjointed and uncertain land parcels. The large-sized boulders obstructing plant construction were blasted and transported outside the plant.
Undulated lands were filled and compacted, and an array layout was designed. As the land was previously used for mining and had large, excavated pockets, it was first leveled up using normal soil and compaction.
With the river and nullahs passing through the land, a culvert and bridge were specially constructed for the movement of material, machines, and manpower.
The scattered and disjointed land parcels severely impacted the array layout and affected the inverter sizing and design process. This ultimately impacted material and cable quantities, resulting in a high-cost impact.
The array layout was customized to minimize land wastage and table sizes. Moreover, as the plant boundary fencing was porous due to land issues leading to the theft of critical material, the SWRE team ensured intensified night patrolling with additional security and drone surveillance.
As countries around the world look on, India is leveraging the opportunity to tap energy resources and bring in the latest technology to navigate complex geometry for the future of solar energy. The top Indian companies engaged in solar energy are fast exploring the need to use inclined terrains for siting PV power plants close to urban areas to reduce power transmission losses and avoid the high cost of transmission line infrastructures.
SWRE is a global pure-play, end-to-end renewable engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) solutions provider with a total portfolio of 12.6 GWp (including projects commissioned and under various stages of construction). It also manages an operation and maintenance (O&M) portfolio of around 7 GWp solar power projects.

KU Leuven researchers in Belgium have created a hydrogen panel that directly converts water vapor from the air into hydrogen gas, with the help of sunlight. They claim it produces 250 liters of hydrogen per day, at an efficiency of 15%. They are developing it under the Solhyd project, which is now in a transition phase from research to spinoff.
In a nutshell, hydrogen panels are modules that use solar energy to split water molecules and produce hydrogen gas. This means only the most arid places on Earth are too dry for hydrogen panels to work efficiently. They are akin to classical solar modules, but instead of an electric cable, they are connected via gas tubes.
Specifically, electricity is produced by the top layer solar panel, with a system of tubes underneath, where the hydrogen is produced from water molecules extracted directly from the air using a membrane.
“Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with most commercial modern PV modules, which are directly plugged into our system. This way, we can benefit from the ongoing developments and cost reductions in the PV industry,” KU Leuven researcher Jan Rongé told pv magazine. “To further enhance this synergy, Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with common PV mounting structures.”
The researchers described the hydrogen panel as small-scale, modular, and ideal for decentralized production. They estimated that 20 of the panels could supply electricity and heat for a well-insulated house with a heat pump all winter long. When installed alongside a solar thermal collector and traditional solar panels, hydrogen panels could help heat homes and provide electricity throughout the year.
“The hydrogen panels themselves do not store hydrogen and work at very low pressure. This has several safety and cost benefits. The hydrogen is collected centrally from the hydrogen panel plant, and then compressed, if needed,” Rongé said. “Hydrogen can be stored indefinitely in compressed form. Of course, certain applications do not require compression, or will use other means of storage.”
Hydrogen produced by Solhyd panels can be used in a wide range of applications, including mobility.
“In the shorter term, we are mostly targeting mid-sized applications, such as backup power, logistics, heavy transport, but also providing energy in the Global South,” said Rongé. “Later, you could think of anything from large scale ammonia production down to small-scale off-grid systems.”
The researchers said they foresee a similar system-price cost curve like the one seen in PV, and noted that they use non-precious materials to keep the hydrogen panels affordable. They have tested several prototypes since the project launch in 2011 and are ready to launch industrial production of hydrogen panels.
In September, the Solhyd project moved from the university labs to a new 350 square-meter production space close to the Belgian town of Leuven, where pilot production lines were established with the help of Flemish government funding. Initially, the team will produce a few dozen hydrogen panels for small-scale pilot projects. But by 2026, the team expects to scale up production to 5,000 panels a year.
“At this moment we expect that the product will be commercially available from 2026 onwards,” Rongé said. “When we achieve mass production, the price will be close to that of PV modules today.”
