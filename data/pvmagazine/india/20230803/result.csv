Through this cooperation, the ISA and ACI aim to make airports greener to help reduce airport emissions, improve air quality, and make them more sustainable.
ISA and ACI will work together to develop joint projects that promote solar at airports and make them more viable. ISA, with its international expertise, will support policy choices that accelerate solar development. ACI will bring in best practices for adoption by airports across the globe.
To strengthen the partnership, the signatories will explore collaborating with various partners, including the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), on developing solar projects for airports.
Director General of ISA, Dr Ajay Mathur, said, “Our focus will be two-pronged: engage with ISA member countries to support establishing robust national and regional policies and frameworks. In addition, explore a joint publication of a guidance document of best practices for airport solarisation. We foresee this document as a comprehensive resource, sharing valuable insights and recommendations for the successful implementation of solar projects.”
Director General of ACI World, Luis Felipe de Oliveira, said, “The memorandum of cooperation with ISA will help ACI members improve and reduce their carbon footprint as well as dependency on fossil fuels. Airports are ideal locations for solar infrastructures due to their large, flat, and unobstructed surfaces, and this partnership will be key to supporting them in their energy transformation.”
“Additional assistance will be provided to Small Island Developing States and other developing countries so that they are able to leverage the rights tools and solutions for setting up effective solar projects. This collaboration is one more step forward in achieving our long-term carbon goal by 2050.” 
The collaboration between the signatories encompasses a range of activities. Firstly, there is an emphasis on exchanging and sharing available and relevant information, including success stories, learnings, and outcomes from existing projects. This knowledge-sharing will serve as a valuable resource for all parties involved. Additionally, the signatories are committed to exchanging information on the aggregate demand for solar projects in identified airports, which enables a more informed approach to project planning.
Joint exploration and identification of pilot projects for solar installations are also key components of the collaboration. By working together, the signatories can assess the feasibility of setting up solar projects in identified airports and conducting joint preparations and assessments. This cooperative effort extends to supporting implementation by adopting appropriate business models based on best practices, relevant information, research, and experience.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/03/financing-implementation-of-solar-energy-solutions-in-the-pacific-island-countries/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"AUGUST 3, 2023",Financing implementation of solar energy solutions in the Pacific Island countries,"Over 80% of the population living in Pacific Island Countries (PIC) have access to electricity, with electricity access being around 80% in rural areas, according to the World Bank. A large part of this access, around 80%, is provided by diesel generators using imported fuel, which costs around USD 6 billion annually. This situation is due to the dispersed geographical nature of the island states and the prohibitively high cost of providing grid connectivity to far-flung islands. The result is that residents of these countries face high electricity costs, which can be up to three times the average bill of consumers in the US.
Building self-reliance in the energy sector through increased capacity of renewable energy-generated electricity is the way out of this issue for these countries. It will not only transition them to clean energy, but also greatly strengthen economic resilience. Many of these countries have hydropower potential, which they are already using to a good extent. But an area with reasonably high potential and low utilization is solar energy. Developing solar energy generation capacity in the PICs faces a range of issues, such as lack of technical capabilities and skilled workforce, challenging geographical conditions, weak regulatory and policy frameworks, and underdeveloped capital markets, all of which contributes a lack of access to the required finance.
While globally the solar sector has started seeing significantly improved mobilization of investment, along with increased uptake of solar, and there are now a range of innovative models for financing, many of these are not applicable in their present form to the PICs. In the case of the PIC economies, they have relatively lower energy demand and growth projections compared to countries where the bulk of energy investments are directed. As a result, there is a limited number of private sector actors and private sector financing.
Furthermore, with the dispersed population and diesel generator-based connectivity, there is a greater need for stand-alone, smaller-scale projects. These face several challenges in terms of required skills, capacities, business models, regulations than the more mature and developed markets. Considering these aspects, and that financing for a technology is largely dependent on maturity levels, as well as the local sectoral and country context, there are several barriers to finance for solar in PICs. However, given the reality of the PICs being amongst the most highly vulnerable countries to climate change, they are getting more attention and preference for grants, and other supportive finance mechanisms. This provides the opportunity to design appropriate, long-term impact projects for such investments, which can change the economic trajectory of these countries.
In general, the types of finance required to scale technologies can be broadly categorized:
It is notable that solar project investments in most developed and emerging markets are of the third category, investment finance, driven almost entirely by the private sector based on commercial aspects, while in other markets, such as Africa, risk mitigation finance is required. It provides an extra layer of comfort for market development and draws in private sector investors.
In the case of PICs, it may be even more complex due to the need for stand-alone solar energy systems and mini-grids, which to be viable for larger investments would require aggregation at a sectoral or programmatic level to become feasible. Revision of existing regulations would also be required. Thus, the investment required in this case may be in the nature of ‘readiness finance’ accompanied by ‘hand-holding’ in the initial stages for a larger number of applications that have been categorized as investment finance in other markets. Also, payment guarantees and additional assurance through infrastructure insurance, or guarantee against currency fluctuations, may be needed to mobilize private sector investments.
This approach is what the developmental organizations have been taking for deploying many adaptation-related projects and evolving new viable models, but in the case of solar they have transitioned away from it in the belief that the sector has evolved into commercially viable projects. However, in the Least Developed Countries, including the PICs, innovative financing is still needed. It is important to note that a large part of this readiness finance support would be to build local technical skills and institutional capabilities, which are often the critical missing elements in developing markets to enable such projects. Support is required to devise viable business models for investments, which might aggregate several small projects, or service-based operating models, such as pay-per-use. Financing would also be required to re-design existing product systems to create appropriate and innovative solutions given the lack of available land and the extreme weather events these countries frequently face. Thus, solutions such as floating solar and agro-photovoltaics, may need to be explored.
The International Solar Alliance (ISA) has been working across the PICs, deploying specific solar applications, such as rooftop solar, lights, and solar boats, building capacities through targeted training and conducting feasibility studies for innovative infrastructure solutions. To accelerate the deployment of solar in PICs, financing solutions formed through collaborative efforts, which are able to address these wide-ranging aspects by providing a level of grant support and attracting private international and local investments through instruments, such as payment guarantees, is the need of the hour.

The Romanian Ministry of Energy said this week that state-owned energy company Societatea de Administrare Participațiilor în Energie S.A. (SAPE SA) is currently conducting a feasibility study to resume the development of the Tarniţa Lăpuşteşti pumped hydropower project on the Someșul Cald River in Cluj County, northern Romania.
The government said the storage project will be the country’s first pumped hydropower station, with its capacity ranging between 500 MW and 1,000 MW. It will use water from Lake Tarniţa and Lake Lăpusteşti. The system will feature turbines with capacities of 250 MW each.
Development originally began in 1989, but the project has since gone through a series of setbacks. Hidro Tarnita, the Romanian project company in charge of managing the planned asset, has held a number of failed tenders for the project over the past decade. Finally, the Romanian authorities abandoned the project in 2019 after defining it as financially unviable.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/03/new-technique-to-recover-lead-in-end-of-life-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RECYCLING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 3, 2023",New technique to recover lead in end-of-life solar panels,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at Arizona State University have developed a new two-step process to recycle lead (Pb) in photovoltaic modules at the end of their life cycle.
“No recyclers talk about lead recovery because it does not generate much revenue but adds to the cost of recycling,” the research’s corresponding author, Meng Tao, told pv magazine. “In the long run it is a liability for recyclers as it is toxic and will sooner or later leach out from PV panels. We are considering lead recovery as part of the overall recycling process we are developing.”
The process utilizes a leaching solution based on a combination of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which the researchers said works as an efficient leaching agent for Pb “in a matter of minutes.” They specified that each solar cell used in PV panels contains, on average, about 0.2 grams of Pb.
The metal is recovered by dissolving it in the leaching solution. After leaching, the resulting Pb powders are rinsed and dried on highly absorbent paper to minimize the formation of lead acetate compounds, which the team said introduce errors during weight measurements. “It is preferred to recover it in the metallic form so it can be sold back to the solar industry for new solder,” the US group said.
The process’ second step is electrowinning, a technique that is generally used to recover metals from a solution by means of an electrolytic chemical reaction. The scientists conducted nine electrowinning experiments for different combinations of CH3COOH concentration. They achieved the highest recovery rates over 99% using a 10% CH3COOH solution. 
“These high recovery rates were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for the post-electrowinning leachates,” they explained. “The 0% CH3COOH solution has the lowest Pb recovery rates for each potential applied, suggesting that CH3COOH aids in Pb electrowinning.”
The scientists noted that the total Pb amount in the solution is approximately 16 mg or 0.05% of the total powder mass. Assuming that 0.2% of the silicon cell’s weight is represented by Pb, the total Pb amount in the 1.3 g of silicon cells should be 26 mg, they stated.
The technique is described in full in the study “Lead leaching and electrowinning in acetic acid for solar module recycling,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. “Overall, the leaching and electrowinning process using CH3COOH shows promise as a feasible and safer approach for Pb recovery from silicon solar modules,” the academics concluded.
