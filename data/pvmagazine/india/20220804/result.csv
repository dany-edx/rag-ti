The states of Rajasthan (282.6 MW) and Haryana (246.5 MW) led in PV capacity addition through both modes under the scheme.
Power minister RK Singh shared this information in the lower parliament today.
The PM KUSUM Scheme, under its Component-B, supports farmers in installing standalone solar agriculture pumps of up to 7.5 HP to replace their existing diesel agriculture pumps in off-grid areas. 
Under Component-C of the scheme, individual farmers having grid-connected agriculture pumps are supported to solarise their pumps. The farmer can use the generated solar power to meet the irrigation needs and sell the excess solar power to distribution companies at a pre-fixed tariff. 
A 2016-17 survey by the agriculture ministry estimated India to have 11.2 million diesel agricultural pumps. As of June 30, the nation had installed 123,180 standalone solar pumps under Component-B of the Scheme. These solar pumps are estimated to reduce 85 million liters of diesel consumption per annum. 
Cumulatively, the nation had installed 385,000 standalone solar pumps till June 30, including the solar pumps installed under PM-KUSUM Scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/04/photovoltaic-micro-inverter-based-on-gallium-nitride-transistors/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 4, 2022",Photovoltaic micro-inverter based on gallium nitride transistors,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at France’s National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – an arm of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – have developed what they claim to be the first prototype of a 400 W photovoltaic microinverter made with gallium nitride (GaN) transistors.
According to its designers, the device has a power density of 1.1 kW/L and an efficiency of 97%.
The micro-inverter utilizes GaN 600V diodes and power transistors developed by CEA’s electronic branch CEA-Leti. “With this coplanar technology, it would be possible to make the power component ‘smarter’ with protection (temperature, voltage, current, etc.) and control (driver) functions. It is also possible to design bidirectional voltage interrupters which do not exist at present,” the French scientists said in a statement.
They added the microinverter technology consists of two conversion stages — a DC/DC stage comprising 5 GaN 100V transistors and DC/AC stage comprising 4 GaN 650V transistors — without providing further technical details. “This technology is expected to reach the market by 2025-2027,” they specified, noting that a second prototype should be developed this year. “In the meantime, researchers at CEA-Leti and CEA-Liten at INES will improve the technology and develop an integrated digital control system. The team will unveil new prototypes in the coming years.”
String inverters based on gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors could represent a valid alternative to devices based on silicon (Si) or silicon carbide (SiC) in the future if the industry manages to reduce their size. A consortium led by Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology IEE is currently coordinating a research project to assess how components of GaN inverters can be further miniaturized, in order to achieve lower production costs.
The primary goal when using GaN in power electronics is usually the optimization and miniaturization of the entire inverter device, including passive components such as cooling systems, casings, and mounting structures.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/04/global-energy-storage-deployment-may-hit-500-gw-by-2031/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 4, 2022",Global energy storage deployment may hit 500 GW by 2031,"From pv magazine Global
As renewable energy plays a growing role in the electricity grid, energy storage buildout is quickly following behind. Wood Mackenzie said it expects 500 GW in global deployment by 2031, with the United States and China representing 75% of worldwide demand.
Wood Mackenzie said it sees the United States on a path to be a 27 GW annual market by 2031, and 83% of that figure will be utility-scale storage. However, projections for 2022 and 2023 have been trimmed by 34% and 27%, respectively, due to disruptions from antidumping and a countervailing duties tariff suit in the second quarter. Solar-plus-storage projects were impacted heavily by the investigation, leading to about 35% of grid-scale projects being delayed as a result.
The market is expected to be highly consolidated over the next decade. The top 10 nations for deployment are expected to represent 91% of the global demand, with grid-scale storage representing the largest share of capacity.

The European market is expected to increase five times over the next decade, however project economics in Europe are hampering buildout, said Wood Mackenzie. Policy may improve project economics. The European Commission’s REPowerEU plan has provisions to streamline permitting processes for storage and PV systems, and calls for higher renewables targets, which in turn will drive demand for energy storage.
Europe’s energy storage market is characterized by distributed storage more than grid-scale. Distributed storage has numerous benefits, one of the most important being a lessened need for high-power transmission and substation buildout. It also makes the power grid more decentralized and able to respond to extreme weather events and grid outages.

China released a five-year plan for energy storage this year that calls for a large-scale development supply chain by 2025, in which the nation targets a 30% reduction in system costs through improved technology performance. Since the plan was released, 12 provinces and cities announced deployment targets for energy storage, totaling 40 GW.
