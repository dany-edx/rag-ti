It is also expanding its PV module production capacity to 1.2 GW with the addition of a new 500 MW line.
The manufacturer expects the new module and cell facilities to start production by the end of FY 2024-25.
Manish Gupta, chairman of Insolation Energy, told pv magazine they have planned the new facilities in Jaipur but may consider other states if the incentives are attractive.
Currently, Insolation Energy Ltd has a cumulative module manufacturing capacity of 700 MW from its two factories of 200 MW and 500 MW, respectively.

The project, valued at $130 million, will be funded by the EXIM Bank of India.
Amara Raja Infra’s scope of work includes engineering, design, supply, installation, and commissioning of the solar plant. 
ARIPL secured the project from Rural Power Co. Ltd (RPCL) in Bangladesh. The project spans 326 acres at Madarganj in the Jamalpur district and is set for commissioning in the next 18 months. 
Post commissioning, ARIPL will also provide comprehensive operation and maintenance services for two years, along with warranty spares and consumables.
With the latest win, ARIPL now has a solar portfolio of 1 GW in the pipeline.

A research team led by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany has developed panel-like photoreactors that use a water-splitting photocatalyst to produce hydrogen on rooftops or dedicated solar farms.
“Various photocatalysts are now known,” said Paul Kant from the Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT) at KIT. “They can be used, for example, to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, or to produce climate-neutral fuels from water and carbon dioxide.”
The proposed systems mimic the photosynthesis process and use a photocatalyst to drive the required chemical reaction for the electrolysis. The photoreactors contain the photocatalyst and the materials for the chemical reaction themselves.

“The design method and base design are applicable to any sunlight-harvesting liquid, gas, or heterogeneous multi-phase photocatalytic system,” the scientists stated. “To ensure comparability with other approaches, however, the design method and the resulting photoreactor are demonstrated experimentally with the established, commercially available, and reliable potassium iron(III) oxalate photocatalytic system.”
The photoreactor is made of hundreds of parallel reaction channels, with each of them embedding a V-shaped concentrator and a tube-like cavity. The V-shaped concentrator harvests light from various incident directions and drives it into a tube-like, mirrored cavity, enclosing the reaction volume. “The photoreactor should ideally conduct incoming sunlight to the photocatalyst with little loss, regardless of the direction it is coming from or where the sun is in the sky,” said Kant.
The microstructured polymer panels are coated with aluminum for high reflectivity and, according to the German group, enable both optimal operating conditions and efficient light transport to the photocatalyst over the entire course of the day.
The researchers believe that this system configuration may lead to the manufacturing of low-cost, high-efficiency in the near future.
“Being made from three polymer parts only, all produced via established mass-manufacturing techniques, the material cost of the reactor components is estimated to be in the range of 9.4 $ m2,” they explained. “Including a catalyst worth $1 million per ton, the material cost estimate of the photoreactor system increases to roughly 22 $ m2.”
They presented the novel concept in the study “Low-cost photoreactors for highly photon/energy-efficient solar-driven synthesis,” which was recently published in Joule. The research team includes academics from the University of Toronto in Canada.
“Further optimization of the photoreactor should address the manufacturing of the key components in polymers and the consideration of real-world aspects such as aging of polymers and optical coatings, as well as challenges such as dust accumulation in the rather complicated surface of the photoreactor aperture,” they concluded.

The German Ministry Ministry for Economic Affairs (BMWK) has launched an expression of interest process to invite solar module manufacturers to set up manufacturing facilities in Germany.
The government aims to allocate investment subsidies (capex) through the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF), subject to budget availability and European Commission approval. The objective is to establish a 10 GW production capacity along the PV value chain.
Projects must meet specific criteria, including a minimum annual production capacity of 2 GW, module efficiency over 24%, and annual degradation below 0.2%.
Soldering processes are not allowed in production, and manufacturers must demonstrate a CO2 footprint below 18 grams of CO2/kWh based on service life.
The use of antimony-free solar glass is required, with lead, bismuth, and nitrogen classified as prohibited critical raw materials.
The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has intensified pressure on the German government and the EU Commission to provide more financial support for the domestic solar industry, leading some companies to consider favoring investment decisions in the United States, where both capex and opex funding are available.

Indian Railways (IR) expects to commence field trials of the hydrogen train on this route within a year.
Notably, Indian Railways plans to run 35 hydrogen trains on various heritage/hill routes under the “Hydrogen for Heritage” program. The cost per train is estimated at INR 80 crore ($9.76 million) and the ground infrastructure will cost INR 70 crore per route.
Indian Railways has awarded a pilot project for the retro fitment of hydrogen fuel cell on the existing diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) rake to be run on the Jind–Sonipat section.
In a separate development, Indian Railways’ biggest solar plant at Bhilai in Chhattisgarh is reportedly ready for operation. South East Central Railway (SECR) will offtake power generated from this 50 MWp ground-mount project.

The proposed facility in the USA will provide critical battery materials to power more than one million electric vehicles. 
This synthetic graphite anode processing facility is purportedly the largest Indian investment in the US electric vehicle battery industry. 
EAM is currently evaluating multiple locations across the US for the proposed facility subject to regulatory approvals, environmental permits, and state and local incentive agreements. It has already signed strategic supply agreements with local raw material suppliers and transport partners to create a seamless supply chain network. 
Through this facility, EAM will produce high-capacity synthetic anode materials customized for specific cell chemistries. The facility is expected to generate revenue of more than $ 500 million at full capacity by 2031.
The facility is expected to be commissioned by 2026.
TheUS government aims to convert 50% of vehicle sales in the nation to electric by 2030 and generate 1000 GWh of battery capacity. “With this facility, EAM will contribute to the US EV roadmap by ensuring a local supply chain for EV batteries. The facility will contribute to the U.S. Government’s mandate of critical mineral security,” stated EAM.

Panasonic North America has revealed the new generation of its EverVolt home battery, a modular energy storage device that supports both DC and AC coupling. This flexibility makes the battery a good fit for both new and existing solar installations.
The storage system includes a hybrid inverter and lithium-ferro-phosphate battery. It also includes the SmartBox, a home energy management device.
Each battery is modular in increments of 4.6 kWh of usable energy, offering up to 18.4 kWh per battery. Up to four EverVolt batteries can be connected to one SmartBox, achieving up to 30 kW of power and 72 kWh of usable energy. 
Up to 15.2 kW of solar modules can be connected to three maximum power point trackers. The battery offers up to 7.6 kW of continuous backup power in a single battery.
The battery’s 160 A AC current helps keep more appliances running continuously, and it can use both 120 V and 240 V with no transformer needed. It is rated for a 6,000 cycle lifespan and has a 98% peak efficiency rating and 97.5% CEC weighted efficiency. It also enables 200% PV oversizing, meaning solar capacity can exceed inverter capacity by up to 200%.
