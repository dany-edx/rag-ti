https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/13/us-customs-solar-exclusions-might-be-de-facto-ban-on-chinese-polysilicon/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 13, 2023",US Customs solar exclusions might be ‘de facto ban on Chinese polysilicon’,"From pv magazine USA
Under the enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), US Customs and Border Protection has reportedly excluded Longi solar modules made with Tongwei polysilicon from entering the US market, according to a recent industry note from Roth Capital Partners.  
Modules made with Astronergy (Chint) polysilicon have been detained and are under review under the UFLPA, according to additional checks by pv magazine USA. The UFLPA places the burden of proof on importers to show that the supply chain is free from forced labor practices. China has consistently denied allegations of forced labor of the Uyghur minority group.
Prior to the exclusion of these goods, any imports sourced frm Xinjiang region of China, responsible for a little less than 50% of global production, would be barred from entry. However, it was unclear whether other Chinese suppliers outside the region would face similar scrutiny and market bans.
The ban of Tongwei polysilicon-supplied Longi panels could mean a “de facto ban on Chinese polysilicon,” warned a pv magazine USA industry contact. Tongwei was the world’s largest polysilicon provider in 2022, producing over 345,000 (metric tons) MT, and has no presence in the Xinjiang region.
This is a dramatic negative development for the supply of solar panels in the United States, as China produces “a share of 89% in the global output of solar-grade polysilicon in 2022, and expansion continues unabated,” according to Bernreuter Research. Longi is expected to appeal the import exclusion, but the process for appeal may take several months, drying up module supply in the meantime.
To comply with the UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at a facility, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
While the United States starts to onshore its solar supply chain, doubts persist that the industry can move fast enough to manufacture a steady supply of components to build toward its clean energy goals. Wood Mackenzie expects the US solar market to triple in size over the next five years, bringing total installed solar capacity to 378 GW by 2028.
Clean Energy Associates (CEA) says that while module assembly has a strong presence today in the United States, ingot, wafer, and cell production plans have not kept pace, and no plans for greenfield polysilicon plants have materialized.
CEA forecasts the United States to reach 17 GW of polysilicon production, 3 GW of ingots, 3 GW of wafers, 18 GW of cell manufacturing, and 40 GW of module manufacturing capacity by 2027, suggesting that the United States will continue to rely on energy imports for years to come. However, the recent UFLPA enforcement developments could pose a serious challenge to finding suppliers.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/13/tata-steel-uk-to-support-low-carbon-hydrogen-projects-for-industrial-decarbonization/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA,UNITED KINGDOM",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 13, 2023","Tata Steel, UK to support low-carbon hydrogen projects for industrial decarbonization","Tata Steel, along with The British High Commission, has launched a funding call for innovative projects in the low-carbon hydrogen that address the challenges of greening the steel sector in India. It will offer up to £80,000 (INR 83 lakh) to two winning projects and offer experiential engagement to selected entities including priority access to Tata Steel’s integrated steel plant visit.
The challenge is launched under The UK-India Hydrogen Partnerships and builds on the UK-India Hydrogen Hub announced by the UK and Indian Prime Ministers in 2022. It will feature a range of private industry-sponsored pilots to tackle five grand challenges of hydrogen storage, transport, safety, production, and cost.
The proposals bidding for the grant are expected to address two challenges: the development and deployment of hydrogen technologies for greening the industrial sector; and solutions for hydrogen storage/purification.
Minister of State at the UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology, George Freeman, said, “Steelmaking is highly energy- and carbon-intensive, and cleaning up the steel industry is a key pillar of reducing global warming. Pairing up the UK’s expertise in low carbon manufacturing technology with the Indian steel industry, by working with progressive manufacturers like Tata Steel, we can unlock the innovations that will deliver the steel sector an environmentally sustainable future.”
Debashish Bhattacharjee, vice president, technology and R&D, Tata Steel, said: “While the current levels of carbon footprint from the steel sector are unsustainable, the available version of clean hydrogen faces numerous challenges like high operational cost and energy loss. We are committed to finding a solution to these challenges and have created a platform like ‘Tata Steel – Sprint to Zero 2023’ to ensure the best minds from academia and industry join hands in this effort.”
The funding call is open for solutions from academia, start-ups, and industries across India and the UK. The projects must be co-led by an Indian or a UK organization with a maximum of three partners per project. The last date for submission of proposals is August 31, 2023, and winners will be announced by October 2023. The projects will commence in November 2023 and will be completed in 9-12 months.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/13/solar-module-prices-auction-volumes-and-the-outlook-for-capacity-addition/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",,"JULY 13, 2023","Solar module prices, auction volumes, and the outlook for capacity addition   ","India’s Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has announced that renewable energy (RE) capacity of 50 GW per annum will be bid out from FY2024 to FY2028. The capacity will comprise solar, wind, hybrid, and round-the-clock (RTC) power projects with at least 10 GW of wind projects. 
The MNRE move is aimed to provide a pipeline to meet the 2030 target of 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity. 
Four RE implementing agencies (REIAs), namely, Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NTPC, NHPC, and SJVN, have been notified to invite these bids. 
In FY 2024, a capacity of at least 15 GW will be bid out in the first and second quarters each, followed by at least 10 GW in the third and fourth quarters each. 
The timely implementation of the notified bidding trajectory by the REIAs remains important to achieve the RE capacity targets.
The bidding activity in the solar segment slowed down in FY2023 amid challenges like elevated module prices, the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) comprising only domestic solar PV module manufacturers, and basic customs duty (BCD) on imported modules. 
While bidding activity has picked up since April 2023, the timely ramp-up in tendering by the REIAs remains important to improve the project pipeline. Further, the bidding agencies must lay greater focus on hybrid plus storage tenders to ensure better integration of RE sources with the grid.
On the other hand, PV module prices have witnessed a moderation over the past nine months, with the price of mono PERC modules reducing from the peak level of 27-28 cents/watt to about 23-24 cents/watt in December 2022 and further to 20 cents/watt in May-June 2023. 
While the cell prices increased between January and March, they declined over the past three months to 10-11 cents/watt in June 2023 from 14 cents/watt in March 2023. This has been driven by improved supplies across the value chain and the decline in polysilicon prices. 
Earlier, the prices were driven up by a sharp increase in the price of polysilicon, a key input for cell and module manufacturers, and disruption in operations across the value chain of solar PV module manufacturing in China. 

The increase in cell and module prices between January 2021 and September 2022 impacted the viability of solar power projects. This, in turn, led to execution delays, with developers deferring projects in the hope of a reduction in module prices. 
In this context, the MNRE provision for timeline extension to solar and hybrid power projects till March 31, 2024, and the moderation in cell and module prices, if sustained, would bring relief to the developers and improve the viability of the projects bid out over the past 12-18 months. 

The solar bid tariffs had earlier been on a declining trend, led by reduced module costs and improved module efficiencies, and reached an all-time low of INR 1.99 ($0.024)/kWh in December 2020. 
However, the bid tariffs increased thereafter to INR 2.2-2.5/kWh and further to INR 2.5-2.7/kWh following the elevated cell and module prices, imposition of basic customs duty on imported cells/modules, increase in the goods and services tax (GST) rate, and the rising interest costs.
Nonetheless, solar power tariffs continue to be highly competitive at below INR 3/kWh and lower than the marginal variable cost of generation for thermal utilities in the bottom 25% of the merit order dispatch of the discoms across key states. 
Apart from the capital cost pressure, the developers face challenges like delays in land acquisition and transmission connectivity, which is leading to delays in project implementation and thus impacting the capacity addition. 
The moderation in solar PV cell and module prices, along with the extension in the timeline and ALMM relaxation valid till March 31, 2024, is expected to improve the RE capacity addition in FY2024 to over 20 GW from 15 GW in FY 2023, largely driven by the solar power segment. 
Apart from solar, the wind segment is also expected to see an uptick in capacity addition with the commissioning of projects awarded by the SECI under Tranche VIII, IX, and X, along with the wind component of the hybrid/RTC projects. However, this would remain lower than over 40 GW required to achieve the 500 GW non-fossil capacity target by 2030. 
In this context, a timely ramp-up of tendering activity, easing of challenges associated with land and transmission connectivity, and availability of adequate financing avenues remain important.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/13/italian-startup-offers-solar-kits-packed-in-barrels/,"COMMUNITY,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"JULY 13, 2023",Italian startup offers solar kits packed in barrels,"From pv magazine Italy
Italian startup Barrel has developed a solar kit for remote areas and conflict zones that can be packed in typical oil barrels. It sells the solution in standard packages consisting of solar modules with a total output of 6 kW, a 5.6 kW single-phase hybrid inverter, and a 3.55 kWh lithium battery.
“At the moment, Barrel is present in several markets, with a particular focus on Africa and the Middle East,” Barrel founder Matteo Villa told pv magazine Italia. “Before the pandemic, we focused on providing electrical services to hospitals, remote care centers and schools. More recently, we have shipped our Barrels to Cuba, Ukraine, Dubai and Oman. In Africa, we are present in countries such as Morocco, Senegal and Mali, and we are developing a hospital project in Angola and Mozambique. Our presence also extends to Nigeria and Ghana.”
Villa said that Barrel also recently worked to support earthquake-affected areas in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna and Turkey.
“Our priority is always to offer immediate and reliable energy solutions in emergency situations, helping communities to recover and rebuild,” he said. “We continue to work with international and local organizations to extend our support into other areas in need of energy assistance.”
The company has a dedicated product line that uses exclusively technologies from Europe and the United States to meet the specific needs of the military supply chain. According to Villa, the enormous challenge consists of organizing integrated management processes for these plants and guaranteeing their maintenance.
“We understand the importance of sourced components to this industry and ensure that our products meet rigorous quality and safety standards,” Villa said. “Thanks to our partnership with reliable European and American suppliers, we are able to provide high quality energy solutions that meet the demands of military organizations.”
Barrel’s goal is not only to provide technology, but also to offer integrated consultancy to develop processes that guarantee the continuity of energy production over the decades within NGOs that manage thousands of energy points.
