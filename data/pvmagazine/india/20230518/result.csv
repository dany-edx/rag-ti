Ayana won the capacity at a levelized tariff of INR 4.1 ($0.049)/kWh through its subsidiary Project Nine Renewable Energy in a reverse bid auction for a cumulative 900 MW tendered by REMCL. 
To supply 300 MW of round-the-clock power, Ayana will need to install around 1 GW of solar and wind energy generation capacity supported by a storage solution. It will develop the RE project on a build-own-operate basis. 
“The project is a first-of-its-kind, with a high degree of availability and dispatchability, and will add installed capacity of approximately 1 GW of renewables through solar and wind to Ayana’s portfolio with third-party storage arrangements. This takes Ayana’s cumulative capacity in operation, maintenance, and development to nearly 5 GW,” stated Ayana.
“With an annual availability of over 85%, the project will provide firm renewable energy for 25 years and showcases the potential of RTC to enable baseload, rather than managing peak-load as has been traditionally done,” Ayana added.

Sharp has released a new n-type monocrystalline bifacial solar panel based on tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell technology. The NBJD570 double-glass module features 144 half-cut solar cells based on M10 wafers and a 16-busbar design.
The new panels measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh 32.5 kg. They can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C.
The IEC61215- and IEC61730-certified panel also features a power conversion efficiency of 22.07% and a bifaciality of over 80%, according to the manufacturer. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.30% per C and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, said Sharp.
The company offers a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee.
“We are excited to launch our 570 W bifacial, dual-glass solar module,” said Andrew Lee, Commercial Director for EMEA at Sharp Energy Solutions Europe. “Thanks to its n-type TOPCon cells, our panel offers greater power and efficiency, as well as better low-light performance, higher bifaciality, and a lower temperature coefficient.”
The new product is purportedly resistant under extreme conditions, as it has passed tests for ammonia, salt mist, sand and potential induced degradation (PID) resistance.

Scientists at the Polish Academy of Sciences have studied PV installations older than 15 years and observed a decrease in energy productivity ranging from 1.9% to 2.9% over a 16-year period. They conducted their tests on two rooftop PV systems in Sinsheim, a town in southwestern Germany.
The first system, a 37.8 kW grid-connected array, consists of 252 glass-backsheet solar modules, each with an output of 150 W, provided by Suntech, a Chinese manufacturer. The second installation is an 18.48 kW PV system comprising 112 Suntech glass-backsheet modules with an output of 165 W. Both systems utilize inverters from Solarmax, a German manufacturer.
Based on their analysis using NREL’s HOMER software, the scientists reported that the PV installations generated a total of 958 MWh during the 2004-2021 period. They also observed that the larger system experienced some inverter failures in 2009 and 2010.
The research group discovered that the 18.48 kW system exhibited higher energy unit productivity compared to the 37.8 kW array, particularly in 2009 and 2014-2015. They determined that the annual degradation factor for the first system was 0.11%/year, while for the second system it was 0.20%/year.
Furthermore, the researchers found that the actual energy production per available irradiation was 0.817 for the 18.48 kW system and 0.826 for the 37.8 kW system. The measured specific yield divided by theoretical specific yield for the initial two years of operation was 96.8% and 95.8%, respectively.
Their analysis also indicated a power degradation rate of 1.9% in the largest system and 2.9% in the smaller system over the 16-year period. Additionally, the yearly power degradation rates were observed to be 0.11%/year for the 37.8 kW array and 0.20%/year for the 18.48 kW installation, which the researchers noted as significantly lower values compared to those reported in existing literature.
Thy described their findings in “Evaluation of degradation energy productivity of photovoltaic installations in long-term case study,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
“The main strength of the proposed extended methodology is the elimination of the impact of weather conditions on the scale of annual differences,” they concluded.

Singh said the government is bringing a scheme for distributed renewable energy-based livelihood applications that could benefit lakhs of families across the country. 
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has already been supporting off-grid renewable energy applications, including solar streetlights, solar lamps, standalone solar pumps, etc. A number of livelihood applications can be integrated with distributed renewable energy sources to provide clean and reliable power and increase the users’ productivity and income. 
The power minister stressed on the need for large scale-manufacturing and [component] standardization to lower equipment prices and expand the distributed renewable energy-based livelihoods sector. 
India has witnessed the fastest growth rate in renewable energy capacity addition among all large economies, primarily driven by its success in utility-scale solar installations. 
“We have seen the potential of grid-scale solar power; India will scale up distributed renewable energy applications for livelihoods. Just like we have a large program on rooftop solar and solar irrigation, we will create a large program for DRE livelihoods,” said the minister at the ‘National Summit on Powering Sustainable Livelihoods’ organized by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and Villgro Innovations Foundation’s Powering Livelihoods initiative. 

“The government plans to make DRE livelihood equipment affordable. One aspect of this will be tying up with banks. If a family wants to own a solar dryer, they should be able to get financing from the banks – we will work towards it. Manufacturers and users of DRE for livelihoods are pioneers, and now the government will scale it up to the next level,” he added.
On the occasion, the minister released two new reports by CEEW and Villgro, which show that clean technologies have the potential to impact 37 million livelihoods in India’s agriculture and textile sectors and translate into a market opportunity worth almost INR 4 lakh crore (about $50 billion). Further, 70% of women and farmers using clean technology reported an increase in income, typically by 35%. They use clean-energy powered products such as solar-powered silk reeling machines, multi-food processors, micro solar pumps, and solar vertical fodder grow units, among others, to enhance and diversify their income.
