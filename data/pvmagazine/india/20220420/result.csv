Librestream’s Onsight solution will enable ReNew experts to remotely support field service teams in a fully-collaborative environment, requiring as little as 30 kbps connection, to rapidly troubleshoot, inspect, and resolve issues in the field.
With advanced artificial intelligence and IoT visualization, Onsight effectively distributes knowledge and empowers decision making with capabilities such as live translation, object recognition, and sensor data integration.
Librestream’s technology also addresses the challenge of limited availability of specialized workers, and helps achieve seamless connectivity between remote experts and field technicians.
ReNew currently has operational projects at over 100 sites within nine states across India and continues to expand. Librestream will enable the power giant to drive increased sustainability results leveraging AR and remote video collaboration services.
Onsight offers capabilities for holistic remote collaboration between workers, contractors, and subject matter experts (SMEs), ensuring organizations can reduce unnecessary travel to locations when an issue can be resolved remotely. In turn, it helps decrease their carbon footprint, enhances productivity through just-in-time learning and training, and furthers safety for the deskless workers.

The State has reached 5,152 MW of installed renewable energy capacity, compared to just 160MW in the year 2010. This includes 2,444 MW of wind power, 2,490 MW solar power, 119 MW biomass power, and 99 MW small hydropower.
The Rewa Ultra Mega Solar project in Madhya Pradesh, which has a total capacity of 750 MW, is one of the largest single-site solar projects in the world. It has been supplying power to Delhi Metro for its operational and auxiliary requirements.
“This scheme has proved to be a milestone for Madhya Pradesh. With this, the confidence of national and international investors in Madhya Pradesh has increased,” said the minister.
Madhya Pradesh is going to host a 600 MW floating solar plant, in the Khandwa district, in addition to several ultra-mega solar parks. The array, planned for the reservoir formed by the Omkareshwar dam across the Narmada river, will be the world’s largest when completed.

Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has commissioned a pilot hydrogen plant combining photovoltaics with storage and fuel cells at its fuel cell factory in Kusatsu, Shiga Prefecture, in central Japan.
The system has a power output of 1.07 MW, with 570 kW are provided by the solar array and 495 kW by Panasonic’s own fuel cell systems. It also relies on lithium-ion batteries with a combined storage capacity of 1.1 MWh. The Kusatsu site has a peak demand of around 680 kW and an annual power demand of around 2.7 GWh.
The pilot facility occupies a surface of around 6,000 square meters. It is purportedly the world’s first attempt to create a factory powered by 100% renewables through the full-scale use of hydrogen.
“Through this demonstrator, we will acquire know-how and data related to energy management, including the operation of pure hydrogen fuel cells,” the manufacturer said. “The generated power will cover all the electricity needed by the manufacturing department of the fuel cell factory in the Kusatsu base.”
The facility was built with 99 Panasonic H2 Kibou fuel cell systems with capacities of 5 kW each. The system works with pure hydrogen at a density of more than 99.97%, and achieves electrical efficiency of 56%. It measures 834 mm × 417 mm × 1,766 mm and weighs 205 kg, including the design panel.
The fuel cell generator can be used with an operating temperature between -10 C and 40 C, at altitudes not exceeding 500 meters. During power outages, it is able to generate electricity and to use up to 2.5 kW of its capacity for at least 120 hours.
