https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/04/green-gravity-links-with-miner-to-fast-track-gravity-energy-storage-tech/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 4, 2023",Green Gravity links with miner to fast track gravity energy storage tech,"From pv magazine Australia
Green Gravity and Western Australia-headquartered mining contractor RUC have executed a Memorandum of Understanding which will see the parties collaborate on the technical opportunities, data insights and commercial arrangements associated with gravitational energy storage systems.
Green Gravity, based at Wollongong on the New South Wales South Coast, aims to use gravity to generate clean, dispatchable energy. Its technology relies on lifting and lowering ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts and in doing so, turning a turbine that creates electricity – essentially providing an alternative to pumped hydro or batteries without the need for water or chemicals.
Green Gravity founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Swinnerton said the company’s energy storage technology “represents a breakthrough in the search for economic long-duration storage of renewable energy.”
“Green Gravity is bringing new technology to an existing population of mineshafts,” he said. “By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low. By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”
Swinnerton said the partnership with RUC brings together the mining contractor’s capability in shaft sinking and mineshaft hoisting operations with Green Gravity’s technology, a combination which he believes “has the potential to significantly accelerate and to improve the deployment of gravitational energy storage systems into mineshafts.”
“With detailed design underway for our commercial-scale energy storage system, integrating the global scale and innovative thinking of RUC to areas like the vertical transit system and mine winder design will generate superior outcomes for the technology,” he said.
The signing of the MoU follows Green Gravity’s recent announcement that it would partner with BlueScope to build a 12-metre-tall prototype at the steel manufacturer’s Port Kembla Steelworks. The research and development facility will also include a digital twin that can be used to test new components or hypothesis before they are trialled in the physical world.
“The … lab will enable power generation capacity and efficiency to be validated in addition to data that will support Green Gravity technology to connect to the power grid at large-scale,” Swinnerton said. “This allows us to have great confidence in the mine site and convince the mining operators to say, ‘It’s working over here’, and that’s a way of building confidence.”

The pilot project, based on an alkaline electrolyzer, is expected to complete in eight months.
“This Gorakhpur-based pilot project for Torrent Gas will be one of the largest private-sector blending projects in India,” stated the company.
Torrent will blend green hydrogen at 2.5% by volume into the CGD network, marking its foray into the green hydrogen business in India. 
Through this initiative, coupled with its strong presence in renewable energy, Torrent is looking to grow as a leading end-to-end green hydrogen solution provider to industrial and commercial players in India. It is also looking at export-oriented green ammonia development as a growth avenue. 
Currently, Torrent Power has an installed power generation capacity of 4.1 GW, which consists largely of gas (2.7 GW) and renewables (.07 GW) including solar and wind power generation. In addition, a renewable capacity of 0.7 GW is under different stages of development. Torrent Power is also working on pumped hydro storage.

The winning developers will set up solar power projects in Khavda Solar Park on a build-own-operate basis.
SAEL Industries secured 400 MW and NLC India 300 MW at a tariff of INR 2.71 ($0.033)/kWh each. KPI Green Energy won 100 MW at INR 2.70/kWh. 
Speaking about the auction results, Vinay Rustagi, managing director of Bridge To India, told pv magazine, “Khavda is a challenging location for solar projects because of a high risk of earthquakes and flooding. Additionally, the solar park charges are much higher than usual. We estimate the additional financial burden of these two aspects at about 15-18% of capital cost.”
The latest tariffs are about 5% lower than the last Khavda park auction in May, said Rustagi, adding the sharp fall in solar module prices in recent weeks as one of the contributing factors.
Rustagi said the profile of the winners is interesting. All three winners have recently announced ambitious plans to scale up their renewable business and have bid aggressively in this tender.
“The project site poses some challenges but the benefits of land availability and evacuation arrangements far outweigh them. The project site is close to the seashore and therefore salinity may impact solar panels and other equipment. Also, the solar structure needs to be designed to withstand high wind speeds (200 km/hour) in the zone. The best part of this project is that all the basic infrastructure, including land on lease for 25 years, is provided by GUVNL against an upfront amount as per the tender document,” a prominent developer told pv magazine.
SAEL, based in Punjab, builds and operates solar and agri waste-to-energy projects. Currently, it has a solar portfolio of around 600 MW and aims to add 400 MW of new PV capacity annually over the next five years.
NLC is a state-owned coal miner that has also installed 1,421 MW of renewable energy capacity, including solar power plants totaling 1,370 MW and wind power plants of 51 MW. It aims to enhance its solar capacity to 5,880 MW and wind projects to 151 MW by 2030.

Portugal has announced revisions to the 2030 National Energy and Climate Plan (PNEC) under the slogan “a greener country, sooner.” It now hopes achieve climate neutrality by 2045.
The updated energy strategy aims for 80% of electricity in the country to be renewable by 2026, and 85% by 2030. The revised plan sets a target of 20.4 GW of operational PV systems in 2030, with 14.9 GW for utility-scale plants and 5.5 GW for distributed generation.
The government said that solar plant deployment should not exceed 0.4% of national territory and has called for compensation and community involvement. The new plan also includes improvements to authorization processes, designated areas, regulatory frameworks for distributed generation and energy communities, and new financial incentives.
Portugal’s cumulative PV capacity hit 2.59 GW at the end of 2022, outpacing the growth of other renewable energy sources. The latest statistics from Portugal’s Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG) also show that the country added just 118 MW of new solar capacity in the first four months of 2023.
BloombergNEF predicts that Portugal’s solar installations will reach 1,363 MW by the end of 2023, a substantial increase compared to 890 MW last year.
