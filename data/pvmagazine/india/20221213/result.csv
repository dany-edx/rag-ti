The PV projects were developed under the second phase of the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, Govt. of India. 
NTPC won this capacity through viability gap funding (VGF) based competitive bidding conducted by the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) in 2019. The projects were set up by HILD Energy under EPC with land mode.
The projects employ made-in-India PV cells and modules as per the Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) clause of the CPSU Scheme.

Ltd’s tender for the purchase of 250 MW of flexible and schedulable power from renewable sources with an energy storage facility. Each quoted the lowest tariff of INR 9/kWh (for non-solar generation hours) to win 150 MW and 100 MW, respectively.
As per the tender, the winning developers will set up renewable energy projects (solar, wind, hydro, or combination thereof) along with an energy storage facility to supply flexible and schedulable power on daily basis. The projects are to be installed on a built-own-operate basis.
The projects selected are eligible for two-part tariffs: Energy supplied during the solar generation hours at a flat price of INR 2.42/kWh and energy supplied during the non-solar generation hours at the tariff discovered through the tender. The applicable tariff under the power purchase agreement (PPA), comprising tariffs for both solar generation hours and non-solar generation hours, will be fixed for the entire term of the PPA.
MSEDCL may exercise the green-shoe option to allocate additional capacity of up to 250 MW to the successful bidder if it finds the discovered tariff to be economical.

Under the agreement signed with Saatvik, Etrica will sell Saatvik PV modules for residential, utility, and commercial projects in Rajasthan. 
Saatvik manufactures solar PV modules based on M10 wafers. It has a manufacturing unit in Ambala (Haryana) with a production capacity of up to 1.5 GW per year. The company recently hit the milestone of 1 GW solar module shipments across India. It is all set to launch its new greenfield project in Gujarat (Gandhidham) by the end of 2023. The plant will be equipped with ultra-modern technology and the most advanced types of machinery to manufacture cells and modules, according to Saatvik. 
Etrica Power is engaged in the distribution, trade, and promotion of solar products and also provides EPC and consulting services to its clients in the area of renewable energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/13/us-to-deploy-30-gw-111-gwh-of-grid-scale-energy-storage-by-2025/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",US to deploy 30 GW/111 GWh of grid-scale energy storage by 2025,"From pv magazine Global
Grid-scale energy storage capacity is expected to surpass 30 GW/111 GWh of installed capacity by the end of 2025, according to a new report by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Battery storage capacity in the United States was negligible prior to 2020, at which point storage capacity began to ramp up. As of October 2022, 7.8 GW of utility-scale storage assets began operating, with 1.4 GW of additional capacity to be added by the end of 2022. The EIA expects another 20.8 GW of battery storage capacity to be added from 2023 to 2025.
Growth in energy storage capacity is outpacing the pace of early growth of utility-scale solar. US solar capacity began expanding in 2010 and grew from less than 1.0 GW in 2010 to 13.7 GW in 2015. In comparison, the EIA sees energy storage increasing from 1.5 GW in 2020 to 30 GW in 2025.
Energy storage adds stability to intermittent clean energy sources such as wind and solar. Batteries solve the intermittency problem by storing extra energy produced by wind or solar generators for use later in the day.
While it may come as no surprise, more than 75% of the 20.8 GW of new utility-scale battery capacity that developers plan to install from 2022 to 2025 is located in Texas (7.9 GW) and California (7.6 GW).
More utility-scale solar capacity is located in California than any other state, at 16.8 GW, and developers expect to add another 7.7 GW of solar generating capacity between 2023 and 2025, furthering the ramp up necessary for grid-scale storage solutions.
Another 10.5 GW of utility-scale solar capacity is located in Texas. Developers plan to install another 20.4 GW of solar capacity between 2023 and 2025.  Not to mention, Texas is home to 37.2 GW of wind power capacity, more than any other state, and developers expect to add 5.3 GW of new wind turbines over the next three years.
As more battery capacity becomes available, storage projects are becoming increasingly larger in capacity. Before 2020, the largest battery storage project was 40 MW. The 250 MW Gateway Energy Storage System in California, which began operating in 2020, marked the beginning of large-scale energy storage installations.
At present, the 409 MW Manatee Energy Storage in Florida is the largest operating battery storage project in the United States. Developers have scheduled more than 23 grid-scale battery projects, ranging from 250 MW to 650 MW, to be deployed by 2025.
Funding for the massive energy storage roll out will come in part from the Inflation Reduction Act, which BloombergNEF states will drive the development of 30 GW (111 GWh) of energy storage capacity by 2030. The IRA stipulates $369 billion in clean energy investments, as well as 30% tax credit for energy storage systems.
