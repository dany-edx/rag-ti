The project was launched in collaboration with Nuru, a leading solar power company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Under the project, Nuru will develop and construct 15 MW of solar mini-grid capacity across three provinces in the Eastern Congo.
Ajay Mathur, Director General of the International Solar Alliance, said, “Less than 20% of the DRC’s population has access to energy, and with a rising energy demand projected for the future, Nuru’s innovative approach to renewable energy access unlocks the immense market potential across the country.”
“[Nuru] will be installing a series of mini grids that will power around 5 million people. Towards this, the GSF is providing insurance capital to the company, which will be bought from MIGA [Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of the World Bank Group], contributing significantly to the viability of the project,” Mathur added.
The ISA, through its GSF, is supporting Nuru by partnering with the MIGA. The collaboration, announced at the G20-Clean Energy Ministerial meeting in Goa in July 2023, aims to promoting new investment in solar power generation to increase access and boost energy security, especially in countries with the greatest needs. “ISA-MIGA partnership will be invaluable to mitigating risk, and unlocking potential of investments in Africa,” said Mathur.
Jonathan Shaw, chief executive officer and co-founder of Nuru, said, the ISA is providing critical and catalytic support to ensure that we can manage complex risks in the places we work while also maintaining affordable pricing for our clients.
Nuru plans to deploy an additional 39 MW in subsequent phases, so as to provide power to up to 5 million people by 2025.
Nuru’s utility-scale solar metrogrids are designed to provide 24/7 reliable and renewable energy to urban communities in the DRC.
The GSF aims to catalyze solar investments in underserved segments and geographies across Africa, unlocking commercial capital in the process. ISA had earlier announced a $35 million funding for the GSF to stimulate investments into solar power projects.
During the International Solar Alliance Assembly, RK Singh, minister of power and new & renewable energy, Government of India, had highlighted the GSF’s objective to raise $100 million, to provide security to investments and accelerate the transition to solar energy in Africa.
“The world requires an investment of $12.5 trillion in renewable energy and $23 billion in off-grid solar by 2030. The GSF will further our vision of addressing the urgent need for universal energy access and a clean energy transition,” said Mathur.
After Africa, the GSF plans to expand its reach to Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, tailoring regional facilities to meet specific requirements. The GSF envisions investments in innovative technologies, support for startups, and exploration of emerging solar energy sectors in its mission to enhance solar energy efficiency globally.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/07/indias-installed-solar-power-capacity-to-hit-104-gw-by-march-2025/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OFF-GRID SOLAR,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",India’s installed solar power capacity expected to hit 104 GW by March 2025,"ICRA expects India’s installed renewable energy capacity (from solar, wind, and other RE sources) to increase to about 170 GW by March 2025 from 132 GW as of October 2023. Much of this capacity addition will be driven by solar installations, which will grow to 104 GW by March 2025 from 72 GW as of October 2023. New solar capacity addition in FY 2024 and FY 2025 is expected at 17 GW and 20 GW, respectively.
ICRA said RE capacity addition momentum will sustain after March 2025 due to a significant improvement in tendering activity in the current fiscal with over 16 GW of RE projects (including 11.2 GW solar) bid out so far and another 17 GW bids underway by the Central nodal agencies. This is in line with the 50 GW annual bidding trajectory announced by the Government of India in March 2023.

Vikram V, vice president & sector head – Corporate Ratings, ICRA, cited the sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices, abeyance of the ALMM order till March 2024, and the timeline extension approved for solar and hybrid projects as the primary drivers for the improvement in RE capacity addition to 20 GW in FY 2024 from 15 GW in FY2023. This, along with the growing project pipeline, is likely to support the scale-up in capacity addition to 25 GW in FY 2025, mainly driven by the solar power segment.
However, the capacity addition prospects could be hampered by challenges on the execution front, such as delays in land acquisition and transmission connectivity, Vikram said.
The sharp decline in solar PV cell and module prices by 65% and 50%, respectively, over the past 12 months is leading to a healthy improvement in debt coverage metrics for the upcoming solar power projects. Benefitting from this, for a solar power project with a bid tariff of INR 2.5/kWh and sourcing modules from domestic OEMs using imported PV cells, the average DSCR has improved by over 35 bps.
Vikram said, “While this is a positive in the near term, the developers would remain exposed to movement in imported solar PV cell and wafer prices, till the development of fully integrated module manufacturing units in India.”
The rise in the RE capacity over the next six years is estimated to increase the share of RE plus large hydro in the all-India electricity generation from 23% in FY2023 to around 40% in FY2030. Given the intermittency associated with RE generation, the availability of RTC supply from RE sources remains important. This can be made possible through the use of wind and solar power projects complemented with energy storage systems.
Vikram said, “The tariffs discovered in the RE-RTC tenders so far remain highly competitive against the conventional sources, with recent bid tariffs in the range of INR 4.0-4.5 per kWh, well below the INR 5.2 per kWh discovered in the recent medium-term bid for supply from coal-based projects. The share of RE-based RTC projects is expected to rise in the upcoming bids as already seen from the tenders issued by the Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd (SECI) in the current fiscal.”
“The returns for the winning developer under the RTC bids remain linked with the cost of the storage component, apart from the cost associated with the wind and solar components. Further, based on the prevailing capital cost of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and pumped hydro storage projects (PSP) projects, the viability of the RTC projects remains relatively better with the use of PSP capacity,” he added.

The plant, located in the Bemetara district of Chhattisgarh, is part capacity of a proposed 55 MWp plant.
Hira Ferro Alloys had earlier commissioned a 30 MWp solar PV plant in March 2023. Thus, with the latest commissioning of 22 MWp, a total of 52 MWp of the proposed 55 MWp capacity has been commissioned to date.
“The company had earlier proposed to set up a 60 MW captive solar PV plant at Bemetara, however, the proposed capacity was reduced to 55 MWp and [the company] could commission only 52 MWp due to non-availability of contiguous land. The company is making efforts to purchase the land for the balance 8MWp capacity and the same will be installed and commissioned in due course when land is purchased,” stated Godawari Power & Ispat.

Today’s electric vehicles are predominantly powered by nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) lithium-ion batteries. However, the inclusion of cobalt in this type of batteries has been considered as problematic due to its anticipated scarcity as well as associated supply chain risks related to its single source, human rights and mining practices.
Now, a team led by researchers from the University of Tokyo has designed a lithium-ion battery pairing a cobalt-free cathode with a silicon suboxide (SiOx) anode, successfully addressing the cobalt challenge.
“There are many reasons we want to transition away from using cobalt in order to improve lithium-ion batteries,” said Professor Atsuo Yamada from the Department of Chemical System Engineering. “For us the challenge is a technical one, but its impact could be environmental, economic, social and technological. We are pleased to report a new alternative to cobalt by using a novel combination of elements in the electrodes, including lithium, nickel, manganese, silicon and oxygen — all far more common and less problematic elements to produce and work with.”
Underlying this favorable electrode combination is a rational electrolyte design based on 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC featuring a shifted potential, which serves to aid formation of robust passivation layers on the anode and promote electrolyte stability against both reductive and oxidative degradations.
In addition to featuring electrodes and electrolytes devoid of cobalt, the new battery design has also displayed a number of advantages over conventional lithium-ion batteries. It has an energy density about 60% higher, which could equate to longer life, and it can deliver 4.4 volts, as opposed to about 3.2-3.7 volts of conventional NMC batteries.
In addition, test batteries with the new chemistry were able to fully charge and discharge over 1,000 cycles, simulating three years of full use and charging. In the process, they were losing only about 20% of their storage capacity.
“We are delighted with the results so far, but getting here was not without its challenges. It was a struggle trying to suppress various undesirable reactions that were taking place in early versions of our new battery chemistries which could have drastically reduced the longevity of the batteries,” said Yamada.
“And we still have some way to go, as there are lingering minor reactions to mitigate in order to improve the safety and longevity even further. At present, we are confident that this research will lead to improved batteries for many applications, but some, where extreme durability and lifespan are required, might not be satisfied just yet.”
According to the researchers, their  electrolyte formulation offers a pathway towards both sustainable and high-performing lithium-ion batteries, while the concept could be applied to other electrochemical energy technologies, including other kinds of batteries, water splitting (to produce hydrogen and oxygen), ore smelting, electro-coating and more.
Their findings are discussed in “Electrolyte design for lithium-ion batteries with a cobalt-free cathode and silicon oxide anode,” published in Nature Sustainability.

Statkraft and Dutch startup Aquabattery have joined forces to develop the latter’s long-duration storage solution based on saltwater.
The two companies will test the storage technology in a pilot project for six to 12 months in Delft, the Netherlands. The objective is to investigate the scalability of Aquabattery’s technology and its commercial viability.
Aquabattery’s patented storage technology uses saltwater as a storage medium. The tech is described as a flow battery that is able to independently amend power (kW) and energy (kWh) capacity. It is also said to be low-cost, highly scalable, and sustainable, as it uses only water and table salt, with its storage capacity being expandable by just adding water reservoirs or using larger tanks.
The battery system uses three storage tanks, one with fresh water, one with concentrated salt water and one with diluted salt water, and also relies on membrane stacks. During the charging phase, the diluted salt water is split into concentrated salt water and fresh water in the membrane stack and stored separately.
The separation is achieved through electrodialysis (ED), which is a separation process in which charged membranes and electrical potential differences are used to separate ionic species from an aqueous solution and other uncharged components.
In the discharging phase, the two streams are combined and the resulting energy is converted to electricity with the help of the membrane stack through reverse electrodialysis (RED), which is a technology to generate electricity from the salinity difference between two solutions, for example, seawater and river water.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/07/tesla-cybertruck-can-power-your-home-and-more/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,HIGHLIGHTS,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 7, 2023",Tesla Cybertruck can power your home and more,"From pv magazine USA
USA’s leading EV manufacturer, Tesla’s newly released Cybertruck features vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) capabilities, branded as Powershare.
Although Tesla’s website does not specifically state that the vehicle includes vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, it connects to the home using either a Powerwall or the Tesla Gateway. In turn, the Powerwall offers V2G capabilities and virtual power plant participation via the Gateway.
Powershare offers two sets of specifications: one for powering a home and another for supplying power to five individual outlets.

The home backup specifications feature an 11.5 kW max continuous power output at 240 volts, aligning with the company’s upcoming Powerwall 3 and solar inverter, introduced at RE+ in September.
Some additional hardware is required to utilize the V2H feature. The Universal Wall Connector, likely on many Cybertruck buyers’ wish lists already, is priced at $595. Additionally, the Tesla Gateway, essential for integrating standard Powerwall or solar installations, costs $1,800. Tesla also recommends the optional Backup Switch, known for streamlining the installation and potentially reducing overall costs. However, the price of this switch varies with different installation requirements and is not uniformly listed.
Tesla indicates that existing Powerwall owners won’t need extra hardware to enable the V2H feature.

The vehicle is equipped with five outlets: four standard 120V wall plugs – two in the cabin and two in the cargo bed – and a high-voltage 240V plug, capable of charging another Tesla, as depicted in the featured image.
In total, these five outlets offer 9.6 kW of power.
Tesla asserts that the vehicle can supply a minimum of 30 kWh to a home over a 24-hour period, matching the average daily energy usage of an American household.
The Cybertruck will also offer an optional removable range-extending battery box, designed to be installed in the truck’s bed, adding approximately 120 to 130 miles of additional range. Reflecting figures from Car and Driver, and other sources, we estimate Cybertruck’s efficiency to be between 2.33 and 2.5 miles per kWh. This efficiency estimate suggests that the capacity of the range extender is likely between 48 to 56 kWh.
While the official price for this accessory has yet to be announced, a Twitter user’s exploration of Tesla’s website code suggests the hardware might be priced at $16,000.
For comparison, the Tesla Powerwall, which provides 13.5 kWh of storage capacity, is priced at $8,401.
