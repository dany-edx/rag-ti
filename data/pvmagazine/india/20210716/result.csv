https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/16/indias-renewable-energy-fell-subsidies-nearly-45-since-their-fy-2017-peak/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 16, 2021",India’s renewable energy subsidies fell nearly 45% since their FY 2017 peak,"India needs to increase financial support for renewable energy to reach its goals of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and clean energy transition as part of the economic recovery from Covid-19, according to a new study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). 
The study, titled ‘Mapping India’s Energy Subsidies 2021: Time for renewed support to clean energy’, finds that subsidies to renewable energy fell by 45% from the fiscal year (FY) 2017 peak of INR 15,470 crore to INR 8,577 crore in FY 2020.
IISD and CEEW experts emphasize new clean energy funding is crucial to progress the transition that is already underway in India. They point to positive trends such as the increasing subsidies for electric vehicles, which jumped 135% from FY 2019, reaching INR 1,141 crore (US$ 153 million) in FY 2020 due to growing public demand for electric mobility. However, they said the full benefits of electric transport can only be achieved with a green electricity mix.
The report explains that renewable energy subsidies are at a standstill due to a combination of factors including grid-scale solar and wind achieving market parity, lower deployment levels, and subsidy schemes nearing the end of their allocation period.
Overall, the study finds that support for fossil fuels has increased, hitting INR 70,578 crore (US$9463 million) in FY 2020. This is over seven times the sum of subsidies to clean energy.
“It is time for a new wave of support measures focused on emerging technologies such as grid integration and storage, decentralized renewable energy, green hydrogen, and offshore wind,” said study co-author Balasubramanian Viswanathan of IISD. 
“India must deploy historic levels of about 39 GW every year to meet its admirable target of 450 GW of renewables by 2030. It is hard to imagine achieving this goal without the right support policies.”
Experts highlight that reforming fossil fuel subsidies can generate valuable additional resources for economic recovery from COVID-19 and investments in clean energy.
The report also identifies other government measures that can promote energy transition.
“Redirecting a share of coal tax revenues to clean energy and supporting communities, regions, and livelihoods impacted by the transition will help ensure a just and equitable energy transition,” said co-author Prateek Aggarwal of CEEW. 
“Further, the government should encourage public sector undertakings, which are currently investing more in fossil fuels, to set ambitious targets for high levels of investment in clean energy and establish national capacity in manufacturing.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/16/electricity-demand-in-india-to-grow-at-6-in-fy2022/,"COAL-FIRED POWER,COVID-19,HIGHLIGHTS,PROCUREMENT,RENEWABLE ENERGY,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 16, 2021",Electricity demand in India to grow at 6% in FY2022,"India will see electricity demand grow by 6% in FY2022 on a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis, owing to a favorable base effect, relatively lesser impact of the second Covid wave on electricity demand, and vaccination pick-up, according to ICRA Ratings.
Any resurgence in Covid infections leading to lockdown restrictions, however, remains a key downside risk for the demand, it stated. 
The ratings agency expects the power generation capacity addition in FY2022 to rebound to 17-18 GW, compared to 12.8 GW in FY2021. The capacity addition will be mainly led by the renewable energy (RE) segment, which, at annual addition of 10.5-11 GW, will form around 60% of the overall power capacity addition.
The aggregate 10.5-11 GW of renewable capacity addition in FY 2022 will comprise 8.5 GW solar, about 2 GW wind, and the rest from small hydro, biomass, etc.
ICRA expects the RE segment to remain as the main driver of capacity addition with a more than 60% share over the next five years.
The outlook for the thermal generation segment is negative, despite the electricity demand growth prospects remaining favorable.
Girishkumar Kadam, Co-Group Head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said, cited subdued thermal plant load factors (PLFs), lack of visibility in the signing of new long-term or medium-term power purchase agreement (PPAs) for thermal independent power producers, modest tariffs in the short-term power market, and continued payment delays by the state distribution utilities as the reasons. 
The thermal PLF is expected to remain subdued at 57.0% in FY2022, despite the expected improvement from 54.5% in FY2021 led by higher electricity demand. 
While the demand is expected to recover in FY2022, the discom finances are likely to remain under pressure owing to the lack or inadequacy of the tariff revisions, high distribution losses, and rising subsidy dependence. The median tariff revision based on the tariff orders issued so far for FY2022 is less than one percent and the subsidy dependence for discoms at all India level is estimated at Rs. 1.3 lakh crore for FY2022.
Vikram V, Sector Head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said, “The gap between the average cost of supply and average tariff for state-owned discoms at the all-India level is estimated to remain high at 70-75 paise per unit in FY2022, though declining from FY2021. As a result, the discom losses at the all-India level would remain high at more than Rs. 750 billion. Further, the debt on the books of state-owned discoms at all India level is estimated to reach close to Rs. 6 trillion in FY2022. Such a high level of liabilities (debt plus dues to Gencos) is unsustainable for the discoms. In this context, the rapid implementation of reforms in the distribution segment is essential for the power sector.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/16/sonnen-battery-still-running-after-28000-full-charge-cycles/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 16, 2021","Sonnen battery still running after 28,000 full charge cycles","From pv magazine International
German storage system manufacturer Sonnen has published test results that indicate the longevity of its products after extended use. In laboratory tests, the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells, which are also used in the company’s “solar battery,” reportedly withstood 28,000 charging cycles.
The lifespans of battery storage systems remain an issue for many potential buyers. Sonnen says that it has charged and discharged battery cells at a C rate of one and a depth of discharge of 100% over a period of eight years. This means that a full charge or discharge was completed within an hour. It noted that the test for the batteries was significantly more demanding than its use as a residential storage system.
Over the past few years, it has carried out tests in a laboratory operated by Sonnen in Wildpoldsried, Germany. According to the manufacturer, the iron phosphate battery cells still had 65% of their original capacity. As a result, the cells have not yet reached the end of their lifespans, because for this there must be a sudden drop in capacity, the manufacturer explained.
“The test results achieved so far go beyond the expected service life of the battery technology we use,” said Sonnen Managing Director Oliver Koch. “This is an important quality factor for our customers. And those who have a long-lasting battery also benefit economically for a longer period of time.”
Sonnen also tested modules consisting of 200 cells. It guarantees that the modules will retain 80% of their original capacity after 10,000 cycles. According to its latest tests, the modules retained 83% of their capacity over 10,000 cycles.
DNV GL presents its performance index for batteries, the Battery Scorecard, every year. In the last edition, it checked the cycle stability of various battery types. The company’s experts determined how many cycles a battery had to go through to lose 1% of its capacity. The average was 381 for 22 manufacturers. For iron phosphate batteries, the range was between 135 and 448 cycles. For nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries, the range was 180 to 849 cycles for each percent of capacity lost.
If the same method is applied to Sonnen’s test, a value of 800 cycles per percentage of capacity lost is obtained for the cell. The modules would have a value of 588 cycles.
