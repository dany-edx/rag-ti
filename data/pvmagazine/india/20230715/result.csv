It was, almost, a perfect match. The eight-story building in central Barcelona was exactly what Wallbox wanted. By February 2020, the company headquarters, 30 km away, was getting crowded. “We managed to find a building which checked all the boxes except one – power availability,” says Daniel Utges, Wallbox’s head of energy.
The building only had access to 173 kW of grid electricity but Wallbox needed 300 kW to 400 kW. Testing EVs and chargers is energy intensive. “The utility told us we can solve this problem by investing €500,000 ($536,000) in a new transformer but we thought there are better ways to spend such money,” says Utges.
A year before becoming the first Spanish unicorn (a company worth more than €1 billion) to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Wallbox decided to develop a grid-connected building as a microgrid. It invested around $400,000 into 400 kWp of solar panels, 560 kWh of stationary battery capacity, 23 of its Quasar bi-directional EV chargers, and 23 Nissan Leaf vehicles, each with a 62 kWh battery. “We needed something on top that understands when each of these assets should be consuming or producing energy in real time and this is how Sirius was born,” says Utges.
First unveiled in 2021, Sirius is expected to be released onto the market in Q1 next year. By choosing the greenest and cheapest energy source available, Sirius optimizes building energy consumption and saves money. “Thanks to Sirius we had no blackouts in the building and we are saving more than 50% on our energy bills at the Barcelona headquarters, which were supposed to amount to more than €200,000 per year,” Utges says.
On March 27, some 54% of the building’s 2.4 MWh daily energy consumption was covered by solar and only 16.5% came from the grid, saving around €420. Sirius relies on big data analytics to integrate inputs including real time pricing, weather forecasts, and installation restrictions such as wiring capacity. It does not control loads such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning; lighting; or water heating. “We treat the building as a black box but there is a lot of variability in energy consumption, depending on the days of the week or if the lab is open or closed,” says Utges. “Integrating an artificial intelligence layer would help us learn from the building behavior and improve Sirius by 10%.”
Most EV fleet charging systems are much simpler. Power is split evenly between charging stations without considering user requirements or real-time availability. Business information company BloombergNEF anticipates there will be 77 million EVs by 2025 and 229 million by 2030 and managing their grid impact will become a challenge. Add on-site solar and storage and there is even more for algorithms to balance.
Wallbox is not alone in investigating smart EV charging in a microgrid. Dublin-headquartered power-management company Eaton has commercialized its “buildings-as-a-grid” approach and tested it at its office in Le Mont-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland.
The project harnessed 100 kWp of rooftop solar, a 20 kW/21 kWh battery, 16 alternating-current EV chargers, and a public DC fast charger. “We turned our office building into a real-world testbed to gather statistics about how our buildings-as-a-grid approach performs and achieved outstanding results, including 60% energy cost savings, averaging CHF 1,685 ($1,877) per month,” said Fabrice Roudet, general manager for the energy transition at Eaton, who was referring to the July to December period.
In the United States, Powerflex has deployed around 10,000 chargers with more than 330 MW of solar and around 44 MWh of battery storage on commercial premises. A California Institute of Technology spinout acquired by EDF Renewables in 2019, Powerflex claims its patented software can reduce the cost of electrical system upgrades and peak demand charges by up to 60%, and can enable customers to install up to four times the number of stations than a standard configuration.
“We always take into account the building load,” says Powerflex CEO Raphael Declercq. “We use patterns [e.g. predictable office-building demand] and real-time information [e.g. air conditioning consumption increasing, balanced by reducing EV load]. It is essential to have a comprehensive view when a building and EVs are on the same meter.”
Most EV charging companies are at the early stage of integrating devices with broader on-site power management needs and adding bi-directional charging has been mostly limited to research.
At Wallbox HQ, cars are charged with grid power during the night and discharge electricity to the building during daytime. “We use the power from our batteries in the early morning, when electricity tariffs in Spain are high, and then recharge them with solar power during the day to reduce our electricity consumption from the grid in the late afternoon,” says Utges.
“Our fleet of cars is intended for internal mobility, from the HQ to the factory (5 km), and some for commercial visits, but not to go on a long trip, to Madrid, for example,” he explains. “This can be booked and we can prepare a car for a long a trip as well but it’s probably easier to go to a fast charger here on the premises and fill your car in half an hour, than to use Quasar, that gives you only 7.4 kW.”

The compound undergoes a structural change upon NH3 uptake, allowing for efficient uptake and extraction. “X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that reversible NH3 uptake/extraction originates from a cation/anion exchange reaction,” they wrote in American Chemical Society. “This structural transformation shows the potential to integrate efficient uptake and extraction in a hybrid perovskite compound through chemical reaction.”
Bosch says it is preparing to showcase new hydrogen-related products during its upcoming Tech Day. The German company is developing technologies for the production, compression, storage, and use of hydrogen. It says its main manufacturing site in Feuerbach, Germany, will produce fuel-cell power modules (FCPM) from July. The FCPM weighs more than 500 kilograms, has a surface area of approximately 1.5 square meters, and a total output exceeding 200 kW. Bosch will also unveil a water treatment system, scheduled for launch in 2024. Stefan Hartung, chairman of the Bosch board of management, noted the importance of ultra-pure water for green hydrogen production and highlighted the company’s special-purpose systems for water treatment in remote areas.
HH2E and Foresight Group have completed funding for the green hydrogen production site in Lubmin, Germany, with construction expected to be finished by mid-2025. The project aims for an initial capacity of 100 MW, scalable to more than 1 GW by 2030. HydrogenOne and Foresight signed a final agreement in May to invest in HH2E, which acquired 120 MW capacity of electrolysis equipment from Nel in March. 
FDE says that the HECO2-Plasmalyse Hybride consortium, including FDE, has been selected to promote decarbonated hydrogen usage in Belgium. The consortium aims to build a clean hydrogen production pilot project using Hybrid Plasmalysis technology. The ultimate goal is to establish a plant producing 15,000 tons of hydrogen and 45,000 tons of solid carbon materials. FDE also recently announced the discovery of natural hydrogen in one of the drilled wells, with significant hydrogen concentrations in the Carboniferous formations of the Lorraine mining basin. In May, FDE announced the discovery of natural hydrogen (white hydrogen) in one a previously drilled well.
UK Minister for Energy Efficiency and Green Finance Martin Callanan has confirmed that the hydrogen village trial in Whitby will not proceed due to lack of local support. Discussions are ongoing with NGN regarding the potential trial in Redcar. The rejected project aimed to transition Whitby to hydrogen by 2025, while Redcar remains the sole hydrogen village trial location in the United Kingdom, facilitated by the NGN gas network. Gas distribution network Cadent and British Gas proposed the project in Cheshire, offering residents the choice to participate. The decision raised criticism, with differing opinions on the transition from fossil fuels. Callanan, a Conservative politician, has been vocal in his opposition to the Labour Party’s no-fossil-fuel policies.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/15/mixed-price-signals-for-solar-wafers-narrowing-spread-between-m10-and-g12-wafer-prices/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JULY 15, 2023","Mixed price signals for solar wafers, narrowing spread between M10 and G12 wafer prices","This week, the Mono M10 wafers trended flat after last week’s price notch upwards, reporting in at $0.351 per piece (pc).  Several sources verified this week that the price of Mono M10 wafers has grown to the level reported by OPIS last week, which is approximately CNY2.85 ($0.40)/pc.
One of the factors contributing to the price increase is the decrease in wafer stockpiles, with some inventory shifting to cell producers’ plants. Cell makers have increased wafer purchases in the previous few weeks when wafer prices were low. Fewer than 1 billion pieces of wafers are currently stockpiled at wafer facilities, equivalent to three to five days’ worth of production and regarded as a low inventory level, according to a source from a large wafer manufacturer.
Additionally, manufacturers are trying to recover profit now by boosting prices as the year’s second half starts, and so improve this period’s financial report, a source explained.

On the other hand, the prices of Mono G12 wafers saw a week-on-week fall of 5.75% to $0.475/pc, marking their lowest point of the year, according to OPIS’ assessment.
According to a source from the wafer segment, the price reduction of Mono G12 wafers appears to be a pricing strategy rather than a price adjustment in response to supply and demand in the market. The price of G12 wafers per W must be comparable to or even lower than the price of M10 wafers per Watt if manufacturers are to emphasize the cost advantage of G12 wafers and grow G12’s market share.
While polysilicon prices are low, wafer manufacturers have accelerated their purchases of the material and raised operating rates, with the typical operating rate of wafer businesses having climbed to 80–100%, several sources claimed.
According to a source, overall wafer output is anticipated to reach 52 GW in July based on an average operating rate of 85%, representing a month-on-month growth of roughly 15%. Another source claimed that since at least two major wafer producers will release new capacity in the second half of this year, wafer market fundamentals will remain dominated by oversupply in the near future.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
