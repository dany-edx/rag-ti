Supplying 1.5 GW of round-the-clock RE power requires Serentica Renewables to commission 4 GW of wind and solar capacities. The offtakers are multiple industrial customers with whom Serentica has signed power delivery agreements
Serentica will set up these solar and wind capacities across India, supplemented with balancing solutions like energy storage. These capacities will likely be deployed in the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan, where Serentica has secured connectivity to the inter-state transmission system (ISTS).
Established in 2022, Serentica Renewables (India) aims to provide assured renewable energy to large-scale, energy-intensive industries through a combination of solar, wind, energy storage, and balancing solutions. The company has already secured investments worth $650 million from global investor KKR.

The inverters range from 5 kW to 25 kW with a rated input voltage of 600 V. The maximum input voltage is 1,100 V.
With a maximum input current of 16 A (for 5-12 kW inverters) and 32 A (15-25 kW models), the inverters are said to be the best compatible with bifacial PV modules.
The peak efficiency is 99.8%, while the Euro efficiency is 97.8%. Total harmonic distortion is less than 3%.
The inverters come in a lightweight and compact design measuring 370x480x183.5 mm and weighing 17-21 kg.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/20/passive-solar-module-cooling-tech-based-on-pcm-heat-sink-fins-water/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"DECEMBER 20, 2023","Passive solar module cooling tech based on PCM, heat sink fins, water","An international research team has designed a novel cooling system for PV modules involving a phase change material (PCM), heat sink fins, and water. The experimental system utilizes passive cooling, as it uses the latent heat of fusion of PCM and the latent heat of evaporation of water.
PCMs can absorb, store, and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
“The drawback of the PV-PCM system is mitigated with the use of heat sink fins, which extract the heat efficiently from PCM. Meanwhile, water is still utilized to accelerate the heat transfer process via energy storage and evaporation,” said the researchers.
Presented in the paper “An experimental investigation on coalescing the potentiality of PCM, fins and water to achieve sturdy cooling effect on PV panels,” published in Applied Energy, the system prototype consists of a 5 W polycrystalline PV panel embedded with HS 29 PCM packed to around 0.02 m thickness.
The HS 29 PCM, which has a melting temperature of 29 C, was chosen based on the location and system thermal characteristics. A flat plate of heat sink fins, measuring 21 cm × 21 cm, is adhered to the PCM bottom surface. The system is placed inside a plastic container, with 3.3 liters of water covering the fins.
That system was tested against a reference 5 W polycrystalline PV panel without any cooling. The experiment was done in the southern Indian city of Madurai in early October 2020. Electrical, thermal, and efficiency characteristics were measured daily from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at 30-minute intervals. Using a set of equations, some of the results were scaled up for a large-scale 1 MW PV system.
According to the research team, the per-day power output in W of the proposed configuration was 8.12% and 9.39% higher than the reference panel. Also, the maximum power obtained from the cooled panel was 20.25% higher than the reference panel.
“The output power of the reference PV panel ranges from 2.579 W to 3.062 W on October 3 while it ranges from 2.785 W to 3.538 W on October 4,” the researchers noted. “On the other hand, the output power of the proposed configuration ranges from 2.538 W to 3.336 W on October 3 while it ranges from 2.880 W to 3.864 W on October 4.”

On average, the novel system helped reduce the panel temperature by 10.14 C. The highest temperature difference, 16.7 C, was obtained at 10:30 a.m. on October 4. When scaled up to a 1 MW plant, the scientists found the drop in temperature to extend its lifetime from 25 years to 31.
“The proposed PV cooling scheme shows a 9.4% additional CO2 reduction compared to normal solar PV,” the researchers added. “A sum of 2130.578 Tonnes of CO2 reduction can be achieved using a 1 MW solar PV with the proposed cooling technique.” They also added that the cooling strategy renders 9.4% energy saving per day, which, scaling to a large plant, means 366.5 MW per year.
Regarding efficiency in relative terms, the researchers found the proposed system to enhance it by 20.3% on the first day and 13% on the second day. However, the average efficiency enhancement ranged from 0.78% to 1.08%.
“The designed cooling system can target residential solar PV panels,” the academics concluded. “This pilot study can also be provisioned with a heat collecting system from water to form a PV-T system. Further, this research paves the way for exploring the feasibility of employing this cooling approach in floating panels since they float on still-water bodies.”
The research group comprises scientists from Australia’s University of Queensland, USA’s University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and India’s Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/20/p-type-perc-solar-modules-now-selling-in-europe-for-e0-10-w-to-e0-115-w/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",P-type PERC solar modules now selling in Europe for €0.10/W to €0.115/W,"From pv magazine Global
Prices of p-type PERC solar modules in Europe are currently approaching the €0.10/W threshold, according to Leen van Bellen, business development manager Europe for Search4Solar, a Netherlands-based purchasing platform for solar panels, inverters and battery solutions.
“Prices for p-type products today are between €0.100 to €0.115 and we think that the magic limit below €0.10 will be reached in Q1 2024,” he told pv magazine. “Stocks will then shrink further and then prices will slowly recover in mid-Q2 2024.”
Van Bellen said these prices are for a minimum purchase of one container.
“Considering the newer types, the price goes toward €0.20/W,” he said.
Van Bellen said the number of modules stockpiled in European warehouses is lower than commonly thought. He questioned the amount announced by Norwegian research firm Rystad Energy in July, when it said 80 GW of solar modules were still unsold.
 “Assuming 400 W panels, 80 GW is the equivalent of 240,000 containers,” van Bellen said. “There are now 40 tier 1 manufacturers and no one we speak to has more than a few hundred to sometimes several thousand containers. Non-tier-1 manufacturers have up to several dozen. The medium-sized distributors have fifty to one hundred containers, and the large distributors have one hundred to two hundred and fifty. If we add up all the findings and inquiries, we arrive at 50,000 to 80,000 containers.”
Van Bellen said that Search4Solar doesn’t have warehouses or stocks, but it works with the stocks of manufacturers, distributors, and installers.
“This means we are kept well informed and therefore have an accurate insight into European stocks,” he said.
He said that manufacturers will likely become more careful in the future about the amounts of stock they send to Europe.
“It is difficult to predict whether there will be a similar ‘normal’ stock level in 2024,” he said, noting that distributors and installers will also probably purchase more carefully. “But at times of scarcity things will go back to normal. It remains a matter of supply and demand.”
Search4Solar claims to have approximately 8,000 registered members throughout Europe.
“Search4Solar is in terms of business model comparable to Bol.com or Amazon,” said Van Bellen.
