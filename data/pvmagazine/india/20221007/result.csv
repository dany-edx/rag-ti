Darshan Rana, chairman and managing director of Rana Group, told pv magazine, “Erisha is currently working on developing new technologies for lithium battery cell manufacturing. The company is in discussion with foreign investors to raise funds. We aim to make Erisha E Mobility a unicorn (reach a valuation of $1 billion) within three years.”
Erisha E Mobility will also develop hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen combustion engines as it plans to roll out hydrogen vehicles.
Rana said they have entered into a joint venture with a German company for hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen containers, and hydrogen system integration into the vehicle. Initially, hydrogen fuel cells will be imported. Local manufacturing in India will start within two-three years.
Erisha E Mobility today launched an electric cargo loader, electric delivery van, and electric passenger vehicle (three-wheeler auto rickshaw) in the L5 category, and EV charging stations.
“Phase 2 will see the development of commercial vehicles with capacity ranging from 1.5 to 20 tonnes. Phase 3 will expand the company’s vision in producing electric two-wheelers in slow as well as high-speed domains. Phase 4 will further strengthen the company’s position as a solution provider for all EV segments by launching electric buses in the 7m, 9m, and 12m range. We are also committed to developing the ecosystem for electric charging stations pan India to support electric vehicles,” said Rana.

The unit is spread across over 21,000 sq.ft. land on the outskirts of Bengaluru, and employs a chemical-free Integrated Carbothermal Reduction process to extract valuable materials out of dead lithium-ion batteries.
“The unit is equipped with intensive quality control and material handling capabilities in order to facilitate and manage ‘waste-as-ore’ concept-based recycling of hazardous end-of-life batteries and products. Its in-house Quality Control Lab constantly ensures the highest quality of output materials,” stated the company.
In the near future, the unit will also be doubling down as an on-site R&D center to enable improvements in yield, purity and the overall process efficiency for Metastable.
Following the commissioning of the new facility, Metastable Materials is now looking to actively ramp up its production capabilities to achieve its optimal capacity of processing 5 tonnes of raw materials (through urban mining) per day over the next few quarters. In a year, Metastable’s new unit will be capable of handling up to 1,500 tons of batteries.
Metastable Materials claims the unit is one of the safest recycling facilities in the entire world, as it is designed to produce zero effluents and completely eliminate fire hazards that are usually associated with recycling of lithium-ion batteries. It also said its battery treatment methodology significantly reduces capital expenditure and operational expenditure in comparison to the conventional battery recycling practices, and offers a recovery rate of over 90% for the constituent materials.
“With this unit expected to be handling up to 1,500 tons at its full operational capacity, it would work as a training ground for the extended Metastable team to gain the much-needed experience and practical exposure in the recycling of LiBs. This unit shall also enable Metastable Materials to be equipped well-enough with market experience to extend its services across the globe,” said Shubham Vishvakarma, founder and chief of process engineering at Metastable Materials.

The product, called Microgrid Energy Corridor, also allows interconnection with other microgrids through AC coupling.
“The idea of a scalable microgrid business is at the core of this product’s design philosophy,” stated the company.
The product eliminates the need for an array junction box, AC distribution box or other protections as all of these features are built into it. It supports almost all types of external storage technologies like lead-acid, gel, lithium as well as flow batteries. It also has an in-built interface for a diesel generator to charge the batteries and cater to loads. The inverter is Internet of Things (IOT)-enabled and allows multilevel remote monitoring and control.
The product supports both AC coupling and DC coupling, and AC-AC power transfer for connecting multiple microgrids. “It’s reliable and has inbuilt redundancy in design to ensure zero downtime. It is indigenously designed and developed with all its components like transformers, cabinets, power stack PCBs, and software designed in India,” as per the company.

Germany’s Creaton and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) specialist Autarq have designed a new kind of solar tile.
The new “Creaton PV-Autarq” product is based on Creaton’s Domino black tile, which is a smooth, flat brick that acts as a carrier for small monocrystalline PV elements supplied by Autarq. The tile features a 3.2 mm, hardened single pane of safety glass on the front side.
The panel has an operating temperature between -40 C to 85 C and can withstand mechanical stress levels of up to 5,400 pascals. Longevity and durability are certified according to IEC 61215 and safety according to IEC 61730. The components have a guarantee of up to 25 years.
“The Creaton PV-Autarq roof tile system has a modular structure and is therefore also perfectly suitable for complex roof areas,” said Creaton Sales Director Florian Scherr.
The solar roof tiles can be installed in combination with original tiles. The size of the PV area can be designed flexibly. The tiles are individually connected to one another by plug-in connections when they are deployed. All connection cables and plug contacts remain hidden under the bricks and are protected from the weather.

French recycling group Soren (formerly PV Cycle France) and Envie 2E Aquitaine have inaugurated a recycling center for PV modules in Saint-Loubès, France. Envie 2E Aquitaine was selected following a call for tenders launched by Soren.
The €2 million ($1.9 million) plant will be able to process 4,000 tons of panels per year and will employ 25 people. The facility is the first of its kind in Europe, as it uses a hot blade delamination process. This makes it possible to recover flat glass and isolate the polymer layer containing the cells, rather than relying on grinding, which is the main process used in recycling plants.
The technology comes from Japan-based NPC Incorporated. The consortium claims the plant will make it possible to recycle 95% of the materials used in solar panels.
“This extends the lifecycle of the components. It is a way of considering recycling no longer as a way of recycling waste but as a way of producing raw materials,” said Nicolas Defrenne, the director of Soren.
Soren launched a tender in February 2021 to set up three new facilities to recycle solar panels in France. Two of the installations have been in service since June 2021.
*The article was updated on Oct. 4 to add that NPC Incorporated is the supplier of the hot blade delamination technology.
