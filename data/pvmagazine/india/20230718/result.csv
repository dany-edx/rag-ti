Research by NREL on bifacial perovskite solar cells has resulted in bifaciality of 91% to 93%, leading it to conclude that bifacial perovskites could be a preferable pathway for a lower levelized cost of electricity. It published the results in Joule.
Perovskites hold promise because of their low production costs, and their thinness allows them to be deposited on most surfaces. While challenges remain with the stability and longevity of perovskites, new efficiency records have been achieved month after month in recent years.
Past iterations of bifacial perovskites have struggled to keep up with monofacial cells, which currently have a record efficiency of 26%. Bifacial cells are also more expensive to produce than their single-face counterparts. The NREL researchers noted that for the technology to compete, a bifacial cell should have a front-side efficiency close to the best-performing monofacial cell, and that the bifaciality rating should be close to 100% of the front-side efficiency.
In the newly produced single-junction NREL bifacial cell, an efficiency of 23% was recorded on the front, with the back side achieving a bifaciality of 91% to 93% of that efficiency level. The research team said that bifacial cells could generate 10% to 20% more power than single-face cells.
Before constructing the record-breaking cell, researchers used optical and electrical simulations to determine the ideal thickness. The front layer had to be thick enough to absorb most of the photons from a certain part of the solar spectrum, but a perovskite layer that is too thick can block the photons.
On the back of the cell, the NREL team had to determine the ideal thickness of the rear electrode to minimize resistive loss. The team noted the balance between the resistive and optical losses needs to be considered. The transparent oxide rear electrode needs to be sufficiently thick to minimize the resistive loss, but it also needs to be sufficiently thin to minimize parasitic absorption.
The research team found that an ideal thickness for a perovskite layer is around 850 nanometers, which is incredibly thin. For reference, a human hair is roughly 70,000 nanometers thick.
Albedo, or the reflectivity of the surface beneath the solar cell, impacts the output of the backside perovskites. The bifacial output power was measured at 28.5 mW per square centimeter with an albedo of 0.3 and 30.1 mW per square centimeter for an albedo of 0.5.
This research was funded by the US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office.

The two parties signed an agreement on this collaboration recently.
“The collaboration with IIT Kanpur is part of a national initiative in sustainable energy led by IIT Kanpur to develop new testing laboratories to conduct research into battery storage, new chemistry development and thermal characteristics. The research will support joint projects with industry partners on protocol development and technical advisories,” read a joint release by H.E.L Group and IIT Kanpur.
H.E.L develops and manufactures innovative laboratory tools for process optimization, safety, and scale-up. It will provide IIT Kanpur with its Iso-BTC+ non-abusive and non-destructive isothermal calorimeter designed to characterize thermal behavior of battery cells during charge and discharge testing, leading to enhanced performance, lifespan and safety.
Raju Kumar Gupta, professor at IIT Kanpur, said, the Iso-BTC+ will enable IIT Kanpur to measure heat release profiles of large batteries during charge and discharge. The equipment will give extremely tight control of the battery temperature and will enable IIT Kanpur to obtain thermal characteristics of cells during operation.
“The software-integrated battery cycling function will allow us to understand how charge/discharge profiles affect heat generation. The iso-BTC+ will give us a complete picture of heat generation by batteries during normal and extended use conditions which is vital for maximizing safety and performance,” said Gupta.
Rajeev Kumria, general manager, H.E.L India, added, “Poor understanding of battery thermal behavior can lead to unsafe batteries being integrated into devices with inadequate safety precautions in place, and safe batteries being used inefficiently – leading to shortened product lifetimes and poor energy management. As we strive for a more sustainable world, batteries are becoming more prevalent in, for example, electric vehicles and e-scooters, and it is imperative that we continue to research and develop efficient and safe cells appropriate for all environments and applications. As such, we are delighted to be working with IIT Kanpur on this important initiative to help India transition into a more sustainable energy environment, and look forward to providing the latest technology, and sharing our experience in developing battery testing and process safety tools.”

And while the number of deals went down, total funding went up.
Total corporate funding, including venture capital (VC) funding, public market, and debt financing, was up 54% year-over-year (YoY) compared to $12 billion raised in the first half of 2022. The number of deals dropped from 91 in the same period last year to 80 in the first half of this year, a decrease of 12%.

“Even amidst the tightening financial market conditions and high interest rates, the solar industry remained strong in the first half of the year. Besides AI, cleantech is one of the few sectors still attracting VC interest. Demand due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is so strong that even interest rate-sensitive public market and debt financing in solar was up year-over-year. The lack of easy money, however, affected M&A activity negatively,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.
Global VC funding rose 3% YoY with 33 deals worth $3.8 billion compared to 53 deals in the same period last year, worth $3.7 billion.
Top five VC deals:

Developers and independent power producers (IPPs) acquired 5.5 GW of solar projects, whereas utilities acquired just under 4 GW. Insurance companies, pension funds, energy trading businesses, industrial conglomerates, and IT firms acquired another 2.1 GW. Oil and gas companies acquired 1.8 GW of projects, and investment firms acquired 407 MW.
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) were down in the first half of 2023, with 116 project acquisitions for 25.5 GW of solar projects compared to 148 project acquisitions totaling 37.8 GW in the first half of 2022. The largest deal was by Brookfield Renewable, which agreed to acquire Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale commercial renewables business in the U.S. The business comprised close to 3.5 GW of utility solar, wind and energy storage projects, and was acquired for cash consideration of $1.1 billion and the assumption of $1.7 billion total debt.
Solar public market financing in the first half of 2023 totaled $6.7 billion in 14 deals, which was 103% higher than the $3.3 billion financed in eight deals in the first half of 2022. Solar debt financing activity in the first half of 2023 reached $8 billion in 33 deals, a 60% increase compared to 1H 2022, when $5 billion was raised in 30 deals.

Norsun said it will use the funds to quadruple the capacity of its n-type mono wafer and ingot plant to 3 GW in Årdal, western Norway, powered by hydroelectric capacity. Wafer production is very energy-intensive and the use of hydropower significantly reduces the ecological footprint of PV modules. The Oslo-based company currently has a production capacity of 1 GW.
“The EU sees NorSun and Norway as a strategic resource to rebuild the European solar value chain and has therefore chosen to provide direct support to this industry in Norway. 3 GW of new capacity provides a quadrupling of current capacity,” the company said in a statement.
Norsun said it is aso preparing the technical and commercial details on a 5 GW plant in the United States, in addition to its Norwegian facility.
Midsummer said it will invest the funds in a 200 MW CIGS module plant near Stockholm. The company will deploy its own DUO production equipment at the facility.
“Midsummer makes the thin film deposition equipment ourselves, but back-end equipment like screenprinters, testers, sorters, tabbing and stringers, will be purchased from third party suppliers,” Sven Lindström, CEO, Midsummer, told pv magazine.
Midsummer, which specializes in building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and rooftop modules, also has a 50 MW factory under construction in Italy. It raised about a third of the financing from national grants and low-interest loans.
“We expect to be ready to sign with EU by the end of the year. Locations in Sweden have been focused around the area of lake Mälaren,” Lindström said.
The EU Innovation Fund funded several other PV manufacturing expansion projects recently, such as the 3 GW project by Enel Green Power in Italy. Meyer Burger, the Swiss heterojunction cell and module manufacturer, also secured last week €200 million to support 3.5 GW of expansion projects, reported pv magazine. The funding agreements are expected to be completed by the end of the year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/18/sodium-ion-battery-fleet-to-grow-to-10-gwh-by-2025/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ELECTRIC VEHICLES,EV BATTERIES,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"JULY 18, 2023",Sodium-ion battery fleet to grow to 10 GWh by 2025,"While still in its infancy, sodium-ion technology represents a viable alternative to lithium-ion battery technologies. With better raw material costs, enhanced safety, and better sustainability credentials, sodium-ion holds a promise of easing the strain on lithium-ion’s supply chains.
As global commercialization efforts for sodium-ion batteries intensify, IDTechEx forecasts that by 2025, around 10 GWh of sodium-ion batteries will be installed as significant manufacturing capacities come online and existing lithium-ion lines are converted to sodium-ion production.
At a CAGR of 27%, sodium-ion is forecast to grow to just under 70 GWh in 2033, says the UK-based market research company. “There may be potential for more rapid growth than forecast once the technology is trusted, qualified, bankable, and available,” it added.
Earlier forecast from Wood Mackenzie is more conservative. According to the US-owned Scottish data company, sodium-ion batteries are expected to replace some of the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) share in passenger electric vehicles and energy storage, reaching 20 GWh by 2030 in the base-case scenario.
Presently, production is mainly limited to pilot plants, and a few smaller factories are starting up. However, IDTechEx calculates that “the capacities that have been publicly announced by various raw material manufacturers alone add up to well over 100 GWh over the next three years.”
IDTechEx said in its latest report that it has identified around 15 companies developing their own Na-ion battery technologies. It has also analyzed patents and found that China is taking the lead once again.
For instance, battery industry heavyweight CATL rolled out its first-generation sodium-ion battery in 2021, with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg. Earlier this year, it confirmed that China’s Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
HiNa Battery, which was spun off from the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017, became the world’s first company to switch on a gigawatt-hour sodium-ion battery production line last year. It also revealed plans to expand the capacity to 5 GWh.
Last week, BYD’s subsidiary FinDreams said it had found a partner in Huaihai Holding Group to begin producing sodium-ion batteriesin the Xuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone in the Jiangsu province. In a press release, the companies said the joint venture will be the world’s largest supplier of sodium-ion batteries for mini and micro vehicles.
Until now, sodium-ion batteries have mainly been used in electric two-wheelers and for stationary energy storage due to their lower energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries. Sodium-ion is three times heavier than its lithium counterpart and has a lower redox potential, which results in at least 30% lower energy density.
Sodium-ion batteries are quoted to be between 20% and up to 40% cheaper, but the challenge is bringing the technology to scale. Therefore, significant saving over lithium-ion batteries is unlikely, at least initially.
According to IDTechEx research, the average cell cost for Na-ion batteries is $87/kWh taking different chemistries into account. By the end of the decade, the production cost of Na-ion battery cells using primarily iron and manganese is likely to bottom out at around $40/kWh, which would be around $50/kWh at the pack level, the company calculates.

Growth is being driven by push towards decarbonisation, increased ESG compliance requirements, stricter renewable purchase obligations (RPO) and increasing grid power prices.  
Annual solar capacity addition in the corporate segment touched a high of 5.3 GW in 2022, taking total estimated corporate solar capacity to 18 GW.
Both open access and rooftop solar have become popular procurement routes for consumers because of their low cost and operational simplicity. Wind power adoption has lagged in comparison because of the limited availability of suitable sites and higher costs.

Fig. 1: : Solar capacity addition in the corporate segment, MW
Across states, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu are the leaders because of their large industrial base, high solar radiation levels, and relatively easy availability of suitable land. While Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have taken the lead in open-access solar, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have raced ahead in rooftop solar.

Fig. 2: Corporate solar power capacity and penetration by state, December 2022
One of the most important determinants of market progress in different states is the local policy and regulatory framework, which varies highly across the states, often in an unpredictable manner. Many states initially offered incentives to captive solar projects but as the market grew, the policy landscape has become somewhat unfavorable because of these projects’ negative financial impact on DISCOMs.
Rooftop solar remains one of the most attractive routes for corporate entities with short installation times and no need for complex land acquisition or lengthy approval process for grid connectivity.
As most states have withdrawn net metering connectivity for rooftop solar installations, consumers have shifted to ‘behind-the-meter’ mode.
The market faces additional policy-related challenges in many states. Haryana, Karnataka, and Chhattisgarh do not allow net-metered installations for open-access consumers, while Gujarat and Maharashtra don’t allow consumers to use open-access and ‘behind-the-meter’ modes at the same time.
Some states including Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu have also introduced grid support charges as high as INR 2.33 ($0.028)/kWh.
Open-access solar is the primary avenue for corporate consumers to meet most of their renewable power requirements but many states are still reluctant to provide approvals for such projects. Phasing out of incentives and increase in grid charges has partly eroded the cost benefit. Some states are even levying additional taxes and charges like grid support charges, parallel operating charge, captive tax, and state tax.
Nonetheless, the landed cost of captive open-access solar power is still 8-53% lower than variable grid power in all key industrial states.
Encouragingly, the central government has taken note of the strong growth potential of the corporate market and tried to bring policy consistency and stability. Issuance of Green Open Access Rules is expected to be a game changer although implementation timeline remains uncertain. Proposed changes include relaxation of eligibility criteria, exemption from Additional Surcharge, use of the standard methodology for calculation of various grid charges, and monthly banking.
Many states including Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and West Bengal have already adopted these rules, while Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, and Telangana are also proposing to do the same.
Another exciting development in the market is the opening up of new procurement avenues for corporate consumers, who can now buy renewable power directly from the DISCOMs using the green tariff route, or go on the green power exchange or just buy various internationally traded renewable energy certificates.
These new routes provide a higher degree of procurement flexibility to consumers but have their unique commercial and regulatory challenges.
Virtual power purchase agreements are another emerging alternative route wherein consumers, otherwise unable to directly procure renewable power, can access green attributes through a financial settlement mechanism.
Falling costs and improving policy landscape are expected to provide a further thrust in the coming years to the corporate solar market. We expect the annual market size to double over the next five years. The bulk of the growth is expected to come from under-penetrated states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh, while Maharashtra and Karnataka will also witness substantial capacity addition.
The upcoming Clean Energy Ministerial meetings in July 2023 provide a great opportunity for India to showcase its leadership in this market and learn about evolving supply chains and market mechanisms.
