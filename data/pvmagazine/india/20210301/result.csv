Out of the new quarterly addition, 77% (998 MW) was utility-scale solar and 23% (300 MW) rooftop—according to Bridge To India’s latest quarterly report India Solar Compass Q4 2020. 
With this, India’s total installed PV capacity reached 41,689 MW as of December 31, 2020. This included 34,183 MW of utility-scale, 6,430 MW rooftop and 1,076 MW off-grid. 
The report stated the fourth-quarter utility-scale addition (998 MW) was marginally below the analyst’s estimate. “Project commissioning was up 55% quarter-on-quarter but increase in execution cost slowed down progress,” it added.
A rise in module and inverter prices increased the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) costs. “Mono-crystalline module prices increased to US cents 23.5/W, up from US cents 21/W in September 2020. Central inverter prices also increased marginally to INR 1.30/W from INR 1.20/W. Total EPC prices shot up to INR 30.64/W due to an increase in equipment prices and a 20% increase in the balance-of-system (BOS) costs,” as per the report. 
However, the report expects construction to gather pace in the current year, leading to utility-scale solar addition exceeding 2 GW in each of the first two quarters—the highest since 3833 MW achieved in Q1 2018. The installations are forecast to be 2,040 MW in the first quarter of 2021 and 2,340 MW in the second quarter. 
The rooftop solar market is also expected to pick up the pace with expected capacity addition of 475 MW in Q1 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/01/siemens-completes-the-acquisition-of-cs-electric-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 1, 2021",Siemens completes the acquisition of C&S Electric in India,"Siemens today announced it has completed the acquisition of electrical equipment manufacturer C&S Electric in India after receiving regulatory approval from the Competition Commission of India in August last year. The acquisition comprises the Indian operations of C&S Electric’s low-voltage switchgear components and panels, low- and medium-voltage power bush bars as well as protection and metering devices businesses.
As per the agreement, Siemens acquired around 99.22% of the equity share capital of C&S Electric Limited from its promoters for INR 2,100 crore.
The acquisition will enable Siemens to address the competitive infrastructure low-voltage market in India while creating a manufacturing hub to source low-voltage products for export to competitive markets globally.
Certain other businesses such as engineering, procurement, and construction shall be retained by the existing promoters of C&S Electric, which has five operational renewable energy (four wind and one solar power) projects with a combined capacity of 174 MW.
Siemens India focuses on power generation and distribution, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, and automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries. It also supplies smart mobility solutions for rail and road transport and infrastructure solutions for Smart Cities.
C&S manufactures a range of electrical switchgear, power protection, and electrical distribution products. It also has an electrical contracting business that performs turnkey solutions for industrial and commercial electrification, substations, and power plants. Besides, C&S is engaged in the design and execution of grid-connected renewable power plants.
C&S Electric has five operational RE (four wind and one solar power) projects with a combined capacity of 174 MW. The 18 MW Ramnathapuram project in Tamil Nadu is the company’s first venture into solar power. It was undertaken through Crescent Power Limited, a CESC subsidiary, and was commissioned in January 2016.

The revised deadline now stands as March 11.
UPNEDA also reduced the tariff ceiling to INR 3.00/kWh in a pre-bid meeting from INR 3.25/kWh set earlier. The tariff shall be applicable for the 25-year power purchase agreement duration.
The developers have requested to maintain the maximum tariff at INR 3.25/kWh considering the recent increase in prices of modules, inverters, cable, structure, copper, etc.
The tender inviting global bids was issued on January 29. The projects—to be set up on a build-own-operate basis—shall come up in the Jalaun District’s four locations (225 MW) and Kanpur Dehat (50 MW) in Uttar Pradesh Solar Park.
The projects shall be awarded based on international competitive bidding followed by reverse auction.
The Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL), on behalf of State Discoms, shall enter into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the successful bidder for a period of 25 years.
Developers must quote a single tariff for all the projects applied for, which shall be applicable for the entire PPA period.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/01/australian-firm-launches-36-kw-120-kwh-storage-system-made-of-second-life-ev-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 1, 2021",Australian firm launches 36 kW/120 kWh storage system made of second-life EV batteries,"From pv magazine International
Australia-based Relectrify has announced plans to target utility, commercial, and industrial customer applications with the initial release of its ReVolve battery energy storage product, a modular 120 kWh system that uses second-life Nissan Leaf EV battery packs.
The ReVolve battery energy storage system (BESS) is fully integrated with the company’s cell-level battery management system (BMS), inbuilt inverter, and control system. It is designed for installations in the 120 kWh to 2 MWh range.
Relectrify CEO Valentin Muenzel said each three-phase unit provides grid-compliant 400-480 Vac output, with 120 kWh of capacity and 36 kVA of continuous power. The units are suitable for both grid-connected and off-grid applications.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) said Relectrify, which has been working with American Electric Power and Nissan North America on a pilot project, will now finalize development and undertake certifications ahead of the deployment of 20 ReVolve battery units across C&I applications throughout Australia.
“In some ways, we didn’t want to develop this product, but the market really pulled it out of us,” Muenzel said. “Our pre-sales interest in the product has been very wide, from community battery storage applications, utilities looking for back-up and outage support for weak rural networks, and peak shaving for EV charge installs, to construction and mining services firms interested in stand-alone power supply and genset diesel fuel reduction.”
Muenzel said Relectrify’s BMS+Inverter technology – which avoids the need for standalone inverters – means the ReVolve is truly competitive price-wise, coming in 30% to 50% lower than comparable products on the market, while offering an expected lifetime of 3,000 cycles. And at a roundtrip AC-to-AC efficiency of close to 90%, he said the second-life BESS compares strongly against new industrial storage systems.
“The storage market needs affordable battery storage, and we are thrilled to achieve this market-leading competitiveness with this product from the get-go,” Muenzel said. “With Relectrify’s cell-level technology seeing increasingly widespread use, we look forward to working with industry leaders to co-develop future products using second-life or new batteries, including for residential, commercial, industrial and grid applications.”
Muenzel acknowledged that the launch is an important milestone for the fledgling company. But he said the validation of a high-performing second-life system at a strongly competitive price-point is the much larger milestone.
EV batteries are often considered to have reached end-of-life when they have degraded to 80% of their initial capacity. However, Relectrify is determined to demonstrate the second-life battery remains a valuable and useful asset in stationary storage applications.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project will help to reduce costs and improve pathways for battery storage to be installed at commercial scale, particularly in industrial settings.
“Battery storage is already playing a crucial role in supporting the transition to renewable energy within industry, however, we need to do more to make it commercially viable,” Miller said. “Second-life batteries have significant potential to drive down costs, and Relectrify’s battery management and inverter technology can provide what is needed to transform them into valuable assets for businesses looking to make the switch.”
