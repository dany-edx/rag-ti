The shift to EVs is not only driven by growing environmental consciousness and stringent emission regulations but also technological advancements that make EVs more appealing to consumers. However, the widespread adoption of EVs is contingent on the development of a robust and accessible charging infrastructure. As we embark on this electric highway, let’s delve into the growth in EV infrastructure and the challenges that lay ahead.
One cannot discuss the EV revolution without acknowledging the exponential growth in EV infrastructure over the past decade. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of public EV charging points worldwide grew by almost 60% in 2019 alone, signifying a major leap forward.
Much of this expansion can be attributed to public and private sector investments into charging infrastructure, driven by the recognition that EVs are vital in combating climate change and promoting sustainable mobility. For example, in the United States, the Biden administration has pledged to deploy 500,000 new public charging outlets by 2030. Similarly, in Europe, the EU aims to install a million public charging points by the same year.
Notably, private sector investments have played a critical role in this growth. These investments have led to innovative solutions, such as high-speed charging stations that can recharge an EV battery in less than 30 minutes, and wireless charging systems that offer convenience and ease of use. We’ve also seen the emergence of smart charging systems, which allow EVs to communicate with the power grid, scheduling charging during off-peak hours to reduce load and lower costs.
Moreover, businesses have seized the opportunity to integrate charging infrastructure into their operations. Many retail stores, restaurants, and workplaces now offer EV charging, turning the necessity of charging into a value-added service.
Despite these promising developments, the road to widespread EV adoption is still fraught with obstacles. The growth of EV infrastructure faces several challenges, some of which are highlighted below.
To address these challenges, we need a multi-pronged approach. Governments, businesses, and individuals must collaborate to create an ecosystem that supports the growth of EV infrastructure.
Policy incentives can stimulate investment in charging infrastructure, while regulations can enforce the standardization of charging systems. Technological advancements can improve grid capacity and charging speed, alleviating concerns about range anxiety. Education and awareness campaigns can shift public perception and promote the adoption of EVs.
Additionally, the integration of renewable energy sources into the charging infrastructure can further enhance the sustainability of EVs. For instance, solar-powered charging stations can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, making the charging process as green as the vehicles it powers.
In conclusion, the journey on the electric highway is still in its early stages. While the growth in EV infrastructure is impressive, we must overcome numerous challenges to realize the full potential of electric mobility. However, with concerted efforts and innovative solutions, we can build an infrastructure that fuels the transition to a sustainable and electrified future.

In the study “Feasibility study of solar photovoltaic/grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system with pumped storage hydropower system using abandoned open cast coal mine: A case study in India,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage, researchers from the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology investigated the business case of a similar approach for a mine located on the bank of India’s Godavari River, in the Karimnagar district.
“Our work is mainly concerned with pre-feasibility study,” corresponding author, Ambati Bhimaraju, told pv magazine. “The cost of the system is estimated based on some reference journals.” The use of abandoned mines for such mechanical storage is not new, but the novelty of the research is its use of an open-cast coal mine, which is essentially an enormous crater.
The system described in the study is based on a classic pumped hydro storage system, in which surplus energy created by the PV is used instead to pump water from a lower reservoir to a higher one, that in turn uses a hydropower turbine to create energy in times of low solar power generation or at night.
The proposed system configuration considers the river as the upper reservoir, which they say results in considerable savings on construction costs. The researchers assessed the cost of such a project at $188 million, where $91 million is invested in the solar plant and $85 million is devoted to the pumped storage hydro-power plant (PSHP).
The solar plant is assumed to have a maximum capacity of 50 MW and to devote around one-fourth of the energy it generates to the pumped hydro station.
According to the calculation of the scientists, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of this project in India may be $0.2693/kWh. They also considered unexpected changes and said that in the case of a 10% solar panel outage, the LCOE rises by 19% to $0.320/kWh. In the case of a 10% increase in CapEx, the LCOE is adjusted to $0.3177/kWh, while in the case of a 10% reduction in CapEx, the price drops to $0.2491/kWh.
“The positive net present value (NPV) of 16.408 million USD indicates that the system is economically viable, making the proposed project financially feasible in the chosen case study location,” the paper notes. “PV-PSHP system is a feasible and scalable solution for fulfilling future electrical needs at a selected site, and the suggested method in this work successfully executed the considerable cost-effective solution.”

The proposed mechanical energy storage system is for demonstration purposes. It will presumably be a solid gravity energy storage system as the tender document suggests the system will be designed to convert electrical power into potential energy for storage and then back to electrical power on demand.
In a solid gravity energy storage system, heavy objects such as concrete blocks are lifted against the earth’s gravitational field through electromechanical equipment. The electrical power that drives the electromechanical equipment to lift the weight to a certain height is stored as gravitational potential energy. The weights can be lowered to release power when it is needed.
NTPC stated its Talcher Thermal Power Station has an existing boiler steel structure of around 50-meter height, which will be repurposed to install the mechanical energy storage system. In this design of mechanical storage system planned to be implemented at NTPC Talcher Thermal Power Station, it is envisaged to have a few concrete/ash blocks hanging from a beam at 50-meter height which will fall one after the other in a controlled manner (constant velocity) without any time lag between the falls ensuring continuous power generation.
The selected contractor’s scope of work includes supply, engineering, design, installation, and commissioning of the mechanical energy storage system.

The top 10 global solar inverter vendors accounted for 86% of the market in 2022, up 4% year on year from 2021, according to a new study by Wood Mackenzie.
The market grew 48% year over year, due to easing supply chain challenges and strong government support, as seen in the United States with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Wood Mackenzie said that the top five vendors shipped more than 200 GW (AC) and accounted for 71% of total global PV inverter shipments in 2022, up 8% from 2021. The report notes that fir the top vendor of 2022, Huawei, shipments increased by 83%. Ginlong Solis posted growth of 86%.
For the eighth consecutive year, the top two vendors were Huawei and Sungrow. Huawei held the first position with a 29% market share in 2022. Sungrow, the winner of the pv magazine award in 2021, increased its market share by two percentage points, from 21% in 2021 to 23% in 2022. Ginlong Solis moved up to third place in 2022, driven by the company’s shipments in China.
The top eight vendors of 2021 were very similar to the lineup in 2022, with only Ginlong Solis and Growatt swapping third and fourth positions from 2021. Aiswei and Sofar jumped up three ranks to enter the top 10 ranking, holding the ninth and tenth positions respectively in 2022.
In the Asia-Pacific region, China led the market with 78% of inverter shipments as solar experienced unprecedented growth. India retained its position as the second largest inverter market in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022, but Wood Mackenzie said that it had a 25% decrease in shipments year over year. Japan had 7 GW of inverters enter the country, overtaking Australia as the third-biggest market, with growth of 23% year-over-year growth.
The European region experienced the highest shipment growth, with an 82% increase in 2022, following its 44% year-on-year growth in 2021. Wood Mackenzie attributed this to the move toward carbon neutrality by 2050, as part of the European Green Deal plan. Europe accounted for 28% of the global market, with 92 GW shipped.
While the US market is beginning a strong growth trajectory, it accounted for only 13% of the global market with 42 GW shipped to the country. Solar-plus-storage hybrid inverters made up 10% of the regional shipments as the curtailment of net metering in some markets are leading to a strong energy storage market.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/16/new-study-claims-pv-industry-is-neglecting-overirradiance-issues/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 16, 2023",New study claims PV industry is neglecting overirradiance issues,"From pv magazine Global
An international research team has investigated how overirradiance (OI) may impact the performance of PV installations at low- and mid-latitudes and have found several issues may arise when OI conditions last more than one minute and at ambient temperatures above 30 C.
These events may affect the operating performance of photovoltaic plants, the stability of the electrical grid, and the efficiency of inverters. These effects are due to the increase and drastic fluctuation of irradiance, which can vary by more than 900 W/m2.
“To our estimation, the industry in the last decades, the PV industry, has been neglecting overirradiance, possibly due to unawareness or the belief that these events are rare and isolated,” the research’s lead author, Marco Zamalloa, told pv magazine. “We ourselves were not aware of such events before seeing them in our irradiance data a few years ago. However, since we are relatively new to this topic, we cannot say with absolute certainty whether some PV energy industry branches and project developers now consider these overirradiance conditions.”
 According to Zamalloa, OI conditions are common and occur everywhere with cloud formation. “They can be imagined as a wandering focal point of a magnifying glass,” he further explained. “With the movement of the cloud, it wanders over the earth’s surface. We become only aware of the irradiance enhancement when the focal point passes a sensor.”
In the paper “Overirradiance conditions and their impact on the spectral distribution at low- and mid-latitude sites,” published in Solar Energy, Zamalloa and his colleagues analyzed the spectral distribution of OI conditions in Lima, Madrid, and Berlin using spectroradiometers, tilt and azimuth angles, and sampling interval. They measured, in particular, the spectral distribution of solar irradiance in W/m2/nm, ranging from 350 to 1050 nm, via two years of measured spectral data.
Through their analysis, they found that OI conditions cause red-shift and cloud a blue-shift of the clear-sky spectrum. “The red-shift caused by overirradiance conditions results in different spectral distributions, depending on the average photon energy of the clear sky,” they explained, adding that the spectral red-shift indicates a cloud-enhancement of the direct normal irradiance.
“We believe the photovoltaic industry requires a quantitative evaluation of the impacts of overirradiance on the operation of photovoltaic systems, which are just beginning to be carried out,” co-author Jan Amaru Töfflinger said. “The sudden change in irradiance makes it necessary to improve the response time of the inverters and the MPPT algorithm, both to take advantage of the increase in irradiance and to avoid heating the cables, fuses, and photovoltaic modules due to the high current generated by the overirradiance events.”
Töfflinger also stressed that overirradiance conditions are frequent in Brazil and can have technical and economic effects on photovoltaic plants. “We have contacted colleagues from Brazil, where, so far, most papers have been written regarding the impact of overirradiance conditions on PV plants,” he concluded. “They say they are quite aware of the potential risks and are taking precautions in sizing the inverter and protective fuses.”
The research group is formed by scientists from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Germany’s Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie GmbH, and the University of Jaén in Spain.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/16/u-s-startup-to-produce-perovskite-glass-for-tandem-modules/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 16, 2023",U.S. startup to produce perovskite glass for tandem modules,"From pv magazine USA
Perovskite technology startup Caelux announced it has secured a series A funding of $12 million, bringing total funding to $24 million to develop and commercialize its perovskite glass for tandem use. The company will open a 100 MW perovskite-glass manufacturing facility outside of Los Angeles, California.
Caelux said tandem cells using its technology can push efficiencies past 30%, while retaining the same cost per Watt.
Perovskites are under focus for many global research teams as an abundant, highly efficient photovoltaic material, but they suffer from resilience and lifecycle limitations. New records of efficiency and stability are continually being demonstrated in laboratories, moving the technology closer to commercialization.
Caelux is among first movers on this road to commercialization as it netted the new Series A fund in a round led by Temasek with participation Reliance New Energy, Khosla Ventures, Mitsui Fudosan and Fine Structure Ventures.
The company has developed a method for depositing a perovskite layer in glass, enabling it to be readily integrated with existing solar cell manufacturing lines for a boost in module output. Caelux said its solar glass alone offers greater than 17% efficiency, and when deposited in tandem with other cell technologies, it can boost the overall conversion efficiency rating by six percentage points.
Caelux said its perovskite glass layer can be deposited in existing manufacturing processes with minimal changes to the facility. It is technology-agnostic, allowing for integration with all conventional cell technologies, including PERC, HJT and TopCon.
This investment will support our mission to usher in the next generation of solar innovation, including our production of full-size perovskite sub-modules,” said Scott Graybeal, chief executive officer, Caelux. “We are excited to have attracted visionary, global investors to help us on our journey to multi-gigawatt scale.”
The company said its U.S.-made perovskite-glass sub-module, called Caelux One, qualifies as a solar cell under Treasury Department analysis, making it eligible for manufacturing tax credits as well as contributing to a project’s domestic content percentage.
“Companies should be incentivized to scoop us up into part of their manufacturing value chain, because now they have a solar cell that was produced right here in the United States,” said Leslie Chang, director of strategy and policy, Caelux in an interview with Solar Power World. “By incorporating Caelux, not only are you able to increase the overall power conversion efficiency of your module, but also you better qualify for these domestic content regulations.”
The company said it targets a commercial launch of Caelux One in 2024, with aims to secure Series B funding and reach gigawatt-scale production after launch.
In June, another U.S. manufacturer, CubicPV, secured equity commitments in excess of $100 million to scale a U.S. solar wafer production facility. Formed in 2021 in a merger of Hunt Perovskite Technologies and 1366 Technologies, the company has a history with perovskite development, and said it will continue its research and development of tandem modules as part of the funding led by SCG Cleanergy.
