The two partners would first establish a small demonstrator plant in India in 2021. After that, they plan to co-develop larger-scale projects in the region to supply hydrogen for green ammonia and bio-ethanol production and as a feedstock for other heavy industrial applications.
Fusion Fuel will install the demonstrator facility for BGR Energy in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu in the second half of 2021. The facility would use its HEVO-SOLAR technology to generate cost-competitive green hydrogen. 
The companies would then co-develop projects throughout India, leveraging BGR Energy’s extensive client network and existing commercial footprint. They will also explore broader areas of potential cooperation, given BGR Energy’s broad competencies in the energy, environmental and industrial sectors.
BGR Energy has developed more than 12 GW of power plants and balance-of-plant-related services in India. It also has substantial capabilities in the design and manufacture of high-tech equipment. 
“[This makes] BGR well-positioned to take the lead in developing green hydrogen production infrastructure in the region,” read the company statement.
Green hydrogen
Nearly all hydrogen used today is created through the steam reforming process using gas or coal as base fuel. This process generates large amount of CO2. Traditional steam reforming with gas can generate 9 tonnes of CO2 for every ton of hydrogen produced. With coal, the emissions levels are substantially higher, Fusion Fuel Green writes on its website.
Fusion Fuel claims to have developed its proprietary electrolysis solution using solar energy to create hydrogen with zero carbon emissions. The system allows for the production of green hydrogen at the same cost levels as brown hydrogen. 
Enabling cost-effective domestic production of green hydrogen is critical for India to reduce the carbon intensity of heavy industry and help achieve its energy security and emissions targets—as virtually all the hydrogen consumed in India today is grey hydrogen, the production of which emits roughly 9 tons of CO2 per ton of hydrogen. 
Hydrogen plays a critical role in the Indian economy, with roughly 6 million tons of hydrogen consumed annually, primarily in the production of ammonia and methanol and for use in refineries. A recent study from The Energy and Resources Institute estimated that demand could grow to as much as 28 million tons by 2050. 
João Wahnon, Fusion Fuel’s Head of Business Development, said, “We are excited to open up this new market for Fusion Fuel and develop India as a leader of the global hydrogen economy. We could not ask for a better partner in this undertaking than BGR Energy, with its extensive experience developing turnkey solutions in India’s power and industrial sector.”
Arjun Govind Raghupathy, Managing Director of BGR Energy commented, “BGR Energy has long been an innovator in India’s energy and industrial sectors, and we are excited now to be taking these steps to establish a foothold in the burgeoning green hydrogen industry. We look forward to working with Fusion Fuel to scale the development of local green hydrogen production and play a leading role in creating a green hydrogen ecosystem in the region.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/05/fourth-partner-coal-firm-indika-energy-team-up-on-solar-projects-in-indonesia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,ENERGY STORAGE,EV CHARGERS,HIGHLIGHTS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,INDIA,MALAYSIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 5, 2021",Fourth Partner and coal firm Indika Energy launch joint solar venture in Indonesia,"Hyderabad-based developer Fourth Partner Energy today announced its foray into the Indonesian market by launching an integrated solar power company in partnership with the nation’s energy major Indika Energy. Like Fourth Partner Energy’s India portfolio, the joint venture company Empat Mitra Indika Tenaga Surya (EMITS) will offer integrated solar, storage and electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions to Indonesia’s commercial and industrial sector. 
Indika Energy will hold 51% stake and Fourth Partner Energy 49% in EMITS. The joint venture combines the experience of Fourth Partner Energy in building and operating over 550 MW in India and elsewhere, with Indika Energy’s engineering capabilities in bringing reliable energy solutions to the people of Indonesia. 
This partnership was facilitated by The Fourth Partner Energy’s impact investment arm, The Rise Fund, the majority shareholder in Fourth Partner Energy. 
When contacted by pv magazine, Fourth Partner refused to comment on individual investment in the venture but said EMITS would likely bring in at least $500 million into Indonesia in the next five years.
Vivek Subramanian, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Fourth Partner Energy, said the partnership with Indika Energy is a part of Fourth Partner Energy’s strategic international expansion into key markets across South East Asia. 
“The commercial potential for renewable energy in Indonesia is immense – the government aims to double its current share of clean energy and achieve nearly a quarter of its energy needs from renewables by 2025. Indonesia, like India, has a clear imperative towards aggressive decarbonization. EMITS is gearing up to play a vital role in enabling this transition through a simple value proposition to the consumer—cleaner electricity at lower rates than grid tariffs—to help meet their sustainability goals,” he added. 
Indika Energy brings its two decades of on-ground leadership to the partnership as an integrated energy player with robust clientele and strong financials. “Together with Indika Energy’s local regulatory expertise and our execution prowess, we are confident that EMITS will be Indonesia’s leading renewable energy solutions platform,” Vivek said. 
President director of Indika Energy, M. Arsjad Rasjid said EMITS is expected to contribute to Indika Energy’s efforts to increase revenues from the non-coal segment by 50% by 2025. “The joint venture is a manifestation of our commitment to diversify our business portfolios, achieve sustainability goals, improve our ESG performance, as well as support the Indonesian government’s efforts to achieve its renewable energy mix target of 23% by 2025,” he added. 
The Indonesian opportunity
Green energy sources are estimated to have accounted for 11.51%, or around 10,467 MW, of Indonesia’s total energy consumption at the end of 2020, according to data from the Directorate General of New and Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (EBTKE) of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM).
While this represents an increase of 2.3% compared to 2019’s figures, it falls short of the Ministry’s 13% goal for 2020. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources projects that another US$ 36.95 billion in green energy investments will be required to achieve Indonesia’s target of 23% green energy usage by 2025. EMITS expects to bring at least US$ 500 million to Indonesia during this period.
This partnership was facilitated by Fourth Partner Energy’s impact investment arm, The Rise Fund – which is the majority shareholder in Fourth Partner Energy. With over $5 billion in assets under management, The Rise Fund is the largest private markets social impact fund globally. 
Fourth Partner portfolio
Apart from operations in Indonesia, Fourth Partner Energy is looking to expand its international presence in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Myanmar and Singapore. The company currently has an installed base of 550 MW solar capacity across the distributed and open access portfolios, with solar parks under construction in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.
Fourth Partner Energy has also set up a 50:50 JV with leading commercial EV fleet operator, Lithium Urban Technologies in India to set up solar-powered EV charging infrastructure across the country. Charging Hubs across Pune and Gurugram have already been commissioned, while hubs across Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chennai and Jaipur are in the pipeline.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/05/silver-accounts-for-10-of-pv-module-costs/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 5, 2021",Silver accounts for 10% of PV module costs,"From pv magazine International
The share of silver in PV module costs has risen by around 5% in recent months to account for approximately 10% of the total, according to U.S.-based analyst Matt Watson.
“With PV module costs in the neighborhood of $0.018-$0.019/watt and silver representing around 10% of the overall module cost structure, and module and cell prices still declining, finding a means to lower the silver cost component is going to become an increasingly difficult task,” Watson told pv magazine. “Over the past 20 years, silver has averaged an 8.31% year-on-year growth in prices, which is greater than the current rate of design thrifting. This means lowering that silver $/watt component is going to be very difficult.”
Watson noted that silver is now sold at around $26 per ounce, but said that prices will continue to climb.
“When you study the silver market, electronics demand, led by the Solar PV markets, all have increasingly larger forecast demand,” he said, noting that silver is becoming more of an industrial metal with each passing year. “The projected solar PV module silver cost per watt produced is leveling out going forward as a result of these silver price climbs … As other cell and module costs decline, silver will consume an even larger percentage of the overall module cost as these trends continue.”
Watson, a former executive at U.S.-based CIGS solar module manufacturer SoloPower, is currently the CEO and founder of California-based Precious Metals Commodity Management LLC. He said he believes that the PV industry will probably not move away quickly from the use of silver, despite the recent jump in silver prices.

Solar PV, including ground-mounted and rooftop, reached 38.8 GW in January 2021 as against the 38.7 GW wind, as per the report, which quoted figures from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
The report expects solar PV to maintain its lead with the government’s focused policy push providing the growth impetus. It estimates solar PV to further grow to an estimated newly-built capacity of 107 GW between 2021-2030 against wind’s likely 64 GW.
Wind energy led India’s renewable transformation for more than a decade. “In a span of six years starting in 2011, solar PV could only reach 40% of the total wind installed capacity in 2016. However, its installation capacity reached on par with the wind by the end of 2020 and then overtook by the end of January 2021,” said Ankit Mathur, Practice Head of Power at GlobalData.
The report cites abundant solar PV resources spread across the various states, declining equipment and development costs, and a smaller gestation period as the other reasons for this exponential PV growth.
Cost has played a key role in solar getting preference over the wind. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar has dropped 85% compared to wind’s 65% fall, it stated.
Mathur said the solar PV sector is poised to attract new investments as the government plans to provide domestic solar manufacturing a renewed thrust post-Covid-19. This will further strengthen the project development activities and consolidate the domestic manufacturing capabilities.
