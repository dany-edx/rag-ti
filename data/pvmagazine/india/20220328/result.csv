Developers are hopeful that the Ministry will delay the implementation of the ALMM requirement to such projects by a minimum of one year.
DiSPA is an association of solar, wind, and wind-solar hybrid energy developers and independent power producers for the commercial & industrial (C&I) segment.
Pinaki Bhattacharyya, President, DiSPA, said, “Over 4GW of open access and rooftop projects under various stages of development can get stuck due to this ALMM notification, which will have a significant financial impact on developers and consumers. This will be an additional burden with the basic customs duty (kicking in from April 1) and goods and services tax adversely impacting solar projects.
“The government must understand that the developers are already suffering from issues such as supply chain delays, shortage of raw material, and such sudden amendments only lead to an artificial increase in prices. We are still hopeful that MNRE, which understands the seriousness of the situation, will offer us a solution that is in the larger interest of developing the renewable energy ecosystem.” 
In January this year, the MNRE announced the expansion of the ALMM requirement to open access and net-metering projects from April 1, 2022. Accordingly, only the models and manufacturers included in the ALMM list will be eligible for use in government projects, government-assisted projects, projects under government schemes and programs, open access, and net-metering projects.
This amendment to the ALMM order has not been received well by solar developers, who approached the MNRE for clarity on the application of the order to private projects developed for C&I consumers. Developers wanted to know whether adequate time would be provided to implement such an amendment so that ongoing projects are not impacted.
In the absence of a response from the Ministry, developers approached the Delhi High Court for clarification. Surprisingly, the counsel appearing on behalf of the Ministry offered no clarification on the impact on ongoing projects.
“Developers want the Ministry to keep C&I projects under open access and net metering outside the ambit of ALMM requirement, because such projects are neither government funded nor subsidized. In addition, the present supply of solar modules is not enough to cater to government funded projects. Any shortage in supply will affect the development of solar energy projects. It is also a matter of concern that not all module manufacturers pass reliability parameters and they do not make modules that can be used in commercial projects,” DisPA stated.
The next hearing on the matter is scheduled on March 29, 2022.

The enterprise value of this acquisition is around INR 300 crore.
The PV plant, situated in Wagdari village of the Solapur district, is owned and operated by Lightsource BP’s renewable energy arm Lightsource Renewable Energy (India) in finance partnership with UK government-funded green investment platform UKCI Indigo.
The plant was commissioned in April 2018. Construction, photovoltaic modules, and technical expertise for the project were provided by Sterling & Wilson and LONGi Solar. The plant benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited for total capacity at a tariff of INR 4.43/kWh.
Torrent Power, part of the diversified Torrent Group with group revenues of INR 20,500 crore (approx. US$ 2.7 billion) and a market cap of INR 70,000 crore (approx. US$ 9.1 billion), is one of the largest companies in the country’s power sector with presence across the entire power value chain of generation, transmission, and distribution. 
Torrent Power currently has an aggregate installed generation capacity of 4.1GW, consisting mainly of clean generation sources such as gas (2.7GW) and renewables (1.0 GW). It also has 400MW of renewable energy plants under development. With the acquisition of the 50MW solar power plant, its total generation capacity, including an under-development portfolio, will reach 4.6GW with a renewable portfolio of more than 1.5GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/28/hyundai-sonata-hybrid-is-equipped-with-a-solar-roof/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 28, 2022",Hyundai Sonata hybrid is equipped with a solar roof,"From pv magazine Global
The newest model of the Hyundai Sonata hybrid is equipped with a 205W solar PV array that directly charges the car’s battery. It is estimated the PV will add about 2.5 miles of range per day. The solar panels feature 22.8% efficiency.
While this number may not jump off the page as impressive, the solar PV marks an improvement in efficiency for the vehicle that can add up to being significant. Two and a half miles per day for a year comes out to 912.5 “free” miles. Based on an average commuter’s yearly mileage of 10,000 miles, this represents an over 9% improvement to fuel efficiency.
Hyundai said its solar array system comes with efficient design advantages over competitor cars like the solar-roofed Toyota Prius. The Prius has a separate solar battery, requiring two stages of conversions to charge the high voltage driving battery and the auxiliary “starter” battery. The Sonata only converts once, directly feeding power through the panels, to a maximum power point tracker charge controller, and directly into the auxiliary batteries and drive batteries. This leads to more efficient use of photovoltaic generation, said Hyundai.
The automaker said that the solar roof lessens the burden on the engine and prevents battery discharge. The Korea Insurance Development Institute estimates 4 out of 10 emergency on-road services relate to battery discharge, as parked car electrical systems require an average of about 720mAh per day, and black box cameras, which are increasingly being integrated in cars, require an additional 12,000mAh. With the solar roof, one hour of charging can provide 14,000mAh, supplying a car’s powered-off battery needs for the whole day.
While the range added by the PV is not dramatic, efficiency improvements are just that – improvements. Hyundai does not attempt to “greenwash” the product and recognizes that this is not the core of the vehicle’s power, but rather an ancillary system that provides a handful of benefits.
The solar roof-integrated “Limited” trim for the Sonata is rated at 47 miles per gallon and has a 192 horsepower engine. It has autonomous features like remote parking assist, highway driving assist, and has cameras for blind-spot views. Through an app, drivers can access the Sonata using their mobile phone as a key.

Japanese multinational imaging and electronics company has launched a 1kW pico-hydro generation system that can be used with factory drainage systems and irrigation canals. Pico-hydro systems are all hydropower systems with a capacity of less than 5kW and are commonly used as a cheap and easy-to-deploy source of power in the world’s most inaccessible places.
“The system can also be used in combination with photovoltaics and batteries to ensure stable power supply, ” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Depending on the amount of electricity generated, it can be used for IoT devices such as sensors, lighting devices, and charging systems.”
Called 3D-Pico Hydro Generator System, the new product will be initially sold in the Japanese market. “Service validation will begin in Japan, and the system will gradually be offered globally to markets where it is needed,” the spokesperson further explained.

According to the manufacturer, the system is made with 3D-printed sustainable materials based on recycled plastics and is able to generate electricity even with a small stream of water.
It was tested at the company’s Numazu Plant. “In our demonstration experiment using factory wastewater from the Ricoh Numazu Plant, we confirmed the possibility of lighting a lamp and using it as a power source for a security camera for nine months,” the company said. “We are also considering using it as a power source for disaster prevention in combination with battery storage.”
“Ricoh is also planning to improve the system so that it can also be used in microgrids,” the company’s spokesperson concluded.
