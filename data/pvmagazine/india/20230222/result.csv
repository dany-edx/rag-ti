The government aims to create 50 GWh of domestic lithium cell capacity by 2030 through its $2.5 billion (PLI) scheme for advanced-chemistry cell energy storage. The domestic availability of lithium will cut India’s dependence on imports of this raw material for lithium battery manufacturing.
Hiren Pravin Shah, executive director and CEO, RePlus Engitech, a part of LNJ Bhilwara Group, terms the discovery of 5.9 million tonnes of lithium resources in Jammu & Kashmir as a significant development for India’s energy security. “These lithium reserves will be serving our nation’s two most important priorities as a part of G20 and COP27 commitment— decarbonization of the grid and penetration of EVs. The total lithium battery storage demand for both these applications in 2030 is estimated to be 500 GWh. If we are able to fully utilize the reserves within the available window and timelines, we may just be able to cover the requirement for the next one or one-and-a-half decades with best practices and recycling ecosystem,” he told pv magazine.
Notably, the Geological Survey of India has established the presence of lithium in the preliminary exploration stage (G3). The finding, described as lithium inferred resources (G3), means the exact content and quality of the mineral resources are yet to be established. G3 is followed by two more stages of exploration, G2 (general exploration stage) and G1 (detailed exploration stage) to estimate quantities with a high level of confidence.
Notwithstanding, it is safe to assume that the massive discovery puts India among the top 10 nations with the world’s largest lithium reserves. 
Chile has the world’s largest lithium reserves at 9.2 million metric tonnes (mmt). Australia ranks second with 5.7 mmt. It is followed by Argentina (2.2 mmt), China (1.5 mmt), and USA in that order.
“While the discovery of 5.9 million metric tonnes of lithium reserves is a pleasant sight for the entire ecosystem, it is quite early to comment, given the geopolitical situations, the uncertainty about the quality of the resources, and other strategic factors. If we can take the exploration from G3 to G1 in the next two to three years, it will immensely fuel the PLI scheme by enabling the complete cell manufacturing in India,” shared Rashi Gupta, founder and managing director of Vision Mechatronics.
“There are still some stages of evaluation to complete before we can pinpoint the proven lithium reserve in the Salal-Haimana deposit. If it turns out to be sizeable, it could help India reduce its reliance on lithium imports in the future and benefit stationary and EV battery manufacturing. Additionally, it may support the nation’s attempts to dominate the world in manufacturing… To fully become independent, the next stage is to expand the capacity for processing raw materials and minerals,” added Raman Bhatia, founder & managing director of Servotech Power Systems.
Lithium processing
It’s important to know that lithium does not occur in elemental form in nature as it’s highly reactive. It is found in hard rocks and brines in compound form. While there are many known lithium-containing rock deposits, lithium is usually produced from pegmatite deposits as these have the largest concentrations of lithium-containing minerals. Spodumene (Li2O, Al2O3. 4SiO2), a lithium mineral derived from pegmatite rock, has a high lithium content in the form of Li2O (8.03%) and is, therefore, the most widely exploited for lithium. The lithium reserves in million tonnes are estimated by considering an average percentage of Li2O in lithium-bearing deposits such as pegmatites.
Lithium is also extracted from brines of some very salty lakes, again in compound form.
The lithium-containing salt brines or rock deposits are processed/treated to remove unwanted contents. The next process is the conversion into lithium carbonates through a series of refining and additive processes and then lithium hydroxide with subsequent steps if needed.
While lithium carbonate finds application in various industries, lithium hydroxide is especially suited for electric vehicle batteries.
Australia tops in annual lithium production capacity, followed by Chile. China is the third-largest producer, hosting around 60% of the world’s battery-grade lithium refining capacity.
Building the capability
Currently, Manikaran Lithium, an arm of New Delhi-headquartered power trading company Manikaran Power Ltd, is perhaps the only company with known progress on lithium refining in India. It is setting up the proposed lithium refinery in Gujarat to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide. It intends to source high-quality spodumene concentrate from across the world and use locally sourced reagents to make battery-grade lithium hydroxide in India.
Shah says the processing [of mined lithium minerals and conversion into lithium bicarbonate] requires a significant investment. However, it’s not very complicated and can be quickly built up. 
“In fact, with the focus of our government on building the ecosystem in India, we may be looking at not just processing the lithium that we have mined in J&K but becoming a global refinery for lithium from across the world. This is the first time we may have gotten a handle on this electrification game by this discovery, and I am optimistic that India will be in a game-changing position in the upcoming five to six years from now. We might have just found our own axis around which the Earth will spin,” he adds.
Apart from the lack of lithium refining capacity, there are concerns about mining operations’ ecological impacts.   
“The discovery of lithium reserves in the Jammu & Kashmir region is a big win for India. It will not only boost India’s electrification journey but will also put India among the top 5 countries in terms of lithium reserves worldwide. However, it is imperative to consider that lithium mining is extremely water-consuming and hazardous to nature. To generate one tonne of lithium, it needs more than 500,000 gallons of water, which causes a lot of social and ecological problems. For India, it’s important to build infrastructure that supports sustainable and eco-friendly lithium refining,” Nitin Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Attero, told pv magazine.
Gupta adds that the discovery of lithium resources presents a great opportunity for India to become atmanirbhar [self-reliant] in lithium and also export to the rest of the world!

Research firm Sunwiz has published a list of Australia’s top solar panel and inverter manufacturers, as well as details of buying trends throughout 2022.
Sunwiz said that by the end of 2022, leading Chinese manufacturers had managed to regain some of their market share from “premium” brands, after falling sharply from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Chinese brands have not quite made it back to the 80% market share they enjoyed in the first half of 2021, but the rounded out the year above 70%.

“Premium” brands and other manufacturers grew considerably between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021, before gradually sliding back over the course of 2022. It is worth nothing that other manufacturers, primarily smaller Chinese brands, finished off 2022 in a markedly better position than they were for most of 2021.
In alphabetical order, Australia’s top 10 solar panel manufacturers in 2022 were:
Leading Chinese inverter manufacturers reached a high point in their combined market share in the middle of 2022, before easing back slightly toward the end of the year, said Sunwiz.

Inversely, European inverter brands hit a low point mid-year, but clawed some of that marketshare back by the year’s end.
Module-level power electronics (MLPE) stayed pretty much flat throughout the course of the year, with a minuscule rise over the first quarter, followed by a corresponding drop in the fourth quarter. Likewise, the market share of other inverter brands stayed pretty much flat throughout 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/22/longi-raises-wafer-prices-as-polysilicon-hits-34-98-kg/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 22, 2023",Longi raises wafer prices as polysilicon hits $34.98/kg,"From pv magazine Global
CNMIA‘s silicon branch has reported that polysilicon prices rose after the Chinese lunar year and will likely remain at current levels for a relatively long period, due to increasing demand from wafer manufacturers.
It said that the prices for the raw material ranged from CNY 230/kg to CNY 250 last week, and noted that prices for monocrystalline silicon ranged from CNY 222/kg and CNY 248/kg, up 31.37% from the middle of January. The organization said that the average price of monocrystalline silicon has now hit CNY 235/kg.
“After China’s recent new year holiday, wafer manufacturers returned to high operation rates in order to handle downstream orders. As a result, they quickly consumed all polysilicon in stock,” the CNMIA said. “This contributed to a tense supply situation and higher prices.”
The association said that the recent drop in polysilicon prices is a temporary phenomenon.
“Wafer manufacturers improved their operating rates in response to the false signals, resulting in a remarkable increase in polysilicon demand,” said CNMIA. “Polysilicon buyers will make procurement decisions as quickly as possible and determine the price as early as possible in the price upturn, as inventories are running low and the pressure will rise on manufacturers to replenish their stocks. This will likely bring the price rebound continues.”
CNMIA said it expects a long-term price rebound in the first half of the year, before another series of new polysilicon plants go online.
Longi, meanwhile, has raised the prices of its wafer products. The solar manufacturer now prices M10 p-type, 150-micrometer wafers at CNY 6.25 each, up 15.74%. It is selling its M6 wafers for CNY 5.40 each, up 18.94%.
“The price increase is mainly due to the recent big increase in the price of upstream polysilicon,” Longi said in a statement. “The company’s silicon wafer prices have to be adjusted in line with the market.”
This is the first time this year that Longi has raised prices. Its last silicon wafer price update was on Dec. 23, 2022.
