The company carries out smelting of lead ore, lead concentrate, lead battery scrap, and aluminum scrap to produce secondary lead metal and aluminum ingots. It has made an INR 10-crore investment for the above expansion at its arm Recyclers Ghana Limited at Ghana, West Africa. To date, it has invested approx. INR 31 crore for the establishment of this recycling plant, having a capacity of 16,200 MTPA.
Gravita India is expecting a revenue contribution of approx. INR 200 crore and around 15% gross margin from this step-down subsidiary in fiscal year 2021-22. 
Besides, it has accelerated the process of establishing a new unit at Mundra, Gujarat, due to a rise in domestic procurement. The Gujarat unit is expected to complete by August 2021. 
“Establishment of Mundra plant will help the company in saving the inward and outward logistics cost as Mundra facility is much closer to the port, which, in turn, will reduce the working capital requirement of the company. Furthermore, the above expansions will increase the share of business from the overseas market, which will result in higher margins,” stated the company.  
Going ahead, Gravita plans to focus on optimizing its overseas manufacturing facilities and improving its scrap collection network in India to help improve its profitability by reducing logistic costs of importing the scrap in India and reducing the working capital cycle.

The installation comprises more than 230 solar panels installed over 7500 square feet shadow-free area. 
The latest project follows Oorjan’s solar project installation across towers in Dheeraj Dream, which is likely to be the largest housing society solar project in Mumbai with 1600+ solar panels.
“We are pleased to install solar rooftop panels in Mahavir Universe Phoenix Society, which is one of the most prominent societies in Bhandup, Mumbai. This project is expected to save INR 20 lakh every year for the society, and the green impact is equivalent to planting 4,500 teak wood trees. We have 1500 customers across India and are committed to reaching 10,000 soon,” said Gautam Das, co-founder and CEO, Oorjan Cleantech. 
Oorjan has built financing partnerships with institutional and private investors and has 1500+ customers across 15 states and union territories in India. The company has enabled the adoption of more than 100 MWp of solar projects across the country.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/07/06/transparent-solar-panels-for-agrivoltaics/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"JULY 6, 2021",Transparent solar panels for agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine International
Swiss research institute Agroscope and energy company Romande Energie are building an agrivoltaic project with the support of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) at a site owned by Agroscope in Conthey, in the canton of Valais, Switzerland.
They are building the project with special transparent concentrator PV panels provided by Swiss startup Insolight. The Theia (Translucency and High Efficiency In Agrivoltaics) modules have an efficiency rating of 30% and purportedly let through up to 78% of sunlight.
“Combining two usage modes based on Insolight’s optical micro-tracking technology, these modules focus light on high-efficiency solar cells,” Insolight said in a press release. “When aligned, the optical system can generate energy (E-MODE), but it is also possible to unalign it to ‘leak’ the light (MLT-MODE). The solar modules therefore act like a ‘smart’ shade adjusting the amount of light they let through.”
This makes it possible to optimize the photosynthesis of plants during the seasons and reduce the negative impact of high summer heat on the yields and quality of agricultural products, while recovering the rest of the light in the form of electricity. Starting from July, the panels will be tested for four years on a 165-square-meter surface area. They will replace protective plastic tunnels on strawberries and raspberries.
“Dynamically adjusting the light transmitted to the plants paves the way for increased protection from climate variations and possible increases in crop yields thanks to the matching of the light to the needs of the plants and the lowering of the temperature during heat waves via the shading effect,” said Bastien Christ, head of the berries and medicinal plants group at Agroscope.
pv magazine has previously reported on Insolight‘s module technology. The company – founded by three researchers from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne – has developed panels that rely on expensive III-V multi-junction solar cells from an undisclosed manufacturer.
The cells only cover 0.5% of the panel surface and are covered with protective glass and optical lenses to concentrate and direct sunlight onto them at around 100 times the intensity of standard solar glass. The cells are reportedly able to track the sun through horizontal movement.
