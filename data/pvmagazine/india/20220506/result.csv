The multi-busbar modules feature half-cut passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells based on M10-sized monocrystalline wafers.
The backside of the bifacial module provides up to 25% additional power gain. The bifacial gain is significant on grassland, dry sand, and especially in snowfields. The modules come with a linear warranty of up to 30 years.
Recently, Saatvik raised its production output to 1 GW through the addition of a 500 MW mono PERC panel factory in Haryana. The new production base is equipped to make mono PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar technology to produce high-efficiency solar modules with a power output of 530 Wp to 610 Wp. It is coming up with an additional 1.2 GW capacity in Gandhidham, Gujarat.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/06/new-renewable-capacity-additions-doubled-in-fy-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 6, 2022",New renewable capacity additions doubled in FY 2022,"India added 15.5 GW of new non-hydro renewable energy capacity from solar, wind, biomass and other renewable energy sources in the 2021-22 fiscal year, from just 7.7 GW installed in the preceding fiscal period, according to the latest solar statistics from the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) Market Handbook.
Solar energy accounted for 90% of the total renewables capacity added in fiscal 2021-22, driven partly by a 21% increase in rooftop solar installations to 2.3 GW.
As of March 31, 2022, India’s cumulative renewable energy generation capacity (including hydro) stood at 150 GW. This is far off from the national target to install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, and the country will require an annual deployment of 40 GW to achieve its 2030 target.
“Over 100% rise in RE capacity addition this fiscal versus capacity addition in FY21 is heartening. However, the recent stress seen in the power sector, with several states facing the prospect of power cuts, underscores the central role that thermal power continues to play in India’s energy mix,” said CEEW-CEF Director Gagan Sidhu. “Further increase in RE can provide a significant degree of protection from the kind of supply chain issues plaguing thermal power, but for that battery storage needs to be deployed at scale to address RE’s one big drawback – intermittency. Other innovative procurement formats such as hybrid and round-the-clock (RTC) also offer a certain degree of protection against intermittency.” 
Of the 17.5 GW of renewables capacity auctioned in fiscal 2021-22, 4.3 GW was under hybrid and RTC procurement formats. Sidhu expects this share to increase further as distribution companies increasingly look to developers to address the intermittency challenge of renewables.
An increase in the cost of raw materials and supply chain constraints have resulted in rising solar PV module costs. Higher module costs and the imminent imposition of basic customs duty have led to a rise in the lowest solar tariff of INR 2.14 ($0.028)/kWh in fiscal 2021-22, from INR 1.99/kWh in fiscal 2020-21.

The India unit of France’s Webdyn achieved the milestone within seven years of starting operations in India. Its power management solutions allow the synchronization of the diesel generators and PV plants.
Separately, Fimer said it recently supplied its 1 MVA inverters for an integrated solar and storage project in the Sun temple town of Modhera, Gujarat.
The project features a 6 MW grid-connected solar plant coupled with a 6 MW/18 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). Additionally, the town is powered by 100 kW solar rooftop system, 50 kW of solar parking infrastructure, and 271 numbers of 1 kWp solar systems on residential buildings.
Mahindra Susten handled engineering, procurement, and construction duties.
“The project has a complexity of integrating the solar generation ranging from 1 kW to 6 MW and the battery system of 18 MWh. Susten design team analyzed each design aspect thoroughly while running various generation model simulations and concluded on final design,” said Pramod Kalyanshetti, chief commercial officer of Mahindra Susten. “All the equipment used in the project were analysed considering the reliability and long-term service. Considering the best design fit and their reliability, the Fimer PCS of size 6 MW is used for our Modhera project.”
Fimer supplied six 1 MVA power conversion systems for the BESS application. The solar inverter powers the load during solar hours, and the excess power charges the batteries. The system can also support load demand during solar deficit conditions.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/06/renac-power-unveils-high-voltage-residential-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 6, 2022",Renac Power unveils high-voltage residential battery,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese battery and inverter supplier Renac Power has unveiled a high-voltage battery for residential applications.
It said the storage system combines an internal energy management system (EMS) with a self-consumption control accuracy function. It also features timing charging, remote control, emergency power supply, and other working modes.
“The battery flexibly realizes power dispatching, storage and power load management, strong load adaptability, supports stable access of diversified loads, helps customers easily become the master of power, and integrates VPP (virtual power plant) function,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Turbo H1 plug-and-play battery has a storage capacity of 3.74 kWh, but that can be enhanced in series with up to five batteries to 18.7 kWh. It has a nominal voltage of 96 V and a voltage range of 81 V to 108 V.
The battery measures 606 mm x 651 mm x 217 mm and weighs 49.5 kg. It can operate with temperatures ranging from -10 C to 50 C and at an altitude of up to 2,000 meters. Its life cycle is indicated at over 6,000 cycles and its warranty has a 10-year duration. It also features natural cooling and IP65-rated protection.
The company said the battery recently passed tests by Germany-based third-party testing and certification organization TÜV Rhine. It said it obtained the ICE62619 energy storage battery safety standard certification.
