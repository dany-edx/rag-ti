It received a response from overall 14 developers, including domestic players like Tata Power Renewable Energy, Torrent Power, and ReNew Power as well as international players like Enel Green and Engie power.
PTC India, a Government of India initiative, is a leading provider of power trading solutions in India. It launched the call for EOI in September to assess the market potential and procure power from interested hybrid renewable energy suppliers for onward sale through market-linked RE products. Based on the EOI response, it is expected to sign a bilateral power purchase agreement (PPA) with the most competitive source.
“This is first-of-its-kind development in the Indian power market wherein a trading licensee intended to purchase renewable power for onward sale through market-linked products. This will lead to significant changes in the present electricity market structure and speed up renewable energy generation,” stated PTC.
Developers have offered quantum ranging from 100 MW to 500 MW. “Since this is a hybrid-based procurement (solar plus wind energy), many developers have also offered high capacity utilization factor (CUF), which means more renewable energy available for sale in the market,” stated PTC. 
The projects are mainly located in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka. Developers have offered to commission the project within 18-24 months.
The offers received from the developers are currently under evaluation and PTC is likely to take a call on the procurement within a month.
Commenting on the above development, Dr. Rajib K Mishra, CMD (addl. charge), PTC India Ltd, said “This is a unique market-linked product being initiated by PTC to encourage renewable energy sale in the exchanges or through any other options without putting any burden or commitment on the state discoms. This will shape up the future of the renewable energy market and will contribute to the growth of the sector.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/09/key-factors-when-choosing-an-automated-cleaning-system-for-utility-scale-pv/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,ISRAEL",,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",Key factors when choosing an automated cleaning system for utility scale PV,"In assessing all technologies offered in the market, several key aspects should be considered when approaching a supplier. For example, it’s important for developers and IPPs to understand what components are tested and how big vendors’ testing teams are, in order to ascertain how much time and resources could be devoted to this, and to gauge the scope of their testing. Additionally, it is important to know with which potential vendor third-party testing laboratories work, to verify that they are open to gaining outside validation to demonstrate reliability.
As projects last for 25-30 years, the robots need to work for the same amount of time. It is therefore important to know how a company tests for longevity and durability in harsh climates, and how they account for natural occurrences like dust, heat, and wind in artificial environments.
A good robot will clean thousands of times with minimal interference, so it is imperative to ask how robotic cleaning solution vendors test for a 25-year lifespan of a project. Developers should make sure to ask how many simulations they run, and how this is overseen. Inquire where components are designed and where they are manufactured. Developers can even ask what safety mechanisms are built into the robots.
Compatibility
The extent of the relationship that the vendors have with tracker makers, and which modules they use and test on, is another important key parameter. Developers should ask how a potential robotic provider deals with unusual field conditions such as uneven terrain that causes gaps and misalignments. This is intended to ensure that the robotic solution is flexible enough to be able to support the site, even after 10 and 25 years of ground shifting and structural movements.
It is also probable that components do not have a 25-year endurance, but it is critical to know how long they will last and when is the optimal time for them to be replaced. Finding out who is responsible for covering the cost of replacement parts, especially if it is a Capex-only model. Another important aspect to ask about is coating, and how vendors account for deterioration.
Developers should also request information about how robotic cleaning solution vendors ensure product reliability post-deployment, and what services they offer during the lifetime of the project. If they do not offer any maintenance service, investigating whether a third party can be trusted to uphold the integrity of the robotic parts is mandatory.
Monitoring
It is crucial for developers to inquire if there is any operational monitoring. Considering project sites are most likely remotely located, remote monitoring should be requested. Developers must check if there are any dashboards showing the data, to oversee the cleaning schedule and activity results.
Verifying all the above is vital for understanding how product reliability is demonstrated by a cleaning solar panel robot vendor. It will highlight whether a vendor puts safety first.
Certification, extensive testing programs, post-deployment testing and monitoring, along with other detailed questions, all validate if a PV plant owner has found a real partner in the process.
At Ecoppia, there is a 12-person-strong validation and verification department, dedicated to checking every aspect of our robots.
Ecoppia believes that every aspect of the robotic performance should be analyzed – from the impact on modules, coating, structure, to connections between neighboring structures and the testing process applies to the overall product, as well as to individual components such as batteries, wheels, firmware, and microfibers. Not only does Ecoppia have an internal team, but it also works with external laboratories for certification such as PI Berlin laboratories, one of the most reputable labs in the industry.
Ecoppia is committed to safety and ensuring a reliable solution to the solar energy market is on offer. Over the last decade, it gained vast experience developing robotic solutions for the Indian market, and as such the company consider testing part of its DNA.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/09/most-new-solar-panels-retain-80-production-after-30-years/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 9, 2022",Most new solar panels retain 80% production after 30 years,"From pv magazine Global
The US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories has concluded a five-year, early-life solar module degradation study that examined 834 fielded PV modules, representing 13 types from seven manufacturers in three climates.
The report, recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics, studied 23 systems in total. Six of the studied were determined to have degradation rates that will exceed panel warranty limits in the future, while 13 systems demonstrated the ability to extend their lifetime beyond 30 years. “Lifetime” in this study is defined as the amount of time a panel produces electricity above 80% of its beginning-of-life rate.
The report said that module costs have fallen by 85% since 2010 due to economies of scale, higher efficiencies in cell designs, production line automation, larger modules, and changes to bill of materials components like backsheets. It said that lower costs have led to solar becoming a central part of energy infrastructure buildout today, but noted that cost-cutting design and material changes could lead to a lowered degradation rate, which in-turn could cancel out many of the positive results of lower module costs.
The degradation study showed that degradation is highly nonlinear over time and seasonal variations are present in some module types. Mean and median degradation rate values of −0.62%/year and −0.58%/year, respectively, are consistent with rates measured for older modules.

The report said that the market share of cell types has shifted dramatically in recent years. In 2018, conventional aluminum back surface field (Al-BSF) designs dominated global solar cell production, representing up to 90%. By 2020, the market share shifted to only 15% AI-BSF and 80% high-efficiency cell concepts like passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), passivated emitter with rear locally diffused cell (PERL), passivated emitter rear totally diffused cell (PERT), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon).
The report said there is a lack of long-term field data for these new cell and module technologies. It aimed to tackle that lack of data by studying each of these technologies in the field over time. 
Nameplate power rating differences ranged from around −3.6% to 4% with initial power stabilization varying from −3.3% to +0.6%. Flash-over-flash measurements showed variable performance with seasonality amplifying the variations.
Overall, the degradation rates found in the work were within the values observed in the past from 1979 to 2014 module technologies for more expensive conventional PV technologies. The study concluded, although the costs declined sharply in the last decade, module degradation rates do not seem to be affected, at least for the sample investigated in the report.
