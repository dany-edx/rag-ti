It developed the Nellai solar park via the group captive model, under which customers own a minimum 26% share of the plant and buy the electricity under long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The solar plant features 140,000 PV panels and spans 773,678 square meters of land. It is expected to produce 124 GWh of electricity per year.
Belectric, a German engineering, procurement and construction specialist, built the plant. Its Indian unit will also provide plant operation and maintenance services for the first three years after commissioning. 
“Statkraft has an ambition of ramping up as a solar and wind power developer in India and is currently focusing on developing greenfield solar projects at utility scale,” said Jürgen Tzschoppe, Statkraft executive vice president of international power. “Nellai is the first project in realizing this business objective and supports our strategy to strengthen our industrial presence in the solar segment and grow our customer-oriented business.”
Oslo-based Statkraft has had a presence in India since 2004 and now owns 215 MW of production capacity, with around 1,310 GWh of annual generation. In Himachal Pradesh, it is also building the 150 MW Tidong hydropower plant, which is scheduled for completion by the end of the year.

(MFL) has partnered with Renew Green Energy Solutions to set up an 18.34 MW wind-solar hybrid power project in Gujarat for self-consumption. 
The company will set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with Renew Green Energy Solutions to build the plant. It will raise a 26% stake in the SPV by contributing INR 20.54 crore ($2.65 million). Renew Green Energy Solutions will invest INR 58.46 crore in a 74% stake.
Meghmani Finechem has signed an energy subscription agreement, share subscription deal, and shareholder agreement to install the wind-solar hybrid power plant. This project will be commissioned by December.
The plant will exclusively supply power to Meghmani Finechem over a period of 25 years. This will help Meghmani Finechem meet its energy requirements, while also allowing it to produce green hydrogen. The cost per unit of electricity through this hybrid power plant will be lower than the power procured from the electricity grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/30/risen-launches-450-w-rooftop-solar-module-with-21-7-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 30, 2022",Risen launches 450 W rooftop solar module with 21.7% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese solar module maker Risen Energy has launched a new module for rooftop applications, based on 210mm cells. “It is a multi-busbar solar module manufactured with non-destructive cutting technology, capable of operating at an efficiency of 21.7%, outperforming its peers by 0.4%, increasing solar return on investment for users,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
Called RSM130-8-430-450M, the new 130-cell module is available in five versions with a power output ranging from 430 W to 450 W and efficiencies ranging from 20.7% to 21.7%. The open-circuit voltage is between 44.36 V and 45.33 V and the short-circuit current is between 12.35 A and 12.65 A.
The panel measures 1,894 mm x 1,096 mm x 30 mm and weighs in at 22.5 kg. It is built with a white backsheet, low iron, tempered anti-reflective glass and an anodized aluminum alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per C and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.8% of the nominal output power.
“As an upgrade for the Titan 40-cell high-performance monocrystalline PERC solar modules, RSM130-8-430-450M features a power output range from 430Wp to 450Wp, 10-20Wp higher than other mainstream residential PV products available on the market,” Risen stated. “It is compact and aesthetic, and includes two color options – black and silver for its steel frame.”

(AHEJOL) unit has commissioned a 390 MW wind-solar hybrid power plant in Rajasthan.
The project is purportedly India’s first large-scale wind-solar power plant. It benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) at a tariff of INR 2.69 ($0.035)/kWh. 
ReNew Power recently commissioned a 17.6 MW captive wind-solar project in Gujarat. The ReNew project supplies clean energy to a factory run by Grasim Industries Ltd. Hero Future Energies has also commissioned a wind-solar hybrid project in Karnataka by adding 28.8 MW of solar capacity to an existing 50 MW wind farm.
With the commissioning of the 390 MW wind-solar plant, Adani Green now has an operational renewable energy capacity of 5.8 GW and a total portfolio of 20.4 GW.

Global Energy Monitor (GEM) has unveiled a new online tool to map solar power plants throughout the world with capacities above 20 MW.
The Global Solar Power Tracker (GSPT) can map projects of any status, including operational arrays or announced plants, as well as solar facilities that are under development or under construction. Every solar park is linked to a wiki page on the GEM wiki platform.
The tracking tool provides search results by project name, start-up year, operator, owner, country, capacity, and project status. Currently, it includes 5,190 solar projects with a combined capacity of 298.7 GW across 148 countries. It also includes another 3,551 potential projects, bringing the aggregate total to 651.6 GW.
