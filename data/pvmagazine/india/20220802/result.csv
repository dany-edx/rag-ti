Metastable Materials has developed a chemical-free technology that can extract a wide range of valuable materials like copper, aluminum, cobalt, nickel, and lithium from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries in an eco-friendly manner. It claims its patented technology can provide up to 90% recovery of constituent materials for lithium batteries across various cell chemistries.
The startup’s newly opened R&D center will carry out equipment fabrication, design and development, and process optimization, among other strategic areas for the company. The 5,000-sq.ft facility is equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and equipment, including an in-house quality analysis lab to perform regular quality checks of the extracted materials and a parallel focus on continuous improvements in process efficiency and yield.
Metastable aims to ramp up the facility to run at its full capacity by the end of the current fiscal 2022-23 and bolster commercialization optimally for the company. The plan includes doubling up the facility to function as a metal extraction line by the end of 2022 – with the capacity to handle the processing of up to 600 tons of end-of-life Lithium-ion batteries per year and eventually cater to 4 to 6% of India’s end-of-life Li-ion batteries treatment value chain.
At the facility, Metastable’s process engineering team will conduct regular experiments to increase efficiency, yield, and purity of the various output materials obtained through Metastable’s patented technology.
“Majority of the metals extracted from Li-ion batteries have an overall trade deficit. These are currently facing a supply crunch in the domestic market and are being imported from other countries at higher prices. We foresee a huge opportunity for …offering these commodities at a lower price than the market,” said Shubham Vishvakarma, founder and head of process engineering, Metastable Materials.
“Our newly-inaugurated facility will play a pivotal role in enabling that and giving impetus to a circular economy. Once technology validation is proven at scale at this facility, Metastable Materials plans to develop India’s urban mining infrastructure based on its new and improved processes over the next two years or so.”

Visaka will also supply its Vnext fiber cement boards, an eco-friendly alternative to climate-damaging plywood and gypsum.
Visaka’s Atum solar roof will cover the 4,200 sq.ft area of the lab and produce 70 kW of solar power to run the lab.
As per the company, Atum solar roof is a great alternative to metal sheets, sloped RCC, or clay tiles for industrial, commercial, and residential buildings. It can generate up to 40% more power than conventional solar rooftops and has a minimum lifespan of 25 years. The roof can resist fire damage for over 2.5 hours and withstand wind speeds of 255 kmph.
“The installation requires a steel structural grid for mounting the Atum solar roof modules, accessories to anchor the Atum modules straight on the steel structure, and BOS and inverters to commission the plant based on whether it’a an on-grid or off-grid system,” stated a Visaka spokesperson.
Atum has been successfully installed across many locations in India, including Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai (Maharashtra), and Hyderabad (Telangana), and in Sharjah, UAE.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/08/02/us-to-extend-investment-tax-credit-for-solar-at-30-to-2032/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 2, 2022",US to extend Investment Tax Credit for solar at 30% to 2032,"From pv magazine Global
In a surprise victory for the solar and clean technology industries, US Senator Joe Manchin and Democrats reached an agreement on a reconciliation bill, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The bill includes $370 billion in spending for renewable energy and climate measures.
One of the most impactful provisions in the bill, which can be read in full text here, is the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit, which has been instrumental in launching the solar industry we know today. The bill calls for a 10-year extension at 30% of the cost of the installed equipment, which will then step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. The tax credit applies to individuals adopters of solar technology.
The 30% credit also applies to energy storage whether it is co-located or installed as standalone energy storage. This enables the retrofit of a battery to a solar array while taking advantage of the credit.
One measure that was hoped for, but is not in the bill, was the “refundability” clause. Refundability means that if the tax credit value exceeds taxes owed on the year, it would be paid as a cash refund. This provision was not included, which hampers the value of the credit for some individuals. However, the credit can be rolled over to a following year.
There are also several “adders” for the tax credit depending on the type of organization, domestic product use, and project location. ROTH Capital Partners said that the investment tax credit could reach as high as 50% for some projects with the right adders applied.
The credit also includes the “direct pay” provision. This would allow a developer with little or no tax liability to treat the amount of credit as an overpayment of tax which would result in a cash payment refund in the amount of such overpayment being made to the developer.
“With long-term incentives for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, the solar and storage industry is ready to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and get to work building out the next era of American energy leadership. This is a crucial window of opportunity that we cannot miss, and now Congress must seal the deal and pass this legislation,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The bill is expected to head to the Senate floor for a vote soon.
