These PV assets are spread across three states and benefit from long-term power purchase agreements with government off-takers.
The acquisition is in line with Virescent’s strategy to acquire operational renewable energy assets that have stable long-term cashflows with government counterparties across India.
While more details from Virescent are still awaited, the acquired projects are presumably the 20 MW+15 MW plants owned and commissioned by Sindicatum in Gujarat, 5.2 MW in Rajasthan, and 35.2 MW in Uttar Pradesh.
Sindicatum commissioned the 20MWp and 15 MWp Gujarat projects in the year 2012 through its subsidiaries PLG Photovoltaic and Sindicatum Solar Energy Gujarat, respectively. The plants, located in the Patan district, benefit from a 25-year power purchase agreement with the state discom Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL).
Sindicatum Solar Energy Rajasthan commissioned the 5.2 MWp solar plant in Rajasthan in 2011. The project is located one hour from Jodhpur City. The electricity generated from the project is being sold under a long-term power purchase agreement with NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN). Jodhpur Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited is the associated Discom for the project.
Universal Saur Urja, another arm of Sindicatum, commissioned the 35.2 MWp Uttar Pradesh project in September 2016. The plant, located in Mahoba district, benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with State government utility, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), and exports to the grid about 14 km away via a 132 kV transmission line.

Mumbai architecture firm NUDES has designed Solar Mountain, which could become a permanent installation on Burning Man’s 3,800-acre ranch in Nevada and produce 300 MWh of electricity annually.
The design features an array of solar panels fanning out from a central spine. Construction is planned with modular design elements of recycled wood and other environmentally friendly materials. It would include four units, each with 182 solar panels of 300W capacity.
Burning Man is an annual festival focused on community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance. The NUDES design is one of 10 finalists in a design challenge by Land Art Generator Initiative and Burning Man Project known as LAGI 2020 Fly Ranch.
Later this year, selected design teams will be offered a grant to build a functional prototype on site.
