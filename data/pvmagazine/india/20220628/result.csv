(STPL) transmission project in Madhya Pradesh.
It launched the project in partnership with SELCO Foundation in 2020. They focused on 14 villages around Seoni Malwa in Hoshangabad district and Ashta in Sehore district. The villagers faced multiple challenges due to inconsistent power supplies.
Apraava Energy set up 52 solar streetlights in the common areas of the villages. In Anganwadis (rural child care centers), it provided solar solutions to power basic appliances such as fans and lights.
The systems will generate approximately 13.9 MWh of solar power per year and will help to offset around 11.2 tons of carbon emissions per year.
The villages include Nayagaon, Narri, Gotabarri, Nandarwara, Malapat around Seoni Malwa, and Chancharsi, Richhadiya, Kannod Mirzi, Awali Kheda, Thuriya, Kitya, Deosiralya, Sonkhedi, JanjalKhedi around Ashta.
Apraava Energy is jointly owned by Hong Kong-based CLP Group and Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. It was founded in 2002 and has a diverse portfolio comprising 3,150 MW of installed capacity, including 924 MW of wind and 250 MW of solar energy projects across seven states, as well as a power transmission asset.

The modules must have a minimum nominal power of 530 W.
The prospective supplier should have a cumulative supply track record of at least 40 MWp of solar modules. The ideal candidate should have executed at least one order for a minimum of 10 MWp of capacity before the opening date of the techno-commercial bid.
The bidder’s average annual turnover should be at least INR 1,200 million ($15.2 million) for the last three financial years, said NTPC.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/28/new-pricing-mechanism-for-pumped-hydro-storage-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 28, 2022",New pricing mechanism for pumped-hydro storage in India,"A new report by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) recommends a differential pricing mechanism for pumped-hydro energy storage (PHES) projects in India.
The proposed pricing mechanism has different pumping and generation prices, instead of only generation-based energy charges. The report says developers can use profitable generation from the differential pricing mechanism for fixed cost recovery.
The current pricing mechanism considers PHES only as a generator, which needs to recover its cost by selling power at a determined tariff to the beneficiaries/consumers. The tariff for a PHES project includes fixed costs and variable costs.
The fixed cost component, or capacity charge, is to recover the capital cost incurred on the plant every year, such as plant and machinery, manpower, and administration costs. The variable cost component, or the energy charge, is used to recover the cost incurred during the plant operation. 
However, PHES acts as both a generator and a consumer. The PHES draws power from the grid and acts as a consumer when water is pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir during off-peak hours. And it acts as a generator at the time of releasing water and generating energy. 
Therefore, the report highlights the need for developing a differential pricing mechanism for PHES during its pumping (off-peak operation) and generating mode (peak operation). The report also recommends the pricing mechanism for PHES should be based on specific use cases. The current pricing mechanism does not consider the grid flexibility aspects of PHES. The report highlights the need to develop a pricing mechanism for each specific service offered by the PHES.
Differential tariffs
The report proposes new tariff computation methods for peak load shaving and renewables smoothing. For peak load shaving, PHES can be operated in the market (such as the Indian Energy Exchange) as a merchant power plant with different pumping (off-peak rates) and generation prices (peak rates). The peak price should be 1.33 to 1.35 times the off-peak price for profit generation.
Grid-connected PHES plants that utilize renewables for their pumping requirements and are co-located with renewables plants enable round-the-clock support from these renewables plants. The report says incentives should be provided in such cases. The incentives could be one or a combination of the following: compensation for avoiding renewables curtailment, avoided cost from high-priced purchase of thermal or gas plants, grid flexibility incentive similar to ancillary unit plants, and generation-based incentive in the range of INR 1 ($0.01) per kilowatt-hour to attract more investment in the sector.
In addition to the above pricing mechanisms, the report recommends financing mechanisms for total PHES project cost funding. These include budgetary subsidy on viability gap funding, expense distribution (resources, assets, and investment distribution) through collaboration between local government and developer, and foreign direct investments in the PHES sector.
The report states the new pricing mechanisms will lead to higher revenue generation for PHES projects. Developers can recover the fixed costs from their revenues. PHES projects can also benefit from competitive pricing by operating in the market.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/28/cea-ines-develops-18-95-efficient-flexible-perovskite-solar-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"JUNE 28, 2022",CEA-INES develops 18.95%-efficient flexible perovskite solar panels,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at France’s National Solar Energy Institute (INES) – a division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) – have developed new flexible perovskite solar modules.
They have a surface area of 11.6 square centimeters, with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.95% and a stabilized efficiency of more than 18.5%. INES said the performance is a world record for a flexible perovskite device larger than 10 square centimeters.
Currently, the power conversion efficiencies of solar devices based on perovskites indeed exceed 25% for single junctions and 29% in tandem structures with silicon. However, these results are obtained on small surfaces, of the order of 1 square centimeters.
To obtain this yield on larger surfaces, INES developed the flexible perovskite solar modules at low temperature on low-cost substrates made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). They used a very simple structure featuring five layers, including the electrodes.
The performance is obtained after encapsulation and the stability of the devices has been tested under damp heat conditions at 85 C, according to the standards used for silicon-based technologies. A stability of several hundred hours has been obtained – between 400 and 800 hours, depending on encapsulation – based on a standard objective of 1,000 hours.
To achieve this result, the CEA optimized the stacking of the layers of the cell to implement a three-step laser process for the production of the module. It also developed a flexible encapsulation process that is fully compatible with high gas barrier materials, with no initial loss.
The CEA’s devices will be integrated into a demonstrator for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications by Flexbrick (Es), a member of the European consortium. The modules will be interconnected to obtain high voltages and will be tested according to building standards. In addition, stability tests in real conditions are currently being carried out.
The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) in Germany, a project partner, is testing the panels for indoor applications. The tests have already shown power conversion efficiencies of up to 24.5% at very low light (500 lux).
For some applications, the use of flexible substrates could be of interest for single-junction perovskite technology, because it could open the way to high-speed and low-temperature printing processes. It therefore becomes possible to use low-cost substrates unlike flexible inorganic technologies, such as CIGS, which require higher temperature processes and more expensive substrates.
Many teams around the world are trying to meet the challenges of making larger devices with sufficient stability for real-world applications. This is one of the tasks set by the partners of the European APOLO project.
