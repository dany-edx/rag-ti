https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/01/india-gets-first-community-energy-storage-connected-to-grid/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,DELHI",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 1, 2021",India gets first community energy storage connected to grid,"Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, in collaboration with Nexcharge, has launched India’s first grid-connected community energy storage system (CESS) at Rani Bagh in New Delhi. Nexcharge is a joint venture between Exide Industries, India’s largest lead-acid storage battery manufacturer, and Leclanché, one of the leading Lithium-ion (Li-on) battery manufacturers based in Switzerland.
The 150 kW/528 kWh battery energy storage system at Tata Power-DDL’s Ranibagh Substation benefits both customers and the utility. Rani Bagh was selected for the installation owing to its dense population with vertical load growth and space constraints to put additional transformers. The setup will help in providing continuous and reliable power to key consumers during exigency.
CESS’s key feature is to support the distribution transformers in managing the peak load, voltage regulation, power factor improvement, frequency regulation, and deviation settlement mechanism. 
Besides, during an outage of distribution transformers or supply fail condition, the battery will connect to the privileged bus and provide 150 kW for 4 hours duration to consumers providing critical services like hospitals, commercial complexes, and Delhi Jal Board. Apart from the essential consumers, the system serves hundreds of consumers residing in the area.
The battery energy storage system will charge during the off-peak hours and discharge the power during peak condition, which will enhance the asset’s life, prevent the interruption on account of overload, and capex deferral in putting additional support for placing distribution transformers only to meet peak-load.
Commenting on the launch, Ganesh Srinivasan, CEO, Tata Power-DDL said, “Instead of building humungous infrastructure of transformers and electric equipment, CESS can be used to meet peak demand while storing surplus power. I believe wider adoption of such storage systems will help in balancing the load curve of discoms and make them future ready.”
Stefan Louis, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Technology Officer, Nexcharge said, “Battery-based energy storage (BESS) provides the agility to better integrate intermittent solar and wind energy resources into India’s electric grid and ensure high-quality power for consumers. A Community Energy Storage System like this will ensure consumers experience better levels of stability, reliability, quality, and control. Both customers and distributors will benefit from this service… this new 0.52 MWh grid-connected system ..will pave a new path for wider adoption of grid-scale energy storage technology across India.”

Rebranded, Norway-based consultancy DNV has published a guide to help renewable energy developers in the construction of floating solar power plants.
The Recommended Practice guide, on top of describing the most common requirements for building a floating PV array, provides a series of technical guidelines for electrical safety, anchoring and mooring issues, operation and maintenance, and specific plant design that can withstand site-specific environmental conditions. “It aims to be valid and applicable in all major markets and geographic regions, for all defined applications within scope, from component level to system level, covering the entire life cycle,” its authors specified.
“It will take the industry around five years to reach full standardization,” said DNV consultant Michele Tagliapietra, adding that standards set by the IEC, ISO and DVN will be defined within two to four years, depending on component.
Launching the first global recommended practice document for floating solar, the company underlined that the technology requires significant attention on some parts of the system in the medium term. At the same time, a focus on durability and degradation will be needed in the long term.
“At the moment, in the medium term, the main cause of failure is [the] anchoring and mooring part of the system. This is not a surprise because these are new challenges for PV developers,” explained Tagliapietra.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/01/managing-solar-pv-waste-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RECYCLING,EUROPE,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 1, 2021",Managing solar PV waste in India ,"A new report proposes making solar panel producers (instead of end owners) accountable for India’s PV waste. It states such a policy approach would help the nation tackle its PV waste better than the scenario whereby a landfill ban is introduced, but the end-owner retains end-of-life management responsibility.
The report titled “PV Waste Management in India” was prepared as part of an EU-India technical cooperation project on renewable energy and energy efficiency in India, with the support of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Industry bodies The National Solar Energy Federation of India and SolarPower Europe, along with European take-back and recycling association PV Cycle, contributed to the report. 
The report makes recommendations based on experience with the extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy approaches for PV modules in several European countries. 
Currently, PV modules and inverters aren’t covered by the Indian E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules as these rules apply only to (i) information technology and telecommunication equipment and (ii) consumer electrical and electronics product categories. Neither PV modules nor inverters are listed among these identified electrical and electronic equipment categories.
The report recommends creating an EPR legislation for PV modules in India separately from the E-Waste Rules. Such a law could set the producers’ responsibility for PV modules and – where required – other PV system products, such as inverters and batteries, it stated. 
The EPR legislation framework could include collective PV module waste management by creating an organization run by the industry. 
The report authors surveyed Indian stakeholders (especially manufacturers and developers) on different PV waste management mechanisms. The survey found that almost 80% of the respondent manufacturers were willing to take PV end-of-life responsibility. A majority of stakeholders agreed that a fee be paid at the time of purchase by the owner of the PV modules to finance the end-of-life management of PV modules.
Further, the stakeholders are willing to create a fund that is managed by an industry body.
Landfill ban on PV modules, control and monitoring by the State Pollution Control Boards and/or the Ministry of Environment/Renewable Energy through the industry organization or the individual producer, and regular reporting on the sold amounts of PV modules and on the amounts of waste PV modules collected are among the other components proposed under the EPR framework.
The report stated that PV waste generation in India is currently insignificant considering that solar PV modules generally last 30 years or longer and the nation installed only 570,000 tonnes of PV modules before the end of 2016. The vast majority of PV modules – 2,175,000 tonnes – was installed in the period 2017-19.
While end-of-life (EoL) modules will constitute PV waste’s main source only in the early 2040s, early failures or damages during transportation, installation, and operation contribute to the current mass of PV waste. The study estimated these volumes under three growth scenarios of the Indian PV market. It found that by the year 2030, India will generate a cumulative PV module waste of 11 kilotonnes (kt) in the Low scenario, 21 kt in the Medium scenario, and 34 kt in the High scenario.
Here, the Low and Medium scenarios forecast a 9-18 GW of annual installations in the next five years. Annual installations increase significantly in the mid and long term, reaching 22-46 GW by 2030. 
Conversely, the High scenario assumes that national government objectives are reached due to a surge of installed capacity in 2021 and 2022. After peaking in 2024, annual installations decline to 17 GW in 2030.
Under the Low and Medium scenarios, cumulative capacity reaches 187 and 287 GW, respectively, up from 40 GW in 2020. The High scenario capacity reaches 400 GW by 2030, in line with government ambition. Assuming that PV systems installed in 2020-2030 have a lifetime of at least 30 years, any capacity installed during this period will reach the end-of-life stage not before 2050.
