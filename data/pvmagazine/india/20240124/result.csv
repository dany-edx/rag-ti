The pact covers the supply of 0.4 mmtpa (million metric tons per annum) of green ammonia from Phase-1 of Acme’s Odisha project in Gopalpur on a long-term basis.
The green hydrogen and ammonia project at Gopalpur, Odisha is being developed by ACME with a planned capacity of 1.2 mmtpa to be developed in phases. The first production is likely within 2027. Over its life cycle, the project will help reduce global GHG emissions by 54 million tons of CO2 equivalent.
The term sheet for the supply of green ammonia from the project was signed by Acme Group founder and chairman, Manoj Upadhyay, and IHI Corp. president and CEO, Hiroshi Ide, in the presence of India’s union minister for power and new & renewable energy R.K. Singh, new & renewable energy secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla, and Japan’s ambassador to India Hiroshi Suzuki.
Acme and IHI Corp. wish to partner across the value chain, starting from production to logistics, supply to the Japanese customers, and to create a market for green ammonia for use in a range of applications in power generation and various industrial uses in Japan to reduce the overall emissions.
Speaking about the agreement, the Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy R.K. Singh said that this is one of the first and largest agreements in the world in the field of green hydrogen and green ammonia. “Japan has been a close friend and partner of India. This collaboration in renewable energy in going green will further strengthen our partnership. India’s cost of making green hydrogen and green ammonia is already among the most competitive in the world. We are going to emerge as one of the largest manufacturers of green hydrogen and green ammonia in the world.”
The Minister underlined the strategic importance of the partnership between India and Japan. “Our partnership with Japan is strategic; it will grow stronger. Japan and other developed countries have huge requirements for green hydrogen and green ammonia, which India shall be able to supply at most competitive rates.”
Ambassador of Japan to India Hiroshi Suzuki said the partnership between Acme and IHI will bring remarkable success, given the potential of globally competitive green hydrogen in India… India-Japan Clean Energy Partnership, established by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, has been driving the cooperation between the two countries.
The Ambassador requested the union power & NRE minister for early signing of green hydrogen and green ammonia joint declaration of intent (JDI) involving the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Government of Japan, and Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) Government of India.
Speaking on the occasion, Acme Group president and director, Ashwani Dudeja said: “India is well positioned to develop the renewable resources and produce competitive green molecules for export as well as domestic consumption in applications which are otherwise difficult to decarbonize”. He also emphasized the need for support from the Government of India and the Government of Odisha in developing the green ammonia project at Gopalpur.
IHI director and managing executive officer, Jun Kobayashi said, “This agreement builds upon our earlier MoU with ACME and represents the strong relationship and alignment between the two companies in developing the market for this new generation fuel”.
ACME Group is one of the largest private-sector renewable power producers in India with a renewable energy portfolio of more than 5 GW of projects under operation and various stages of implementation. In 2021, Acme built what is perhaps the world’s first green ammonia plant in Bikaner, Rajasthan. ACME is developing several green hydrogen and ammonia projects in India, Oman, and USA with an aim to have a cumulative portfolio of 10 mmtpa of green ammonia or equivalent hydrogen/derivatives by 2032.
Acme is working with many potential customers in India to supply green hydrogen and ammonia. It has a global footprint with offices and representatives in Japan, Middle East, Europe and USA for the marketing and supply of green hydrogen and its derivatives to the international markets.
IHI is a Japanese integrated heavy industry group that originated in 1853 and leveraged its shipbuilding technology to expand into onshore machinery, bridge, plant, aero-engine, and other manufacturing fields. IHI is developing technology for ammonia firing and is constructing a carbon-free fuel
ammonia supply chain to help decarbonize the economy.

South Korea’s Hyundai has acquired an unspecified minority stake in German PV module recycler Flaxres.
Flaxres did not reveal the name of the new investor in its press release. Its name, however, can be found in the commercial register. The value of the transaction is estimated in the “three-digit million range,” the company said, adding that this transaction could help it to become active in important non-European markets in the future.
Flaxres has developed a patented solar module recycling technology, based on short-term, high-temperature heating using flash lamps. The company claims that this “flash lamp annealing” process is more environmentally friendly, more cost-efficient and significantly faster than conventional processes, which are usually based on mechanical shredding or thermal recycling of the modules.
With this process, all composite materials of the solar modules can be separated from each other according to type and returned to the material cycle.
Flaxres’ largest shareholder is Germany-based industrial holding Econnext Group.

Sunstall has announced that UL has certified Sunzaun, its new vertical PV mounting system. Sunzaun has met UL2703 standards, making it the first vertical solar mounting system to achieve such certification for safety and reliability in the United States.
The vertical configuration of the Sunzaun system saves space, allowing for energy production in limited spaces. Sunstall said the system is well-suited for agricultural land, urban environments and areas with restricted land availability.
The vertical orientation of the panels leads to a grid-serving production curve, avoiding the midday production peak of traditional utility-scale arrays. It has other dual-use benefits, like providing shade to crops and saving irrigation water.
“We are thrilled to announce that our Vertical Solar System has successfully passed UL testing, making it the first of its kind nationwide to comply with the UL2703 standard,” said Helge Birenath, chief executive officer and president of Sunstall.
The German-designed Sunzaun vertical arrays were installed in 2022 at a winery in Somerset, California, demonstrating the dual-use ability vertical PV tech. The solar array, installed within rows of grapevines, is composed of 43 modules with 450 W each, connected to a microinverter and two batteries.
The design uses holes in the module frames to make a simple attachment to two piles, negating the need for a heavy racking system. The bifacial solar modules produce energy on both sides of the vertically oriented array.

Dewangan said the MNRE is in the process of revising the guidelines of the national rooftop solar scheme launched earlier. It is considering increasing the subsidy for the low-segment, grid-connected rooftop solar systems in the residential sector with capacities between 1-3 kW.
Under the previously launched national rooftop solar scheme, the subsidy (central financial assistance) amount for 1-3 kW grid-connected rooftop solar systems in the residential sector was up to 40% of the benchmark cost of the system, and for systems beyond 3 kW and up to 10 kW, the subsidy amount was up to 20%.
Dewangan said, under the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, the target is to cover one crore residential rooftops in one year. MNRE has already started a pilot project in the Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh, where the target is to install 25,000 rooftop solar systems. Similarly, the MNRE has asked the states to prioritize the cities or the urban conglomeration for this rooftop solar mission. Once the cities are finalized, REC will coordinate with all the stakeholders.
Dewangan said, “MNRE has given us [REC] the mandate to work as a program implementation agency for the installation of 40 GW of rooftop solar capacity by 2026, for which the total financial workout is INR 240,000 crore. The subsidy part is still being worked out by the MNRE..If one crore [residential] rooftops are targeted in one year [through the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana], the total installed capacity supported with this scheme will be 10 GW over a year’s period if only 1 kW systems are installed.”
