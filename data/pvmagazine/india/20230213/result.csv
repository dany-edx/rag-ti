“The factory will manufacture advanced power electronics for HVDC Light [voltage source converter technology’, HVDC Classic, and STATCOM grid and power quality technologies, together with MACH control and protection system, the brain behind our advanced transmission and power quality solutions,” stated the company. Hitachi’s STATCOM technology improves voltage stability and grid reliability by continuously and rapidly providing reactive power in response to voltage variations.
The factory will cater to the rising number of high-voltage transmission projects in India and export to support global HVDC installations.
India targets to meet half of the total power generation from renewables by 2030. Achieving this will require the bulk transmission of clean energy over long distances and balancing the national grid for intermittencies, for which HVDC and power quality are the ideal solutions.
HVDC transmission has been a breakthrough in connecting remote renewable generation points with the national grid, transmitting large amounts of electricity with significantly reduced transmission losses and physical footprint.
Hitachi Energy has executed more than half the HVDC links in India, including the North-East Agra link, the world’s first multi-terminal ultrahigh voltage link enabling the transmission of a clean power supply for 90 million people, as well as the 6 GW Raigarh-Pugalur link, transmitting power from central India to consumers in the south, over a distance of 1,830 km.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/13/emmvee-gets-fraunhofer-ise-on-board-for-solar-cell-line/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",Emmvee gets Fraunhofer ISE on board for solar cell line,"Karnataka-based Emmvee Group has appointed Fraunhofer ISE, the largest solar research institute in Europe, as the solar technology partner for its upcoming PV cell manufacturing facility near Bangalore. The collaboration aims to set up a 1.5 GW integrated mono PERC/TOPCon cell production facility.
The two partners recently signed an agreement for the entire project timeline, which spans more than 36 months. The project stages include technical evaluation of process equipment and consumables, training of employees in cell production, ramping up and optimization of production lines as well as a TOPCon upgrade with cell line optimization.
“Partnering with Fraunhofer ISE will help us to improve our skill, quality, and efficiency and allow us to produce high-quality cells and modules in the industry. This association will help us to enhance our product portfolio to develop and build new cell configurations and module sizes,” said Manjunatha, managing director of Emmvee.
Emmvee is the first Indian solar company to associate with Fraunhofer ISE on a PV cell line.
“Fraunhofer ISE’s expertise in advanced cell manufacturing technologies, complex process interactions, and profound engineering approach is as unique as Emmvee practices. We are proud to be the first Indian solar company to associate with Fraunhofer ISE. We strongly believe that this collaboration allows us to deliver industry leading efficiency within the timelines.” said Suhas Donthi, Director, Emmvee.
Currently, Emmvee has 1.25 GW of module manufacturing capacity in Karnataka. It aims to expand its module capacity to 5 GW with 1.5 GW of mono PERC/TopCon cell capacity by 2024.

Ltd has launched a fast EV charging corridor on the Delhi–Jalandhar national highway to address the range anxiety of EV owners. These DC charging stations are strategically located on the highway at 12 BPCL fuel stations. This high-traffic highway has fast charging points installed at approx. every 100 km on both sides. 
This is the fourth such highway corridor in the country, which has been developed by BPCL. “We are on our way to set up 200 such corridors along national highways by March this year,” said Subhankar Sen, head-retail initiatives & brand, BPCL. 
BPCL also announced the launch of the Integrated Customer Program with MG Motors, which allows MG EV customers to locate BPCL EV charging stations through their car dashboards as well as the MyMG App and make payments through the HelloBPCL mobile application. MG ZS EV owners will also get the added benefits of discounted charging rates.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/02/13/new-ev-battery-offers-50-more-density-than-traditional-lithium-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV BATTERIES,LI-ION,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 13, 2023",New EV battery offers 50% more density than traditional lithium-ion batteries,"From pv magazine Global
Ionblox says it has secured $32 million in a recent Series B funding round. The funds – provided by Lilium, Applied Ventures, Temasek, and Catalus Capital – will help the startup to scale its high-power cells for electric aviation and prototype its fast-charge EV cells.
The batteries are developed with lithium-ion cells that have pre-lithiated silicon dominant anodes. Ionblox said the technology leads to a powerful combination of 50% greater energy density and five times more power over lithium-ion batteries, while enabling fast-charge times of 10 minutes. The cell performance has been verified by Idaho National Laboratory.
A rapid charge can power 80% of the battery’s capacity in 10 minutes. For a 300-mile vehicle, this means you can charge 240 miles in the time it would take to stop at a normal gas station. Idaho Labs tests of 12 Ah pouch cells confirmed energy density of 315 Wh/kg. The battery can operate 1,000 charge cycles at the C/3 charge rate while retaining nearly 90% of original capacity.
The company said the breakthroughs in battery capability are particularly well-suited for cutting-edge electric aircraft like Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircrafts (eVTOL), where weight must be minimized, and power output maximized. The large-format pouch cells of up to 50 Ah, which also have applications in ground EVs, are currently being built on Ionblox’s pilot production lines.
“The Ionblox technology enables one of the highest performance cells for eVTOL aircraft existing today,” said Yves Yemsi, chief operating officer at Lilium. Yemsi’s company will work to integrate the new battery tech into its conforming aircraft, the Lilium Jet.
“Test results to date are showing the technology will deliver not only superior energy and power density for the Lilium Jet at launch but also very good aging performance,” said Yemsi. Lilium said it will support continuous improvement and industrialization of the technology.
The battery provider received a development contract from the United States Advanced Battery Consortium to develop low-cost, fast-charge EV batteries. Ionblox is also partnering with Applied Materials for semiconductor equipment supply.
This second Series B round builds on a $24 million investment round in October, 2022. Founded in Fremont, California in 2017, as Zenlabs, Ionblox has more than 40 issued patents for pre-lithiation for all types of silicon-based anodes.
