The agreement will see Hygenco build, own and operate a multi-megawatt green hydrogen facility for 20 years.
The plant will also purportedly be the first multi-megawatt scale plant with a long-term offtake in Asia to be commissioned in the next 12 months.
The green hydrogen plant will help Jindal Stainless Ltd reduce its carbon emissions by about 2,700 metric tonnes per year.
“This is one of the most significant landmarks for the hydrogen industry in India and globally as it demonstrates the competitiveness and cost-efficiency of Green Hydrogen. We are honored to partner with one of the largest conglomerates globally and help decarbonize steel production, one of the most energy-intensive industries,” said Amit Bansal, CEO of Hygenco.
The state-of-the-art and fully autonomous plant will be controlled by an advanced energy management and control system. The system monitors several parameters, including hydrogen generation, renewable energy generation, states of charge, pressure, and temperature and makes autonomous real-time decisions for achieving high efficiency. The technology enables the company to augment the hydrogen yield and deliver cost-competitive hydrogen to the end clients.
Hygenco aims to invest more than $300 million in green hydrogen projects across India in the next three years.
The large-scale adoption and scale-up of green hydrogen across industries is vital for India, which is significantly dependent on imports for its energy needs. This will significantly push the government’s ambitious National Hydrogen Mission, which envisages the production of five million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.

Module-level power electronics (MLPE), where an inverter or optimizer is attached to each PV module, allowing for its current and voltage to be controlled individually, has been around for a long time but seen relatively few system owners prepared to make the additional investment or understand the added complexity.
However, a report published this week by IHS Markit, now part of S&P Global, suggests that change may be air for MLPE, thanks a range of market influences. The report, aptly titled Module Level Power Electronics, finds that the market for MLPE grew by 33% between 2019 and 2021, and that last year, in the residential sector at least, around one third of new PV installations came with MLPE.
For residential PV, rapid shutdown capability is increasingly outlined in safety regulations both to prevent the unlikely occurrence of a system catching fire, and to remove the danger of firefighters having to deal with dangerously high voltages. The United States was first to introduce this regulation, and Thailand, the Philippines and others have since followed suit, with other major PV markets including China reportedly considering rapid shutdown requirements as well. And since MLPE is one of the simplest ways to meet these safety requirements, the regulations have been key to its growth.
As PV’s popularity continues to grow, more complicated systems are being built with modules partially shaded at different times of day, facing in different directions, etc. Here MLPE can minimize energy losses, compared to a string inverter system whose output is limited to that of the lowest performing module connected to it.
Also driving the trend toward MLPE is the general trend toward smaller, distributed generation systems that are likely to make better use of it. IHS Markit finds that falling costs, supportive policies and increasingly innovative business models have driven growth in the segment, now expected to account for almost 43% of global PV installations between 2022 and 2025.
“Ten years ago, rooftop installations were largely concentrated in Europe, however as other markets have developed, a more diverse picture has emerged,” reads the report. “China (mainland) has since bolstered rooftop PV installations which has contributed to Asia Pacific surpassing EMEA as the main market for rooftop PV. China (mainland) is expected to comprise 32% of global rooftop installations in 2022, while EMEA is expected to represent 27%, driven by Germany, Netherlands, and Poland. The Americas region is set to comprise 16% in 2022, supported by the United States and Brazil.”
For now, the United State remains the largest market for MLPE thanks to its early move on regulation, but movements show that it is becoming much more common elsewhere, even in regions where no rapid shutdown requirement exists. “In recent years, the United States’ dominance in the MLPE market has been challenged by certain markets in Europe such as Netherlands and Germany, in South America such as Brazil and in Asia such as Australia,” it says. “While consumers are not obliged to adopt these technologies, they have been persuaded by other benefits such as optimized yield, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and in certain cases, easier installation.”
Beyond this, IHS Markit finds the rise of the ‘smarthome’ concept, where system owners want a high level of control over their power generation and consumption, as another driving factor, alongside the easier operations & maintenance that’s afforded by being able to collect system data at the module level, and in the future the introduction of ‘smart modules’ supplied with built in MLPE could push this technology even further.

Any change to the contents of a PV module – whether moving to an entirely new cell technology, or simply changing the thickness of the glass in front of the cells– can affect its performance in the field and its susceptibility to different mechanisms that reduce performance over time.
Scientists led by Sandia National Laboratories in the United States investigated how frequent changes in module technology affect their long-term performance. The group purchased 834 PV modules from the open market between 2016 and 2018, and has since been carefully monitoring their performance installed at locations with varying climate conditions – New Mexico, Colorado and Florida.
Modules were selected from seven different manufacturers, covering 13 different module types. Based on the number of manufacturers included in the study, the selection represented 55% of the US module market in 2020, based on market figures from Wood Mackenzie.
Modules were flash-tested upon arrival at their installations (testing conducted by Sandia in New Mexico, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, and the University of Central Florida. A sample of the installed modules was then tested annually and compared against control modules stored in a climate controlled dark room for the same time period.
The full testing procedure, along with the results, is described in “Onymous early-life performance degradation analysis of recent photovoltaic module technologies,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The study found that module degradation rates tend to stabilize after three to four years, and that additional flash-testing after this period could help system owners better ensure that modules are performing according to financial expectations.
They also noted significant differences between different bill of materials, even in modules from the same manufacturer. And the modules installed in the hot and humid subtropical climate in Florida saw a significantly degradation rate – though the study notes that a larger sample would be needed to verify this as a trend.
The degradation rate of 26.1% of modules installed exceeded the limits specified in the warranty, while 56.5% of those studied would continue to perform at better than 80% of their initial rating beyond 30 years in the field, assuming their degradation continues at the same rate.
“Although the costs declined sharply in the last decade, module degradation rates do not seem to be affected, at least for the sample investigated in this work,” the paper concludes. “This is a very encouraging result, but more opportunities exist to reduce Rd to levels that enable longer PV module lifetimes.”
