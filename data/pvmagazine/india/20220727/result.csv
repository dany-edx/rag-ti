At COP26, India had announced its aim to attain 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity and meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewables by 2030.
So far, much of the renewable energy expansion in India has taken place primarily through large grid-scale projects. In comparison, the nation had installed only 7.6 GW of decentralized rooftop solar capacity as on March 31, 2022 against the target of 40 GW.
The report states implementation of feed-in-tariff in the kW range would lead to a surge in decentralized capacity addition in rural India through private investment. The feed-in-tariff has to be well above the price bids received for large solar projects as there are higher unit costs in dispersed small installations as well as greater risks. This would reduce distribution company (DISCOM) costs, provide better quality power in villages, and increase farmer’s incomes.
Further, the nation could tap the immense potential of canal-top solar. All canals could be covered with solar panels by 2030, and a minimum of 10 GW capacity could be created on major canal systems of India, the report adds.
No pathway to renewable energy transition is plausible without adequately addressing the issue of storage. “India should initiate storage projects using mature technologies for pumped storage plants (PSP), concentrated solar thermal plants (CSP), and batteries,” observe the authors. “The State should take the initiative in developing pumped storage plants.”
Apart from advocating strategies, the paper examines the prospects of India growing into a cost-effective and competitive manufacturing hub for renewable energy. It suggests the extension of Production Linked Incentive scheme to cover the full spectrum of renewable energy equipment production, solar panels, mirrors and sensors for solar thermal, batteries for grid use, and hydrogen.
With the green energy open access rules being notified, the DISCOMs need to give Commercial and Industrial consumers the choice to buy carbon free electricity on a real time basis with separate tariffs. This choice, observe the TERI authors, may be extended to all consumers since it would accelerate the transition to carbon free electricity.
Timely and appropriate action in implementing the requisite range of measures is the key to India meeting the 2030 goals, assert the authors.

(TCIL), which has diversified into executing civil infrastructure and power projects, has invited expression of interest from rooftop solar system installers to work as its back-end partners.
The selected partners will set up rooftop solar systems of different capacities across various states of India, based on TCIL’s client requirement for providing the capacity ranging from 1 kW to 8 MW.  
The work includes supply, installation, testing, and commissioning. TCIL will empanel the bidder quoting the lowest rate on a rate contract basis. It also expects the back-end partner to explore business leads in various government organizations to work with TCIL for the rooftop pv installation.
“Selected bidder will have to sign an MoU with TCIL before TCIL submits bid/proposal to the end client. The rate contract shall be valid for initially three years, which may be extendable for another two years based on the mutual consent,” states TCIL tender document.

Ltd (ONGC), India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company, has teamed up with renewable energy major Greenko to tap opportunities in renewables, green hydrogen and its derivatives including green ammonia.
The two companies recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on this collaboration.
Greenko harnesses green hydrogen potential by using low-cost RE power for green hydrogen production.
ONGC had 348 MW of installed renewables capacity as of May 30, 2022, and targets 10 GW by 2040. It is exploring new energy opportunities to reduce its carbon footprint. ONGC Energy Centre Trust, a dedicated center created by ONGC for holistic research in non-conventional energy sources, has already taken up projects on the thermo-chemical reactor for hydrogen and fuel cells.
With the latest announcement, ONGC has joined the list of Indian oil and gas counterparts foraying into green hydrogen and ammonia production. IndianOil (Indian Oil Corporation Limited), for instance, is setting up a green hydrogen plant at its Mathura refinery in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. The green hydrogen will replace carbon-emitting fuels used in the refinery to process crude oil into value-added products such as petrol and diesel.
Meanwhile, GAIL has commenced India’s first project to mix hydrogen into the natural gas system. It supplies hydrogen-blended natural gas to Avantika Gas Ltd, a city gas distribution company operating in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.
ONGC’s MoU with Greenko will be valid for two years. “This MoU is in line with the National Hydrogen Mission launched by Prime Minister in making India a global green hydrogen hub. The activities envisaged under this MoU will contribute toward India’s target of producing 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen per annum by 2030. It will also act as a stepping stone for ONGC to achieve renewable energy targets as per its Energy Strategy 2040,” ONGC stated in a media release.
