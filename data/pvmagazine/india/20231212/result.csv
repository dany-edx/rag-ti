The company, now part of the Kiwa Group, said the new tool combines operational data review, field inspections, and on-site measurements with a Python-based tool that merges SCADA data and on-site information.
The new approach is implemented on the ground, where PI Berlin carries out forensic analysis. In addition, PI Berlin technicians interview the operators of PV plants.
“Beyond conventional practices, additional measurements are carried out to examine the operating characteristics of key elements such as capacitors, inductances and printed circuit boards,” a PI Berlin spokesperson told pv magazine. “Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of the actual switching of the IGBTs during operation.”
Researchers analyzed PV plant documentation provided by clients, combining field inspections and SCADA data analysis. They used a Python tool to synthesize field measurements and plot graphs, streamlining the processing of operational data.
Root causes include problems such as defective printed circuit boards and communication failures.
“This procedure is useful for PV plant operators, PV plant owners or EPC companies whose warranty is still active,” the spokesperson said.

The company is investing INR 800 crore ($96 million) to build a new plant near Sambalpur in Odisha that will initially produce 25,000 tonnes of the foils for Lithium-ion and Sodium-ion cells.
The factory will be located alongside a 25 MW solar power plant. It is scheduled for commissioning in July 2025 and will supplement Hindalco’s existing facility at Mouda in Maharashtra.
By 2030, the demand for battery-grade aluminum foil in India is expected to grow manifold to 40,000 tonnes, primarily driven by mushrooming growth in gigafactories for advanced cell manufacturing.
“We are seeing a fast traction in battery materials demand, driven by an impressive outlook for the electric vehicle and grid storage sectors. Raw material localization is critical in such strategic sectors,” said Satish Pai, managing director, Hindalco Industries. “Hindalco is thus making various investments in battery materials and technologies towards building Atmanirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India]. Investment in this new battery foil mill is another such step in this direction.”
Hindalco already manufactures fine-quality battery foils at its Mouda unit in Maharashtra. The Mouda unit is currently in the process of qualifying with Lithium-ion cell manufacturers in India, Europe, and the United States.
The new unit in Odisha will further augment Hindalco’s capability to supply material to Gigafactories across the world.
High-performance aluminium foils are used by cell makers as a current collector for the cathode materials. “Hindalco’s deep understanding of metallurgy, extensive experience in sheet and foil rolling and access to its own aluminium metal gives it a formidable launch pad. The company is already developing such foils to raise the bar on mechanical strength, fine-tune the thickness and enhance surface characteristics of these advanced application foils. It is working on new coatings on the battery foils that will boost performance by delivering better adhesion, lower resistance, and reduced corrosion. It will tap its robust R&D to provide tailor-made solutions for its customers,” stated Hindalco.
Hindalco is also working closely with original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to co-develop and make critical components like battery enclosures, motor housings, busbars, structural and safety components, and lightweight load bodies, many of which are being designed and developed for the first time in India.

A group of scientists from the University of Linz and the Johannes Kepler University in Austria has carried out lengthy damp-heat tests on double glass solar modules made with UV-transparent ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and polyolefin elastomer (POE) encapsulants for over 10,000 hours and has found several advantages of using POE encapsulants compared to EVA materials.
“The investigations clearly revealed that POE is outperforming EVA especially when it comes to long-term durability of double glass modules under damp heat conditions,” the research’s corresponding author, Gernot Wallner, told pv magazine, noting that the main advantages of POE are less water uptake and scattering effects, improved interfacial strength in hot-humid environment, as well as a tendency to resist the formation of acidic degradation products and an enhanced barrier capability against sodium ion diffusion.
“Especially in encapsulants of double glass modules, the formation and transport of low molar mass substances, such as acidic degradation products, water vapor or sodium ions is crucial for the long-term durability,” he added.
The study involved preparing double glass laminate specimens measuring 25 mm × 25 mm× 7 mm. The UV transparency of the encapsulant materials was achieved by adding hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS). Alternative stabilizers, such as phenolic antioxidants, were avoided due to their acidic tendencies.
The specimens were placed in an environmental chamber at relative humidity for exposure up to 10,000 hours under damp heat conditions of 85 C at 85 % and wer then shear load tested, exploring several failure modes.
Materials were characterized throughout the experiment with several tools, including microscopy visual appearance, UV-visible-near infrared (UVVISNIR) spectroscopy for hemispheric and diffuse transmittance, compressive shear testing (CST) to determine changes in ultimate shear load, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure effects on the thermal transition in the melting range, and to assess compressive shear fractures. The researchers also used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XP) and macro and microscopic infrared testing (FTIR).
“The main surprise was the excellent adherence of low-polar hydrocarbon-based POE to the solar glass substrates at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the adherence was even improved under hot-humid conditions,” said Wallner.
The results of the test were presented in the study “Effect of global damp heat ageing on debonding of crosslinked EVA- and POE-glass laminates” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
Looking ahead, the researchers see further research required on the durability of double-glass laminates for EVA, POE, thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulants, as well as toughened solar glass substrates, with a focus on the effects of UV and damp heat loading conditions at the specimen level to better understand UV weathering effects and superimposed cyclic mechanical or electrical stresses.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/12/12/ku-leuven-spinoff-plans-mw-scale-production-of-solar-hydrogen-panels/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 12, 2023",KU Leuven spinoff plans MW-scale production of solar-hydrogen panels,"From pv magazine Global
After years of fine-tuning its solar-hydrogen panel technology, Solhyd has spun off from KU Leuven in Belgium and is looking to apply its potential in market-oriented, pilot projects and further develop its manufacturing capabilities.
The newly established company has raised seed capital from a group of entrepreneurs active in Flanders, which have committed to injecting up to €6 million into the company over the next few years. The first tranche of €2 million was put on the table on Thursday.
“We have received a lot of interest from investors from all corners of the world,” Jan Rongé, CEO of Solhyd, told pv magazine. “We will now focus on establishing a network of partners, suppliers and system integrators and get ready for megawatt-scale production by 2026.”
The Solhyd technology combines a regular PV panel and a proprietary hydrogen-producing layer which are connected via gas tubes. Electricity produced by the top layer solar panel is used by catalysts to split water molecules extracted directly from the air using a membrane. The system is said to produce 250 liters of hydrogen per day, at a peak efficiency of 15%.
“The average real life efficiency we are targeting is 12% and upwards,” Rongé said.
Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with most commercial PV modules, which are directly plugged into the hydrogen-producing system.
“At this point, we prefer to go with mono PERC panels, but we are also very much looking forward to perovskite-silicon tandems, which we expect to be a very important step in our own development,” Rongé said. “However, in the long run, it makes sense to partner up with certain PV suppliers to optimize the technological synergies such as dimensions and operating voltage.”
So far, the technology has been tested in various climates and demonstrated that it can be deployed almost anywhere in the world.
“The determining factors is the sun. The hydrogen output directly depends on the solar input,” Rongé said. “Our panels can store humidity, so if you have a few dry days, that should not be a problem. The system has some resilience in that respect.”
The technology has also been tested in Africa, where it showed even better results than in Belgium.
“A Belgium summer night is drier and shorter than most African nights,” Rongé said. “It is only in the middle of the dessert that our panel would have a problem to work efficiently,” he said. “In northwestern Europe conditions, one module can produce around 6 kg of hydrogen per year, but in more sunny regions you can easily go to 12 kg per year.”
A 1,000 square-meter roof would then produce 2 tons to 4 tons of hydrogen per year. A smaller roof with 20 hydrogen panels would produce 120 kg to  240 kg per year, which is 4 MWh to 8 MWh of hydrogen energy.
Most recently, Solhyd finished a batch of 10 panels to be deployed at a testing project in Belgium.
“There is still a lot of manual work involved and we are learning which steps we need and quality control measures to facilitate and speed up the production process,” Rongé said.
Solhyd’s goal is to deliver a plug-and-play solution which will be primarily applied in industries such as the steel and chemical industry to make their operations more sustainable.
“Making hydrogen at your own premises with a modular technology like ours will also be interesting for SMEs,” Rongé said. “They have a really hard time finding affordable hydrogen or finding green hydrogen at all, because transporting hydrogen is quite expensive especially for those who are not located at ports.”
He said they continually assess the safety qualities of the technology internally and with external experts to evaluate potential risks. He noted that Solhyd panels generate hydrogen at a low pressure of 300 mbar to 500 mbar, similar to gas distribution grid pressure.
“We have designed our hydrogen panels to work at a very low pressure bacause it is cost optimal and safer. They contain almost no hydrogen at all or less one gram per panel so that means the risk is very limited,” Ronge said. “The risk only starts when you want to collect and store the hydrogen at a central location.”
