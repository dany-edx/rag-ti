The domestic manufacturers, at whose instance the probe was initiated, withdrew their application for probe citing that the price pressure on them due to the alleged dumping had considerably eased with the imposition of basic customs duty on solar cells and modules.
Notably, post-initiation of the anti-dumping probe, the government imposed a basic customs duty of 40% on solar modules and 25% on cells from April this year.
“The said levy covering the entire scope of the product under investigation has alleviated the price pressure being suffered by the domestic industry due to the dumping from the subject countries to a considerable extent, though not fully,” stated ISMA.
The DGTR launched the investigation into the solar cells, whether or not assembled into modules or panels, coming from China, Thailand, and Vietnam, on May 15, 2021, based on an application filed by Mundra Solar PV, Jupiter Solar Power, and Jupiter International, through ISMA.
In their application, the manufacturers sought the imposition of anti-dumping duties to protect them from material injury caused by such imports at unfairly low prices.
The DGTR launched the probe as it identified prima facie evidence suggesting that the normal value of solar cells in each of the three exporting countries significantly surpassed their net export prices.

For Africa’s commercial and industrial (C&I) solar industry, 2022 has truly been a watershed year. The sector has seen an unprecedented level of activity in the form of mergers and acquisitions and large scale investments.
Oslo-based Empower New Energy raised $100 million for 150 MW of industrial solar projects while Starsight Energy merged with SolarAfrica. In September, Daystar Power (the company that I co-founded with Christian Wessels) was acquired by Shell, its first acquisition of a power business on the continent.
This flurry of activity might make it seem that C&I solar in Africa is an overnight success, but the sector has been slowly gaining traction since the model first emerged in 2015. A confluence of factors this year – historically high diesel prices, aging power grids, mounting pressure to reduce carbon emissions, and the growing adoption of solar by large multinational manufacturers – have come together to lead to the industry’s tipping point. And the exciting part is that African C&I solar has barely scratched the surface.
Like any new industry, it took time for African C&I solar to gain a hold with businesses. As the model was new, corporate clients had their doubts about solar energy. Chief financial officers were new to signing long-term contracts for on-site installations with zero upfront operating expenditure costs. Facility managers at large factories had concerns about the effectiveness of solar PV or were concerned it would disrupt their existing power set-ups, such as multiple diesel generators, or connection to the grid. However, the cost savings from integrating solar energy into self-generation were undeniable. Today, solar electricity costs roughly $0.10/kWh to $0.11/kWh, which is five times cheaper than electricity generated from a diesel generator ($0.55/kWh to $0.70/kWh) and on par with the national grid ($0.10/kWh to $0.17/kWh).

In West Africa, especially in Nigeria, businesses effectively run on diesel generators, given the scarcity of grid power. Nigerian businesses regularly cited diesel as their second or third largest expense. Manufacturers point to diesel as representing 40% of operating costs. By replacing diesel generators with solar for daytime power, businesses could save up to 40% on their energy costs. That benefit to the bottom line persuaded many West African businesses to adopt solar. When the first large manufacturers installed solar at their factories, many others in the business community followed suit.
The historical surge in diesel prices – ignited by Covid-related supply chain disruptions and aggravated by Russia’s war in Ukraine – further accelerated the shift to solar. In Nigeria, diesel prices have surged 290%, from NGN 250 ($0.57) per liter to more than NGN 800 per liter, forcing many businesses to reduce operating hours or shut down entirely. Given the new-found trust in the C&I solar model, after years of growing awareness and adoption by large corporations, Nigerian businesses rushed to adopt solar to reduce their dependence on costly diesel generators. This year, Daystar Power received three times more inbound sales requests, just like other solar developers in the country.
Across sub-Saharan Africa, national grids, lacking investment, are struggling to provide reliable power to businesses. At the time of writing, the last time Nigeria’s power grid suffered widespread blackouts was on Sept. 26 and it is likely that it has happened again by the time you read this article. With 12.5 GW of installed electricity generation capacity, only a quarter of that amount of power is actually produced. The country’s grid cannot satisfy the rapidly growing power needs of people and businesses.
Businesses with cold-chain operations, such as pharmaceutical companies and fisheries – as well as heavy industry manufacturers – cannot afford a minute of downtime. Back-up diesel generators are not just nice to have, they are an absolute – and expensive – necessity.
The situation is similar across the region. Yet, given the lack of investment to upgrade aging infrastructure, utilities are forced to raise grid prices.
Multinational corporations, both those already operating in sub-Saharan Africa and those getting ready to expand, have rather strict guidelines when it comes to sustainable development goals. Clean energy might have been a novelty a decade ago but today it is ingrained in the business strategy of some of the biggest companies in the world.
“Should we install solar panels?” is no longer the question. Now, companies are instead asking: “How can we capitalize on solar at scale?” And as procurement departments of these multinationals seek out providers to solarize their operations across the continent, developers with a solid track record will have many big-ticket opportunities in the immediate future.
The African C&I solar sector has a bright future ahead, with Nigeria’s industry alone worth at least $15 billion per year. Increasing adoption rates and changing market conditions have created an environment ripe for newcomers who might have overlooked the continent previously. The advent of novel – at least for this continent – business models, such as carbon credit trading, will only deepen the market. It’s a very exciting time to be in this space.
Jasper Graf von Hardenberg is a co-founder and group chief executive of West African C&I solar installer Daystar Power, which was acquired by Shell in September.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/14/worlds-first-utility-scale-rock-based-storage-facility-goes-online-in-italy/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022","World’s first utility-scale, rock-based storage facility goes online in Italy","From pv magazine Global
Italian energy group Enel has commissioned a rock-based thermal storage system (TES) in Tuscany, Italy.
The plant is based on Brenmiller Energy’s storage technology. The Israel-based company’s system uses rocks that store excess energy as heat, then releases that heat to generate steam for electricity. The system has a capacity of about 24 MWh of thermal capacity and can be fully charged and discharged in about five hours.
“In this first-of-a-kind application, the TES is integrated with a combined cycle gas turbine power plant to partially decouple production from the gas turbine and the bottoming steam cycle,” said Nicola Rossi, head of innovation at Enel’s renewable energy unit, Enel Green Power. “The TES is charged by steam coming from the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).”
Rossi said the aim is to increase the overall flexibility of the thermoelectric plant, which means having faster ramp-up rates, reducing minimum load, and having faster startup times from warm conditions.
“In this way, the plant can offer more services to the grid, thus increasing the overall renewable energy hosting capacity of the electrical system,” he said. 
They use high-pressure steam at around 9 tons per hour at 550 C and 80 bar to charge the TES during the charging phase. Condensate coming out of the TES goes back to the steam cycle at a degasator. During the discharging phase, 150 C water feeds the TES at around 6 tons per hour. The intermediate pressure steam then goes back to the HRSG to feed the intermediate pressure steam turbine stage at 360 C.
“[This] will allow for the technology to be tested in very challenging conditions,” Rossi said. “In the future, the system will be charged electrically through resistors fed by solar and wind power plants. The heat accumulated in the system will be then used to feed industrial sectors that need heat for their production processes and that today use gas to produce the required heat, or to generate electricity”
Enel believes that the most interesting business case for the system would be using it for electrification purposes, to make heat demand from industrial customers more flexible.
“The TES will be used both as power-to-heat equipment and a thermal storage,” Rossi said. “In fact, TES technologies already have a configuration that uses a direct electric charge with resistors instead of steam during the charging phase. Therefore, the TES matches a renewable energy generation profile and the heat demand profile, supporting 24/7 full decarbonization.”
Enel says another interesting application is that the TES replaces a conventional boiler in phased-out thermal power plants.
“In this configuration, an electrically charged TES integrated with the plant’s existing power island, including turbines, generator, condenser and other main equipment, represents a real power-to-power energy storage system, that despite the lower efficiency, offers a competitive solution in terms of levelized cost of storage (LCoS) for long durations of over eight hours and very large-scale applications of hundreds of MWh up to GWh,” it said.
TES could also be an interesting technology for hybridizing different generation assets, according to the company.
“For instance, heat accumulated by PV or wind in peak production hours could be reinjected in existing plants such as geothermal plants to produce more energy during demand peak hours,” Rossi said. “In all the above-mentioned future applications, the TES could be directly coupled with RES (PV or other) or connected to the grid and using other tools like PPAs to manage the charging phase.”
