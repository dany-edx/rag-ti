Yara has agreed to the green ammonia offtake of 100,000 tonnes annually in the first phase and potential further offtake from the project’s second phase as this develops.
Acme and Scatec are building the Omani project through a 50/50 joint venture. They will begin developing the project’s first phase in the Special Economic Zone at Duqmto. Phase one will produce 100,000 tons of green ammonia per year with the help of 300 MW of electrolyzer capacity and 500 MW of solar generation capacity.
Once fully developed, a second phase will be added, and the project is expected to produce up to 1.1 million tonnes of green ammonia annually.
Oman has excellent conditions for renewable energy generation. It is also a strategic location to produce green ammonia for export to Europe and Asia, which are the pacesetters in reducing CO2 emissions.
For Yara, the green ammonia supply will contribute to producing green fertilizer and decarbonizing other industries like shipping, power, and steel.
“Yara Clean Ammonia is working on enabling the clean ammonia market. The green ammonia from Oman will go into our scalable distribution system and contribute to emission-free fuel for deep-sea shipping, power production, and fertilizer globally,” said Magnus Krogh Ankarstrand, president of Yara Clean Ammonia.

The leaders of these nations made the announcement under the I2U2 framework, wherein they have agreed to increase joint investment in water, energy, transport, space, health, and food security.
This project puts into action a broader US government policy to work with its overseas partners to set the world on a sustainable climate pathway. Moreover, this project has the potential to support significant exports of US-based clean energy solutions.
The US Trade and Development Agency has funded a feasibility study for the $330 million project. It awarded the grant to India’s Shivman Wind Energy, which chose Illinois-based EverGreen Power as the contract partner.
The UAE-based companies are exploring opportunities to serve as critical knowledge and investment partners in this project. Israel and the United States intend to work with the UAE and India to highlight private-sector opportunities. Indian companies are keen to participate in this project and contribute to India’s goal of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, read a joint statement by I2U2.
The project’s hybrid design will mitigate renewable energy variability to help stabilize Gujarat’s regional electricity grid, increase overall efficiency, and lower electricity costs.

TP Saurya won the project through tariff-based competitive bidding followed by an e-Reverse auction.
The project is scheduled for commissioning within 24 months of the power purchase agreement (PPA) signing.
With this win, Tata Power’s total renewables portfolio has swelled to 5,524 MW, including an installed capacity of 3,634 MW and 1,890 MW under various stages of implementation.
The Karnataka project is the latest addition to TP Saurya’s wind-solar hybrid portfolio after winning a 300 MW project last year. To build the 300 MW project, it received a Letter of Award (LoA) from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL).
