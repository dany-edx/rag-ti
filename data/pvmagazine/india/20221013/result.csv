With this, India will reach a renewable energy capacity of 405 GW in FY 2029-30–on track to surpass its target of 50% of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. 
Thermal power, on the other hand, is set to progressively lose market share, with the expanding use of domestically produced thermal energy in response to recent global events likely to be a “short-term hiccup”, the report says. 
“India has been one of the champions globally in adopting renewable energy as part of its energy transition. While recent headwinds faced by the renewable energy sector and rapidly rising power demand has forced the government to re-look at thermal power as a short-term fix, the government’s clean energy capacity addition targets, as well as commitments by various corporations, remain ambitious,” says the report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, director, South Asia, IEEFA. 
In the utility-scale segment, the top 16 players are expected to deploy a cumulative RE capacity of 231 GW in the eight years ending in 2030. The estimation is based on these players’ current capacities and commitments. Leading the list is state-owned NTPC, which targets 60 GW of cumulative RE capacity by 2030 from the current 5.7 GW. Adani Green Energy targets 45 GW and Tata Power, ReNew Power, and Acme Solar 25 GW each.
“The Indian government seems unbending in ensuring the renewable energy targets are met through facilitating growth across the sector’s spectrum. Financially strong investors, such as the Indian government, domestic conglomerates, and some of the biggest global investors, back most industry players, lending them the firepower needed to fulfil their capacity addition targets,” says Garg.
Beyond utility-scale capacity additions, rooftop solar, solar pumps, and renewable energy capacity addition by non-power public sector companies will supplement power generation from non-fossil fuel sources.
“On the decentralized renewable energy side, several segments have the potential to grow multifold as policy-side reforms streamline current bottlenecks and demand-side drivers provide lucrative returns,” says co-author Shantanu Shrivastava, energy finance analyst, IEEFA. 
“On the demand side, green hydrogen is a major force that promises to massively drive India’s clean energy ambitions. Corporates, such as the Adani Group and Reliance Industries, have wholeheartedly supported the country’s green hydrogen policy, announced in June 2022, and its 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) target, with several major commitments.” 
The report finds that India’s green hydrogen target of 5 MTPA by 2030 will require an additional renewable energy capacity of 118 GW.  
To put the ambitions of Indian corporates into context, the report also undertakes a study of similar clean energy commitments by four global majors – NextEra Energy (U.S.), RWE (Germany), Ørsted (Denmark), and Enel (Italy). 
“Understanding the clean energy commitments of domestic players compared with global counterparts also provides perspective on where India’s renewable energy plans stand relative to international developments and what Indian utility players can leverage from the experience of global leaders,” says co-author Tim Buckley, Director, CEF. 
“We find that the ambitious decarbonization targets of the four global companies, which do not rely on carbon offsets or carbon capture and storage, have helped their share prices outperform broader equity markets. It has also helped the companies tap a rapidly growing global green bond market.”

“Trina Solar’s n-type technology will offer an alternative high-power solar module for the next generation of solar projects in India as the country mobilizes to meet the ambitious renewable energy targets laid out by the government,” said Gaurav Mathur, India Head of Trina Solar.
Trina has been present in the Indian market for nearly 12 years and has shipped more than 8 GW of solar modules to the country. With the n-type product launch, the company is looking to strengthen its foothold in the Indian market.
“In India, module capacity is migrating from polycrystalline to mono PERC. However, in China, migration is taking place from mono PERC to HJT and TopCon (n-type). The Indian market will evolve accordingly as mono PERC matures.
“India is an important market for us. In support of the Indian government’s push to massively increase renewable energy capacity in the years ahead, we are ready to supply the country with high-power, high-efficiency, high-reliability, and high-energy yield PV solutions that will help our customers embrace solar energy while lowering the levelized cost of electricity,” said Mathur.

The two companies recently entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) for this captive solar power project. 
“Collectively, this installation is expected to generate 215 million units of electricity, potentially mitigating over 1.7 lakh tonnes of carbon emissions. This is equivalent to planting over 2.72 lakh teak trees over a lifetime,” stated Tata Power.
Tata Power is working closely with Tata Motors on installing solar rooftop projects at some of their plants in India. To date, it has cumulatively installed 45 MW of solar rooftops across Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle plants in Pune, Pantnagar, Jamshedpur, and Dharwar.
Tata Motors, as a signatory to the RE100, is committed to using 100% renewable energy in its operations. In FY2021-22, across all its plants in India, the company generated 92.39 million kWh of renewable electricity for its manufacturing operations, which is 19.4% of its total power consumption.
Tata Power’s rooftop solar portfolio includes one of the world’s largest rooftops (16 MW) at a single location at Radhasoami Satsang Beas, Amritsar; 2.67 MW carport at Cochin International Airport; 820.8 kWp solar-powered cricket stadium in Mumbai; and 120 kW solar vertical farm at Dell Technologies in Bengaluru.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/13/ae-solar-unveils-n-type-topcon-solar-modules-with-22-2-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 13, 2022",AE Solar unveils n-type TOPCon solar modules with 22.2% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
AE Solar has unveiled three different solar modules based on n-type tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) cell technology.
“The new module will be produced at our 1,500 MW factory in China were we recently upgraded our production lines,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The modules have a glass-glass bill of materials with polyolefin elastomer (POE) as encapsulation material. This makes the module highly durable and perfect not only for moderate climates but also for extreme climates such as deserts or tropical areas. The modules show relatively higher durability against wind and snow compared to typical single-glass modules.”
The largest module series includes five panel versions with power outputs of 555 W to 575 W and power conversion efficiency ranging from 21.50% to 22.28%. The open-circuit voltage is between 50.07 V and 50.68 V and the short-circuit current is between 14.07 A and 14.31 A. The modules have a see 2,278 mm x 1,133 mm x 35 mm and weigh in at 33 kg.
The mid-size series consists of five products with wattage spanning from 460 W to 480 W and efficiency comprised between 21.26% and 22.18%. The open-circuit voltage is between 42.05 V and 42.71 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.99 A and 14.33 A. The modules measure 1,910 mm x 1,133 mm x 30 mm and weigh 29 kg.
The smallest series features five modules with a power output ranging from 410 W to 430 W and an efficiency of 20.99% to 22.01%. These panels measure 1,724 mm x 1,133 mm x 30 mm and weigh 26 kg. Their open-circuit voltage is between 37.45 V and 38.26 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.88 A and 14.17 A.
All panels have an operating temperature between -40 C and 85 C and a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius. They all feature junction boxes with IP 68 ratings, 20 mm solar glass, and 30 mm anodized aluminum alloy frames.
The manufacturer offers a 15-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee for 87.4% of the initial yield. It said the TOPCon technology offers advantages over conventional monocrystalline PERC products, including lower degradation rates in the first year due to light-induced degradation (LID) or light-elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID).
“The TOPCon modules have a very close efficiency to heterojunction (HTJ) and interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells with a positive factor of a better price and higher stability in the supply chain,” said the company. 
*The article was amended on October 12 to reflect that the company’s manufacturing facility in China has a capacity of 1.5 GW.
