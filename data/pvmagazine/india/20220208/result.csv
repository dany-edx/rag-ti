The developer shall execute the project for Greenlab Diamonds LLP, Surat, under ‘captive power producer (CPP)’ segment.
Under captive power production vertical, KPI Global either sells or leases part of its Solarism Plant’s land for the solar power plant of customers and develops the solar power project on their behalf.
In a separate development, Sungrow has signed a contract with Roofsol Energy to implement its solar inverter solutions for 50 MW solar projects across India.
The latest order follows Sungrow’s 75 MW inverter solution contract with Solarworld Energy Solutions Private Limited, wherein they will co-operate on the 75 MW solar power project being set up by SJVN Limited in Uttar Pradesh.

The new production base is equipped to make mono PERC, half-cut, multi-busbar technology to produce high-efficiency solar modules with a power output of 530-610Wp.
Saatvik is setting up an additional 1.2GW of solar production capacity in Gandhidham, Gujarat, by the end of March next year and has said it plans to create an “eco system” featuring module and cell manufacturing.
“As a part of the government plan to achieve 280GW of solar capacity by 2030, and to bring cutting-edge technology to India for manufacturing high-efficiency modules, we have just added 500MW [of] mono PERC, half-cut, MBB [multi-busbar] technology to produce high-efficiency solar PV modules,” said Saatvik CEO Prashant Mathur. “Further, we are setting up a greenfield manufacturing project in Gandhidham, Gujarat, to raise manufacturing output to 3GW by 2023.”

The selected developer will be required to set up the project at the SNM hospital on a “build-own-operate” basis, for the supply of electricity, heat, and oxygen to the hospital.
The hospital shall sign a 15-year supply agreement (SA) with the successful bidder for the procurement of electricity, heat, and oxygen.
“The scope of work includes design, supply, testing, commissioning of green hydrogen-based complete power-to-power cycle system along with metering arrangement for supply of electricity and heat,” as per the tender document.
The hydrogen production, compression, and storage components of the project shall be installed at the premises of the SECI’s 20 MW(AC) solar project with a 20 MW/40 MWh battery energy storage system in Taru village of Leh. The combined heat and power (CHP) fuel cell or gas engine and associated system shall be installed at the SNM Hospital.
The project is an initiative under the Government of India’s aim to make Ladakh the first carbon-neutral territory of India. Ladakh is endowed with a multitude of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal. Comprising several remote locations and isolated hamlets, it has so far been dependent on diesel to meet its power and heat requirements, especially during winters. 
Currently, the SNM hospital receives electricity supply from the Power Development Department of Ladakh and also uses diesel generators (DG) for electricity consumption during a grid outage. The heating requirement is being met by electric boilers and diesel boilers. 
The objective of the green hydrogen project is to reduce the hospital’s dependency on diesel.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/02/08/us-government-extends-section-201-tariffs-on-imported-pv-panels-cells/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 8, 2022","US government extends Section 201 tariffs on imported PV panels, cells","From pv magazine Global
The US government has revealed that it will extend the Section 201 tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar panels and solar cells above an annual 5GW tariff rate quota, thus upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and doubling the tariff rate quota for cells.
The proclamation is seen as a “balanced solution” by many in the solar industry.
“While we are disappointed with the decision to extend Section 201 tariffs on imported solar cells and panels, we are grateful to the Biden administration for clearly considering the range of issues affected by this decision,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “Administration officials arrived at a balanced solution in upholding the exclusion for bifacial panels and increasing the tariff rate quota for cells.”
The saga surrounding the solar tariffs began after a Section 201 trade petition was filed by Suniva and SolarWorld that sought relief against what the companies said was unfair competition from overseas imports.  In 2018, former President Donald J. Trump imposed duties on solar panels and solar cells for a period of four years. In the ensuing years, many countries – including China, South Korea, and Taiwan – filed complaints with the World Trade Organization in opposition to the graduated tariffs.
One of the outcomes expected by those supporting the ruling was an increase in solar manufacturing in the United States, but that did not come to pass. It also had a negative affect on US solar installations, with the number of installed gigawatts missing projections for the first time in years, said Tony Clifford in pv magazine in 2019. Clifford was then chief development officer at Standard Solar and a board member of SEIA.
The new ruling extends the exclusion for bifacial solar panels – something that SEIA has been fighting for for three years.
“Today’s decision recognizes the importance of this innovative technology in helping to improve power output and lower costs in the utility-scale segment. It is a massive step forward in producing clean energy in America and in tackling climate change,” said Hopper.
However, not everyone in the solar industry is seeing the proclamation as offering a good balance. First Solar Chief Executive Mark Widmar said that the extension to the Section 201 safeguard excluding bifacial panels is no safeguard at all.
“This exclusion un-levels the playing field by providing unlawfully subsidized bifacial panels an instant, artificial advantage over other panel types, an advantage that is based not on real-world performance or true competitiveness, but merely on distinguishing where the cells happen to be located on the panel. With bifacial being the dominant Chinese solar product today, this decision effectively allows China to outflank American efforts to grow self-reliant solar supply chains,” said Widmar.
In order to incentivize domestic solar manufacturing, the next step is the passage of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act.
“Failing that, today’s decision places at risk billions of dollars in existing investment, thousands of jobs, our country’s energy security and a climate-critical transition to net-zero emissions,” said Widmar. “It also places at risk the over 10 gigawatts of new American manufacturing capacity announced since May 2021, as well as the thousands of new jobs here at home that were set to be created both directly, on the manufacturing floor, and indirectly across domestic supply chains.”
In writing about the extension of the solar tariffs and need for the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, Brian Lynch, director of solar plus storage at LG, wrote in an op-ed in pv magazine that “the actions we take today – as an entire industry – will affect our ability to continue to grow as we meet the imperative of installing solar to help protect our environment and grow our economy.”

French microgrid specialist Ecosun has launched Trailer Watt 15S — an autonomous solar-powered trailer that can be used to provide power in grid-disconnected environments.
The trailer has a size of 6.76 x 2.19 x 1.1 m and weighs 1.8 t. It is equipped with a foldable mast that can be raised to a height of 7 m and relies on four 50 W adjustable LEDs.
The vehicle can host between 15 solar panels with a power output of 360 W each and the resulting solar array can reach a nominal power of 5.4 kW. The inverter is a Multiplus II device provided by Victron with a rated power of between 3.5 and 8 kVa.

The trailer is also be equipped with LiFePo4 batteries, which the manufacturer claims have high stability with 4,000 charge/discharge cycles at 90% depth of discharge (DoD). Their combined capacity can reach up to 23 kWh.
The system can also be connected to an external diesel generator or to the grid for backup power.
The vehicle is towable using a civilian vehicle and is easily deployable, either hydraulically or electrically. “The Trailer-Watt 15S solar trailer is the ideal solution for military camps, construction sites and water pumping in agriculture,” the manufacturer stated. “Made from high-quality European materials, this durable structure is equipped with fixed photovoltaic modules capable of being deployed in no time at all.”
According to the company, a single person may need between five and 10 minutes to completely deploy the solar system.
