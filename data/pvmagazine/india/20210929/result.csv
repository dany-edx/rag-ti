The report, ‘Financing Trends in the Rooftop Solar Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Segment in India’, notes that much of the growth in installations so far has been driven by a few large creditworthy customers. Financial institutions are often reluctant to lend to MSMEs because they prefer borrowers with strong financial track records and good corporate credit ratings.
“MSMEs are as yet an untapped segment and could be the next drivers of growth in the market, especially considering the significant electricity cost savings offered by the adoption of rooftop solar,” said lead author Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research. “Textiles, food, and packaging are among the industries with lots of potential.”
The report notes that rooftop solar installations are financed through equity investments, debt capital, mergers and acquisitions, and loans or concessional financing such as the US$625 million World Bank-State Bank of India (SBI) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF)-Tata Cleantech credit lines.
Since 2015 rooftop solar project developers have raised more than US$2 billion, 48% (US$985 million) of which came from equity funding and 29% (US$599 million) from debt. Around 45% of these investments was raised in the first eight months of 2021 alone.
“The C&I rooftop solar segment has seen a sudden surge despite Covid-induced disruptions,” says Gulia. “This indicates a significant growth trend ahead.”
Almost all (99%) of the equity investments in rooftop solar came from foreign entities looking to tap the Indian market, given the high growth potential and healthy return on equity.
The report notes that over the last five years, a majority of the funds raised through equity and debt routes has been concentrated among four active players in the segment: Amplus, Fourth Partner, CleanMax, and CleanTech.
“While these four players have been successful in raising funds for their projects and sustaining their business, the sector has seen many major players including Statkraft India, Sterling & Wilson, and Azure Power exit the market due to shrinking margins and regulatory setbacks by distribution companies (discoms),” says Gulia.
With a limited number of good, creditworthy customers having ratings above BBB+, this segment is becoming saturated, resulting in reduced demand that has led major developers to look at foreign markets with potential growth opportunities and also to build offsite open-access private solar parks that cater to the C&I segment.
On the other hand, MSMEs remain largely untapped. These face many barriers in obtaining financing for rooftop solar installations, including insufficient credit history, lack of collateral, and long-term uncertainties in their businesses. Renewable energy service companies (RESCOs), which own and operate solar plants for the consumer, are unwilling to work with MSMEs due to these uncertainties.
Credit enhancement schemes like the World Bank’s upcoming first-loss guarantee fund and a US$41 million line of credit from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DFC are examples of steps being taken to make financing for rooftop solar more accessible [to MSMEs], says co-author Vibhuti Garg, Energy Economist and Lead India at IEEFA.
“Schemes like these allow lenders to absorb risks and increase access to collateral-free loans.
“As well as loans available from national and regional banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) we are also seeing engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors such as Tata Power Solar and Orb Energy starting to offer one-stop financing options bundled with their rooftop solar products.”
The report notes this type of financing is likely to scale up, particularly as most big lenders and concessional credit lines are largely focused on the major rooftop solar developers. It also highlights positive developments such as Tata Power-SIDBI and Encourage Capital-Electronica Finance Limited tie-ups that specifically cater to MSMEs.
The report outlines the following recommendations for stakeholders and policymakers to make rooftop solar a more viable and attractive option to MSME customers:
1. Ensure regulations across states are consistent and implemented with a long-term perspective.
2. Introduce favorable state policies and incentives targeting MSMEs. For example, in Gujarat, MSMEs get incentives for up to 35% of rooftop solar plant and machinery costs.
3. Encourage discoms to offer lease or power purchase agreement (PPA) services at a lower cost than the private sector because of synergies in marketing, sales operations, and a large customer base, which can lower customer acquisition costs.
4. Streamline and digitalize document verification and other compliance by big lenders such as SBI to ensure a quick turnaround time for rooftop solar loan disbursal for corporates.
5. More risk capital in the form of equity funds is needed to manage first-loss risk. Partial credit guarantee funds to hedge the risks of the MSME segment can be extended from various bilateral and multilateral organizations to other lenders as well.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/29/kkr-backed-virescent-infrastructure-raises-us62-million/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,CANADA,INDIA,UNITED STATES",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021",KKR-backed Virescent Infrastructure raises US$62 million,"US investor KKR-backed Virescent Infrastructure today announced its renewable energy-focused infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) has raised INR4.6 billion (US$62 million) from a group of foreign and domestic investors.
Leading the transaction in the Virescent Renewable Energy Trust (VRET) is Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), one of Canada’s largest institutional investment managers, which invested on behalf of its clients. KKR invests in VRET from its Asia Pacific Infrastructure Investors Fund.
The National Stock Exchange defines “an Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvITs) as a collective investment scheme similar to a mutual fund, which enables direct investment of money from individual and institutional investors in infrastructure projects to earn a small portion of the income as a return.”
“The InvIT is designed as a tiered structure with Sponsor setting up the InvIT, which, in turn, invests into the eligible infrastructure projects either directly or via special purpose vehicles.”
KKR set up Virescent in October 2020 to acquire operating renewable energy assets in India. Headquartered in Mumbai, Virescent aims to expand its portfolio of operational clean energy projects chiefly through KKR’s infrastructure fund and will target facilities with stable cash flows from long-term public-sector contracts.
VRET’s initial portfolio comprises nine operational solar projects, with a cumulative capacity of approximately 395 MWp. The assets are located in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In addition, subject to applicable approvals, VRET is in advanced discussions to acquire a 55 MWp portfolio from Focal Energy.
CRISIL and India Ratings have assigned a ‘AAA’ rating with a Stable outlook to VRET’s loan facilities.
VRET is the only Indian renewable energy InvIT and among a few infrastructure companies to have been assigned this highest ‘AAA’ rating, reinforcing its healthy cash flow prospects owing to long-term power purchase agreements at pre-determined tariffs, its track-record of enhanced generation capabilities, a healthy financial risk profile and low leverage supported by adequate liquidity. The ‘AAA’ rating considers the portfolio to grow up to 2 GWp over the next two to three years.
Sanjay Grewal, CEO, Virescent Infrastructure, said, “This incredible achievement is an important milestone in Virescent’s journey. VRET is India’s first renewable energy focused InvIT and one of the few entities in the infrastructure sector to get the highest ‘AAA’ rating from two rating agencies, CRISIL and India Ratings. We look forward to drawing on the global investment management expertise of our investors as we continue to acquire high-quality assets for achieving our initial growth targets. Our endeavor is to support the Government in achieving its medium and long term renewable energy objectives of 175 GW and 450 GW respectively.”
Hardik Shah, Managing Director, KKR Infrastructure, said, “Virescent continues to be an important part of our infrastructure strategy in the Asia Pacific and how we contribute purposefully to India’s ambitious targets in the renewables sector. Investing in VRET alongside AIMCo and other institutional investors will help us to capitalize on this huge market opportunity. We will continue to support Virescent and its management team in providing greater renewable energy solutions to communities across India.”
Ahmed Mubashir, Director, Infrastructure & Renewable Resources at AIMCo, said, “AIMCo is excited to expand its geographic footprint in Asia through its investment in India’s first renewable energy InvIT. VRET’s portfolio of operating renewable energy assets whose economics are underpinned by long-term power purchase agreements are well aligned with our clients’ investment objectives. We look forward to partnering with KKR and Virescent to further grow the platform and provide renewable energy solutions to India in the coming years.”
Axis Capital acted as the lead manager to the issue. Shardul Amarchand acted as the legal advisor and Ernst & Young as the tax advisor.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/29/iit-bhilai-researchers-developer-large-area-perovskite-solar-cell-with-copper-metal-contact/,"HIGHLIGHTS,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHHATTISGARH",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021",IIT Bhilai researchers develop large-area perovskite solar cell with copper metal contact,"From pv magazine International
A group of scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai has developed a perovskite solar cell with an active area of 2cm2 and a back contact electrode made of copper (Cu). “Efforts are on to improve stability with new perovskite materials and reduce costs at every possible processing step,” researcher Nikhil Chander told pv magazine. “Our work has focused on reduction of costs by utilizing copper contacts instead of gold.”
The solar cell was fabricated via a two-step spin-coating technique with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate; a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite layer sandwiched between a titanium oxide (TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL) made of Spiro-OMeTA; and a copper conducting electrode. A similar device with a gold (Au) conducting electrode was also built, as a reference cell. “Copper or gold contact electrodes were deposited through a metal shadow mask by thermal evaporation to complete the cell fabrication process,” the Indian group specified.
The researchers explained that the copper, silver and aluminum used for metal contacts often lead to instability issues, as the diffusion of these metals with the Spiro-OMeOTAD or the perovskite layer has a chemical reaction that may be detrimental for the cell’s performance. “Among others, inexpensive Cu has a comparatively higher work function with decent stability,” the academics said. The work function is the energy needed for a particle to come from the interior of a medium and break through the surface. This effect needs to be considered when connections between dissimilar metals in certain electronic circuits are made.
The scientists built a cell with an active area of 0.25cm and a larger one with an area of 2cm2 and their performance was measured under standard AM 1.5G radiation by using a 300-W xenon lamp as a light source.

The 0.25cm2 cell showed an efficiency of 9.78%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.99 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.82 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 53%. For comparison, the same device with the Au metal contact achieved an efficiency of 10.42%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.94 V, a short-circuit current density of 20.31 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 54%. The device built with the Au contact electrode was also found to exhibit a low leakage current density, which is beneficial for the fill factor.
When scaled up to the 2cm2 size, the cell showed a lower drop in the open-circuit voltage and a significant decrease in photocurrent. “The shunt resistance of both the Cu and Au-based devices decreased when the size of the devices was increased,” the research team emphasized. “It is an indication of increased shunting effects arising due to scaling-up of the device area.”
The cell fabricated with copper metallization showed an efficiency of 5.61%, and that based on gold, 5.92%. These efficiencies were tested over a seven-week period and the gold-based device was able to retain around 74% of its initial performance while the copper-based cell retained only about 35% of the initial efficiency. “After 14 days under ambient conditions, the color of the perovskite film looks even more faded,” it explained. “It is an indication of film degradation under the influence of air and moisture.” This degradation was responsible for a strong decrease in photocurrent values and the resulting fill factor drop.
The main conclusion of the research is that completely eliminating gold will not be immediately possible and, in this regard, the scientists recommend using a metal contact made of a thin layer of Au and a thicker, overlying Cu layer. “This will ensure that the perovskite layer is not in direct contact with copper, and the usage of gold is minimized,” the researchers stated. “In this manner, the usage of gold could be reduced by about 80%,” Chander told pv magazine.
The solar cell is described in the paper Stability study of large-area perovskite solar cells fabricated with copper as low-cost metal contact, published in Energy Research.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/09/29/sharp-launches-540-w-half-cut-pv-module-with-20-9-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2021",Sharp launches 540 W half-cut PV module with 20.9% efficiency,"From pv magazine International
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp has unveiled the NU-JD540 solar panel, a half-cut monocrystalline PERC product with a 20.9% efficiency rating and 540 W of power output.
The IEC/EN61215 and IEC/EN61730-certified panel features 144 half-cells based on M10 wafers and a 10-busbar design. It has overall dimensions of 2,279×1,134×3.5mm and weighs in at 27.8kg.
The panel can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,500 V and an operating temperature between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius. It comes with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.341% per degree Celsius and its power tolerance reaches up to 5%, the manufacturer claims.
The module is fabricated with a white backsheet and anti-reflective, highly-transmissive, low iron tempered glass with a thickness of 3.2mm, and a frame made of anodized aluminum alloy and silver.
The Japanese manufacturer said that its half-cut modules feature three small junction boxes, instead of one; all with bypass diodes. These enclosures transfer less heat to the upper cells, which helps to extend the lifetime of panels while improving overall system performance, it claimed.
