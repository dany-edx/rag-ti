The report notes the Central Electricity Authority’s projection that solar and wind will form 51% of India’s total installed capacity, or 420 GW, by 2030, with biomass and small hydro adding another 30 GW. The International Energy Agency’s India Energy Outlook 2021 projects India to add 900 GW of renewable capacity by 2040.
“The transition to low-cost, variable renewable energy generation requires a flexible grid that can respond rapidly to changes in power demand dynamics,” said Kashish Shah, an Ieefa research analyst and author of the report, recommending a three-pronged approach for grid firming. 
The report calls for policy support for a time-of-day pricing mechanism to incentivize capital investment in grid-firming solutions such as battery storage, hydrogen, and flexible coal power generation to ensure flexible, reliable peak-time power supply. 
The report also looks at the experiences of leaders in integrating large-scale renewables, such as Germany and the states of South Australia and California, in the context of the Indian electricity market.
“While the much-bigger Indian market benefits from its strongly connected national electricity grid, it has its own set of challenges and market structure dynamics in dealing with large-scale variable renewable energy,” says Shah. “But there are interesting lessons for India as renewable energy-rich states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu could see their shares of renewable generation increase to 50% by 2030 from the current levels of 10-30%,” said Shah.
Battery storage
Ieefa says domestic and international developers and utilities are eyeing the very positive battery cost deflation trend but need to see a market signal in the form of time-of-day pricing to attract high initial capital investment into such assets.
“Battery storage can provide a solution to help the grid manage massive amounts of intermittent wind and solar, provide dispatchable power during peak demand periods, and other essential grid services. And battery cost deflation is now making utility-scale battery storage projects possible for India,” said Shah.
According to The International Energy Agency, India could add 140-200 GW of battery capacity by 2040 – the largest of any country and more than 100 times as much as currently installed in the U.S. today.
“Battery storage will likely play an important role in India achieving its renewable energy capacity target of 450 GW by 2030. India already has 93 GW of on-grid variable renewable energy and is targeting annual additions of 20-40 GW,” said Shah. 
Flexible coal-plant operation
Solar power is now the cheapest source of new Indian electricity capacity, and with record low tariffs of INR 1.99-2/kWh (around US$27/MWh) it’s now below the marginal fuel cost of coal-fired power plants.
However, the report says coal is likely to remain an important source of Indian electricity generation for some time to come and proposes flexing its generation to cater to the majority of grid variability requirements.
“Flexible generation is characterized by the ability to rapidly ramp up and ramp down the generation, quickly start up and shut down and operate efficiently at lower generation levels,” said Shah. 
“Flexible coal-fired plants would require retrofitting, operational and regulatory amendments. This would incur capital costs as well as additional operational expenditure depending upon the size, age, and combustion technology of the plant, but this could be rewarded with a higher time-of-day price.”
Green hydrogen
Though yet to be commercially deployed in India, green hydrogen, produced through water electrolysis using renewable energy, has a wide range of potential applications in transport, industrial production of ammonia, methanol, steel and electricity storage, and is an opportunity that India cannot afford to miss, said Shah.
According to The Energy and Resources Institute’s (TERI) recent analysis, the cost of alkaline electrolyzers is projected to drop 56% from around INR 6.3 crore/MW (US$0.86 million/MW) today to around INR 2.8 crore/MW (US$0.38 million/MW) by 2030.
“Billions of dollars of capital commitments across the globe are building a critical mass in the green hydrogen space. So India will have the benefit of leveraging these learning-by-doing pilots that are underway in developed economies,” said Shah.
“India’s strategy should be to plan in advance and be prepared to ride the energy storage wave when it arrives.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/02/26/indian-researchers-improve-perovskite-based-solar-cell-design/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"FEBRUARY 26, 2021",Indian researchers improve perovskite-based solar cell structure,"Researchers at Chitkara University in the Indian State of Punjab have proposed an electrostatically-doped back-contact design for perovskite-based solar cells that overcomes the fabrication and performance challenges associated with conventional sandwiched architecture using charge transport layers. 
The researchers performed numerical simulations and modeling to arrive at an electrostatically-doped metal-perovskite-metal back-contact solar cell structure that offered a significant improvement of 59.4% in power conversion efficiency (with an absolute reported value of 4.13%) over the previously proposed structures in the domain, where the absolute reported value was 2.59%. 
Dr Rahul Pandey, Dr Jaya Madan and Dr Rajnish Sharma from the university’s VLSI Center of Excellence carried out the research. Their work has been recently published in a scientific journal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE), IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices..
Dr Rajnish, who leads the VLSI Center of Excellence at Chitkara University, told pv magazine, “In an earlier reported design of back-contact metal-perovskite-metal solar cell architecture, the carrier collection only relied mainly on the Schottky field across the perovskite layer and hence the performance, particularly in terms of open-circuit voltage, was limited by the work function difference between the self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified gold contacts.” 
“The numerical study by our researchers established that an electrostatically-doped dipole-field-assisted metal-perovskite-metal back-contact perovskite solar cell structure could overcome the limitations of dipole-field-assisted metal-perovskite-metal back-contact perovskite-based solar cell structures.”
The researchers proposed placing two additional electrodes beneath the glass substrate to provide the polarity difference and to create an electrostatically doped p-n junction and corresponding built-in potential inside the perovskite layer near the glass substrate. The induced built-in potential offered additional support to light-generated charge carriers for the enhanced collection probability and helped overcome the limitations of the device reported earlier. 
While back-contact dipole-field-assisted metal-perovskite-metal solar cell reported earlier delivered the conversion efficiency of 2.59%, the design reported by Chitkara University researchers, where electrostatic doping has been introduced, provided a conversion efficiency of 4.13%. 
Design
 The Chitkara University researchers’ study findings may pave the way for the development of ‘transport layer-free’ electrostatically-doped, scalable, and low-cost perovskite-based solar cells in the future.
Their proposed design consists of a perovskite layer deposited onto a glass substrate having self-assemble-monolayer-modified gold-patterned electrodes on one side and polarity electrodes on the backside. The polarity electrodes allow for electrostatic control on the polarity carriers generated due to light photons falling on the solar cell structure’s active area. The dipole field due to front electrode and electrostatic potential due to polarity electrodes combine to enhance the charge extraction, enhancing the values of collection probability and open-circuit voltage. 
Quantitatively, 14.2 mA.cm-2, 659 mV, and 44.2% absolute values were reported for short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF)—a notable improvement of 24.6%, 17.5% and 9.1%, respectively, over existing structures in which these values were reported as JSC (11.4 mA.cm-2), VOC (561 mV) and FF (40.5%).
For the ideal expected functioning of any solar cell structure, all 100% generated carriers in terms of electrons and holes should find an easy path to successfully traverse to the structure’s end electrodes and contribute toward charge buildup. However, most of the structures in vogue struggle to ensure that and maximum of the generated carriers get sacrificed to various kinds of losses happening in the device. 
In conventional perovskite solar cells, a thin active layer of perovskite is sandwiched between two charge transport layers, an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). The creation of suitable electric field at the electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer interface helps in overall better collection of carriers. But their deployment may also cause performance degradation if side effects like enhanced recombination of carriers at the traps are not managed well. A pictorial representation indicating these losses has been drawn as below. 
Besides these functional issues, it has never been that easy to fabricate perovskite-based solar cell structures, and issues faced on that front due to their moisture-sensitive nature, possible shortening between electrodes due to pinholes and minimization of series resistance lead to additional losses. 
Researchers at Chitkara University worked to possibly overcome all these issues by numerically simulating and proposing a device structure without the presence of charge transport layers and opting for a back-contact design. 
To get rid of charge transport layers, the team proposed the placing of the polarity electrodes with workfunction Фm,p = 5.25 eV and Фm,n = 4.35 eV beneath the glass substrate to create an additional built-in field for the overall enhancement of internal electric field between the back contacts and obtained very encouraging results. Field inducted this way was seen to increase the carriers’ collection probability and improve the conventional structure’s power conversion efficiency. 
Dr Rajnish concluded, “Perovskite has been showing immense potential for the future generations of solar cells. This is one area where there has been almost an exponential growth in achieving the high values of PCE. However, like in all research endeavors, many issues still need to be resolved. We have shown in this work that with the simple addition of two electrodes beneath the glass substrate, one can harvest the benefits of having an electrostatically-doped p-n junction leading to the corresponding built-in potential inside the perovskite layer near the glass substrate.”
“We look forward to support coming in from government funding agencies to make an indelible mark on the international research roadmap in this field,” he added.
