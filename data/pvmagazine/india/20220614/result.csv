(ANIL). The partnership aims to create the world’s largest green hydrogen ecosystem.
ANIL will be the exclusive platform of Adani Enterprises and TotalEnergies for the production and commercialization of green hydrogen in India. Initially, it will target to develop a green hydrogen production capacity of 1 million tons per annum before 2030, powered by around 30 GW of new renewable power generation capacity.
To control green hydrogen production costs, ANIL will be integrated along the value chain, from the production of equipment needed to generate renewable power and produce green hydrogen, to the production of green hydrogen itself. ANIL will also focus on green hydrogen’s transformation into derivatives, including nitrogenous fertilizers and methanol, both for the domestic market and export.
Over the next 10 years, ANIL will invest more than $50 billion to develop green hydrogen and an associated ecosystem. To start with, it plans to develop a project that will domestically produce 1.3 Mtpa of urea derived from green hydrogen, as a substitution for current urea imports. It will also invest around $5 billion in a 2 GW electrolyzer fed by renewable power from a 4 GW solar and wind farm.
“The strategic value of the Adani-TotalEnergies relationship is immense at both the business level and the ambition level,” said Gautam Adani, the chairman of Adani Group. “In our journey to become the largest green hydrogen player in the world, the partnership with TotalEnergies adds several dimensions that include R&D, market reach, and an understanding of the end consumer. This fundamentally allows us to shape the market demand.”
Adani claimed it is firmly positioned to produce the world’s least expensive green hydrogen.
“TotalEnergies’ entry into ANIL is a major milestone in implementing our renewable and low carbon hydrogen strategy, where we want to not only decarbonize the hydrogen used in our European refineries by 2030, but also pioneer the mass production of green hydrogen to meet demand, as the market will take off by the end of this decade,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies. “This future production capacity of one million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen will be a major step in increasing TotalEnergies’ share of new decarbonized molecules, including biofuels, biogas, hydrogen, and e-fuels, to 25% of its energy production and sales by 2050.”
With the investment in ANIL, the strategic alliance between Adani and TotalEnergies now covers LNG terminals, gas utility, renewables, and green hydrogen production.

The plant is owned by SkyPower Southeast Asia III Investments and SkyPower Southeast Asia Holdings 2. It is operated via a special-purpose vehicle, Sunshakti Solar Power Projects. The project has a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Northern Power Distribution Co. of Telangana Ltd. at a fixed tariff of about INR 5.35/kWh.
The diversified Torrent Group has revenues of INR 20,500 crore and a market cap of INR 75,000 crore. It is one of the largest companies in the Indian power sector, with a presence across the entire power value chain of generation, transmission, and distribution.
Torrent Power currently has an aggregate installed generation capacity of 4.1 GW, consisting mainly of clean sources such as gas (2.7 GW) and renewables (1 GW). It also has 400 MW of renewable energy plants under development. With the acquisition of the 50 MW solar power plant, its total generation capacity, including its under-development portfolio, will reach 4.6 GW, with a renewables portfolio of more than 1.5 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/14/premier-energies-azure-power-partner-on-solar-cells-and-modules/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,MONO PERC,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TELANGANA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 14, 2022","Premier Energies, Azure Power partner on solar cells, modules","Solar manufacturer Premier Energies and renewables developer Azure Power will jointly invest INR 700 crore ($89.6 million) to set up a 1.25 GW solar cell and module facility in Telangana.
Premier will supply 2.4 GW of solar modules to Azure over the next four years. The order value has been estimated at more than INR 4,000 crore. The company said it would build the factory according to global standards.
“A portion of the total INR 700 crore investment is debt. So Azure will have 26% of the total equity after deducting the debt,” Chiranjeev Saluja, managing director of Premier Energies, told pv magazine. “Unlike GEF, which is a private equity investor in this facility, Azure is a strategic partner that is not only investing but also has an order book.”
The Azure investment in the Premier facility is part of its commitment in return for the capacity won under Solar Energy Corp. of India’s manufacturing-linked tender. The auction saw the developer secure 4 GW of solar projects in return for committing to set up 1 GW worth of cell and module production lines.
“We have secured order book [from Azure] for four years. Further supply will be mutually extended as the SECI tender mandates Azure to have an equity stake of a minimum of 26% in the manufacturing project for eight years,” said Saluja.

Premier’s Telangana facility will produce 540 W mono PERC modules with M10 cells and 660 W modules with G12 cells.
Azure Power developed India’s first utility-scale solar project in 2009. Since then, it has become a leader in developing and operating large utility-scale renewable energy projects in the country. It has already invested INR 630 crore in Telangana and operates 128 MW of solar power projects in the state.
Premier Energies, incorporated in 1995, is purportedly India’s second-largest integrated solar cell and module manufacturer. It has state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, with an operational capacity of 750 MW of solar cells and 1.25 GW of solar modules. It recently raised $25.8 million from GEF Capital Partners. It is currently focused on expanding its manufacturing facilities and will have operating capacities of 2 GW of cells and 2 GW of modules by December 2022.
