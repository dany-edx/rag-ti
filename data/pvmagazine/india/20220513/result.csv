It was big news at last year’s Intersolar 2021 when Meyer Burger unveiled its new solar tiles, which were designed by paXos. At Intersolar 2022, paXos is showcasing a range of new innovative applications, including its “Solar Solar Beaver Tail Tiles, which come in black and, more importantly, terracotta.
Building-integrated PV (BIPV) is having a strong showing at Intersolar 2022, which is a good sign that the still-niche application is finally on the verge of more widespread adoption. As the long tussle between PV engineers and architects attests, the main opposition to widespread adoption is aesthetic in nature. However, innovations such as paXos’s terracotta Beaver Tail are promising, as many European buildings are historical, listed structures requiring a certain level of aesthetic appeal.
In many European countries, such as Poland, the use of plain tiles is widespread, and demand for BIPV is proving to be indelibly tied to the technology’s ability to remain inconspicuous. Marius Nennewitz, a paXos project manager, told pv magazine that the Beaver Tail tiles were designed in partnership with Fraunhofer ISE, in order to reduce their reflectivity, in line with local requirements. The result is a duller, rusty colored tile.
Like the Solar Roof Tile Mild-Hybrid product that paXos sold to Meyer Burger, the individual tiles can be removed and replaced as required. PaXos has ensured that the tiles have high hail and storm suction resistance, while maintaining the walkability of rooftops. However, the heat utilization is lower than in mild-hybrid systems, in favor of aesthetic improvements.

India is targeting net-zero emissions by 2070 and 500 GW of installed non-fossil energy capacity by 2030. The nation’s vast renewable energy resource potential and strong policy backing provide a strong foundation for achieving these goals, said Khuba, who visited Intersolar Europe 2022 this week in Munich, Germany.
With its ambitious goals and enabling policies, “India offers a great opportunity for investments,” said the minister. “Currently, around $196.98 billion worth of projects are underway in India.”
Khuba also emphasized that India is committed to promoting domestic manufacturing in the solar PV sector to achieve its ambitious deployment goals. Several policy measures have already been undertaken to support the domestic PV manufacturing sector.
A total budget outlay of INR 24,000 crore ($3.1 billion) will increase domestic manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules. And to promote a green hydrogen economy, India has an estimated outlay of INR 25,425 crore.
India has facilitated incredible growth in renewable capacity over the last seven years. The nation achieved 40% of cumulative electricity generation capacity from non-fossil-fuel sources in 2021 – nine years ahead of the 2030 target date.

The company has been into lithium battery assembly in India since 2019. With the latest addition, it now has an aggregate 550 MWh of lithium battery capacity in India, including an operational 400 MWh/annum factory in Noida and the new 150 MWh/annum in Pune. The Noida and Pune facilities span 40,000 square feet and 20,000 square feet, respectively.
JLNPhenix Energy makes lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries. The target applications are electric vehicles, traction applications, on-grid and off-grid energy storage applications, and drones.
Going forward, JLNPhenix Energy plans to expand geographically. It aims to develop a manufacturing setup for power trains with motors and controllers, said Sunil Gandhi, chief executive officer of JLNPhenix Energy.
