MSMEs contribute around 30% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 40% of its exports, and employ about 110 million people. In addition, MSMEs’ energy consumption is equivalent to 20–25% of the energy consumed by India’s large industries sector. 
Yet, despite their economic significance and their role in India reaching net-zero emissions by 2070, MSMEs are unable to secure the financing they need to decarbonize. 
Energy costs for the most polluting MSMEs in the manufacturing sector are 10–30% of total production costs, which creates an obvious incentive to invest in energy-efficient plants and machinery and source electricity from cheaper renewable sources. However, MSMEs lack the capacity and financial resources to do this. 
The barriers to accessing commercially available finance include stiff lending policies with high collateral security requirements, small project ticket sizes, and high transaction costs. And without an investment-grade credit rating or a strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profile, MSMEs are also unable to access the trillion-dollar sustainable debt market.
In the absence of immediate viable financial solutions, MSMEs need government intervention to get sustainable debt at a reasonable rate. A way forward could be a green finance platform for MSMEs.
A green finance platform could help MSMEs access green bond capital. An appropriate institution would govern the platform, issuing green bonds and disbursing the proceeds to MSMEs via green loans. It would develop criteria for an eligible MSME green borrower based on its environmental profile and business activity or project to mitigate the environmental impact. Alternatively, the governing institution could loan the proceeds of green bonds to financial institutions that would then on-lend to eligible MSMEs. The green loans could be term loans, revolving credit facilities, or other debt instruments.
The platform would adhere to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s disclosure requirements for bond issuance and the Loan Market Association’s Green Loan Principles (GLP) for green loans. The bond issuer would ensure regular impact reporting to investors based on the International Capital Market Association’s guidelines by working closely with MSMEs on each project. It would also appoint a third-party verification agency to ensure loan proceeds fund green projects.
The governing institution would therefore need to be an entity with a high credit rating, have experience in bond issuance, a working relationship with the MSME sector, a strong balance sheet, and an understanding of the impact of climate risk on financial performance.
The Small Industrial Development Bank of India (SIDBI) meets these criteria.
The SIDBI could govern the green finance platform, especially given its mandate to oversee MSMEs. SIDBI, backed by the Government of India (GoI), has a strong AAA (ICRA) credit rating. It is also an accredited entity of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), demonstrating its ability to understand climate change business dynamics. 
While not currently issuing green bonds, SIDBI could follow multilateral development institutions and other GoI-backed Indian institutions, like Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency and Rural Electrification Corp. Ltd, which have successfully issued green bonds worth more than $1 trillion as of September 2022.
If the SIDBI were to become the governing institution of such a green finance platform, it would help address a number of barriers MSMEs face in accessing the finance they need to decarbonize. First, the proposed structure would overcome the MSMEs’ poor credit profile because of SIDBI’s strong credit rating. Second, it would ensure that the green bond issue size is adequate, which is unlikely if MSMEs raise such bonds individually. Third, with adequate policy or financial support for MSMEs from the GoI/SIDBI, the interest rates on these loans would be relatively low and could attract longer tenors. Finally, a strong issuer like SIDBI would attract ESG investors looking to generate a significant impact on their investment.
Still, there are challenges to adopting such a structure that would need to be addressed.
MSMEs’ poor credit profile could impact the rating of the proposed SIDBI green bond making it too risky for investors and increasing subsequent green loan interest costs. To mitigate these risks, the GoI could design a credit guarantee fund to finance green projects for MSMEs similar to the existing Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE). 
The proposed guarantee fund would absorb the potential default risk of MSMEs while ensuring the availability of collateral-free green loans for MSMEs. Similar to CGTMSE, the new guarantee fund should provide cover to green loans for up to 85% of the loan value, which SIDBI and GoI should underwrite. 
MSME borrowers may also lack the capacity to adhere to GLP guidelines. SIDBI would need to conduct capacity-building exercises for MSME borrowers to ensure they adhere to GLP. A small technical assistance pool, funded by public institutions, would be required to cover the technical assistance costs, including capacity building and third-party verification costs. As an accredited GCF entity, SIDBI could use the GCF’s technical assistance grant for eligible projects. 
SIDBI has much to gain from the proposed green financing platform. It would unlock green capital for SIDBI, which it has not explored yet, especially through capital markets. It can enhance its reputation among ESG investors. As financial institutions come under increasing scrutiny on their climate risk management, green bond issuance by SIDBI would send a positive signal about its intent on climate action. The platform would also enhance SIDBI’s role as a development institution by adding climate-related funding as a goal to its mandate of protecting and accelerating MSMEs to meet its socio-economic development goals. 
Currently, India has no dedicated platform to finance the decarbonization of MSMEs. The SIDBI could fill this gap and mobilize green bond capital for Indian MSMEs through the proposed mechanism.

An international research group led by Spain’s DLR Institute of Solar Research has developed Radguard, a novel system that measures soiling losses in PV systems.
Radguard uses a lamp to illuminate a pyranometer or PV reference cell for about 45 minutes at night. The lamp is protected from soiling by a 25-cm collimator. The scientists said this is crucial for the correct functioning of the device, as well as the fixed position of the lamp.
“By comparing the irradiance measured at night with that of another night when the sensor was clean, the soiling loss can be derived,” the scientists said. “Several 45-minute long measurements are combined to detect erroneous soiling measurements caused by dew, rain droplets on the radiometer, or other effects that might only be present in some of the various measurements.”
They placed the RS2600 pocket lamp on one end of a 90-degree angle structure. On the other side of the structure, they used a corresponding sensor, a CM11 pyranometer, and an NES SOZ-03 reference cell with textured cover glass. They also used a Campbell CR1000 data-logger to collect data on the reference cell’s short-circuit current and the pyranometer’s voltage.
“The batteries of the lamp are replaced by a power supply that is controlled with a common time controller that switches on the lamp during one or more 45-minute intervals at night,” said the academics.
The group validated the new technique in four-month testing held in outdoor conditions, which it claims showed an accuracy that is close to that of the reference method, which however includes the daily cleaning of the reference devices.
“The measured soiling losses were compared to soiling losses derived by comparing the test radiometer to a clean device of the same model,” the scientists said. “The deviations between the data sets were found to be below the expected uncertainty of the reference data with low biases of <0.3%.”
They described the new technique in “Autonomous measurement system for photovoltaic and radiometer soiling losses,” which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. The research team includes academics from Sweden’s DLR Remote Sensing Data Center, Spain’s CIEMAT Plataforma Solar de Almería, and Germany’s DLR Institute of Remote Sensing Technology.
“In the future, the method will be tested at further sites and in longer measurement campaigns that are now under preparation,” they concluded.

Longi Green Energy, the world’s largest solar panel producer, has been instrumental in driving solar to become the “cheapest energy in history,” according to the International Energy Agency. The company is now joining a wide field of competitors as it sets its sights on hydrogen electrolyzers.
Looking at the confluence of technological breakthroughs and rapidly growing investments in hydrogen, one cannot help but wonder if the price of the world’s lightest energy storage medium might soon collapse, much like the price of solar cells. BloombergNEF’s hydrogen market outlook recently published a chart showing what looks to be the beginning of a dramatic S-curve. Remember – everyone underestimates the rate of change.
Longi expects to have 85 GW of solar module assembly capacity built by the end of the year.  pv magazine USA briefly conversed with Longi at RE+, where we asked the company about their green hydrogen plans.
The company has launched three electrolyzer models. At the company’s booth it was suggested that the 5 MW alkaline water electrolytic bath – the LHy-A1000 – was the most efficient of the three models. The unit generates approximately 90 kg of hydrogen per hour.
Longi stated that it hopes to expand its Wuxi manufacturing facility to 1.5 GW by the end of 2022, and to produce 5 GW to 10 GW of electrolyzers by 2025. These targets imply a growth of multiple gigawatts per year.
The company began thinking hard about hydrogen in 2018, as wind and solar prices plummeted, and renewables expanded massively across China. Since electricity comprises 60% of the cost of producing hydrogen, excess solar was thought to be the perfect partner.
Meanwhile demand for net zero industrial processes has been looming. Longi cited some of the key industries: cement, fertilizer, and oil refinement.
At its booth, pv magazine USA pried for pricing data for Longi’s electrolyzers, asking whether they were below $1,000/kW. The company replied that their products cost less than $500 per kW. Bloomberg NEF recently reported that alkaline electrolyzers produced by an unnamed Chinese manufacturer were less than one-third the price of those manufactured in the United States, at only $343/kW.
Because Longi is the largest producer of electrolyzers, it is likely to be the manufacturer of the $343 electrolyzer. However, since six companies are already producing more than 1 GW of capacity each year (per the chart, below), we’re not sure who is leading these cost reductions.
Bloomberg NEF’s analysis also predicts that we should expect an additional 30% reduction in costs due to scaling by 2025. However, some of those gains will be offset by increases to the price of labor and commodities.
This scaling process is still in its early stages, so it is still very likely that the 20% price decrease, associated with each doubling of capacity, should greatly outpace the relatively small increases to labor pricing that can be expected. External forces are playing a strong role in these developments, too. The US Inflation Reduction Act pays $3/kg for green hydrogen. And as other forces cause energy pains, like the war in Ukraine, it appears likely that manufacturers will find new markets for these components.
