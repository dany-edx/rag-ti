https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/17/uttar-pradesh-targets-22-gw-of-solar-in-five-years/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,ROOFTOP SOLAR,SOLAR PUMPS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UTTAR PRADESH",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",Uttar Pradesh targets 22 GW of solar in next five years,"The state government of Uttar Pradesh targets 22 GW of solar power generation capacity in the state over the next five years under its Solar Policy 2022. Out of the targeted capacity, 14 GW is to be achieved through solar parks, 4.5 GW through residential rooftop solar projects, 1.5 GW through non-residential rooftop projects, and 2 GW through the PM Kusum Yojana.
The state government has allocated a budget of INR 7,698 crore ($944.4 million) to achieve these and other objectives under its Solar Policy 2022 which is applicable for five years.
Under the new policy, the Uttar Pradesh government targets 4.5 GW of power generation through rooftop systems on 13.5 lakh houses in the state. In addition to the central financial assistance provided by the Central Government, the State Government will provide a maximum grant of INR 30,000 at the rate of INR 15,000/kW for this purpose.
A target has been set to generate 1.5 GW of electricity by installing solar systems on the roofs of non-residential buildings such as government buildings and all types of government or non-government educational institutions.
The net metering facility is made available on the installation of solar rooftop systems in the residential sector, government buildings, and all types of government or non-government educational institutions.
The facility of net billing will be allowed soon for the solar rooftop systems installed on the other categories of non-residential buildings under the directions of the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission.
The policy aims to make Uttar Pradesh a leading state in the setting up of solar parks with storage systems. To promote such parks, the state government will provide a capital subsidy at a rate of INR 2.5 crore per MW to solar parks established with a storage system of 5 MW or more capacity. With this, solar energy can be stored and supplied at the time of peak load.
Developers of these projects will have the option to sell power to the Power Corporation in Uttar Pradesh or to other industrial units of the state through open access.
Gram Sabha land can be given on lease for a maximum period of 30 years for the establishment of solar parks. For this, lease rent will be taken at the rate of INR 1 per acre per year from solar parks to be established in the public (government) sector and at the rate of INR 15,000 per acre per year from solar parks to be established in the private sector.
Under component C-1 of PM Kusum Yojana, the central government provides a 30% subsidy to farmers for solarizing their tubewells. To implement this scheme effectively in the state, the Uttar Pradesh government will provide 70% more subsidy in addition to the grant permitted by the central government, to farmers of Musahar, Vantangia, and Scheduled Tribes living in Uttar Pradesh. In this way, the tube wells of this category of farmers will be solarized free of cost.
Other farmers will be given 60% more grant in addition to the subsidy permitted by the Central Government. In this way, farmers of other categories will receive a 90% government subsidy for solarizing their tubewells and they will have to pay only 10%, which is estimated to be a maximum of around INR 55,000.
Under Component C-2, for the solarization of agriculture feeders, the Central Government provides a grant at the rate of INR 1.05 crore per MW. The State Government will provide an additional grant at INR 50 lakh per MW for viability gap funding of these projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/11/17/all-perovskite-two-terminal-tandem-solar-cell-tech-with-32-3-efficiency/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 17, 2022",All-perovskite two-terminal tandem solar cell tech with 32.3% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Central University of Jharkhand in India have simulated a new all-perovskite two-terminal tandem solar cell. It reportedly has a 13% higher efficiency than similar devices with the same materials at the research level.
“This technology is directly transferable to real production,” researcher Basudev Pradhan told pv magazine. “Few solar companies are already making perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells which are on the verge of commercialization. We believe all perovskite tandem solar cells also can be manufactured commercially without being much dependent on costly silicon wafers.”
The researchers used SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium.
“Through this software, different types of solar cells can be configured by varying up to seven layers for which simulation is carried out under both dark and illumination conditions of AM 1.5G 1 sun spectrum,” they said.
In order to make the simulation more realistic, they also considered bulk defects in all the layers and interface defects between layers. They built the cell with a top perovskite cell featuring a wide bandgap of 1.75 eV and a bottom perovskite cell with a bandgap of 1.25 eV.
The top cell is designed with an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a hole transport layer (HTL) based on copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), a perovskite layer, a bathocuproine (BCP) buffer layer, and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) buffer layer. The bottom cell relies on an ITO substrate, a hole-transporting material (HTM) based on PEDOT:PSS, a perovskite material, an electron acceptor made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a SnO2 buffer layer, and a metal contact made of silver (Ag).
Simulated under standard illumination conditions, the top cell exhibited an efficiency of 12.37%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.806 V, a short-circuit current of 18.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 83.91%. The bottom cell achieved an efficiency of 19.93%, which brought the overall tandem device to 32.3%. The scientists said this compares to an efficiency of 23.72%, as achieved in similar devices built with the same materials at the research level. The tandem cell also has an open-circuit voltage of 2.047 V, a short-circuit current of 18.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 86.23%.
“This simulation work provides insights into quantifying PV parameters limitation and understanding interdependency of one upon another with respect to device performance,” the academics explained. “It also helps in finding an optimized value of various device layer thicknesses along with ETL-HTL combination and its relation with device performance.”
“We haven’t made an accurate cost estimation of the solar cell so far,” Pradhan said. “But the LCOE for perovskite modules built with this cell technology is definitely lower than the present mainstream crystalline silicon-based modules.”
The research team presented the solar cell tech in “All-perovskite two-terminal tandem solar cell with 32.3% efficiency by numerical simulation,” which was recently published in Materials Today Sustainability.
“This work provides a new direction for experimental realization with higher power conversion efficiency and establishes a new route toward the development of all-perovskite tandem solar cells,” the group concluded.
