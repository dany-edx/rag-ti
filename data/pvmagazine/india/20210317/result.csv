The company is delivering fully engineered 400-kilovolt gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) substations that will replace an existing apparatus to better assimilate power from BALCO’s captive generation plants, delivering it with efficiency to the Korba aluminum smelter. 
Hitachi ABB Power Grids is equipping the substations with its advanced MicroSCADA automation solution to monitor and control the aluminum producer’s grid in real time and ensure maximum power availability. It is also deploying its 500-megavolt ampere power transformers to enhance grid efficiency and safety further. 
The GIS substation provides space savings of as much as 60% compared to conventional switchgear due to its compact, robust and low-maintenance design. The GIS technology can be safely operated in confined spaces for optimal substation layout and superior switchgear performance.
“Domestic consumption of aluminum is forecast to reach 10 million tons over the next 10 years* and key players such as BALCO are preparing to be able to cater to this demand,” said N Venu, CEO and Managing Director, Hitachi ABB Power Grids in India. “In this regard, reliable power supply is critical, and we are very proud to have been chosen by the company as a trusted partner,” he added. 
All the equipment for this project is being manufactured domestically in line with the Government of India’s Make-in-India drive and is aimed at ensuring the plant’s complex smelting operations run smoothly, helping BALCO meet its production enhancement plan. 
This project is part of Hitachi ABB Power Grids’ strategy to be a partner of choice for the Indian industrial ecosystem to deliver digital integration and grid connections.
Hitachi ABB Power Grids in India operates under the legal entity name ABB Power Products and Systems India Limited and is listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited (BSE) as POWERINDIA, Scrip code 543187.

The move comes after GUVNL won the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission’s approval to retender the capacities and make allotments at the lowest tariff discovered out of the two auctions (current and previous) for the respective capacities.
The earlier auction for 700 MW in Dholera, held on August 13, 2020, yielded tariffs in the range of INR 2.78-2.81. Whereas the 100 MW auction for Raghanesda Solar Park in September had a tariff ceiling of INR 2.75 and saw a single bid. Subsequently, GUVNL discovered a considerably lower tariff of INR 1.99/kWh tariff in a 500 MW auction for a non-solar park area, prompting it to approach GERC for cancellation of the other two auctions.
Capacity
The developers selected by GUVNL shall set up solar power projects on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. GUVNL may sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with successful bidders for a period of 25 years from the scheduled commercial operation date of the project. 
For 700 MW in Dholera Solar Park, 14 plots, each with 50 MW capacity, are available. Thus, a developer must bid for a minimum 50 MW capacity and in multiples of 50 MW only.
Developers must quote a single and uniform bid for an entire capacity of 100 MW, to be built on a single plot in Raghanesda Solar Park. No partial installation of capacity in the plot is allowed.

Aluminum-ion batteries promise significant improvements over today’s lithium-ion technology. The ability to exchange three electrons per ion, compared to lithium’s one, brings the potential for higher storage capacity. Al-ion batteries could also rely on more cheap/abundant materials, avoiding many of the issues that continue to plague Li-ion supply chains.
Various challenges, in particular relating to the shelf-life of the batteries, have kept Al-ion confined to the laboratory for now. New research published in early 2021, however, represents a significant leap in performance for the technology. A battery capable of both high storage capacity and ultrafast charging could open new applications for energy storage, bridging the gap between a battery and a supercapacitor.
Scientists at China’s Dalian University of Technology and the University of Nebraska in the United States collaborated to fabricate a battery consisting of a pure aluminum anode, a graphene cathode, and an organic electrolyte. The batteries are described in the paper Ultra-fast charging in aluminum-ion batteries: electric double layers on active anode, published in Nature Communications.
Key to achieving this performance was an improved understanding of a mechanism known as ‘electric double layers’ – layers just a few nanometers thick which form at the interface between the metal electrode and electrolyte. By dipping the aluminum into Galinstan – a metal alloy that is liquid at room temperature – the group increased the surface energy of the anode allowing more aluminum ions to tunnel through the electric double layers.
With this approach, the group could demonstrate a battery with a 200 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g-1) capacity, which they claim is a jump forward from the previous record of 120 mAh/g-1 for an Al-ion battery. The battery could also charge at a rate of 104 C – meaning a duration of 0.35 seconds to reach the full capacity at 1000 A g−1.
The group notes that these performance figures denote a device that “eliminates the gap between a supercapacitor and a battery.” And they plan to continue working on understanding more of the specifics of how their anode works, as well as exploring combinations with different cathode materials. Ultimately, they envisage applications in emergency backup power, for example, “energy backup for electric buses that are running between stations, restart a suddenly stopped elevator, or even to minimize the power-off-induced loss in manufacturing or production lines.”
