Lithuanian solar PV manufacturer Solitek, a unit of Global BOD, has unveiled a PV carport product line conceived for single-family homes as well as for commercial and industrial sites.
The system features glass-glass frameless modules with a load-bearing structure delivered with all fasteners required, and a choice of inverters from established manufacturers such as Fronius and Huawei.
The smallest model of the series is a one-car version with a capacity of 4.44 kW, with a construction weight and site being 800 kg and 5,294 mm x 4,370 mm, respectively. A two-berth version has an output of 5.55 kW, measures 5,286 mm x 5,445 mm and has a construction weight of 1,100 kg.
“We have been developing the carport solution for several years. It took time to get all the certifications for safety and durability,” Ramūnas Grudis, Head of Sales, Solitek, told pv magazine, noting that it was necessary to qualify the solar panel-based carport roof as overhead glazing material with the Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik (DIBt).
The carports feature Solitek’s bifacial B.60 glass-glass modules, with 370 W front-side power. The frameless 60-cell panels are made in Lithuania and use PERC cells with a size of 166 mm x 166 mm supplied by an unspecified Taiwanese manufacturer. They also utilize 3mm thick safety glass on both sides. “This is an extraordinarily strong combination,” said Grudis, noting the modules passed 40 mm hail tests.
The modules have an A-class fire safety classification and come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee. The 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.% of the nominal output power.
The carport unit can be designed to withstand a snow load of up to 2.5 kN/m2 and 27m/s of wind loads. Grudis explained that the number of car bays and materials are configurable, in addition to PV-covered terraces, with the same high degree of system integration. The carports can be currently shipped across Europe and are sold via the company’s distributor partners or directly.
Solitek belongs to Global BOD, which also owns ophthalmic lens manufacturing company Bod Lenses. It recently announced plans to build a 600 MW module plant in Benevento, Italy in addition to its 250 MW plant in Lithuania.
This article was amended on 4/12/2023 to note that Solitek is a direct holding of Global BOD, which also owns Bod Lenses, and the factory size in the final paragraph was corrected to 250 MW.

The modules are already certified as per UL and IEC standards and comply to requirements in the US and European markets.
“The main advantage of Gautam Solar’s 590 Wp TOPCon solar module is that it has the same size as a 550 Wp mono PERC panel and still offers a higher efficiency and produces approx. 5% more energy per year than normal mono PERC solar modules. These modules degrade only up to 87.4% of their initial rated power at the end of 30 years compared to normal mono PERC modules which degrade to 84.8% in their 25-year lifecycle. The modules provide BOS cost savings of 3.26% and LCOE reduction of 1.56% over the existing technology,” stated Gautam Solar.
The modules were showcased at the Renewable Energy India (REI) Expo in October 2023.
Gautam Solar’s TOPCon 590 Wp modules offer energy conversion efficiency of up to 22.84% and optimized bifacial power generation performance. The degradation rate is 1% in Year 1 and 0.4% subsequently, as opposed to 2% in Year 1 and 0.55% subsequently for normal mono PERC modules. This increases the longevity of the modules. The modules are built with multi-busbar (MBB) technology with round ribbons for lower electrical losses and higher light utilization and non-destructive cutting technology for lower chances of micro-cracks and greater mechanical strength.

The CPUC has made another anti-rooftop solar decision, ruling that solar-plus-storage customers cannot export electricity to the grid in exchange for an offset of their utility delivery charges.
Under current billing structures, rooftop solar owners are encouraged to attach batteries so that they can export electricity during times of high demand on the grid. This dispatch of electricity helps reduce the amount of inefficient natural gas “peaker” plants in operation on the grid and smooths supply and demand, leading to stable pricing across the grid. Now, under the new ruling, “delivery” and “generation” charges on utility bills are classified separately, and customers are not allowed to use solar-battery exports to offset “delivery” charges set by the utility.
“While the solar and storage industry adapts to an abrupt shift to net billing, the CPUC has added insult to injury with a series of damaging decisions that completely change the environment for rooftop solar in California,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive officer, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
California’s once-flourishing rooftop solar market is now reeling from a year of rulemaking decisions by CPUC, which has shown a proclivity to support the interests of its major investor-owned utilities Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric.
In December 2022, the CPUC transitioned to a net billing format for single-family rooftop solar customers, pushing the state into NEM 3.0. Checks of utility interconnection queues show that requests for new solar array connections have fallen by about 80% since the transition to net billing was made. Nearly 20,000 solar workers have been laid off since the decision was made.

In such cases, desalinized seawater could also be used for green hydrogen production.
The minister said, for the production of 1 kg of green hydrogen via electrolysis, around 10 liters of demineralized water is needed. Accordingly, the demineralized water requirement for 5 mmt green hydrogen production per annum will be about 50 million cubic meters (MCM) per annum.
India targets a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT per annum by 2030 under its National Green Hydrogen Mission. The nation will need 60 – 100 GW of installed electrolyzer capacity for the envisaged green hydrogen production capacity of 5 mmt per annum by 2030.
The National Green Hydrogen Mission envisages the substitution of grey hydrogen with green hydrogen in industries such as fertilizer production, petroleum refining, steel, and shipping, reducing the carbon footprint and dependence on imported fossil fuels. The specific strategies or initiatives under the mission include facilitating demand creation through domestic utilization; incentives for manufacturing of electrolyzers and production of green hydrogen; pilot projects for green steel, mobility, shipping, decentralized energy applications, hydrogen production from biomass, hydrogen storage, etc; development of green hydrogen hubs; and research & development program.
Elsewhere, Iberdrola and Masdar announced a €15 billion ($16.2 billion) strategic partnership agreement to evaluate the joint development of offshore wind and green hydrogen projects in markets including Germany, UK and the USA. “Work to identify other opportunities is already underway,” said Europe’s largest utility. The companies announced the plans at the UN’s climate change conference COP28 in the UAE.
Masdar has signed a joint development agreement with the Jordanian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to develop a 1 gigawatt (GW) wind project with a battery energy storage system (BESS), and a Memorandum to explore the feasibility of establishing a green hydrogen plant. “The study will examine the feasibility of establishing a green hydrogen project near The Port of Aqaba to produce the most cost-competitive hydrogen, utilizing desalinated seawater, and dedicated renewable power,” said the UAE’s energy company in an emailed press release.
Bureau Veritas and Avance signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which recognizes the mutual interest and benefit of cooperating in the field of attributes verification and certification. Avance recently announced the I-REC product code for hydrogen, which governs the tracking and certification process for hydrogen and hydrogen derivative fuels and products. Avance was accredited earlier in 2023 by the I-REC Standard Foundation, the creator of the I-REC (E) Product Code for electricity. 
HDF Energy said that the first mass production plant for high-power fuel cells in Blanquefort (Gironde) will be delivered in January 2024. It is scheduled to come on stream in summer 2024, with mass production expected in 2025. “Final validation by the European Commission regarding the level of support requested is expected in spring 2024,” said the French company. 
Toyota Motor Europe said it would establish a local business operation, the Hydrogen Factory Europe, to ensure a coordinated approach to commercializing hydrogen technology and systems in the continent. “The Hydrogen Factory will be responsible for producing an increasing number of fuel cell systems and supporting a widening group of commercial partnerships,” said the Japanese automotive company.
Asahi Kasei is launching a demonstration trial of a rental service for chlor-alkali electrolysis cells in Europe with Nobian and Logisteed. The Japanese technology company explained that the service can help customers maintain production capacity when repairing their own equipment. The membrane process for chlor-alkali electrolysis produces chlorine, hydrogen, and caustic soda by electrolyzing brine using ion-exchange membranes. Global demand for chlor-alkali in 2022 was approximately 100 million tons2, and Asahi Kasei’s chlor-alkali process has been adopted at more than 150 plants in 30 countries, with a total capacity of over 30 million tons per year converted to 100% caustic soda. Asahi Kasei plans to expand the rental service to Asia and North America.
