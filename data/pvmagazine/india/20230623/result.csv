The robot can be deployed for ground-mounted and rooftop/RCC installations and is compatible with fixed, seasonal tilt as well as single-axis trackers.  
The company states the robotic device is ideal for PV installations in deserts as it can dry-clean the solar panels with 99% cleaning efficiency. 
The robot is available in automated and semi-automated (pick-and-place) models. It is built to work in dry, wet, or hybrid (both wet and dry) cleaning modes. 
Anil Zinjurke, chief marketing officer of Sleepwalkers, told pv magazine the robot is powered by an onboard lithium battery. It travels 2-3 km on a single charge and can clean more than 2 MW in a day depending on the site conditions. Installation is easy. No extra railing is required as the robot can move on the aluminum frame of the panels.” 
“The automatic models self-charge from inbuilt solar panels. In the pick-and-place model, a battery swapping facility is provided. Our wet cleaning robots can reduce the water consumption by half, compared to the conventional manual wet cleaning.” 
The PV cleaning robot is claimed to handle panel-to-panel irregularities up to 25 mm and land slope undulation up to 15 degrees. It features a high torque motor with precise transmission, an industrial-grade controller for robust operation, SCADA and Cloud connectivity with the IOT network, and weather monitoring.  
The Zero Dirt-BOLT robots are tested and certified by the UL Laboratory and are currently deployed for around 300 MW PV capacity. These are available in 2 to 8 m sizes.

Making components that can withstand being installed outdoors for years and even decades, in any type of climate, while maintaining at least the vast majority of their initial performance, is a key goal for the solar industry.
There has been plenty of progress, with both technological improvements and competition between manufacturers driving longer product and performance warranties, and therefore longer contracts for the sale of electricity from a solar project. Most manufacturers now offer 30-year warranties guaranteeing at least 80% of the modules’ initial performance, and one has even extended this to 40 years.
But for solar installations many regions are targeting, for 2050 and beyond, even longer lifetimes are needed, especially for installations located in harsh climate regions whether due to heat, cold, moisture, dust or other conditions. And this will mean understanding exactly how PV modules tend to degrade under these conditions.
Scientists led by the University of Agder in Norway decided to focus on degradation caused by moisture – this being a main characteristic of the climate in Grimstad where the university is based.
The group took modules from a decommissioned PV array installed in the town in 2000  and used a range of techniques, both non-destructive and destructive, to examine the inner workings of the modules, and how various components had fared over years in the field.
Their results are described in full in the paper “Moisture induced degradation in field-aged multicrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. The study found moisture ingress had driven degradation of the encapsulant, producing acetic acid and various substances that drive corrosion and other forms of degradation to the silicon cells. Moisture was also found to have a major role in corrosion at solder joints – causing lead to corrosion rather than “sacrificial” tin included in the solder.
The scientists behind the work accepted that PV materials and manufacturing processes have moved on greatly since the modules in this study were manufactured more than 20 years ago. However, while accelerated testing is useful, they say that studying field-aged modules is still necessary, and that many mechanisms revealed in this study are still relevant to modules rolling off production lines today.
“Though solar PV module materials and technology have evolved over the years, MID mechanisms in solar PV modules appear to follow a similar trend,” they state in the paper. “Hence, insights from this work can guide decision making at the present and in the future as regards understanding the performance reliability of solar PV plants.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/06/23/flywheel-mechanical-battery-with-32-kwh-of-storage-in-australia/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 23, 2023",Flywheel mechanical battery with 32 kWh of storage in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
New South Wales-based startup Key Energy has installed a 8 kW/32 kWh three-phase flywheel mechanical energy storage system at a property in the Sawyers Valley, just east of Perth.
The installation involved a single flywheel, which stores energy mechanically meaning it has no fire risks, can run around 11,000 cycles without capacity degradation and boasts a 20-year to 30-year lifespan. While these systems have low energy density, they are substantially more durable than lithium-ion based chemical batteries.

This was a major drawcard for the owner of the Sawyers Valley property, who wanted a system that did not pose a fire risk, could power their three-phase loads and provide energy security as blackouts frequently affect the area.
The project marks Key Energy’s fourth installation, with another two expected to be commissioned this year. In total, the company has installed around 16 flywheel systems with over 300 kWh of capacity, including at a boarding school and at gas company APA Group’s commercial off-grid device stations.

Key Energy says it aims to leverage this residential flywheel installation, as well as future projects, to qualify its technology for Western Australia’s Stand Alone Power System (SAPS) program, run by state-owned utilities Western Power and Horizon Power. The program is part of the state’s broad strategy to replace its stringy regional network of poles and wires with renewable standalone alternatives, which usually include a solar array, battery and last-resort diesel generator. These systems have been found by the state to be far cheaper and significantly reduce carbon emissions.
Key Energy says it is also developing additional functionality for the flywheel, paving the way for virtual power plants (VPPs) which it believes could capitalise on the flywheel system’s robust cycling characteristics and long lifespan.
Key energy, founded in 2018, is based in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale and has a test site in nearby Alexandria. Since launching, it has attracted funding from the New South Wales government, City of Sydney and Energy Lab.
Key Energy’s flywheels are sourced from US-headquartered company Amber Kinetics, though the rest of the battery system is believed to be manufactured in Australia.

In a safety audit of more than 600 rooftop PV systems, CEA found that 97% of installations have major safety concerns. The engineering services firm performed inspections in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, India, Japan, United Arab Emirates, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and France.
It shared the main results of the audit in a new report identifying the top 10 most common safety problems in the audited systems. It said that 49% of sites have grounding issues, 47% have damaged modules, 41% have cross-mated connectors, 40% have poor terminations and improperly assembled connectors, 31% have module hotspots, 27% have cables on sharp edges, 26% have broken or damaged connectors as well as water ingress, and 19% have enclosure hotpots.
“The vast majority of these hazards are caused by poor installation practices,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “This means most of them can be identified and resolved relatively easily before they lead to fires, safety risks, and potentially costly liabilities.”
CEA discovered that most grounding issues occur at the inverter or equipment pad, between PV array blocks and module rows, and along extended conduit runs, addressing the most common safety concern. It also found that damage to modules is often caused by incorrect installation or cleaning methods, including walking on modules, as well as extreme weather events like hail or wind.
CEA said that sites displaying cross-mated connectors often result from an incorrect understanding of UL-listed connector pairings and the use of field-made connectors that do not match the module connector.
