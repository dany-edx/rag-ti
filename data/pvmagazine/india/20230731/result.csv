The recent hail storms that occurred in northern Italy have drawn attention to the damage that these sudden and violent atmospheric events can cause to photovoltaic systems. Several system owners have posted photos of damaged plants on social networks, clearly demonstrating the violence of the hailstorms and, above all, the size of the hailstones, which in some cases even reached 20 cm in diameter.
But how big do these grains have to be to damage a photovoltaic system? What can be considered a critical threshold beyond which the damage becomes significant?
pv magazine Italy tried to answer these questions by dusting off a 2019 report by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) which had investigated the insurance damage data of a historic hailstorm that occurred in June 2016 in the Netherlands.
According to the conclusions of the Dutch researchers, damage to solar panels occurs primarily with hailstones with a maximum size of at least 3 cm. “Larger hailstones (more than 4 cm) cause more damage on average than smaller hailstones, but they also show greater variety in the amount of damage to solar panels,” they explained in the paper “The vulnerability of solar panels to hail.”
Starting at 3 cm, both invisible and visible damage can occur, but starting at 4 cm, the percentage of visible damage increases significantly.
The smallest cracks (microcracks) do not form in the front glass layer but in the silicon, resulting in no reduction of the initial yield. After a few months, however, the damaged areas may begin to show a rapid drop in power, and after about a year the micro-cracks also become visible on the outside of the panel. All damage then reduces the lifespan of a solar panel.
The orientation of the roof relative to the direction of the hail can greatly affect the damage caused by hail to solar panels, the researchers explained, noting that this factor could be even more decisive than the size of the hailstones.
Then there is some empirical evidence – on the other hand, not too significant – that even the angle at which the solar panels are installed can influence the damage to the solar panels. A greater inclination, according to the conclusions of the scientists, would help to moderate the damage.
The study also shows that the frequency of hailstorms is increasing in Europe and the Netherlands, as is the damage caused by hailstorms. This indicates that exposed items, such as solar panels, could become more vulnerable in the future.
“Hail risk and the vulnerability of solar panels to hail should be included in risk models and climate adaptation strategies,” the Dutch researchers concluded.

The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, fell to $0.163 per W in the aftermath of a major industry event in the country that saw market players reiterate that there is intense competition in the module sector.

The 2.98% drop – paring much of last week’s gains – comes as market players, following the China Photovoltaic Industry Association forum in Anhui, contemplated reduced bid prices for the country’s solar power projects. According to one business contact, prices in China are “crappy” and there have been “a lot of low price bids recently.” According to market participants and outcomes observed by OPIS, winning bids for Mono PERC tenders have been as low as CNY1.23 ($0.17)/W, with many significant tier-1 businesses represented.
The competition has put a strain on non-vertically integrated players, a situation exacerbated by the sheer number of module manufacturers in China. Recent bids mean “module manufacturers without their own cell lines cannot survive,” a contact said. A separate source at a smaller business described it as “the monks are many, but the porridge is little” because each bid portion is shared among more than ten companies.
Intense competition and low prices are not hallmarks of just China, however, but extend to other export markets. A source trying to expand into the Australian market noted that prices there are “incredibly low.” According to him, “some major players have already completely penetrated that market,” making it “impossible to find an opportunity to enter.”
Different from the volatility in module pricing, China Mono Grade, OPIS’ price assessment for polysilicon in the country, continues its upward movement, rose 4.13% for a third week running to CNY67.08/kg, or $8.31/kg, on the back of short-term bullish factors like delays in new producers’ production ramping up and the production disruption brought on by regional power rationing. However, sources believe that this does not change the overall picture of oversupply in the China polysilicon market in the long term.
The module segment also features the same prediction view. Looking ahead, module prices are expected to decline as oversupply remains the overarching economic factor, according to sources. However, given previous comments that developers eye procurement when prices have stabilized for a few weeks, the recent notch down might put them in wait-and-see mode in the short term until prices find a floor.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

The German government has approved an update to the National Hydrogen Strategy, doubling the 2030 target for domestic electrolyzer capacity to 10 GW. By 2030, imports will cover 50% to 70% of the country’s expected hydrogen demand of 95 TWh to 130 TWh. Hydrogen applications will be established in all sectors, and a hydrogen start-up network with over 1,800 kilometers of converted and new hydrogen lines is expected by 2027-28. The German Renewable Energy Federation (BEE) said it wants a stronger focus on domestic potential for green hydrogen production, as the government’s strategy mainly targets imports, including blue hydrogen, which has higher emissions and costs.
BloombergNEF has reported that the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH2) has increased slightly this year due to inflation and higher financing costs. However, it says that green hydrogen (H2) will become competitive with existing gray H2 plants operating at marginal cost in five markets by 2030. The analysts say that green hydrogen will be cheaper than new blue H2 by 2028 using Chinese alkaline electrolyzers and by 2033 using Western alkaline electrolyzers, undercutting blue H2 by one to three years earlier in all modeled markets.
Inner Mongolia University researchers have reported that the Klebsiella pneumoniae Y7-3 strain, isolated from sheep rumen, can directly produce high-yield hydrogen using inexpensive straw as a raw material. The strain increased hydrogen production by 15.03% compared to the control group using corn stalk and yeast powder. The researchers published their findings in Energy, stating that anaerobic fermentation with 50 g L−1 of corn straw as the carbon source could produce 1253.72 ± 55.67 mL/L of hydrogen in 24 hours. The addition of regulatory factors such as FeSO4 (30 mg/L), NiCl2 (70 mg/L), or formic acid (5 g L−1) further improved hydrogen production by 25.72%, 17.89%, or 331.07%, respectively.
GreenH Electrolysis, a joint venture between Spain’s H2B2 Electrolysis Technologies and India’s GR Group, has started building its first 1 GW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer factory in India. The plant will start production by October and will have an initial production capacity of 100 MW.
Levidian and United Utilities have teamed up to use sewage biogas in Manchester, England, to produce graphene and hydrogen. “The government-funded collaboration is a first for the UK water industry and will see Levidian’s innovative LOOP technology used to decarbonize biogas created within the wastewater treatment process,” said Levidian. The agreement follows a successful feasibility study. It will serve as the first demonstration of a LOOP100 system. The project has been awarded GBP 3 million (€3,49 million) of funding from the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero Hydrogen BECCS Innovation Programme.
