The JV will build a network of hyperscale data centers, starting with Chennai, Navi Mumbai, Noida, Vizag, and Hyderabad. Development and construction at these sites have already begun.
The partnership will leverage Adani’s expertise in full-stack energy management, renewable power, real estate, and managing large infrastructure projects.
EdgeConneX, as a technology-driven global data center provider with 50 facilities in over 30 markets, will provide its expertise in rapidly building out and operating data centers around the world.
In addition to full-scale data centers, AdaniConneX will also develop a portfolio of Edge data centers strategically located throughout India that will support the need for more proximate capacity. These Edge sites are designed and planned to scale with demand and become full-scale data center campuses easily.  
Importantly, this pan-Indian platform of hyperscale and hyperlocal data centers will largely be powered by renewable energy.
“In Adani, we have the ideal partner in India,” said Randy Brouckman, CEO of EdgeConneX. “They possess the necessary capabilities and unique expertise in India required to build out critical digital infrastructure that can best support our customers across the entire country. We look forward to investing in the digital economy of India and meeting our customers’ needs throughout the region in collaboration with Adani.”
“India currently has one of world’s largest data subscriber population and to address the need for a reliable infrastructure to support Cloud, content, network, Internet of Things, 5G, artificial intelligence and enterprise requirements, data centers are a fundamental infrastructure need of a nation. The Adani Group brings to the table a unique combination of green power, real estate expertise, access to undersea cable landing stations, and several nodes across the country that will serve as edge locations,” said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group.

WBREDA shall be the offtaker, and the power procured from these projects has been provisioned to be sold to various schools, institutes and organizations having grid connectivity.
The work includes design and engineering, manufacture/procurement, testing, supply installation, commissioning, and five years of comprehensive maintenance of the plants.
The entire project cost is estimated at INR 40.59 crore.
Only indigenously manufactured PV modules are allowed for the plants. The modules shall be based on crystalline silicon technology.

Under this MoU, the two organizations will strengthen research-industry interaction for knowledge sharing and capacity building through collaboration.
Joint endeavors would pertain to further developing power system simulation models; integrated resource planning, including demand and supply, on a short-term, medium-term, and long-term perspective; preparation of joint reports and capacity building of state utilities.
On the occasion, KVS Baba, chairman and managing director, POSOCO, reiterated existing collaborations with TERI in leading India’s energy transitions. “With its rich experience in the power sector, TERI, together with POSOCO, can produce extensive research reports backed with evidence to gain confidence in robust power systems operation.”
Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General, TERI, added, “An increasing amount of renewable energy penetration is causing system instability, and we need to look at interventions with the dynamic nature of load. Together with POSOCO, TERI will further enhance the modeling capability backed with rich data-sets that can address the challenges of the Indian power sector.”

Out of this, about 5.7 GW is likely to be commissioned in the ﬁrst half.
The exemplary addition forecast for the first half of 2021 is based on about 4.5 GW of central and string inverters and 3 GW of modules shipments to India in the last quarter of 2020, stated JMK Research.
Rooftop solar addition in 2021 is estimated at 2 GW, as against 1172 MW in 2020.
According to JMK analysts, the nation’s new utility-scale solar capacity for the year 2020 (January-December) stood at just about 2.6 GW, 65% less than the 2019 installations. 
However, rooftop solar saw substantial addition of 1172 MW despite Covid. Gujarat topped in rooftop installation, accounting for about 42% (496 MW) of the new addition. It was followed by Rajasthan (180 MW) and Tamil Nadu (154 MW).
Q4 2020
JMK said India installed 1016 MW of utility-scale solar capacity in the fourth quarter (October-December) of 2020, about 86% higher than the preceding quarter.
Huawei led the list of inverter suppliers with more than 1.7 GW of shipment during the quarter. 
Jinko was the top module supplier, accounting for 25% of the total shipments to India. High-efﬁciency mono PERC modules emerged as developers’ favorite, accounting for nearly 58% of India’s total shipments in the last quarter.
