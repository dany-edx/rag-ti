The plants are to be set up in various sizes under the Capex model. These will come upon the identified rooftops of government offices and state-run industrial units and educational institutions, connected to TANGEDCO’s distribution network.
The prospective contractor’s scope of work includes site survey, design, supply, installation, testing, commissioning, and five years of comprehensive maintenance of the plants.
Tamil Nadu targets 9 GW of cumulative installed solar energy capacity by the year 2023. The overall solar energy target is divided into 5.4 GW utility-scale and 3.6 GW consumer categories.

(DVC) has assessed 2 GW of floating solar potential across reservoirs of its Maithon, Panchet, Tilaiya and Konar dams in Jharkhand. It has sought approval from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to set up this capacity under the Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPP) scheme.
DVC is a statutory body under the Ministry of Power, Govt. of India.
Out of 2 GW, DVC has already received the approval for 990 MW from the MNRE.
Part capacity from 990 MW will be tendered shortly, according to a key official from DVC.
This capacity is planned across three reservoirs and will presumably be set up in a joint venture with NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd. DVC has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with NTPC Renewable Energy Ltd to develop renewable energy power parks in and around the reservoirs of its dams.

DEG allocated the funds from its Up-Scaling Program, which is co-ﬁnanced by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. The 5-year loan of $749,000 follows Husk successfully closing debt totalling $10.3 million from EDFI-ElectriFI and IREDA in 2022 to build over 200 microgrids in India.
The DEG ﬁnancing is the ﬁrst debt raised by Husk for its business in Nigeria, where the company currently has 12 operational microgrids, and a target of building 500 by 2026.
“The eight microgrids in Nigeria will connect more than 500 residential and commercial customers, reduce the number of diesel generators in use by 400, while creating about 40 new direct local jobs,” stated Husk Power.
Founded in 2008, Husk Power Systems is a net-zero energy services company in rural Asia and Africa, and operator of the largest ﬂeet of community solar microgrids.
