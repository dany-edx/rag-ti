U.K. researchers have proposed to use the airflow generated from compressed air for the simultaneous cleaning and cooling of solar modules.
They utilized a mathematical model to analyze how dust adhesion on the PV panels’ surface is removed through the airflow and how the air had, also, a positive impact on the panel operating temperature. These findings were used to build a pilot cleaning and cooling system based on a compressed-air unit which was made of a compressor, an air tank, and an airflow regulation valve, and a series of nozzles with a thickness of 5mm. All components, according to the research team, are low-cost and standardized products.
“The compressor is directly powered by the PV panels and the release of the compressed air from the tank is regulated by the valve to meet the mass flow requirements of cleaning and cooling,” the scientists explained. “The spreading air from the nozzles installed at the edge of panels overlaps and forms a flake shape airflow then carries away the dust and heat from the panel surface.” Air can be transmitted over the panels through a pipe assembly that can be moved across an installation to clean and cool its parts when it is more needed.
The British team tested the system on a PV system relying on monocrystalline PV panels operating in an unspecified area of northwestern India. “The average size of the dust deposited on the panel surface was 20µm and almost 90% of particles had diameters less than 30µm”, it specified. “The tilting angle of the panel was set to 30 degrees and the average temperature of the surface can reach up to 333 Kelvin.”
After two weeks of testing, the panel surface was covered by 5.3g of dust, which reduced its power output from 42.5 to 37.5 W at 303 Kelvin. After cleaning operations were implemented through the airflow injected by two nozzles, the power output of the module returned to an average of 41.82 W. The experiment also showed that, at a temperature of 333 Kelvin, the module’s yield dropped to 28.24 W while, after 130 seconds of airflow, the temperature fell to 315 Kelvin and the power output increased to 32.42 W.
The blowing time was then set as 10, 15, and 20 seconds and the power output of the tested PV systems increased, from 567.4 W, by 30.7%, 33.6%, and 36.1%, respectively. The cooling effect, however, may only be obtained for short periods of time during the cleaning operations, as the costs for producing the airflow are higher than the benefits achieved by long cooling operations. “Therefore, the blowing time and specific particle size for removals need to be determined, considering the optimal balance between energy consumption in compressing air and energy gain from PV performance improvement, for the application scenario studied,” the academics asserted.
In further research, they want to investigate nozzle configuration, frequency and time for cleaning operations, and how to integrate maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under different dust deposition rates and PV module temperatures.
All the details of the system, which is described as an ideal solution for arid climates, can be found in the paper Study on the cleaning and cooling of solar photovoltaic panels using compressed airflow, published in Solar Energy. All the researchers come from the University of Warwick, in the United Kingdom.

The application was filed by Mundra Solar PV, Jupiter Solar Power and Jupiter International, through the Indian Solar Manufacturers Association (ISMA).
In the application, the domestic manufacturers sought the imposition of anti-dumping duty to protect them from the material injury caused due to such imports at unfairly low price levels.
Having examined the application, the DGTR found prima facie evidence that the normal value of the solar cells in each of the three exporting countries exceeded the net export prices significantly, indicating dumping of these products into India.
The applicants submitted that due to this price undercutting, they were not able to sell in the open market (installations in the private domain). During the 18-month period of investigation (July 2019 to December 2020), their sales volume was negligible in the open market in which the imported goods compete with them. And this left them with unutilized capacity even after making sales under the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) scheme [that mandates use of domestically-made equipment for 12 GW of solar projects to be set up by state-run power generators].
Based on the submitted evidence, the DGTR announced the launch of an investigation to determine the existence, degree, and effect of any alleged dumping of solar cells from China, Thailand, and Taiwan and to recommend the amount of anti-dumping duty, which, if levied, would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.

Researchers at Harvard claim to have developed a lithium-metal, solid-state battery with improved stability and increased ability to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite penetration.
“Our research shows that the solid-state battery could be fundamentally different from the commercial liquid electrolyte lithium-ion battery,” said researcher Xin Li. “By studying their fundamental thermodynamics, we can unlock superior performance and harness their abundant opportunities.”
The battery can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times at high current density, the scientists said. Its multilayer design is described as a structure in which a less-stable electrolyte is sandwiched between more stable solid electrolytes that are able to prevent any lithium dendrite growth. This architecture was then combined with a commercial high energy density cathode material.

“Think of the battery like a BLT sandwich,” the Harvard group explained. “First comes the bread — the lithium metal anode — followed by lettuce — a coating of graphite. Next, a layer of tomatoes — the first electrolyte — and a layer of bacon — the second electrolyte. Finish it off with another layer of tomatoes and the last piece of bread — the cathode.”
The first electrolyte, which the academics designated with the chemical name Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5, or LPSCI, is more stable with lithium but subject to dendrite penetration. By contrast, the second one, dubbed Li10Ge1P2S12, or LGPS, is more immune to dendrites despite being less stable with lithium. Under this configuration, dendrites are allowed to pass through the graphite and first electrolyte but are stopped right before the second.
“The cycling performance of the lithium metal anode paired with a LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode is very stable, with an 82 per cent capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at a 20C rate and 81.3 per cent capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at a 1.5C rate,” the academics emphasized. “Our design also enables a specific power of 110.6 kilowatts per kilogram and specific energy up to 631.1 watt hours per kilogram at the micrometre-sized cathode material level.”
The battery, according to the academics, also has self-healing properties, as it should be able to backfill holes created by the dendrites. Its creators claim it has the potential to recharge electric vehicles within 10 to 20 minutes.
The device design was described in the paper “A dynamic stability design strategy for lithium metal solid-state batteries”, published in nature.
