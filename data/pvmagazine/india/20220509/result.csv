The company, which established a presence in India in 2016, recorded surging sales after 2019, as it hired a local team to work closely with customers. It has shipped more than 6.5 GW in India since 2020.
“In 2021, India accounted for around 10% of Longi Solar’s global business, with around 3.8 GW of Longi modules shipped to the nation against our worldwide sales of around 38 GW,” Pradeep Kumar, managing director at Longi Solar India, told pv magazine.
Longi’s focused approach in India has been instrumental in driving customers away from poly to mono technology.
“Technology is always accepted globally first and a little later in India. We have seen in the past that it took a lot of time for customers to shift from poly to mono technology,” he said. “But since we have been working very closely with customers and educating them on technology perspective, there is a change in terms of attitude and approach of Indian customers. Whatever we have been telling them, they have accepted it in a very right spirit. Nowadays, technology acceptance among Indian customers has become much faster.”
Longi is gearing up to continue to grow its India sales under the new duty regime. India imposed a basic customs duty of 40% on foreign-made solar modules and 25% on cells from April, as it looks to promote domestic PV manufacturing. To steer through these times, it has opened up all its books.
The company is also aligning itself with the Indian government’s goal to boost domestic manufacturing.
“Longi is committed to the Indian market, and we would be keenly exploring the possible synergies bringing our technical expertise to the thriving Indian manufacturing segment in the near future,” said Luke Lu, vice president and head of the Asia-Pacific region for Longi Solar.

Shah formerly served as the chief executive officer of IndiGrid, the largest infrastructure investment trust in the Indian energy sector. IndiGrid owns, operates, and manages $3 billion of power transmission networks and renewable energy assets.
Shah has also served as the chief financial officer of Sterlite Power and IndiGrid. He succeeds Ranjit Gupta, who left Azure Power after a three-year stint. Gupta has said that his new gig will likely be in the solar industry.
“There is a lot of value to be created [in the renewable industry] as the world wakes up to climate change and recognizes the geopolitical imperative,” he said in a LinkedIn post.
Azure Power Global builds and operates some of India’s largest grid-scale renewable power projects, supplying renewable power to government utilities and independent industrial and commercial customers. The company has a pan-India portfolio of more than 7.4 GW, with over 2.9 GW of operational capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/09/multi-chamber-solar-cold-storage-system/,"COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,OFF-GRID SOLAR,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MAY 9, 2022",Multi-chamber solar cold storage system,"Inficold, a provider of cold chain solutions for off-grid solar applications, has developed multi-chamber, modular solar cold storage systems to address the problem of food spoilage caused by India’s inefficient cold-chain network. 
Large cold storage is difficult to find in large cities, and farm/village level cold storage is primarily non-existent due to unreliable grid electricity. Inficold’s system enables farm-level cooling for perishable commodities in locations with weak grid availability.
The Inficold solar cold storage system stores solar energy in a thermal storage system (TSS) for cooling during non-solar hours. The system automatically switches to grid electricity if TSS depletes below a minimum level. The end user can configure these systems in the temperature range of 0 C to 20 C. 
The solar-powered cold storage is available in both container and indoor cold room options, in capacities ranging from 5 metric tons (MT) to 100 MT. This technology is modular in that multiple thermal energy storage can be integrated into larger cold storage. 
The 10 MT model is powered by 14 kWp of solar panels. The system comes with four chamber options, providing the flexibility to store multiple commodities in different temperature-controlled chambers. Pre-cooling capacity on solar (removing field heat from freshly harvested produce) is 2,500 kg/day. Pre-cooling capacity on solar plus grid is 5,000 kg/day.
Inficold developed the product in partnership with the National Institute of Solar Energy, under the government of India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/05/09/new-water-draining-device-for-rooftop-pv-systems/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MAY 9, 2022",New water-draining device for rooftop PV systems,"From pv magazine Global
Portuguese startup Solarud has unveiled a water-draining device that can be clipped to solar modules, in order to resolve dust and soiling issues.
“The piece is usable on panels that have frame heights of 40 mm, 35 mm or 30 mm, and thickness between 8 mm and 11 mm. It is suited for modules with slopes between 3 degrees and 20 degrees,” the company’s co-founder, António Peres, told pv magazine.
The device was designed with rooftop installations in mind, where difficult accessibility and height-related risks make soiling an even greater concern for operations and maintenance contractors. While the device cannot replace cleaning, which remains essential, “the goal is to improve the energy production between cleaning cycles by preventing the soiling impact,” Peres said.
The company claims energy gains of 3.5% on average, with better performance being achieved with solar panels in portrait position, when soiling at the bottom of the module affects all its three substrings.
In a case study, the company showed the gains between two equal strings in the same installation – one installed with Solarud and one without.
“The modules were all cleaned on week zero and we then compared the performance of the strings on week 13,” Peres said.
The company developed and produces the device in Portugal. It is available for bulk purchases, starting at 50 units for €100 ($106), or €2 per unit. Each piece weighs 6 grams and is made of UV-resistant recyclable plastic for longer durability.
The company is focused on the European market but distributes globally. Its main clients are investors and project owners seeking fast returns on investment, as well as O&M companies looking to provide better performance alongside their cleaning services.
