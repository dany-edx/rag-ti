The power supplies will be procured on a medium- to long-term basis.
“The [expression of interest] will also be used to arrive at uniform specifications and parameters for the proposed procurement and to collect the information about probable suppliers,” said NTPC. “On receipt of [the expression of interest], technical discussions/presentations may be held with the [renewable energy] generators, who are prima facie, considered technically capable for the supply of [renewable energy] power.”
Applicants should have a minimum 10 MW of renewables to supply. To be eligible, the applicants should have commercially operational renewable-energy plants or storage projects set for commissioning on or before Dec. 31, 2023. Generators who have already obtained investment approvals or contracts for the main package would be eligible.

The multi-busbar panels provide power outputs ranging from 635 W to 660 W, with efficiencies between 20.38% and 21.18%. Bifacial gain is up to 25% with the dual-glass modules, leading to 825 W of overall power output.
The modules feature 132 half-cells. They measure 2,391 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm and weigh 39.3 kg.
Under standard test conditions, the open-circuit voltage is between 45.8 V and 46.3 V. The short-circuit current ranges from 17.76 A to 18.17 A.  The modules are designed for large-scale utility systems, commercial and industrial systems, and residential rooftop systems.

The projects will be built in Pavagada. These are being tendered under the “domestic content requirement” category, which only allows the use of PV cells and modules that were made in India.
The prospective contractor will design, install and commission the solar project and 220 kV substation. It will also provide operation and maintenance services for three years from the date of full capacity commissioning. In addition, it will supply bifacial PV modules, with average wattages of 540 Wp.

The German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has earmarked €10 million to support the deployment of solar modules with a power of up to 600 W on balconies, terraces, and facades.
Under the program, each household is entitled to receive a rebate of up to €500 ($496).
“The small systems with an output of up to 600 W that we want to support do not require approval, they only have to be registered with the energy supplier,” the government said in a statement. “This can quickly bring savings when electricity prices rise.”
According to estimates by the North Rhine-Westphalia consumer association (VZ NRW), in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, a balcony module, with an upfront investment of €350 to €500, can provide electricity with a current value of €54 per year. The payback period ranges from six to nine years. The prerequisite for this, however, is that the electricity is used entirely by the user.
