These U.S. dollar-denominated bonds will have a door-to-door tenor of 18 years and weighted average life of 12.7 years.
AGEL RG1 consists of Adani Green Energy (UP) Ltd, Parampujya Solar Energy Pvt Ltd and Prayatna Developer Pvt Ltd, which operate a cumulative 930 MW of solar generation assets across India. It intends to use the gross proceeds of the offering to refinance the US$500 million 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 which were issued on June. 10, 2019.
Fitch Ratings stated that the expected rating reflects the post-refinancing credit profile of AGEL RG1. The expected rating is underpinned by long-term fixed-price power purchase agreements (PPAs), commercially proven technology with a pure solar portfolio, experienced operations and maintenance (O&M) contractors, adequate financial profile and fully amortising debt structure eliminating the refinancing risk. Noteholders benefit from a standard security package and robust covenants restricting distributions.

JSW Neo won this capacity by quoting a competitive tariff of INR 2.53/kWh in SJVN’s auction for setting up 1.5 GW ISTS-connected solar power projects. The company can set up the ISTS-connected PV capacity on a build-own-operate basis anywhere in India for power supply under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with SJVN.
The project is required to supply power from the full contracted capacity within 24 months from the effective date of the PPA.
With this addition of 700 MW, JSW Energy’s total locked-in generation capacity has swelled to 11 GW comprising 1.4 GW of solar capacity.  The total locked-in generation capacity of 11 GW comprises 7.2 GW operational and 2.6 GW under-construction projects across wind, thermal, and hydro, and LoAs for 1.2 GW capacity from SECI and SJVN. In addition, the Company has 3.4 GWh of locked-in energy storage capacity from battery energy storage system and pumped hydro storage projects. The company expects to have 9.8 GW of operational generation capacity by CY 2024, up from 7.2 GW at present. It aims to reach 20 GW generation capacity and 40 GWh of energy storage capacity by 2030. JSW Energy targets a 50% reduction in carbon footprint by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.

The company currently has 600 MW of production capacity, which produces polycrystalline (200 MW) and mono PERC modules and is equipped to handle TOPCon production. It will phase out the polycrystalline production by March 15.
At Intersolar India last week, Novasys introduced its Rigel Plus Series 550 Wp mono PERC bifacial module that is 21.3% efficient. The module is built with 144 half-cut M10 cells. The open-circuit voltage is 49.93 V and the short-circuit current is 13.97 A. The module fill factor is 78.92%.

Tenaga Nasional Berhad is set to build 2.5 GW of hybrid hydro-floating solar (HHFS) projects at its hydropower dams.
It will initially install 30 MW at its Chenderoh Hydro reservoir and follow up with work at its Temenggor and Kenyir Hydro reservoirs.
The company said it has signed partnerships with state agencies “to ensure that the HHFS development is carried out successfully and responsibly.” It added that the rollout will support Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap, which was released last year.
According to Tenaga Nasional Chief Executive Officer Dato’ Seri Ir. Baharin Din, using bodies of water for solar installation can conserve land usage, preserve land natural habitats, and reduce water evaporation.
“Unlike traditional thermal power plants, floating solar farms do not have water or air discharges that could negatively impact water or air quality. Hence, it minimizes pollution and supports biodiversity with minimal disruption to the aquatic ecosystems,” he said. “Floating solar farms can complement other renewable energy sources to power the national grid with the potential to boost clean power significantly.”
The HHFS project follows a Tenaga Nasional floating solar pilot project, located on an sh pond on the island of Stesen Janakuasa Sultan Azlan Shah on the western coast of Malaysia. According to Baharin, the project has been a “remarkable success”.
Data from Tenaga Nasional shows that the pilot project has generated more than 600 MWh of energy since 2019. It features 288 installed PV modules with a total capacity of 105.12 kWp, equating to enough energy to meet the needs of 30 houses.
“Every component of the floating solar system was carefully chosen and designed. Even the floaters or pontoons were made of certified food-grade high-density polyethene to minimize the impact on water quality,” Baharin said. “The project has shown no adverse impact on wildlife living in the surrounding area.”
In November, Tenaga Nasional opened a tender for a 30 MW floating solar plant in eastern Malaysia.
Malaysia had recorded an estimated 1.9 GW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2022, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The country has committed to increasing its renewable energy composition to 70% of its total generation capacity by 2050.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/27/meyer-burger-prepares-to-shut-down-plant-in-germany/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-02-27,Meyer Burger prepares to shut down plant in Germany,"From pv magazine Global
Swiss PV manufacturer Meyer Burger has decided to discontinue solar module production in March in Freiberg, Germany, in a bid to stop sustained losses in Europe. The company will instead concentrate on building up its production facilities in the United States.
“As there has not yet been any decision on policy support measures to remediate current market distortions created by oversupply and dumping prices of solar modules, the group has decided to start preparations for the closure of its Freiberg site,” the company said on Friday.
The company said it expects significant cost savings from April. Sales activities in Europe will be unaffected and customers will receive full -product warranties for up to 30 years, it added.
Europe’s solar manufacturers have urged the European Union to step in with emergency measures to protect them from insolvency. Earlier this month, the bloc finalized the Net Zero Industry Act, under which at least 40% of solar equipment deployed on the continent should be locally produced. However, thus far it has failed to introduce any emergency measures that would help to safeguard ailing businesses.
Meyer Burger said that it will seek shareholder approval for a rights issue of as much as CHF 250 million to finance the completion of its US manufacturing facilities in Colorado and Arizona.
“The rights issue is an attractive proposal to our investors as they can invest into the highly attractive US business where we are positioned to have the potential to grow a profitable business,” Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt said on Friday. “Furthermore, a clear focus on our US business makes us independent of political decisions in Europe.”
Eventually, the company’s goal is to close the funding gap of CHF 450 million with a combination of the rights issue, an export agency credit guarantee from the German government of up to $95 million, and either the “45X” advanced manufacturing production tax credit under the US Inflation Reduction Act, in the amount to $300 million, or a US Department of Energy loan.
Meyer Burger said it expects to use these potential sources of financing to complete its solar cell manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and its solar module manufacturing site in Goodyear, Arizona. Both facilities are currently under construction, with a targeted production capacity of 2 GW each.
“Due to a lack of European protection against unfair competition from China, nearly four years of hard work by great employees in Europe is at risk,” said Sentis, which is Meyer Burger’s largest shareholder with a 10.01% stake.
In reaction to Meyer Burger’s announcement on Friday, SolarPower Europe Walburga Hemetsberger said that “this only underlines the absolute urgency with which policymakers should act. Are governments happy to leave our energy transition goals entirely in the hands of others?”
