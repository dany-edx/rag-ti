Italian start-up Genius Watter has developed a desalination solution that is powered exclusively by photovoltaics and is claimed to be an ideal solution for rural areas with no connection to grid electricity.
“We have completed a project in Cape Verde in 2020 and we are now developing [an]other five projects, of which three are expected to be built in 2021,” the company chairman, Franco Traverso, who is also the chairman of the U.S.-Canadian solar module manufacturer Silfab, told pv magazine.
The battery-free reverse osmosis desalination system is fully containerized and thermally insulated. It is able to produce up to 1,000m3 of potable water per day and is claimed to have a life cycle of more than 30 years.

The company’s patented technology is said to enable the efficient operation of the desalination unit at variable frequencies, depending on irradiation levels. According to Genius Watter, more than 90% of the available net PV energy is converted to potable water. A storage tank to store water, with a capacity from 50m to 1,000m3 can be also installed within the system’s fenced spot and used for water demand during nighttime or on cloudy days. According to Traverso, the desalination unit needs maintenance work only twice a year, which would be required to refill consumables and change filters.
The system is currently available in two versions, for brackish water and seawater desalination. The former version can be built with freshwater output ranging from 20m3 to 500m3 per day and a required PV capacity of 9.6 kW to 241.1 kW. The seawater model may be deployed with the same freshwater capacity and a required PV capacity of 31.6 kW to 709.6 kW.

Each system has a solar-powered water pumping unit that is able to pump feed water from 250m underground and supply constant pressure to the reverse-osmosis unit. The proposed solution may also be equipped with an automatic chlorination and re-mineralization unit to deliver potable water meeting World Health Organization (WHO) standards. It may also be coupled with an additional power source if constant daily water volumes are necessary.
Genius Watter is offering the desalination solution with its own, patented drone technology for underground water aquifer detection, which is claimed to be able to precisely detect volume, depth, and GPS positioning of water sources at a depth of up to 300m.
The cost of the system, including the PV system, is less than €4000/m3/ day. “For a 90m3/day plant of desalinated brackish water, the turnkey cost of the plant, installed in an African country, would be around €330,000,” Traverso explained, adding that the system is produced in Italy by an undisclosed manufacturer with 30 years of experience in desalination and is then tested at Genius Watter’s headquarters in Carmignano di Brenta.
According to the CEO, the system can produce water for agricultural use at an opex of only €0.20/m3.
The company is also considering the possibility of becoming an independent water producer itself through the water-as-a-service financing model. “It is clear that when the water is sold instead of the asset, the sale price of the same increases considerably to leave room for the right margin for the investor who must obtain a reasonable return on his investment,” traverso highlighted. “Even in this case, however, the selling price of the cubic meter of desalinated water is normally competitive, not to mention the advantages of the environmental and social sustainability of the system for obtaining the water and distributing it to users.”
The system is claimed to be particularly suitable for irrigation and livestock farming in semi-desert and coastal areas but also for islands that are affected by a scarcity of fresh water, especially in the summer months when solar radiation is greater.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/23/visakas-solar-roof-granted-patent-rights-in-south-africa/,"DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,OFF-GRID SOLAR,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA,INDIA,SOUTH AFRICA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 23, 2021",Visaka’s solar roof granted patent rights in South Africa,"Telangana-based Visaka Industries today announced it had been granted a patent for its ‘ATUM’ solar roof product by the South African Patent Office. The patent, valid for 20 years, has been granted for the invention titled ‘eco-friendly energy-generating roofs.’
ATUM is a solar power-generating roof with solar panels (made with poly or mono-crystalline solar cells) integrated on cement boards—a highly durable roofing material, making it the world’s first solar panel which can be directly used as a roof.
Unlike other solar panels that need to be separately mounted upon a racking system and placed on the truss, Atum is both the roof and the solar panel. It provides a sleek and simpler integrated solar rooﬁng system while increasing energy generation by 20-40% compared to convention solar rooftops. 
Further, compared to galvanized steel sheets, ATUM solar roof minimizes the effects of heat and rain without requiring an insulation mat under the roof.
While granting the patent, the South Africa Patent Office recognized ATUM as a unique integrated solar product “[that] can be used as a roof, facade, or other building applications. It also relates to a method of preparing, designing, and producing the solar cement boards by integrating the cement boards with that of solar panels to form an envisaged single entity. The solar cement board comprises a plurality of solar energy capturing components like photovoltaic (PV) cells or the like, sandwiched over specially treated fiber cement board or the likes.”
Scope
The patent from the South African Patent Office paves the way for introducing ATUM in South Africa and other African countries.
“South Africa, due to its geographic location, receives large amounts of solar energy and is the largest solar market on the African continent. An integrated, solar energy generating roof like ATUM can enable distributed microgrids, which is the need of the hour in South Africa, and increase the country’s pace of adoption of solar energy. With the number of unelectrified in South Africa and elsewhere in the continent, the adoption of solar could be a gamechanger,” the company said in a statement.
Visaka Industries
Global safety science company UL has already certified ATUM solar roof as per the latest International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and UL standards for successfully passing the solar photovoltaic (PV) module tests. ATUM has also been certified by Campbell Corporation to take a uniform load of 780 lbs per sqft and a snow load of 2200 lbs. The jointing mechanism in the roof is a patented leakproof system as per American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) standards. The roof is class A fire rated and designed to take wind speeds of over 150 kmph, making it hurricane proof. 
ATUM has been successfully installed across many locations in India, including Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Mumbai (Maharashtra), and Hyderabad (Telangana), and in Sharjah, UAE.
Visaka Industries Limited received the patent for ATUM from the India Patent Office in September 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/23/australian-solar-installer-receives-unexpected-response-from-customers-after-switching-exclusively-to-microinverters/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 23, 2021",Australian solar installer receives unexpected response from customers after switching exclusively to microinverters,"From pv magazine International
After six years of installing solar on the roofs of Western Sydney, Jake Warner made a bold decision. He decided to no longer offer string inverters. Instead, his boutique company, Pentrith Solar, would only install solar systems with the less common and more expensive microinverters.
The switch garnered a number of unforeseen responses. Firstly, the company’s conversion rate – the amount of enquiries which turn to actual sales – increased. “We’re actually getting less price objections,” Warner told pv magazine Australia, “the opposite to what I expected.”
Trouble, it seems, has come from an entirely different source. “The biggest thing I’ve found difficult to handle is, we’re still servicing string inverters,” Warner explained. The issue is that when past customers discover the company has stopped offering string inverters, they’re left feeling lumped with a subpar product. “I didn’t really think about it, but I do have to think about how that makes people feel.”
Warner is quick to clarify that he isn’t trying to wage any wars on string inverters. “This is not about rubbishing string inverters. If that’s what you can afford at the time, that’s fine,” he said. “Coal is the opposition here, not other solar companies and not string inverters.”
Founded in 2017, Penrith Solar averages about six installs every day. The company doesn’t use subcontractors at all and provides customers follow-up support through its in-house service team. Stemming from that commitment, the company recently undertook an internal audit looking at how often its team was called to service solar systems with microinverters compared to those with string inverters. What he found was stark: his team was eight times less likely to be called to fix microinverters than they were string inverters.
“This is just our own study,” Warner qualified. “In our experience, we found [microinverters] to be eight times more reliable.”
Specifically, Penrith Solar has been using Enphase’s IQ range (including the IQ 7, IQ7+ and IQ7 A), and Warner noted that his findings are particular to those products. He found just four failures among the 13,000 microinverters Penrith Solar has installed, according to its internal audit. “We’ve had a tremendously low amount of failures.”
It wasn’t only that Warner has found microinverters to be substantially more reliable, he also thinks they are easier to manage from a warehouse perspective. Instead of having to stock a range of string inverters to fit different system sizes, Warner now just orders one microinverter for every panel coming into his stockroom.
The third factor that swayed Warner was safety. He says his in-house service team gets called out to DC isolator fires weekly. “It sucks, but we’re almost used to it,” Warner said. “It doesn’t even surprise us anymore.” Some clients don’t even realize there has been a fire, according to him, but when his team looks at the isolator, they’ve found it burned. “It’s pretty bad.”
While Penrith Solar has been installing microinverters on solar systems for a number of years, the decision to use them exclusively is relatively new. Which is to say, while the company’s conversion rate has increased in the last two months, it may be more symptomatic of Australians’ eagerness to install solar following the pandemic.
Rather than drawing conclusions from the fluctuating rate, Warner is relying on his interactions with customers, who he says have been exceedingly receptive to the microinverters value proposition. Warner has a home-spun theory which he says explains the warm reception, he calls it cost bandwidth.
“When you ask a consumer what they expect to pay for a 6.6 kW system, their response is somewhere from $2,500 to $6,600. They rarely expect to pay more than $1 per watt for a string inverter,” he explained.  “Now when you start talking about microinverters, the client doesn’t expect to get that for $2,500. The client’s mindset starts at about $6,500 and ends somewhere around $10,000 – that’s around where they think is reasonable.”
On the boutique end of the spectrum, a string inverter solar system installed by Penrith Solar used to come in at around $6,900. Its systems fitted with microinverters, on the other hand, start at $7,700. “So with string inverters, [Penrith Solar] are not in that price bandwidth. But with micro-inverters, we’re well and truly within the clients’ expectations,” he added.
It’s led the company to have less price objections, with customers overwhelmingly understanding the added value offered microinverter’s ability to monitor both panels and consumption, as well as their longevity. It’s important to note here that solar companies typically charge around 30% more for systems with microinverters, but Penrith Solar has now managed to get this figure down to about 10% through increased installation efficiency. This means that while its microinverter systems are still more expensive than its string inverters were, the price difference is less than half of many of its competitors.
While Warner has found little price pushback, he admits he underestimated the severity of hurt feelings. When we spoke, Warner had just left an inspection for a 90 kW system to be fitted at the business of one of his past residential customers. “The client said to me, ‘how come we’re not using string inverters? We did that on my house, remember?” Warner then had to explain Penrith Solar had stopped offering string inverters, even though he had installed a system on the man’s house with them. “I had to handle his emotions on site, which were – he felt, not betrayed, but wondered if he got the best value for money.”
“I had to explain to him how much the price difference was when he bought his system, and remind him of the saving he’s actually getting right now, as well as informing him that in today’s market, microinverters are the best choice for [his business].”
This delicate juggle between continuing to advocate for the value of string inverters while pitching discontinuing their use has, for Warner, been the hardest part of the transition.
Warner said Penrith Solar is the only company he knows of which has decided to exclusively install microinverters, though he could name a number of other solar companies he believes are using them for a majority of installs.
In terms of other companies operating in Western Sydney and the Blue Mountains, Warner said he has already seen them follow suit and gearing towards microinverter systems. “We’ve done the research for them. We know that it [microinverters] fail less.”
“I’m not saying [microinverters are] always going to be the best choice – there may be in the future something else – 2025, who knows – but right now, with the ammunition and knowledge I have today and the in-field experience, [microinverters] are the best on the market,” Warner said.
