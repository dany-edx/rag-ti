It won the capacity by quoting the lowest bid in the technology-agnostic storage tender that saw participation from Li-ion battery, Na-S battery, and compressed-air storage technologies in addition to pumped storage.
Greenko is developing the world’s largest energy storage platform based on pumped storage technology and has 50 GWh of storage projects already under development.
As per the tender, Greenko will provide 500 MW/3,000 MWh of standalone storage capacity for 25 years to NTPC REL.
NTPC REL will utilize the storage capacity to supply round-the-clock power to utilities and industrial customers.
The tender outcome establishes pumped storage technology as the preferred and lowest-cost long-duration energy storage solution.
“The winning bid translates into unit storage charges of $58/MWh on a single cycle per day basis, a remarkable feat in view of the storage charges discovered in another recent energy storage procurement tender based on battery energy storage systems by SECI ($120/MWh),” stated Greenko. “Taking into account the fact that pumped storage project can deliver more than one cycle per day without any impact on the performance, effective storage charges can be significantly lower at $29/MWh.”

The agreement includes infrastructure costs for further development of the intellectual property, license fees, and royalties on the successful commercialization of CRT’s state-of-the-art electrolyzer technologies.
By partnering with ANIL, CRT will be able to accelerate its research activities to shorten the commercialization of hydrogen electrolyzers.
ANIL is setting up a state-of-the-art vertically integrated 5 GW electrolyzer manufacturing plant in India. The electrolyzer gigafactory is an important element in the plan of Adani Group to invest $70 billion by 2030 in green technologies and projects.
With CRT as a technology partner, ANIL will develop green hydrogen electrolyzer technologies to meet the increasing demand in India and the Middle East North Africa region. The partnership covers the development of electrolyzers based on alkaline, polymer exchange membrane, and anion exchange membrane technology, and CRT’s innovative ‘C Cell’ technology for mass-scale production.

The company plans for 2 GW of ingot and wafer capacity by December 2023 and aims to scale it to 10 GW by 2025.
Ahmedabad-based Chiripal Group has formed a new unit under its arm Chiripal Renewable Energy to manufacture solar cells, modules and glass.
Grew Energy will commission a manufacturing capacity of 4 GW of PV modules, 3 GW PV cells, and 300 tonnes/day of tempered glass in the next four years. The capacity is planned in phases across India, starting with a 2 GW fab in Rajasthan. The Rajasthan facility is expected to start production in June 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/12/09/pv-system-fires-potentially-exacerbated-by-gap-between-solar-panels-rooftops/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 9, 2022","PV system fires potentially exacerbated by gap between solar panels, rooftops","From pv magazine Global
Rise Fire Research AS, an institute in Norway, has conducted a series of experiments indicating that the distance between solar modules and rooftop surfaces could be a crucial factor in PV system fires.
“We have not found any single ideal distance between the roof and the PV modules that can prevent fire propagation,” researcher Ragni Fjellgaard Mikalsen told pv magazine. “But we have seen that the gap distance is one of several parameters that affect the fire spread.”
The scientists said that wind speed and air gap size could affect the development of fires in the space between solar modules and the underlying roof structures. They also looked at how fires could affect PV systems on real, pitched rooftops in Norway. They performed 29 experiments at the institute’s facility in Trondheim in 2021.
The research group identified a link between the size of the gap between a rooftop surface and the modules, and determined how big an initial fire would have to be for the blaze to spread and become larger. 
“These, and other experiments, point to that a larger gap distance decreases the flame propagation, but other parameters, like inclination, ignition source, combustible materials can also affect the fire dynamics in the air gap,” said Fjellgaard Mikalsen.
He claimed that there are no testing methods or standards that properly consider the interplay between PV modules and building surfaces.
“The test methods for building materials are not including the possibility to add PV modules, and the test methods for PV modules are not considering what building surface they should be installed on,” he said. “For building integrated PV modules, the modules need to comply with both the regulations for building materials and as an electrical installation.”
He said that the modules were tested against one of the four European test methods listed in CEN/TS 1187, but noted that these test methods are not particularly well-suited to test PV modules.
“The American test standard UL 1703 / UL 61730 includes some fire tests where the combination of roofing material and PV installation is handled,” he said. “These are based on the test for roofing materials UL 790 where the roof is exposed to an external flame.”
The scientists said that future standards for Norwegian PV installations should be harmonized on a European level, and preferably globally.
“Ideally, the test standards should consider the interactions between the building surface and the PV modules and test the systems at a sufficiently large scale to include the important details of the building surface, fixing system and PV modules,” Fjellgaard Mikalsen said. “To be able to document the fire performance of different combinations of roofing materials, fixing systems and PV modules, a structured classification scheme could be developed.
A similar study, published by the University of Edinburgh and the Technical University of Denmark, showed similar results. The scientists analyzed fire dynamics and flame spread on the substrate beneath panels. They concluded that the shorter the distance between the panels and rooftop, the higher the probability of larger and more destructive fires.
