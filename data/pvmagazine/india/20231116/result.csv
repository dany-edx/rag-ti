The project (called Koppal Transmission Scheme) is the first of the three projects to be executed by ReNew in Karnataka, which will cumulatively help in evacuation of 5 GW of wind and solar power potential identified in Karnataka for implementation and interconnection with the interstate transmission system (ISTS) grid, for a period of 35 years.
The Koppal Transmission Scheme was awarded in FY 2022. It covers construction of a new 400/220 kV sub-station at Koppal along with 276 circuit km of 400 kV D/C quad moose transmission line with extension of the 400 kV GIS Bays at the PGCIL Narendra (New) substation.
Following the commissioning of the 1.5 GW Koppal Transmission Scheme, the remaining transmission for 3.5 GW is expected to be completed by June 2024.
The project is supported by the new Climate Investment Fund, managed by Norfund, and KLP, Norway’s largest pension company.
Following the commissioning of the project, ReNew signed an agreement with Norfund and KLP on the second joint investment in the transmission sector.
“The agreement to invest in the Gadag Project for a 49% stake is the second investment in the partnership, with an ambition for further joint investments. The expected levelized EBITDA for the project is $ 6.2 million,” stated ReNew.
“The project consists of (a) two 500 MVA 400/220 kV sub-station at Gadag with 400 kV D/C transmission line from Gadag substation to Narendra New substation and 400 kV GIS Extn at Narendra New in Karnataka and (b) three 500 MVA 400/220 kV augmentation at Gadag Substation with 400 kV D/C transmission line from Gadag substation to Koppal substation and 400 kV AIS bays Extn at Koppal & Gadag end. Its commercial operations are expected to start in two phases – in the last quarter of FY24 and first quarter of FY25.”
This second investment will allow ReNew to contribute to the connection of another 2.5 GW of planned renewable power to the national grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/16/indias-residential-rooftop-solar-potential-estimated-at-637-gw/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023",India’s residential rooftop solar potential estimated at 637 GW,"Over 250 million households across India have the technical potential to deploy 637 GW of solar energy capacity on rooftops, according to a new independent report by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) released today. The report authors also found that rural areas have a higher technical rooftop potential of 363 GW than urban areas (274 GW) considering the residential rooftop area. Further, residential willingness to install rooftop solar systems is the highest in Gujarat at 13%, while the national average is 5%.
The report stated that deploying just one-third of the 637 GW solar potential could meet the residential sector’s entire electricity demand of 310 TWh.
The overall technical potential reduces to one-fifth (118 GW) after factoring in the current electricity consumption of households. “Most residential consumers fall into low-consumption slabs and solar may not be economically feasible for them without financial support even though it is technically possible,” states the report.
The potential reduces further to 11 GW when no capital subsidy is considered. “The payback period for rooftop solar is restricted to five years and we factor in consumers’ willingness to buy rooftop solar,” explained the report authors.
However, with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s capital subsidy, the report authors have assessed the potential increasing to 32 GW as the subsidy makes the solar systems feasible for more consumers.
Currently, India has installed 11 GW of rooftop solar capacity, of which only 2.7 GW is in the residential sector.
The CEEW report, supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, did a bottom-up analysis across 21 Indian states that cover 97% of the country’s population. It found that 60% of the residential rooftop potential is concentrated in just seven states — Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
Lalit Bohra, joint secretary, MNRE, said, “Accelerating the adoption of rooftop solar is crucial to decarbonize the economy and help India achieve its net zero goal by 2070. MNRE has been actively promoting the rooftop solar sector through its strategic interventions. The recently announced distributed RPO obligation will accelerate demand generation in the rooftop sector. The National Dialogue on Rooftop Solar by CEEW and the launch of its report on the potential are timely interventions to build a common consensus among stakeholders towards making rooftop solar central to India’s energy transition.”
India’s rooftop solar potential is spread geographically across states in contrast to other renewable technologies such as utility-scale solar and wind projects, and could be critical to meeting the energy transition ambitions of states.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/16/coal-power-plants-to-thrive-at-65-plf-despite-surge-in-renewables/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023",Coal power plants to thrive at 65% PLF despite surge in renewables,"Plant load factors (PLFs) of coal-based power plants in India will improve to 65% this fiscal despite record addition in renewable energy (solar and wind) capacity. Healthy PLFs along with lower receivables and encouraging fuel supply will support the credit profiles of private coal-based generating companies (gencos), according to a report by Crisil.
The report stated that over the past two fiscals, demand for electricity has surged at 8-9% annually, driven by the post-pandemic economic rebound. During this period, 34 GW of capacity was added with renewables forming 90%.
The report highlights that in GW terms, this is a 9% growth in power capacities but on normative terms this was only 4-5% growth as capacities operate at varying PLFs. [Normative PLFs vary basis type of capacity – solar & wind 20-21%, hydel 35-40%, thermal 65%, and nuclear 70%.] And in this incremental supply, coal-based power plants remain an important cog, accounting for 69-71% of the total power generation because of the intermittent nature of RE with lower PLFs.
“The trend will likely continue this fiscal. Power demand is seen growing 5-6%, and a part of the incremental requirement will be met by the newly added RE capacities — including 18 GW in wind and solar, the highest ever. That said, a good portion of the incremental generation will be met by existing coal-based power plants,” said Ankit Hakhu, director, CRISIL Ratings. “This will prove beneficial for thermal PLFs, which are likely to improve by 100 basis points (bps) to over 65% in fiscal 2024, as no material coal-based capacity is envisaged this fiscal and relatively low capacity addition of hydro, biomass and nuclear.”
The higher PLFs will continue to be supported by conducive fuel supply as domestic coal production, building upon its record high of 893 million tonne (MT) last fiscal, is on track to achieve 11-13% growth projected for this fiscal. Moreover, coal allocation under various e-auction modes has notably improved. Evacuation infrastructure has also witnessed augmentation with railway rakes for coal transportation 8%7 higher on-year.
In addition, cash flows will be supported by the release of receivables under the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) scheme notified by the government in June 2022. Receivables of private gencos rated by CRISIL Ratings are estimated to reduce from 82 days as of March 2022 to 55-60 days by the end of this fiscal.
“Overall, we expect coal-based power plants rated by us to witness over 20% on-year rise in cash flow from operations (CFO)10 this fiscal. Consequently, CFO to total debt for these power plants will improve from 11% as on March 31, 2023, to an estimated ~15% as on March 31, 2024,” said Mithun Vyas, Team Leader, CRISIL Ratings.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/16/the-overproduction-conundrum/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023",The overproduction conundrum,"From pv magazine 11/23
Despite 2023 thus far demonstrating that end demand in the PV market continues to be strong, spot prices per watt have been anything but. The first half of this year has shown what the consequences can be when supply and demand fall out of balance.
For many years, Exawatt’s production estimates across the PV supply chain have sat broadly within 10% of our global PV installation estimates. This began to change in 2021, when we saw production begin to pull ahead of installations by about 15%. In 2022, the gap grew significantly, to between 30% and 40% for wafers, cells, and modules.
Overproduction didn’t end in 2022. In 2023, comparing the initial production targets announced by manufacturers and Exawatt’s own installations forecast revealed that overproduction not only continued but was on course to increase.
It’s safe to say that the growing gap between production and installations has not been a reflection of weak end demand. Exawatt currently expects global PV installations to exceed 400 GW in 2023, an increase of approximately 60% compared with 2022 figures. Rather, the growing gap between production and installation is a consequence of the exceptional speed at which production has increased, even when compared to hugely impressive installation growth.
Based on our discussions with other PV industry analysts, we believe our figures, that suggest unsustainable levels of overproduction, are not unique. The same trend has also been observed by many of our peers. This leads us to question whether manufacturers’ initial production targets will prove to have been excessively optimistic.
When production levels significantly exceeded installations in 2022 and the first half of 2023, inventories built up throughout the supply chain, leading to an inevitable price crash. In the first half of 2023, spot prices, from wafers to modules, dropped to record lows, with polysilicon prices also taking a substantial hit. This has left limited room for further price declines. Any lower, and even the lowest-cost manufacturers will struggle to turn a profit.

In an attempt to avoid further inventory build-up across the supply chain, some manufacturers scaled back their production plans for 2023. This trend, combined with continued strong end-demand growth, and bolstered by the number of installations in China exceeding expectations, leads Exawatt to project that overproduction in 2023 will likely fall back to within a 20% to 30% range for wafers, cells, and modules.
As a result of the scaling back of production, we believe that current challenges around high inventory levels should prove to be temporary, with production volumes in the second half of 2023 somewhat dependent on how quickly inventory levels can be reduced. Note that we expect that when manufacturers release final production numbers for 2023, our final estimates for wafers, cells, and modules will converge somewhat.
Despite hitting levels higher than those seen before 2022, continued overproduction within the 20% to 30% range might not be so unreasonable in a rapidly growing market – especially when accounting for the delay between production and installation. To put this into perspective, Exawatt estimates the compound annual growth rate in PV installations to have been in the region of 25% in the 10-year period to 2023.
Although overproduction looks likely to return to a more stable level this year, substantial overcapacity seems set to remain throughout the supply chain. Existing major players and new, smaller entrants to the market continue to announce ambitious capacity expansion plans. With these plans far outstripping even the most optimistic forecasts for end demand, substantial overcapacity is unlikely to diminish over the coming years, making unsustainable levels of overproduction an ongoing risk. In 2022, annual module capacity stood at approximately 2.8 times greater than installations. Exawatt’s forecast, based on the expansion plans that have been announced so far, sees manufacturing capacity increasing to nearly four times that of forecast installations by 2025, assuming all announced capacity expansions come to fruition.
Taking a longer-term view, in Exawatt’s high-case scenario, we currently forecast that 1 TW of annual solar installations will be achieved shortly before 2030. Beyond this, a number of possible net-zero scenarios can be achieved with different energy generation mixes, and in most scenarios we model solar demand flattening off in the 2030s.
No matter what route is taken to decarbonization, solar will be key. The industry is well on track to deliver what is necessary, from a manufacturing point of view. Within just a couple of years, manufacturers will be capable of delivering production of the scale required in the 2030s onwards. Unless new capacity is replacing obsolete manufacturing lines, further capacity expansions will only exacerbate the overcapacity that already exists.

The region accounted for 65% of the total $532 billion global funding on renewables in 2022.
Asia’s wind and solar capacity has also grown exponentially at 35% per year since 2015, outpacing Europe’s annual RE growth rate of 29% and North America’s 27%. Its installed wind and solar energy capacity touched 1,029 GW in 2022, constituting 52.5% of the global RE installations, according to the study.


The report highlights the region’s RE capacity expansion was primarily driven by China, India, and Vietnam. While China doubled its wind capacity about every 1.5 years and its solar capacity about every 2.5 years, India grew its wind capacity by over fivefold and nearly doubled its solar capacity between 2016 and 2022.
Vietnam’s solar capacity increased by 18,380% between 2018 and 2022 and the nation wants wind and solar to meet 31% of its energy needs by 2030.
The report states the adoption of renewable energy in Asia is closely tied to significant cost reductions over the past few years, driven by technological advancements, economies of scale, and more resilient supply chains. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOEs) for renewable sources, including onshore wind, offshore wind and solar, has decreased by more than 60% over the past 10 years. The report authors expect the declining price trend to continue.
Aarti Khosla, director, Carbon Copy, said, “Asian economies like India, China and Japan are becoming all the more pivotal for global growth especially as the Asian continent is set to contribute about two-thirds of all global growth. As domestic energy consumption will increase off the back of major infrastructure developments and large manufacturing pushes clean energy should be the crux of development. This will assume even greater significance especially with global energy security threatened with defence issues, as well as economic difficulties being faced by many countries across the world.”
 
The report ‘A driving force: Asia’s Energy Transition’ is the third in a series of reports looking at evidence of the pace of growth in the clean energy transition. It builds on several pieces of research on exponential systems change released by RMI, Systems Change Lab and others this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/11/16/california-to-use-flexible-appliances-for-renewable-energy-integration/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"NOVEMBER 16, 2023",California to use flexible appliances for renewable energy integration,"From pv magazine USA
New flexible demand appliance standards are “coming down the road” in California for water heaters, behind-the-meter batteries, and electric vehicle chargers, said California Energy Commission (CEC) Commissioner Andrew McAllister at a CalFlexHub symposium.
CalFlexHub is a proving ground for flexible load technologies at Berkeley Lab, funded by the CEC, that is evaluating 12 technologies for flexible demand, in collaboration with manufacturers. After setting flexible demand appliance standards for pool controls in October, the CEC expects to open a dialogue on a new appliance category every six months, said a spokesperson.
McAllister said he expects that a rulemaking for electric water heaters will be “in full swing” by late 2024. Ten of the largest heat pump manufacturers have committed to help California reach its goal of 6 million heat pumps for water or space heating by 2030, he said.
California’s standards for pool controls, which McAllister said have created a template for future standards, will require new equipment to default to flexible demand, yet allow the customer to override that setting. Maintaining the default flexible demand setting will save customers money on their electric bills, as the appliance will operate more often on lower-cost renewable generation.
Mary Ann Piette, who leads CalFlexHub, said one concern is whether that lower cost of operation will motivate adoption of flexible demand appliances. She suggested that adding an emergency demand response capability with customer compensation would “provide the most value … We believe that flexible load in many cases will be more cost-effective than installing a battery.” She also noted that CalFlexHub is exploring heat pumps with thermal storage.
As the CEC sets standards for appliances that can respond to flexible rates – such as lower rates when renewable generation is high – the California Public Utilities Commission is working with the state’s utilities to develop flexible rates. The CPUC aims for the state’s investor-owned utilities to offer hourly marginal cost-based rates and programs by January 2027, according to a slide that McAllister presented.
McAllister said that for California to reach its goal of 7 GW of load flexibility, the state aims to combine 3 GW of price-responsive demand from appliances with 4 GW of traditional demand response, in which some customers “drop load” during the 100 highest-demand hours of the year.
“People are so excited globally about what we’re doing with load flex,” McAllister said. “I mean, the word is out, and the light bulb goes on.” People decide, he said, “Of course we’re doing that; that makes sense, and we really want to learn from what California is doing.”
The CEC said it foresees a future that goes beyond flexible demand to “transactive energy.” While flexible demand involves one-way communication of rates from utilities, through a state database known as MIDAS, to appliances, transactive energy would involve appliances with two-way communication capability, enabling electric vehicles, for example, to send energy stored in the battery back to the grid.
Noting that California’s grid is set to become carbon-free by 2045, McAllister said that in the near term, “load flex is going to help decarbonize,” and over the long term, “load flex is going to help us optimally run the grid when it is 100% carbon-free.”
California’s work on flexible rates builds on analytical support provided by a white paper by the CPUC energy division staff and an analysis of potential cost savings from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
Recordings and slides from the CalFlexHub symposium are expected to be made available later this month, said a Berkeley Lab spokesperson.
