The plants, in sizes ranging from 10 MW to 55 MW, are to be set up at GETCO substations in Surendranagar, Morbi Kutchh, Jamnagar, and Surat districts.
The scope of work includes design, engineering, supply, procurement, installation, commissioning, and five-year operation and maintenance of the solar plants.
Only crystalline-silicon solar modules are allowed for the projects. The modules must have a minimum 72-cell configuration with rated power ≥300 Wp. These should carry a performance warranty of >90% during the first ten years, and >80% during the next 15 years.
Site-wise capacity distribution is as follows:

The research team, led by Prof. C. Subramaniam, demonstrated that a water electrolysis system that produced 1 ml of hydrogen gas, required 19% lower energy to produce 3 ml of hydrogen in the same time when electrolysis was done in the presence of an external magnetic field. The team achieved this by synergistically coupling the electric and magnetic fields at the catalytic site. 
Manipulating heterogeneous electrified interfaces with an external magnetic field (Hext) explicitly mandates the constant presence of Hext for achieving magnetoelectrocatalytic kinetic enhancements. The researchers demonstrated the highest kinetic enhancement of 650% in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), without the mandatory presence of Hext. 
The key to this effect is the electrocatalytic (carbon-cobalt oxide catalyst) interface that does not require the constant presence of any external magnetic field and can sustain the magnetization for prolonged time periods. The cobalt-oxide-based catalyst developed by the researchers also provides a cost advantage over platinum (Pt)-based catalysts. 
Speaking to pv magazine, Prof. C. Subramaniam said, “There are numerous attempts to fabricate the best electrocatalyst for water splitting at the low material cost, low energy penalty without compromising on the rate of hydrogen generation. Pt-group-based catalysts are the best known in this direction. However, the prohibitive cost of the catalyst is a huge challenge for commercialization. This led to developing earth-abundant cobalt oxide as catalysts. The cobalt-oxide (Co3O4) nanocubes were dispersed on nanostructured carbon florets as supports to make the final catalyst.”
“Given the kinetics of water splitting is slow with these catalysts, we developed an innovative solution of coupling an external magnetic field to the electrolytic process.” 
With this approach, the researchers were able to obtain a 650% increase in current density, 19% lowering of energy required, and a three-fold increase in volumetric hydrogen production rate. 
The magnitude of the enhancements achieved is unparalleled. And the intermittent magnetic field required is similar to what a fridge magnet can provide. 
“This route can be directly adopted in existing electrolyzers without any change in design or mode of operation and one-time exposure of magnetic field for 10 minutes is enough to achieve the high rate of hydrogen production for over 45 minutes,” according to the researchers. 
“The intermittent use of an external magnetic field provides a new direction for achieving energy-efficient hydrogen generation. Other catalysts can also be explored for this purpose,” said Prof. Subramaniam. “A basic electrolyzer cell of 0.5 nm3/h capacity can be immediately upgraded to a 1.5 nm3/h capacity by replacing the catalysts and supplying the magnetic field,” added Jayeeta Saha and Ranadeb Ball, project researchers and students at IIT Bombay.  
Having shown that the method is not very complicated either, the team is now working with an industrial partner to ensure its successful commercialization. 
The research findings are published in Sustainable Chem. Eng Journal of American Chemical Society, 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/08/11/novel-design-for-east-west-solar-parks-reduces-soil-deterioration/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 11, 2021",Novel design for east-west solar parks reduces soil deterioration,"From pv magazine International
The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has designed a new approach for building east-west-oriented solar parks which it claims can prevent soil deterioration and offer the same yield as south-oriented PV plants.
In a dedicated study, the Dutch scientists explained that, although east-west solar parks are becoming increasingly popular in the Netherlands where land constraints and high land costs are pushing developers to build solar plants with a highly packed panel density, these installations present a challenge for the soil, because they are placed so closely together and cover almost all the ground beneath, thus reducing the light reaching it over a 25-year period or more.
According to the researchers, industry-standard east-west solar parks built in the country have a ground coverage ratio of over 90%, which is highly detrimental for the soil beneath the panels. “It will then take a great deal of time and effort to restore the soil quality that existed before the solar farm was constructed,” the TNO scientists said.
To combat this, the researchers have developed two variants of their novel design. The first sees module arrays built in portrait orientation that are eight meters long, feature a large gap between the arrays, and have a ground coverage ratio of around 77%. “Clearly the irradiance below the bottom gap between an east– and a west–facing module is very high but it also allows more light in the immediate region below those modules,” the academics said. “Also the larger top gap allows more light and distributes that light over a fairly large region.”
In the second variant, which has the same ground coverage ratio as the first, the scientists halved the height of the module arrays and the size of the gaps and, at the same time, utilized semi-transparent bifacial modules. “A 77% coverage design with semi-transparent, bifacial panels scores better in terms of the effect on soil quality than south-facing standard panels with 53% coverage. As a result, almost 100% of the soil receives sufficient sunlight at a higher degree of coverage,” they further explained.
The TNO said this new research is in line with another study published earlier this year by the Netherlands’ Wageningen University & Research, on the effects of solar parks on biodiversity. “The ‘educated guess’ of the project partners is that well-designed, operated, and maintained solar parks can have a positive impact compared to well-defined reference situations, and especially compared to intensive agricultural monoculture use,” Wim Sinke, principal scientist for solar energy at the energy transition unit of TNO, told pv magazine in May 2021.
