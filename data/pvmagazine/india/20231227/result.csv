Halvad Transmission Ltd., a special purpose vehicle (SPV), was set up by PFCCL to evacuate 7 GW of renewable energy (RE) from Gujarat’s Khavda RE park, the world’s largest RE park with a generation capacity of 30 GW. AESL acquired it through a tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) process and will commission it in 24 months on a build-own-operate-maintain basis.
The Halvad transmission line, part of the national grid, will help evacuate 7 GW of RE by connecting Khavda to Halvad, also in Gujarat.
“AESL will invest around INR 3,000 crore to build, own, operate and maintain the over 301 km (656 ckm) transmission project for a period of 35 years. The project includes setting up of a 765 kV Halvad switching station with 2×330 MVAr bus reactors and a line-in line-out of Lakadia–Ahmedabad 765 kV D/c line at Halvad,” stated AESL.
Winning this project takes AESL’s network (installed and under-commissioning) to 20,518 ckm and 53,161 MVA of transformation capacity.

As we step into 2024, several trends are shaping the landscape of the Indian solar industry, emphasizing sustainability, innovation, and increased adoption.
One of the most notable trends in the Indian solar PV sector  is the rapid expansion of solar capacity. With the government’s ambitious target of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, there is a heightened focus on scaling up solar installations across the country. Developers and investors are actively participating in the solar revolution, contributing to the growth of both utility-scale and distributed solar projects.
Technological advancements are playing a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and affordability of solar PV systems. Innovations in solar panel designs, energy storage solutions, and smart grid technologies are making solar power more accessible and reliable. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in solar operations is optimizing energy production, reducing maintenance costs, and enhancing overall system performance.
A novel trend gaining momentum is the development of floating solar farms. With land scarcity being a challenge in densely populated regions of India, floating solar projects are emerging as a sustainable solution. These projects, deployed on water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs, not only conserve land but also offer increased energy yield due to the cooling effect of water on solar panels.
Green hydrogen, produced through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy, is gaining prominence. As the demand for clean and sustainable fuels rises, solar power is being harnessed to produce green hydrogen, a zero-emission energy carrier. This trend aligns with India’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and fostering a green economy.
Government initiatives and policy support continue to drive the growth of the solar PV sector in India. The government is actively promoting investment in the solar industry through incentives, subsidies, and favourable regulatory frameworks. The introduction of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar manufacturing is expected to boost domestic production and reduce dependency on imports.
The adoption of decentralized solar power solutions is on the rise. Distributed generation through rooftop solar installations and community solar projects is empowering consumers to become prosumers, generating and consuming their own solar energy. This trend not only promotes energy independence but also contributes to the resilience of the overall power system.

It secured the capacity by quoting a tariff of INR 2.64/kWh. GUVNL may allot an additional capacity of 140 MW to Hinduja by exercising the Greenshoe option.
The project is part of the Solar Tender Phase -XXII issued by GUVNL for the selection of solar power developers to set up 500 MW of solar power projects anywhere in India. Hinduja Renewables was one of the four winning developers under this tender which saw participation from leading private-sector power producers.
Sumit Pandey, CEO of Hinduja Renewables, said, “With this achievement, Hinduja Renewables will operate with a capacity of 1.5+ GW in the country in the coming few years.”
Hinduja Renewables, part of the Hinduja Group, plans to grow through both organic and inorganic means in renewable energy and emerging sustainable energy technologies in distributed and utility segments. It is seeking opportunities in hybrid renewable projects, energy storage systems, green hydrogen generation (or value chain), and offshore wind. Today, it operates a portfolio of solar power plants spread across the country and aims to grow to a multi-GW capacity in the next few years.

As part of the JV, TotalEnergies bought 50% stake in AGEL’s 1,050 MW portfolio for $300 million.
This follows the binding agreement about the JV announced between AGEL and TotalEnergies in September 2023. The JV houses the 1,050 MW portfolio comprising a mix of already operational (300 MW), under construction (500 MW) and under development assets (250 MW) with a blend of both solar and wind power projects in India.
With this transaction, TotalEnergies has reinforced its strategic alliance with AGEL and support in enabling AGEL’s target of 45 GW capacity by 2030.
AGEL develops, owns, and operates utility-scale grid-connected solar, wind, and hybrid renewable power plants. With an operating renewable portfolio of 8.4 GW spread across 12 states, it is currently the largest renewable energy developer in India, offsetting over 41 million tonnes of CO2 emissions cumulatively. AGEL targets to achieve 45 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, aligned with India’s decarbonization goals.
