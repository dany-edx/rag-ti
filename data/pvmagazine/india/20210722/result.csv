New rooftop solar addition is expected to be below 11 GW and floating solar below 5 GW for this period, according to Bridge To India’s Renewable Power CEO Survey 2021. 
On average, the nation is expected to add 13.6 GW of renewable energy capacity per annum over the next five years. Gujarat is the most preferred state for renewable power projects, followed by Maharashtra and Karnataka.
Top executives from 44 leading Indian and international companies participated in the survey.
The survey finds a highly optimistic market sentiment despite some operational and financial challenges. An overall 86% of respondents are upbeat on the market prospects. The respondents gave positive feedback on most fronts, including government policies, demand for renewable power, and land. 
A majority of the respondents believed the government policies such as PLI Scheme, Basic Customs Duty (BCD), Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and 12 GW PSU scheme were effective [in creating a favorable environment for domestic manufacturers]. Notwithstanding these, capacity additions in grid-scale storage and cell and module manufacturing are expected to remain below 15 GWh and 10 GW, respectively, in the next five years.
Concerns around DISCOMs’ crippling financial health, increasing offtake risk, and policy changes persist. ALMM and BCD are also a concern [among developers].
Vinay Rustagi, managing director, Bridge To India, said, “The industry mood is surprisingly upbeat, buoyed perhaps by the huge government targets and strong investor appetite. But views on capacity addition and most policy initiatives as well as operational issues are more mixed. The biggest concern rightly is the terrible financial condition of our DISCOMs.”
The majority of the respondents felt that new policy initiatives for structural reforms like delicensing the power distribution business, privatization of DISCOMs, and Electricity Amendment Bill would be effective for the sector, though execution challenges might thwart progress.
Speaking on the launch of the survey report, Vinay Rustagi, Managing Director, BRIDGE TO INDIA, said, “The industry mood is surprisingly upbeat, buoyed perhaps by the huge government targets and strong investor appetite. But views on capacity addition and most policy initiatives as well as operational issues are more mixed. The biggest concern rightly is the terrible financial condition of our DISCOMs.”

Singaporean solar developer Sunseap has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority (BP Batam) – which is the public authority responsible for the management, development, and construction on the island of Batam in Indonesia – for the construction of a 2.2 GW PV floating project at the Duriangkang Reservoir in the southern part of the region.
If built, the $2 billion project would be the world’s largest floating PV power plant and would reach the same capacity as the largest ground-mounted facility currently in operation, which is a 2.2 GW plant located in China’s Qinghai province.
The facility is planned to occupy a water surface of 1,600ha and to be coupled with a storage system with a capacity of 4,000 MWh.
Sunseap said the Duriangkang Reservoir provides more than 50% of the freshwater supply to Batam Island and that the floating solar panels will help to reduce evaporation, thereby retaining more water within the reservoir. “Simultaneously, the water will keep the solar panels cool, thereby generating more clean energy and creating a synergistic relationship,” it further explained. “Sunseap expects the solar farm to generate more than 2,600 GWh of electricity per annum, potentially offsetting over 1.8 million metric tons of carbon per year.”
“This hyper-scale project is a significant milestone for Sunseap, coming soon after we had completed Singapore’s first offshore floating solar farm along the Straits of Johor,” said Sunseap CEO Frank Phuan. “This investment by Sunseap will be a timely boost for Batam’s industries as they seek to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. At the same time, it will create jobs and transfer skills to Batam’s clean energy sector,” added BP Batam chairman, Muhammad Rudi.
The project will be financed with both bank borrowings and own funds. Its construction is scheduled to start next year and completion is planned for 2024.

It secured the capacity in a Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited (RUMSL) auction for 450 MW of solar projects at the Shajapur Solar Park. 
The Shajapur Solar Park comprises three units of 220 MW, 125 MW, and 105 MW. 
NTPC Renewables won capacities of 220 MW and 105 MW, quoting the lowest tariff of INR 2.33/kWh and INR 2.35/kWh, respectively. The tender received an overwhelming response from the bidders and was reportedly oversubscribed by 5.8 GW. A total of 15 bidders were shortlisted. 
Recently, NTPC REL received the go-ahead from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy under Mode 8 (Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Park) of the Solar Park Scheme. 
Currently, NTPC, India’s largest energy integrated company, has an installed capacity of 66 GW comprising gas, coal, hydro, and renewable energy based power stations across the country with an additional 18 GW under construction. As a part of its green energy portfolio augmentation, it aims to build 60 GW renewable energy capacity by 2032.

Chinese PV module maker Longi has achieved a power conversion efficiency rating of 25.19% for a TOPCon solar cell.
The achievement, which has been confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Hamelin (ISFH), is purportedly a world record for a p-type TOPCon cell.
“Adhering to the development idea with result-orientation, choosing the proper technology direction based on the essence of technology, focusing on the development and mass production incubation of industry-leading technology products, firmly grasping the technological frontier, to win the future with strong technology output, and leading the technological change of the industry, are always our persistence,” said Dr. Li Hua, the director of the Longi Solar Cell R&D Center.
The company did not reveal how it achieved the efficiency increase.
In January 2019, Longi announced an efficiency rating of 24.06% for a monocrystalline p-type PERC cell on the front side. In June of this year, it recorded a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon cell. It also unveiled a new n-type, TOPCon bifacial module with 22.3% efficiency.
