GGEL operates the 50MW concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan. The project was commissioned in June 2013 and benefits from a 25-year power purchase agreement with NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN).

Sanjay Grewal, CEO of Virescent, said, “The acquisition is in line with our investment strategy to aggregate assets with long-term contracts with credible counterparties. With this acquisition, VRET now manages 500MW of operating solar assets across India. This is VRET’s fourth acquisition in the last 18 months. It has also acquired solar portfolios from Shapoorji Pallonji, Sindicatum as well as Focal Energy.”
The CSP plant features state-of-the-art parabolic trough technology. CSP stations with parabolic trough technology are steam-driven power stations that generate electricity from heat. Parabolic mirrors arranged in long rows concentrate the solar radiation onto the receiver, inside which a carrier liquid is heated to almost 400 degrees Celsius. The heat, in turn, is used to raise steam that drives a conventional steam turbine and creates electricity.
The extraordinary aspect about CSP electricity is its dispatch ability in the form of heat. The energy can easily be stored and fed into the grid when power is really needed, be it day or night, cloudy or sunny. This facilitates load management in grids – a factor destined to be of increasing importance as the contribution of solar energy to India’s electricity mix rises.

The Durable Module Materials consortium (DuraMAT), established by the Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO), has been working since its inception in 2016 to improve the use of PV materials.
DuraMAT has awarded $30 million to high-impact projects, and in 2021 was given an additional $36 million by SETO for six more years of funding. The funds will help the consortium continue to develop solar module materials science in pursuit of a 50-year life for PV.
“We are trying to shift into a reliability research mode where we’re directly targeting modules that last 50 years,” said Teresa Barnes, DuraMAT director. “We’re very focused on high-energy-yield modules and making those in a sustainable way. We know there are going to be big material and energy impacts from ramping up deployment as fast as we need for the energy transition. But our question is, ‘How can we do that in a way that’s environmentally sustainable and in a way that our supply chain can keep up?’”
The consortium has five core objectives. First, it seeks to act as a central data resource, collecting and disseminating solar module reliability data, and applying the data to create insights. The DuraMAT database is a centralized source with the ability to ingest, curate, combine, analyze, and manage diverse datasets.
Second, DuraMAT provides fielded module forensics, quantifying and characterizing module failures in outdoor exposures and recording environmental effects. It said one of the biggest hurdles to studying degradation or failure in fielded modules is that frequent absence of a “reference” or control module. This core objective is designed to provide better understanding of PV material durability, and to generate practical, multi-modal data that guides next steps in materials and module design.
As a third objective, the team develops a multi-scale, multi-physics model to accelerate testing and quantitatively assess material degradation.
“We are now shifting our emphasis towards predictive testing and modeling methods that will enable us to assess reliability more quickly and more accurately in new technologies,” said Barnes.
Fourth, it provides module materials solutions, in which the consortium designs, develops, de-risks innovative materials and module architectures to address PV reliability issues. The group has worked to characterize failure modes, develop crack tolerant metallization, and design recyclable backsheets. It has also developed technical requirements and materials guidelines that have enabled thin-film module development.
And as a final core objective, the consortium uses disruptive acceleration science to test materials. Using aggressive conditions like pressing modules with rings to simulate bending, or with sound waves to mimic the warping effect of wind, the consortium stress-tests PV modules to see how they would perform in the toughest conditions and over long stretches of time.
“If solar is going to expand and become this ubiquitous technology that we have across our power system, on our houses – and be responsible for 40% of our electricity generation – old technologies are not enough,” said Barnes. “PV modules need to be made more efficient, less expensive, and more sustainably at much larger scale. But we also need to know that these new modules – whether they’re new module designs or new cell technologies like bifacial or tandem cells – will perform predictably in the field.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/17/investment-cycle-means-race-is-on-to-incentivize-green-hydrogen/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 17, 2022",Investment cycle means race is on to incentivize green hydrogen,"From pv magazine Global
The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) has stressed the urgency of bringing in policies worldwide to drive the green hydrogen economy by pointing out there is only one investment cycle for heavy industrial plants before mid century.
The latest report published by the international NGO in its green hydrogen series is a guide to policymakers which pointed out 71% of the blast furnaces used in steelmaking around the world require investment this decade, with the remainder requiring attention before 2040.
With chemicals plants enjoying a typical 30-year lifespan, the report added, the average ammonia fab is already 15 years old and the world’s oldest facilities are based in Europe and Asia.
With fossil fuel-powered hydrogen a significant contributor to the heavy carbon footprint of the iron and steel and chemicals industries, Abu Dhabi-based Irena said policymakers must act immediately to foster green hydrogen before another generation of polluting plants are locked in to, and beyond 2050.
That also means, the Green Hydrogen for Industry report added, the world needs to roll out the huge wave of renewable energy generation facilities needed to power hydrogen electrolysis without eating into the renewables capacity needed to generate electricity for non-industrial uses.
Policies are needed to incentivize heavy industry and end-product consumers, Irena stated, to help bridge a gap between the current prices of fossil-fuel powered hydrogen, ammonia and alternative transport fuel methanol and their greener counterparts.
The report estimated green hydrogen costs around $4-6 per kilogram versus $1-2 for the grey version of the energy carrier. With conventional ammonia costing around $250-450 per ton, according to Irena, a green hydrogen-powered version of the fertilizer feedstock and shipping fuel could be made for $500-625/t this decade. Methanol costs around $100-400/t at the moment but the use of green hydrogen, bioenergy and carbon capture and storage to manufacture it would drive that figure to around $800-1,600, with the expense even higher if untested use of carbon captured directly from the air is factored in.
All of which means policymakers need to roll out the full toolkit of measures to tip the scales in favor of green hydrogen if the world is to have any hope of reaching net zero by mid century, with those heavy industry investment decisions looming.
Irena’s 68-page study suggests blast furnaces must be phased out and replaced by direct reduced iron (DRI) processes, with quotas introduced stipulating the proportion of hydrogen use which must come from the green version of the gas as well as related minimum purchase requirements for manufacturers further down the chain, such as steel-reliant carmakers.
Emissions trading schemes and direct carbon taxes are further “sticks” which can bring manufacturers to heel, with income from the former supplemented by carbon contracts-for-difference which ensure emissions trading revenues are topped up by government bodies to an agreed strike price level which would decrease over time.
Making it easier for manufacturers to go green by offering access to all sources of grant and funding support in one-stop shops would reduce red tape, the Irena document suggested, adding tax systems can be altered to incentivize green industry and that governments should also back R&D.
Bilateral auctions, such as that planned by Germany’s H2Global, would see public intermediaries hold auctions to secure the supply of green hydrogen for the lowest price and then hold procurement exercises to determine the price at which the gas is sold on to industrial consumers, with public funds making up any shortfall initially.
Green procurement by public bodies would also help create demand for green hydrogen and, in an interesting point for the solar industry, Irena suggested renewable energy procurement auctions could be tweaked to have a requirement to source materials from eco-friendly processes. The study estimated 35 tons of glass is needed for a 500MW solar plant, alongside 28 tons of steel, 23.5 tons of concrete, 9.5 tons of aluminum, 3.5 tons each of silicon and copper, and three tons of plastic.
The report noted progress is already being made in some quarters, and highlighted the project being planned by Spanish fertilizer company Fertiberia and utility Iberdrola, who plan to establish 800MW of green hydrogen production capacity in four stages to 2027. The first of four plants produced its first green hydrogen in December at a green ammonia plant in Puertollano, Spain and will consist of 100MW of solar generation capacity, a 20MWh lithium-ion battery, and 20MW of electrolyzer capacity.
