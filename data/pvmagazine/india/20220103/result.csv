It has also brought in fresh fervor toward sunrise sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and renewables—from the government through productivity-linked incentive schemes and from corporates via investment in green businesses.
We are seeing green shoots of recovery in core sectors—mainly government-owned metals and oil and gas industries. With India aiming to hit 500 GW in renewable energy by 2030, the pace of development in sunrise sectors will also pick up. Renewable capacity addition is also likely to be ramped up in 2022, meaning a higher requirement for substations, transmission corridors as well as battery energy storage. Rail electrification, urban metro, and regional transport system will also drive growth, bringing in fresh opportunities for us.
Since the focus is high on sunrise industries, there is tremendous potential in technology localization in areas such as remote power monitoring, predictive maintenance, EV charging, green hydrogen, and energy storage. We are already seeing interest in models such as Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS), augmented reality power applications, and a shift in customer preference from proof-of-concept (PoC) to proof-of-value (PoV). Building the required know-how and skills will underpin all efforts in our pivot to cleaner, greener, and smarter energy, depending heavily on partnerships with academia.
Likewise, as ESG gains spotlight, industry-wide collaboration in greening the power infrastructure and investment in sustainable, eco-efficient, and industry-agnostic power solutions will help India make steady progress toward its energy goals. It is also a vastly untapped market to establish power quality solutions that globally support the renewable segment, for improving the availability and reliability of hybrid grids.
Yet, challenges ranging from new variants of the Covid-19 virus such as Omicron, high commodity prices, material shortages especially of semiconductors will likely weigh on market recovery. Businesses may be finding ways to remain competitive in their pricing. This could also strain for some time the market quest for fresh investments in sunrise sectors.
We expect industrial CAPEX to pick up only by the second half of 2022.
To put our pledges into action, we need the right set of finance, policies, technology, and environment for encouraging companies to go green, to encourage e-mobility in public transport, and to build the hydrogen economy. To achieve scale and speed in the adoption of clean technology, digitalization of the entire value chain in the energy sector and grooming related competencies to make the energy transition a reality are required. This will depend on collaboration and knowledge-sharing across the power value chain.  
We need greater support and stimulus in the power industry, including in EV charging infrastructure, and faster decision-making on transformational projects. A reliable framework to facilitate timely payments to various stakeholders in the power value chain, as well as faster implementation of quality-cum-cost-based selection of manufacturers in critical product procurement could be immediate priorities. Incentivization to set up new factories in sunrise sectors, especially in rural India, is another area that can strengthen the Make-in-India drive as well as promote employment and talent building.  
To make good on its climate pledges and sustain advancement on its Nationally Determined Contributions, India needs multi-faceted progress. As fast as cleaning the energy supply, it must upscale the grid and transform the devices such as EVs and sectors such as oil and gas, cement, and steel — that rely on it. This will require next-level planning and collaboration between various stakeholders – industry, policymakers, civic authorities, academia, and research – to fine-tune current realities with long-term goals.
Hitachi Energy has had a strong play in metro and rail, power transmission, and renewables in 2021. It advanced Indian Railways’ mission to achieve net-zero emissions via rail electrification solutions, India’s Power-for-All drive-by commissioning one of India’s longest UHVDC transmission links from Raigarh to Pugalur, as well as provided its technology for a multitude of solar and hydro projects alongside to datacenter players.

India headquartered multinational Reliance Industries has continued its shopping spree in the renewable energy sector signing a binding agreement to acquire a 100% shareholding in UK-based sodium-ion specialist Faradion to the tune of GBP100 million (US$135 million).
The Indian conglomerate’s solar unit will acquire 88.92% of the equity shares of Faradion for GBP83.97 million at closing which is expected in early January. The remaining 11.08% of the equity shares will be acquired for up to GBP10.45 million within three years from the initial transaction.
Under the agreement, Reliance Industries will subscribe to new equity shares of Faradion for a value of GBP31.59 million, of which GBP25 million will be invested as growth capital to accelerate commercial roll out of Faradion’s patented battery technology.
Based out of Sheffield and Oxford, England, Faradion claims to have developed a sodium-ion technology that is more sustainable and affordable than other battery solutions on the market. Its technology is applicable in various fields, such as transportation, storage, backup power, and energy in remote locations. Set up in 2010, Faradion says it has developed an extensive IP portfolio to cover numerous aspects of Na-ion technology, focusing on three key areas- cell materials, cell infrastructure and safety and transportation.
Last year, shortly after it bagged its first order from ICM Australia, Faradion told pv magazine it was planning, along with its partner in India, to set up an initial production capacity of 1GWh in the country. Speaking about the country-specific advantages, Faradion CEO James Quinn said at the time that a vast majority of the raw materials are available in India for a vertically integrated supply chain.
Further, he said that Faradion’s Na-ion cells can be made on existing commercial Li-ion manufacturing lines. The operating temperature range is -30 to +60 degrees. “Our cell chemistry provides world-leading cell-specific energy of 150-160 Wh/kg for sodium-ion,” Quinn told pv magazine.
Reliance plans to use Faradion’s technology at its proposed fully integrated energy storage giga-factory as part of the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex at Jamnagar, western India. The complex is part of Reliance’s ambitious $10 billion plan first unveiled in June to manufacture and fully integrate all the critical components of the renewable energy ecosystem, including every stage of  the solar supply chain, advanced energy storage, hydrogen production, and fuel cells.
Only this year, the conglomerate, which is covering everything from textiles and polyester fibers to petrochemicals and petroleum refining, as well as upstream oil and gas exploration and production, has made massive progress on its big plans via a series of acquisitions in the renewable energy sector.
Through its solar arm, Reliance is acquiring a 100% stake in Norway-headquartered PV module manufacturer REC Group. It plans to use REC’s technology and manufacturing expertise in its fully integrated, metallic silicon-to-PV panel gigafactory. It will initially start with 4GW of capacity per year and will eventually grow to 10GW.
Furthermore, Reliance will acquire a 40% stake in Indian multinational Sterling and Wilson Solar Ltd (SWSL), one of the largest PV plant engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), and operation and maintenance solution providers globally. Going upstream, it is investing $29 million in German wafer manufacturer NexWafe. For green hydrogen, Reliance Industries has partnered with Denmark-based Stiesdal for the technology development and production of Stiesdal HydroGen electrolyzers in India.
On the battery storage front, the company has invested $50 million in Ambri, a US-based calcium-antimony liquid metal battery startup incubated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), raising 42.3 million shares.
Commenting on the acquisition of Faradion, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, highlighted the versatility of the company’s technology. “Most importantly, it utilizes sodium, which will secure India’s energy storage requirements for its large renewable energy and fast-growing EV charging market,” he said.
