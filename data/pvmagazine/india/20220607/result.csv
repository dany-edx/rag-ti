The country ranked third in the Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI) by Ernst & Young (EY) in 2021, with the United States retaining its top position, followed by China. The nation reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 50.5 GW by Dec. 31, 2021, according to Bridge To India.
Driven by the Indian government’s push for solar adoption through its ambitious policies, solar will play a pivotal role in meeting the country’s energy demand. The amount of sunshine that strikes the Earth exceeds the world’s total energy needs. And in recent years, there have been several innovations led by emerging technologies around solar panels, inverters, solar batteries, and control systems that help to automate the process of solar plant monitoring.
Half-cell tech
Simply put, a half cell is a solar cell that is sliced into two. Half-cell technology works on the principle that more PV cells mean less resistance to the flow of electrons in the circuit. A typical 60-cell module will have 120 half cells with only half of the resistance in an array. This means greater efficiency.
Half cell technology helps to circumvent reduced output due to low lighting. These cells are also known to have better durability, as they are not easily prone to micro-cracks due to reduced mechanical stress. Furthermore, they are known to perform in high heat conditions and are less prone to panel malfunction.
Building-integrated PV (BIPV)
In cities where the skylines are filled with skyscrapers, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) panels could easily contribute to the generation of solar energy without detracting from a building’s aesthetic appeal. The versatility of PV glass is perfect for letting daylight enter a building while producing energy. Customized panels that can be fitted into architectural features, such as canopies and terraces, can increase the use of solar energy.
Incorporating transparent PV cells into architecture has many advantages, such as offering unlimited energy, decreased maintenance cost, improved sound insulation, and thermal optimization. It’s a great step toward a zero-carbon footprint.
Floating PV panels
Floating PV modules offer a significant advantage by producing solar energy while freeing up valuable real estate. They can be installed on lakes and reservoirs – recently, a fully operational 48-acre floating solar plant was set up on a large water reservoir in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. In Andhra Pradesh, a floating solar project is set to be installed under the Flexibilisation Scheme.
One key advantage of floating solar panels is that water prevents them from overheating, leading to higher electricity production and lower maintenance costs, as the panels also remain dirt-free. The benefits to the environment include lower water evaporation and less algae formation.
Microinverters
A solar system uses an inverter to convert solar energy into electricity. The recent technological advancements in the inverter have led to module-level power electronics (MPLE) or microinverters being introduced, which are far more efficient and safer.
Unlike a string inverter, which has many panels connected to it, a microinverter is connected behind every panel. It offers a “one inverter, one panel” solution. The output from all these inverters is combined in one cable that comes down to the meter box. This ensures that there is no high voltage running through the system, as the AC-DC conversion happens at the panel level, protecting homes and their occupants.
Microinverters function at 96.5% efficiency. If one inverter stops working, the other microinverters continue to operate, maintaining the efficiency of the solar system, without complete power loss.
Another advantage of microinverters is the plug-and-play function, which means fewer screws, ensuring faster installation. The microinverter’s plug-and-play function also helps to make the entire solar system more scalable to suit future energy needs. To ensure that the solar system is protected against dust, sand and water, most systems use equipment that is IP67 certified. This makes the microinverter a safer and more efficient alternative to string inverters.
Solar batteries
Solar batteries allow users access to solar power even when the sun goes down. Depending upon the size of the batteries, it can power anything from a house to a wide range of appliances. Some of the key advantages of using a solar battery are the reduced carbon footprint and greater energy independence. One recent development has been the switch of batteries from lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion. Solar batteries are constantly being innovated to offer a longer lifespan, reduced weight and safety.
Monitoring systems
As technology continues to advance, systems become more integrated. Solar systems now come with their own monitoring system that is easily accessed through an app or the web. Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and the cloud, customers now have access to their solar system via an app. The app will provide insights on the functioning of each device, power generation, and usage to create a smart, energy-efficient solar system. This will also allow service providers remote access to the solar system and reduce site visits.
With countries globally pushing toward decarbonization and tapping into green energy sources, solar is an inevitable aspect of a sustainable future. The advancements in solar technology will be rapid, with technology becoming more versatile. In the coming years, solar technology will become more efficient, safer, and affordable as everyone works towards the goal of having a greener planet. The future is solar-powered.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/07/sharp-achieves-conversion-efficiency-of-32-65-in-flexible-lightweight-solar-module/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 7, 2022","Sharp achieves conversion efficiency of 32.65% in flexible, lightweight solar module","From pv magazine Global
Sharp Corporation has achieved a conversion efficiency of 32.65% in a lightweight, flexible, practically sized solar module developed as part of the “Research and Development of Solar Cells for Use in Vehicles” project, which is administered by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
The module’s conversion efficiency — currently the world’s highest, according to the company — bests that of a similar Sharp module developed under another NEDO project in 2016, which achieved an efficiency of 31.17%, at the time a world record.
The new prototype uses a triple-junction compound design that sandwiches the solar cell between layers of film. The module is expected to be used in a variety of vehicles, an application that demands high efficiency and lightweight construction. Modules measuring about 29 by 34 centimeters (for an area of 965 square centimeters), a size which is large enough to be commercially viable, weigh only about 56 grams (0.58 kilograms per square meter).
Sharp’s triple-junction compound solar cell adopts a proprietary structure that comprises three photo-absorption layers with indium gallium arsenide as the bottom layer so that sunlight can be efficiently converted into electricity. Smaller cells using this structure (with an area of 1.047 square centimeters) achieved a conversion efficiency of 37.9% in April 2013. In 2016, Sharp used practically sized cells (with an area of 27.86 square centimeters) to create a composite module (with an area of 968 square centimeters) to achieve a conversion efficiency of 31.17%, at the time the world’s highest.
In this current project, Sharp increased the average conversion efficiency of its triple-junction compound solar cells (with an area of 22.88 square centimeters) from the 2016 modules (from about 34.5% to about 36%) and improved the cell fill factor on each module to improve the conversion efficiency for a practically sized module (with an area of 965 square centimeters) to 32.65%.
Sharp said it would continue to conduct R&D into more efficient, lower-cost solar modules with a view to their use in such applications as electric vehicles (EVs) and aerospace.
Solar cells for EVs that provide direct electricity promise to make electric cars more convenient for users due to lower fuel costs and less time required for charging.
“Against this backdrop, Sharp has been developing high-efficiency, low-cost solar modules that can conform to the curved surfaces of vehicles for use in a broad range of vehicles, including in standard EV and aerospace applications, by 2050,” the company added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/07/rec-our-future-is-in-hjt/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JUNE 7, 2022",REC: “Our future is in HJT”,"From pv magazine Global
pv magazine: REC just introduced your newest module, the REC Alpha Pure-R. Its predecessor, the Alpha Pure, picked up the Intersolar Award this year in Munich. I understand that the fact that you were able to eliminate lead was a major reason the jury selected the module as a winner. How would you describe the module’s features?
Cemil Seber: The REC Alpha Pure-R integrates G12 wafers, with heterojunction (HJT) technology, half-cut cells, and we’ve maximized power in compact a format as possible with gapless interconnection. And as with every Alpha product it comes with the advantages of HJT technology, like high efficiency and a low temperature coefficient. With the compact size and two support bars, it means that customers can have a good feeling about the warranty – including with heavy snow or wind loads. We really feel we’ve hit the sweet spot in terms of aligning what is best with efficiency, size, sustainability, and on the usual product specs that everybody uses to benchmark PV panels.

I mentioned lead-free, how was it that you were able to do away with all lead entirely?
Some lead can be in the silver paste, but we use lead-free paste. Additionally, we are now using innovative solder-free foil and wire combination, eliminating again the lead-content here. The other place where lead is being used is on the cross connectors, where the lead is used for the soldering. Also, in the JB [junction box] lead is used for the solder. In the Alpha Pure-R, the cross connectors aren’t soldered with lead and there’s no soldering in the JB with lead. These things are easier said than done. But we reduced the lead in the Alpha and now we’ve eliminated it with the Alpha Pure Series.
The foil interconnection was called “busbarless” some years ago. Of course, initially, REC worked with Meyer Burger with the Smartwire technology. How have you moved forward without Meyer Burger on the cell interconnection?
We’re expanding our initial HJT production from 600 MW to 1.2 GW, and for the expansion we’re doing that with equipment that is not from Meyer Burger. REC has worked intensively for many years with its key suppliers to develop other methods that will still be foil and wire based, proprietary to REC.
Looking more closely at the expansion, Meyer Burger also provided the deposition tooling for the HJT cell production. How will you move forward without Meyer Burger providing support and the production equipment?
We have run more HJT cell production than anyone in the world successfully; we have produced close to 1.5 of HJT and have successfully put that on the market. You also have to remember that REC has been in the PV industry for 25 years. We had skeptics with the first Alpha [HJT] modules, but we’ve proven them wrong. HJT also has less processes than other cell technologies and when you have good process control you can have very stable production. The part where REC really excels is in the industrialization of these new technologies and we have a head start. We launched Alpha with HJT in 2019, so we did it 2.5 years before anyone else.
And where will the expansions beyond the 1.2 GW in Singapore take place? We have heard of a facility in France for some time now. And, of course, since REC’s acquisition by Reliance Industries, Indian manufacturing is also an option.
We were acquired by Reliance on December 1, 2021. And with regards to PV, we are the cornerstone of what they want to do. Singapore has been the center of excellence for REC and it will continue to be that way. We had 600 MW of Alpha Pure HJT production capacity and we are adding another 600 MW of Alpha Pure-R. We are currently working on that expansion plan for Singapore – and in August that production capacity will be operating.
In India, we are building cell and module capacities at gigawatt scale. Reliance is looking both upstream and downstream and wants to deploy in the hundreds-of-gigawatts of PV. Of course, REC will be supporting the expansion in India. Outside of that, we have our two main markets: the U.S. and Europe. And right now we are in the planning stages and considering our options in both of these regions.
Can you give me a bit more detail on the French factory?
What we can say is that we are in the planning stage and there are multiple scenarios for what we can do. There are geopolitical dynamics which are favoring manufacturing in both Europe and the U.S.
What about further upstream to wafers or even polysilicon – because this is where REC in Norway has its heritage?
We have a strong expertise across the whole value chain, from silicon in Norway up to modules in Singapore. This expertise is critical in order to control all processes and ensure high quality of the final product and it’s a strong value in our expansion plans.
Turning back to Europe, there seems to be a lot of energy in the market at the moment – for installations and manufacturing. What’s your message for the market?
I think a key message is: “We’re growing and we are hiring!” We need to enjoy the moment also. REC has launched a new product and we have bigger plans and some of those plans are very concrete and we are talking about them openly. Others are in the scenario planning phase. Our focus is HJT, and our future is in HJT.
