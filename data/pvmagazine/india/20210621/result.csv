The ministry clarified that the waiver is allowed for inter-state transmission charges only and not losses.  
With this, solar and wind projects commissioned up to June 30, 2025 will secure a 25-year exemption from the grid charges post-commissioning. Earlier, the waiver was available to solar and wind projects commissioned up to June 30, 2023. 
The waiver is also allowed for pumped-hydro storage and battery energy storage system (BESS) projects to be commissioned up to June 30, 2025, provided they derive a certain percentage of their electricity requirements from renewables. 
Specifically, to avail of the waiver, the pumped-hydro storage projects must meet at least 70% of their annual electricity required to pump water from electricity generated from solar and/or wind power plants. The battery energy storage systems should also meet at least 70% of their annual electricity requirement for charging from the electricity generated by solar and/or wind power plants.
“The ISTS charges for power generated/supplied from such pumped-hydro storage and BESS shall be levied gradually: 25% of the short-term open access (STOA) charges for initial five years of operation, then charges can be gradually increased in steps of 25% after every third year to reach to 100% of STOA charges from twelfth year onwards. This may be aligned with the gradual reduction in tariff and payment of debt,” as per the power ministry notification.
Waiver of transmission charges shall be allowed for the trading of electricity generated/supplied from solar, wind, pumped-hydro storage, and BESS in green term-ahead market (GTAM) and green day-ahead market (GDAM) for two years, i.e., till June 30, 2023. This arrangement will be reviewed on an annual basis depending upon the future development in the power market.
Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, chief executive officer of industry body National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI), hailed the decision terming it “both a foresighted decision and a right step forward for India’s ambitious energy transition goals,” while calling for an extension to losses waiver too. 
“This extension will go a long way into ensuring the better proliferation of Renewables, especially storage, in India. Not to mention the positive impact it will have on GTAM and GDAM. Overall we are very thankful to the Ministry for accepting one of Industry’s long-standing requests. However, we will request them further to include losses waiver also in the extension to support the industry,” Pulipaka said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/21/the-case-for-microinverters-in-rooftop-solar/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JUNE 21, 2021",The case for microinverters in rooftop solar,"pv magazine: The slow uptake of rooftop solar in India is itself a challenge to solution providers. Why has rooftop solar not taken off in a big way in India?
Sunil Thamaran: The number one issue that we have seen in India is the change in policy from time to time and the lack of awareness about the changes. For example, earlier, we had a net metering policy. Now we have a gross metering policy. Changes have been proposed back and forth at various times in different states. And when this happens, training and awareness are lacking at the implementer level, like Discoms or even the installer.
To give you an example, in Bengaluru, we faced many challenges when we went to rural areas. We had to get the Discom involved, giving them advice or sharing experiences to make sure that they understood what they were doing and approved the systems.
The second issue is lack of finance as solar is a very capital-intensive market. The unavailability of finance at a lower interest rate has been a problem for the customers.
Lastly, a majority of the rooftop market is actually supplied by low-cost players who cannot provide long-term reliability. It’s been either a five-year warranty or a maximum of ten years for inverters. That causes a problem as customers need to factor in the replacement costs for a product.
pv magazine: Inverters play a crucial role in the performance of a solar installation. What are the inverter solutions available for rooftop solar? 
There are typically two types of inverters being used for rooftop installations. String inverters capture a majority of the market. In string inverters, many panels get connected in a string on the roof, and this string is then connected to an inverter box, a large box placed somewhere in the building.
The other solution that we do is module-level power electronics (MPLE), which is what the microinverters or the power optimizers stand for. Here an inverter is connected right behind every panel, and then at that roof level, the outputs from all these inverters are combined in one cable that comes down to the meter box. That ways, microinverters are safe to use as DC-AC conversion happens on the panel level, and there is no high-voltage power traveling through your system.
Enphase Energy
pv magazine: How do microinverters compare with string inverters in terms of performance? How do the rooftop size and shading affect the inverter selection?
The inverter selection depends on the overall generation and the total cost of ownership, or energy cost.
Talking about the parameters, the first thing that people should look at is the system’s generation efficiency. Typically, string inverters are efficient anywhere from 95% onwards. There are some which are 96 or 97% efficient. So, they all play around at that level.
On the other hand, microinverters offer 98% and above efficiency. To explain to you, it’s a ‘one inverter, one panel’ solution. That means, for a building with ten panels, you will have ten inverters. So, if one inverter goes down for some reason, the other nine will continue to work, and you will still have power in the building. In other words, it is not the complete power loss with microinverters.
On the other hand, with string inverters, there will be one inverter for all ten panels. So if that inverter failed, the entire system is down until you replace or repair the inverter.
Further, as each panel has an inverter connected to it, the conversion is optimized at the panel level. This maximizes the overall conversion efficiency. We could say microinverters will be more efficient even if there was an issue with some panels.
This is where the shadow element comes into the picture.
In a system using string inverters, even if one panel has some issue like shadow, dust, or bird dropping, it will limit the performance of the entire string. On the other hand, with microinverter, only the panels under the shading will produce less, and the rest will continue to produce at a high level.
Microinverters don’t just pay off in the first or second year as they are priced more, but their overall benefits in 20 years will be much greater than with string inverters.
The installation is pretty simple. The microinverter is a very small device, weighing just about 1 kg. It’s a plug-and-play kind of system where the cable plugs in like a USB, and there are not many screws.
pv magazine: You talked about panel failure and the resultant impact on performance with microinverters and string inverters. How is the failure of microinverters themselves taken care of?
In India, you can buy a warranty of up to 25 years for Enphase microinverters.
We have a continuous monitoring system that is available on the mobile app and also on the web. Each inverter communicates to Cloud through the Internet of Things (IoT). So every customer, including the service provider, can log in and access. We provide login access to the customer and also the service provider. We can monitor every system on the field from our office.
pv magazine: There are not many players in microinverters. What’s the main reason?
Enphase is leading the microinverter solutions today in the world. In the US market, we have close to 50% market share. But, there have been small players coming in from China. I would say the number one reason is the ability to provide a long-term warranty for 25 years, given microinverters are a costly solution. It requires a lot of engineering, a lot of quality-conscious design to provide that kind of a solution.
pv magazine: What are the microinverter companies’ main challenges in design, and what are they working on? 
One obviously is the price, as every customer will compare the [microinverter] price with the string inverters. That is a huge challenge for us as microinverters are priced two to three times more.
The second challenge is being able to catch up with the module technology roadmap. Solar panels continue to evolve, from 400W to 500W, and now even higher outputs. We have to improve the performance or mechanism of our microinverters accordingly so that they can be paired with the higher-wattage panels. That means, in general, design has to change, the power output has to change, and so on. But that is only one vector that we are driving.
We are investing heavily in enabling microinverters for high-wattage panels. We are coming up with IQ8 inverter, which can be paired with 450-500W panels.
In terms of application areas, the residential rooftop sector is the primary focus as the microinverter is a small system. But, one adjacent market is the small commercial segment. For commercial sector applications, the cost difference will be huge when using microinverters. We are addressing that challenge by coming out with a dual solution to pair two panels with one inverter. That will reduce the per-watt price as one can pair, say, two 400 W panels or address the requirement for 800W with one device.
pv magazine: What are your India plans?
We are manufacturing microinverters from India too. We have three manufacturing plants globally, one in China, the second in Mexico, and the third in Chennai, India. Our India plant can ramp up to one million units per quarter, but we have done about 400,000 units per quarter. It started operating in October last year. It is an export unit from where the units are shipped to the US market. We are also applying for the BIS certification. Once that is satisfied, we will be able to supply to the Indian market as well.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/06/21/stand-alone-brackish-water-desalination-system-powered-by-photovoltaic-thermal-unit/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 21, 2021",Stand-alone brackish water desalination system powered by photovoltaic-thermal unit,"From pv magazine International
A group of scientists from the Tarbiat Modares University (TMU) in Iran has fabricated a brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination unit integrated with a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system which is claimed to produce freshwater at a cost that is close to that of conventional large-scale reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants. Brackish water is water with salinity levels between seawater and freshwater and can usually be found in estuaries, where seawater and freshwater mix.
“We have fabricated a research scale setup and then evaluated it under the climate conditions of Tehran, Iran,” research co-author, Shiva Gorjian, told pv magazine. “The total cost of the current system considering the labor cost has been calculated as $779.50, but this is a research-scale set-up; for a commercial one the costs will definitely be reduced.”
The BWRO unit, which has a treated water production capacity of around 11.80 L/h, was built with a pre-filtration module, a high-pressure DC pump, an RO module, and a post-treatment module. As for the PVT system, it was sized to meet the energy requirement of a high-pressure DC pump and a diaphragm-type circulation pump utilized to circulate soft water beneath the PV module for the active cooling of the panel itself. Two DC-DC converters of 10 A and 180 W of power were used to connect the loads to a battery.

“Since the efficiency of converters is not 100%, the battery was chosen in a way to supply the required power of the loads and compensate for the converters’ power losses,” the Iranian group specified. The PV module has dimensions of 676 x 700 x 30 mm, an output of 60 W, an open-circuit voltage of 21.5 V, and a short-circuit current of 3.88 A. The battery has a size of 92.8 x 65 × 20.2 mm and a nominal system voltage of 12 V.
The PV module was hybridized with the addition of a copper plate heat exchanger (PHE) with a capacity of 23.26 kW installed on its rear side to transfer the produced heat in the panel itself to the saltwater. A temperature control unit containing and a thermostat are used to control the temperature of soft water flowing out of the PVT module.

The average treated water production of the system treating 5,000 parts per million (ppm) and 15,000 ppm is 41.40 and 34.80 kg per day, respectively. “The treated water production cost of the unit treating 15,000 ppm salinity feed water was 18.96% higher than the unit treating 5,000 ppm salinity for all cases,” the academics explained. “The maximum treated water production cost of the unit was about 0.013 $/L, which is closer to the price associated with conventional fossil fuel-powered RO units (0.011 US$/L) and cheaper than passive solar still (0.041 US$/L) and solar membrane distillation units (0.017 US$/L).”
The payback time for the system is estimated between seven and 14 years, depending on several variables, including the price at which water is sold.
A thorough description of the system can be found in the paper “Performance evaluation and economics of a locally-made stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic-thermal brackish water reverse osmosis unit,” published in Cleaner Engineering and Technology.
