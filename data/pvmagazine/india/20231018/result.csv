The Assembly will be presided over by R.K. Singh, minister for power, new and renewable energy, government of India, and the President of the ISA Assembly. It will see the participation of ministers, missions, and delegates from 116 member and signatory countries, along with prospective countries, partner organisations, private sector, and other stakeholders.
The International Solar Alliance is an international organization that works with governments to improve energy access and security in its member countries while mitigating climate change by promoting solar power. It aims to mobilize $1 trillion of investments in solar energy solutions by 2030, installing 1,000 GW of solar energy capacity and delivering energy access to 1,000 million people. It promotes the use of solar energy in the agriculture, health, transport, and power generation sectors. 
The Assembly is the apex decision-making body of ISA, representing each member country. The sixth Assembly of the ISA will focus on universalization of energy access through solar mini-grids, mobilizing finance for accelerated solar deployment, and diversifying supply chains and manufacturing for solar.
Speaking at the curtain raiser event of the Sixth Assembly, R.K. Singh, minister for power, new and renewable energy, government of India, and the president of the ISA Assembly, said, “The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is steadfast in its commitment to member countries, providing extensive programmatic support, capacity-building initiatives, insightful analytics, and robust regulatory understanding. Our vision is to foster environments conducive to attracting investments and ensuring ample energy availability to meet the surging global demands.”
“This year, in our capacity during the G20 Presidency, ISA has been advocating for decentralized solutions, promoting green hydrogen, and advocating for the diversification of supply chains.” 
The International Solar Alliance has a seminal role in energy transition as it focuses only on renewables and solar. “India’s experience in [RE capacity addition] has been substantial. The growth rate of renewable energy capacity in our country has been among the highest in the world. We find that among the various renewables, solar energy has the edge. It is much more reliable, more dependable, and available for more months in a year,” Singh added.
Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of the International Solar Alliance, said, “Solar energy will play a pivotal role in achieving the target of the tripling of renewable capacity by 2030 that the COP28 Presidency has emphasized. To accomplish this, a substantial increase in clean energy investment, tripling current levels by 2030, is imperative.” 
“Encouragingly, investment in clean energy has seen a commendable 12% annual growth rate since 2020, driven largely by solar and wind power projects. However, this surge in investment is primarily concentrated in a handful of countries, leaving many developing economies, particularly in Africa. Emerging economies receive only a fraction of the resources needed to meet their energy requirements sustainably. By collaborating with international financial organizations, development institutions, and national governments, investment and financial support can be enhanced…Through its endeavors, culminating in the annual Assembly, the ISA has demonstrated that partnerships and coalitions are indispensable for addressing the climate challenge.”
The ISA Assembly meets annually at the ministerial level to assess the aggregate effect of the programs and other activities in terms of deployment of solar energy, performance, reliability, cost, and scale of finance. The Republic of India holds the office of the President of the ISA Assembly, with the Government of the French Republic as the co-president.
Bhupinder Singh Bhalla (IAS), Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, said, “The International Solar Alliance’s objective is to facilitate energy transition at the global level, energy security at the national level, and energy access at the local level…ISA is well suited to bring these changes in its member countries through various policies and programs.”
The ISA Secretariat has planned a high-level conference on new technologies for clean energy transition in collaboration with the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, the Government of India, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Solar Energy Society on November 1, 2023. The conference will focus on various issues concerning climate change and solar energy deployment.
ISA will also release its three flagship reports, providing updates on solar technology, the solar market, and solar investments.

Tanmoy Duari, chief executive officer at Axitec Energy India, told pv magazine that out of the planned 600 MW, 300 MW will come up in Gujarat and another 300 MW in Tamil Nadu to overcome the transportation challenges in catering to the markets in the South.
The two plants will produce n-type TOPCon PV modules in bifacial glass-glass variants with power outputs of 580Wp-585 Wp, though the same lines can also be used for mono PERC modules.
Duari said the production will begin in the first quarter of 2024. “Our focus being on quality, we will primarily target the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, not the massive utility-scale projects,” he added. The company also plans to start exports from India.
Currently, Axitec produces its PV modules in India under a contract manufacturing tie-up with a local manufacturer. The production is run as per Axitec’s own quality control process.

A landmark agreement was reached between solar developers, conservation groups, agricultural organizations, environmental and environmental justice groups, and tribal entities that aims to advance large-scale solar development in the United States.
The agreement is the result of a 20-month “Solar Uncommon Dialogue” convened by Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and The Nature Conservancy (TNC).
“As the solar and storage industry grows, it’s critical that we prioritize local engagement,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
As solar development ramps up in the U.S. in keeping with the nation’s goal of achieving clean electricity by 2035 and reaching net zero by 2050, coupled with support from the Inflation Reduction Act, the issue of land use has become paramount. A recent TNC report, Power of Place: Clean Energy Solutions that Protect People and Nature estimates that between 3.1 TW and 3.5 TW of wind and solar generation capacity is needed for the U.S. to reach its goal of net zero by 2050.
Understanding that a build-out of this size could require over 200,000 square miles of land, TNC researchers developed a 70% impact reduction scenario where only 135,000 square miles would be needed. This scenario calls for agrivoltaic installations on 4,000 square miles of agricultural land, producing both electricity and crops on the same land.
“We’re committed to accelerating the renewable energy buildout and have to go smart to go fast,” said TNC CEO Jen Morris. “Bringing environmental groups to the table ensures that we strike the right balance, delivering clean energy solutions while safeguarding our precious natural resources and communities.”
The agreement reached through the Solar Uncommon Dialogue calls for large solar projects to be transparent, equitable and efficient. Tradeoffs are understood to be part of the process.
Signatories to the Solar Uncommon Dialogue agreement have committed to improving large-scale solar development based on the “3Cs”: climate, conservation, and community.
Six working groups will address community engagement, siting-related risk assessment and decision-making, energy and agricultural technologies, tribal relations, and policy solutions. The groups will focus on advancing the 3Cs via improved public participation practices, solar siting mechanisms, regulation, financial incentives, information tools, and other means. The goal is to create best practices that solar companies, local governments, and other stakeholders can use to effectively site solar projects.
“Major U.S. solar projects are critical to fighting climate change but are increasingly opposed across the nation due to significant community and land conservation concerns,” said Stanford energy scholar Dan Reicher, who launched and leads the solar Uncommon Dialogue. “It’s exciting how motivated the parties are to avoid these conflicts and develop high-impact solutions — a triple play for climate, conservation, and community” added Reicher, who was U.S. Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/10/18/european-parliament-committees-approve-draft-regulation-on-forced-labor/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 18, 2023",European Parliament committees approve draft regulation on forced labor,"From pv magazine Global
The Internal Market and International Trade Committees of the European Parliament have approved and amended a draft regulation against forced labor prepared by the European Commission. The proposal covers all products and does not target specific companies or industries.
“The draft regulation would put in place a framework to investigate the use of forced labor in companies’ supply chains,” the European Parliament said. “If it is proven that a company has used forced labor, all import and export of the related goods would be halted at the EU’s borders and companies would also have to withdraw goods that have already reached the EU market.”
The members of parliament approved the draft regulation and also made amendments. For instance, the revised version now requires companies operating in high-risk areas, rather than public authorities, to demonstrate that they do not use forced labor.
It also says that prohibited products can re-enter the EU market if the related producer can prove they have ceased using forced labor in their operations or supply chain. The committees also harmonized the definition of forced labor with the International Labour Standards.
“The ban that we have voted for today will be essential in blocking products made using modern slavery and taking away the economic incentive for companies to engage in forced labor,” said co-rapporteur Samira Rafaela. “It will protect whistle-blowers, provide remedy to victims, and defend our businesses and SMEs from unethical competition.”
The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), which recently urged the European Union to adopt legislation against forced labor in the PV industry, welcomed the vote. However, it said that it is concerned that it will take too long time until the legislation is enforced.
“We are afraid it will not be as effective as needed,” the association said in a statement.
The ESMC is an industry association that was created in 2019 with the aim of promoting the interests of the European PV manufacturing sector.

Task 1 of the IEA PVPS focuses on Strategic PV Analysis and Outreach. For 30 years, the Trends in PV Applications Report offers a comprehensive view of the PV market, policies and key industry developments globally, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. It is designed to assist those who are responsible for developing the strategies of businesses and public authorities, and to support the development of medium-term plans for electricity utilities and other providers of energy services. It also provides guidance to government officials responsible for setting energy policy and preparing national energy plans. has been recently published.

Market Volumes: A Symbolic Milestone
As the PVPS Trends report reveals, the PV industry has achieved a significant milestone, crossing the 1-terawatt (1 183 GW) cumulative capacity mark. This achievement marks a symbolic turning point in the journey towards sustainable energy. Two thirds of all existing PV plants have been installed in the past 5 years.
In 2022, the annual capacity reached an impressive 235.8 GW, a new record, which could have been even higher, with grid connection issues and lack of installers slowing down the development of PV in numerous locations. Notably, China contributed 45% of this capacity, with the European Union following at 17%. The growth was not limited to these regions alone, as strong expansion was witnessed globally, with a 35% increase in annual capacity compared to 2021. Entering the list of the Top 10 annual PV markets wasn’t solely confined to large countries or populations, as demonstrated by the Netherlands, which installed more than 3.9 GW of capacity (see Figure 2). However, the PV market is still concentrated in a dozen of countries globally, with a lot of additional potential for market development.

The report shows that PV capacity was evenly spread between distributed and centralized systems, despite variations in different countries and regions. Some countries, (India, the USA, Spain), showed a dominance of centralized systems, while China exhibited a more balanced distribution. Recently developed markets continue to start with utility-scale development while regulations for distributed systems are more complex to put in place. While the global PV market was on an upward trajectory, some countries experienced slowdowns due to supply issues, grid congestion, and labor shortages. These challenges are expected to persist in certain regions, emphasizing the need for strategic planning to address these issues.
Competitiveness Amidst Challenges
Because of the high cost of electricity in Europe and other locations, caused by events including the Ukraine war, the competitiveness of PV continues improving. Some support mechanisms, for example contract-for-difference arrangements, generated revenue for state governments, buoyed by these high electricity market prices. The Trends report also highlights the continued growth of prosumers (consumers, who are producing part – or all – of their own electricity consumption) policies, underlining the resilience of the PV market.
Industry Investments and Challenges
The PV industry witnessed significant investments in new silicon, cell, and module manufacturing capacity, with at least 700 GW of module manufacturing capacity. Governments around the world (USA, Europe, China, India) are actively supporting local manufacturing and trade conflicts and labor concerns are influencing manufacturing support. The rapid scaling of manufacturing outpaced market development, which resulted in significant module price drops in 2023 due to massive oversupply. With markets developing slower than needed, overcapacities in the industry will cause significant damages to many players and delay the roll out of much needed local manufacturing.
Social acceptance and grid Capacity: two Growing Concerns
As PV volumes surge, grid capacity is becoming a concern in some countries. While some nations are responding with substantial investments in transmission infrastructure, others are using curtailment and other measures at the distribution level. This comes in parallel with increased social acceptance, mostly related to centralized systems, issues which are delaying PV uptake in several key countries.
Conclusion: Shaping the Future Together
The IEA PVPS Trends Report not only provides valuable insights into the current state of the PV industry but also highlights the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. As we celebrate the symbolic milestone of 1 TW of cumulative capacity, market development to reach climate change goals needs more support from policymakers and energy stakeholders. With a wider gap between market and production, a period of lower prices might accelerate PV development, while challenges remain numerous to ensure long term development.
