Altrex – a Dutch company that produces ladders, scaffolding, and suspended platforms – has developed a new modular lift system for solar panels that can be used in rooftop PV projects. It says that its “Shuttle” system is light and easy to handle and mount, and can be operated with just a cordless drill.
“The Shuttle lift system has been developed based on the strength and stability calculations of our RS Tower 52-S,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The special end-frame enables you to put the solar panel safely and easily onto the work platform.”
The system consists of guide profiles, a winch, and various consoles. The guide profiles are easy to clamp to the rungs and the winch is operated by a cordless drill, the company said.

The MoU was signed in January 2021. It covers technologies related to solar, wind, hydrogen and biomass energy.
“The MoU entails training of scientific and technical personnel; exchange of scientific and technological information and data; organization of workshops and seminars; transfer of equipment, know-how, and technology; and development of joint research and technological projects,” according to a government release.
Notably, while the Indian government plans to launch a Hydrogen Energy Mission in FY 2021-22 for generating hydrogen from green power sources, the French government came up with a national strategy for the development of carbon-free hydrogen last year.
The French government wants 6.5 GW of hydrogen generation capacity by 2030, and has defined three hydrogen priorities.
Firstly, it wants to decarbonize the industry with a pathway to electrolysis for carbon-free fuel, rather than the generation of hydrogen from fossil fuels. In line with that aim, it is planning gigawatt-sized electrolyzer projects, according to a scheme similar to the battery plan.
The second priority is the development of hydrogen-fueled public transport and commercial goods vehicles – including trains and bin lorries – across large territories.
Third hydrogen priority is an R&D and skills development program across research institutes, universities and engineering schools.

The plant will be developed by Tata Power arm TP Saurya and supply electricity to Tata Steel Limited under a power purchase agreement (PPA) valid for 25 years from the scheduled commissioning date. 
The project is required to be commissioned within six months from the date of PPA signing. It is expected to generate an average 32 million units of electricity per year, offsetting approximately an average 25.8 million Kg of CO2 annually. 
With the latest addition, Tata Power’s renewable capacity will increase to 4,047 MW. Out of this, 2,687 MW is operational and 1,360 MW under implementation, including 15 MW won under the PPA.
Speaking on this achievement, Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director, Tata Power, said, “We are glad to collaborate with Tata Steel to reduce their carbon footprint and reaffirm the Tata Group’s commitment for sustainability. Presently, the association is limited to Tata Steel at Jamshedpur, and we look forward to working closely with them for covering all their other plants across India.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/03/msmes-can-contribute-16-gw-in-meeting-solar-target/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 3, 2021",MSMEs can contribute 16 GW in meeting solar target,"Union Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Nitin Gadkari has urged MSMEs to avail concessional debt finance to install rooftop solar.
There are 63.4 million MSME units spread across India. India’s highly ambitious solar target can be achieved only if rooftop solar adoption can be accelerated, especially among MSMEs.
“India has set a target of 175 GW of installed capacity by the end of 2022, out of which 40 GW is to come from solar rooftop projects. Out of 40 GW, 4 GW is to come from domestic solar rooftops, whereas 16 GW can be harnessed from MSMEs,” said Gadkari while speaking at a webinar.
There is a strong business case for MSMEs to install rooftop solar as they can achieve significant savings on electricity bills. Most SMEs spend 20% of their operating income on electricity. They pay INR 11/kWh as standard tariff for the grid electricity. In case of power failure, this is substituted by highly costly diesel power (INR 20/kWh). Solar rooftops can generate on-site solar power at almost half the grid tariff. Further, the payback period is less than four years for rooftop solar projects.
However, rooftop solar uptake among MSMEs is hampered despite the huge potential and commercial benefits. Primary challenges include lack of awareness, poor credit access (due to low to no credit ratings), and regulatory uncertainty.
Gadkari informed that the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises is working with the World Bank to bring in a credit guarantee mechanism to make financing accessible to unrated MSMEs in implementing rooftop solar projects. “Considering the rates of solar power from large utility power plants have come down to a record INR 1.99/kWh, MSMEs must leverage this opportunity to bring down their energy expenses,” he added.
Speaking at the webinar, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman said SBI is committed to financing 15 GW of viable renewable energy projects under its Solar Rooftop Financing Program launched in 2016 with support from the World Bank. As of January 2021, it sanctioned INR 17,422 crore for 290 ground-mount projects and INR 1858 crore for 288 rooftop solar projects covering a 545 MW capacity.
SBI has availed a $625 million line of credit from World Bank specifically for financing rooftop solar projects across the country through its identified branches. A countrywide customized financial product has been developed by SBI which covers 75% of the project financing requirement along with other favourable terms such as repayment period, moratorium, and security.
