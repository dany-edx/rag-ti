This will be Ashok Leyland’s first plant in the state.
“Under this partnership, Ashok Leyland will predominantly concentrate on the production of electric buses, with the flexibility to also assemble other vehicles powered by currently available fuels as well as emerging alternative fuels,” stated the company.
Contingent on market adoption and demand of alternative fuel vehicles in the state, Ashok Leyland intends to invest up to INR 1,000 crore ($120.25 million) in this new facility over the next few years.”
Welcoming Ashok Leyland’s investment in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, “This addition reinforces our rapidly growing position as a manufacturing hub of repute within India. The Government of Uttar Pradesh is eager to attract private-sector investments aligned with our Net Zero mission. Mitigating emissions through cleaner public and freight transport is a vital step in that direction. We remain steadfast in our commitment to transitioning our entire fleet of diesel buses and commercial vehicles to electric and other alternative fuels in the coming years.”
Nand Gopal Gupta, Minister for Industrial Development, Export Promotion, NRI, and Investment Promotion, Government of Uttar Pradesh, said, within the framework of the MoU, the Government of Uttar Pradesh will facilitate the sale of electric buses annually for its own fleet and among other stakeholders for the next five years through Switch Mobility, a subsidiary of Ashok Leyland Ltd.
The manufacturing facility will initially have the capacity to produce 2,500 buses per year. The company intends to gradually expand this capacity to accommodate up to 5,000 vehicles per year over the next decade as the demand for electric and other types of buses is expected to grow substantially over the next few years. Once operational, this will be the seventh vehicle plant of Ashok Leyland in the country.
As part of the MoU, the Government of Uttar Pradesh and Ashok Leyland will also engage in discussions to develop more attractive policies aimed at accelerating the adoption of electric and green fuel trucks and buses. These policies will target both the public and private sectors, including private schools and private transportation, as part of the state’s efforts achieve net-zero.

China Mono Grade, OPIS’ assessment for polysilicon in the country, extended gains for a tenth successive week, rising 3.34% to CNY82.5 ($11.51)/kg. This increase comes in a week where China’s polysilicon players head to Baotou in Inner Mongolia for a major silicon conference to contemplate their market.
“At present, solar wafer production exceeds polysilicon production,” observed a solar market veteran. In a period when their inventories are seeing reductions, “polysilicon factories will definitely not take the initiative to lower prices,” he explained.

What remains up for debate is whether China polysilicon’s two and a half months of increasing prices is reaching its conclusion. The rate of increase is to a much smaller extent this week than in preceding weeks, observed a different market veteran. “This might be an early sign of leveling off or is even the tipping point” for polysilicon prices.
Some new production capacity has started operations this month, raising the country’s overall rate, one source said. A different source disagreed, for in his view “most capacity has come online already.” Consequently, he does not see much fluctuation in polysilicon prices come the fourth quarter of 2023.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/15/green-hydrogen-to-become-primary-fuel-for-steelmaking-only-by-2050/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",Green hydrogen to become primary fuel for steelmaking in India only by 2050,"Green hydrogen will dethrone coal as the primary fuel for steelmaking in India only by 2050. This is because the cost of green hydrogen needs to reduce, and there needs to be a price penalty on carbon emissions for Indian steelmakers to switch to hydrogen-based steelmaking, states a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics.
The report estimates that the steel industry will replace around 25-30% of its grey hydrogen requirements with green hydrogen in the early part of the 2030-2050 period. This will increase to 80% by 2050.
With the decarbonization of the steel industry in a nascent stage, the government needs to create the right policies to create demand for green steel, states the report. A legal definition for green steel can help guide the industry in making the right investments for decarbonization.
“Decarbonising steel production in India requires a vision by policymakers whereby they can encourage the production of green steel,” says the report’s co-author, Vibhuti Garg, Director, South Asia, IEEFA.
“The first step is a definition for green steel, without which the technology track that the industry should follow remains unclear. India needs to clarify that green steel will mean eliminating the use of fossil fuels in the production process,” she adds.
Given that green steel production technologies are yet to go mainstream anywhere in the world, the report finds that green steel costs nearly twice that of traditionally produced steel.
“Since steel is a highly competitive commodity, the market is unlikely to absorb the premium of green steel without a strong impact on its dynamics. Therefore, the government needs to formulate policies that create demand for green steel and penalize carbon emissions from traditionally produced steel,” says co-author Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research.
“Initially, in all government and public sector purchases, a certain quantity of green steel should be mandatory. Going forward, the government can also extend the percentage of green steel procurement to private consumers,” says co-author Kapil Gupta, Manager, JMK Research.
“Green Steel Certificates can be another way to create demand. The government can link green steel purchases with incentives through green steel certificates, which are tradable in the national carbon market for financial gain. This action will support the creation of a green steel market for domestic steelmakers,” says Gupta.
The report also recommends viability gap funding (VGF) to help bridge the gap due to the high initial capital cost of low-carbon steelmaking technology. It notes that the government can provide this VGF to urge steelmakers to commit part of their capacity to green steel manufacturing.
The report finds that green hydrogen is the cleanest option among the various technology solutions currently available to cut emissions from steelmaking. Another option is producing steel using scrap in renewables-powered electric arc furnaces (EAFs). Still, it can only partially substitute other forms of production as there are challenges to high-quality scrap availability.
The report finds the key challenge with green hydrogen is its high cost. To address this, the government has launched an ambitious National Green Hydrogen Mission to encourage the domestic production of the fuel.
“To make hydrogen technology viable for expansion, the required price should be around $1-2/kg, and a carbon penalty of at least $50 per tonne of emissions should be applicable on steel manufactured through traditional methods. This can make green steel competitive and catalyze a 150 million tonne shift from coal-based to hydrogen-based steelmaking, mainly the direct reduced iron (DRI)-EAF route,” says Gupta.
The report states that between 2030 and 2050, green hydrogen projects will be deployed on a large scale across India due to high demand. This is likely to phase out coal-based routes of steelmaking at a faster pace.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/15/declining-populations-free-up-agricultural-land-for-large-amounts-of-solar-in-densely-populated-countries/,"HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",Declining populations free up agricultural land for large amounts of solar in densely populated countries,"From pv magazine Global
The global population is expected to increase from 8 billion people today to 9.7 billion by mid-century. Strong growth is particularly evident in Africa, which will add a billion people.
However, in many countries, population is stable or even falling. There are nine countries with populations larger than 20 million people that are expected to have lower populations in 2050 than today: China, Russia, Japan, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. The combined population of these countries is expected to fall by 10%, from 2 billion people today to 1.8 billion people in 2050.
A country with a falling population requires less food. In principle, agricultural space could be freed up for other purposes. And one of these purposes could be hosting solar farms. Let us explore how much solar PV energy could be harvested from freed-up agricultural land. Solar panels are over 100 times more efficient at converting solar energy into useful energy than biomass energy from sugar cane, which is the world’s largest crop by mass. With solar PV, relatively small areas of agricultural land can produce large quantities of electricity.
We make the following assumptions for 2050:
· The world reaches zero fossil fuel consumption.
· Solar and wind drive electrification of transport, heating, and industry.
· Solar and wind drive electrolytic production of large amounts of hydrogen for chemicals [ammonia, metals, ceramics, plastics, synthetic aviation fuels, etc.] including energy exports from sunbelt countries to Europe and elsewhere.
· Everybody in the world catches up to the per capita energy consumption of high-income countries.
· Agricultural land is freed up for solar PV farms in the same ratio as population decline. Typical electricity consumption today in high-income countries is 7-12 MWh per person per year. This needs to double or triple to get rid of all fossil fuel consumption, depending upon participation in the chemical industry. We assume that the energy consumption of 9.7 billion people reaches 20 MWh per person per year (all needs inclusive) in mid-century. Thus, an affluent, fully electrified, and fully decarbonized world will need about 200,000 TWh per year of electricity. For comparison, global electricity consumption today is about 30,000 TWh per year.
We maximize energy harvest per unit area by assuming dense arrays of high-efficiency solar panels with low [10 degrees] tilt scattered all over the globe, but mainly in sunbelt countries. The nominal power of each block of solar panels is assumed to be 200 W per m2 and their efficiency to be 20% efficiency. The blocks of solar panels are scattered throughout agricultural regions. The annual energy yield (MWh/MW) for each region is calculated using the capacity factor calculator in the Global Solar Atlas. Table 1 shows (B) the projected population in 2050; (C) the expected population decline from 2022 to 2050; (D) the agricultural land in 2022; (E) the freed-up agricultural land in 2050 caused by population decline; (F) the potential solar generation from the free-up land; and (G) the required generation in 2050 to provide 20 MWh of electricity per person per year.

For all countries except South Korea, solar generation on freed-up agricultural land (Column F) is sufficient (or much more than sufficient) to provide the energy required (Column G) to operate a fully decarbonized economy. Indeed, the total area of potentially available land across the 9 countries is sufficient to provide two thirds of the energy required (143,000 TWh) by a fully electrified, decarbonized, affluent, global population of 10 billion people in 2050.
In addition, of course, there will also be large energy contributions from rooftop solar, floating solar, solar farms in arid areas, solar in combination with agriculture (agrivoltaics), wind, hydro and other sources.
This is a naive calculation for illustrative purposes only. Importantly, Russia and Ukraine export large fractions of their agricultural output, and so declining populations in those countries do not lead to a declining need for agricultural production. Additionally, countries might devote newly available agricultural land to other purposes, including agriculture for export, increasing agricultural self-sufficiency, alternative crops with lower yield [such as meat], forests, and restoring ecosystems.
However, there is a real opportunity in China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Poland, to harvest substantial fractions of required solar energy from agricultural land freed up by declining populations.

The project in Hatta will be completed by the first half of 2025.
The AED 1.421 billion ($368.8 million) project will have a capacity of 250 MW/1,500 MWh. It will have a lifespan of 80 years, a turnaround efficiency of 78.9%, and a response to demand for energy within 90 seconds.
“The hydroelectric power plant is an energy storage with turnaround efficiency of 78.9%,” the statement added. “It utilizes the potential energy of the water stored in the upper dam which is converted to kinetic energy during the flow of water through the 1.2-kilometer subterranean tunnel and this kinetic energy rotates the turbine and converts mechanical energy to electrical energy which is sent to DEWA grid.”
The company has now finished the project’s upper dam, including a water upper intake structure and associated bridge. It has also concluded the construction of the 72-meter concrete wall of the upper dam.
In June 2022, the construction of the facility stood at 44%. At the time, DEWA said it would also store electricity from the 5 GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The facility, which is partly operational and partly under construction, is the biggest solar plant in the United Arab Emirates and the Middle East.
