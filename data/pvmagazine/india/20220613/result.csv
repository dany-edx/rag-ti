Ltd. (NTPC) has picked Amara Raja Power Systems as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor to set up India’s first green hydrogen fueling station in Leh, Ladakh.
This pilot project will produce a minimum of 80 kilograms per day of 99.97% pure hydrogen, which will be compressed, stored, and dispensed. Green hydrogen will be produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, using an electrolysis process powered by electricity generated by renewable energy sources. Group subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy will set up a dedicated 1.25 MW solar plant to power the hydrogen fueling station.
Upon completion, the project will enable emission-free transport in and around Leh. NTPC initially plans to test five hydrogen fuel cell buses in the region.
Amara Raja is undertaking complete EPC for setting up the standalone green hydrogen fuel station with parking, control room, amenities, fuel storage and dispensing system. Operations and maintenance for three years from the date of commissioning of the project also falls under its scope.
“This pilot project is being set up in Leh’s extreme conditions at a height of 3,600 metres above sea level with a temperature variation of –14 C to +20 C and Amara Raja Power Systems, a part of the $1.3 billion Amara Raja group, was selected to execute this initiative based on their technical expertise,” stated Amara Raja.
The project, which is part of India’s National Hydrogen Energy Mission, will be a precursor to large-scale green hydrogen mobility and storage projects. It will be useful for studying and deploying multiple fueling stations across the length and breadth of the country.

The integrated power producer reported a profit after tax of INR 2,156 crore, up 50% year on year. Revenue rose 28% year on year to INR 42,576 crore.
The integrated power producer performed well across all segments, including renewable energy generation and electric vehicle infrastructure, in addition to conventional energy generation, transmission and distribution. It reported robust financial performance for a year that presented a number of challenges, with headwinds emanating from elevated commodity prices, Covid-19, geopolitical conflicts, and erratic weather patterns.
Throughout the year, Tata Power commissioned 707 MW of new renewables capacity. Its rooftop solar business hit its highest-ever quarterly revenue figures, while revenue from solar pumps doubled on a year-on-year basis. Its utility-scale solar EPC order book stood at 3 GW, worth INR 12,000 crore.
“We continue to be aggressively focused on growing our clean energy portfolio which today constitutes over one-third of our total generation portfolio, and we aim to increase it by more than 60% over the next five years,” Praveer Sinha, Tata Power CEO and managing director. “With BlackRock and Mubadala investing INR 4,000 crore in our renewables business, we are well-positioned to pursue even larger opportunities in the RE space.”
As of March 31, the company had 13.5 GW of installed generating capacity. This included 3.4 GW of renewables, with 2.47 GW of solar and 932 MW of wind. Its total utility-scale solar portfolio, including executed projects and its pipeline, touched 9.7 GWp. In the electric mobility segment, Tata Power EZ Charge had cumulatively installed about 13,000 home chargers and more than 2,200 EV charging points by the end of the fiscal year.

The PV installation will entail investment of INR 5,000 crore.
The project will come upon government land. The newspaper quoted state chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, as saying that the state government has already allotted 1,254 hectares (5,000 bighas) of land for the solar power project in Dima Hasao.
Assam has an estimated solar power generation potential of 13.76 GWp. The state has taken a big leap towards PV generation with two big solar plants commissioned recently: New Delhi-based Azure Power’s 90 MW solar power project in Assam is now fully operational. Noida-based Jakson Group has commissioned the 70 MW Amguri Solar Park in the state. Both the projects will supply electricity to Assam Power Distribution Co. Ltd. under a 25-year power purchase agreement.
The Assam project adds to the growing renewables portfolio of NLC, which is undertaking wind and solar power projects across India to diversify its revenue base.

SDN Co Ltd, a South Korean provider of PV modules and marine propulsion systems, recently began production of a new glass-glass bifacial module series with a power output of up 550 W at its factory in Gwangju, in southwestern Korea.
“We are also planning to launch the production of two new solar modules relying on M12 wafers with a nominal power of 590 W and 650 W, respectively, in the third quarter of this year,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The new module, dubbed SunDay 10, uses 144 monocrystalline half-cut cells based on M1o wafers and busbar technology. It is available in three versions with nominal power of 540 W to 550 W and power conversion efficiency spanning from 20.89% to 21.28%. The open-circuit voltage is between 49.50 V and 49.80 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.85 A and 13.99 A.
The panel measures 2,279 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm and weighs 32.8 kg. It is built with 2 mm tempered anti-reflective glass and an aluminum alloy frame. It also features an IP68 enclosure and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V. The panel has a temperature coefficient of -0.39% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new product comes with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 10-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2.5% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 83.0% of the nominal output power.
SDN announced plans to start the new module production in September 2021. The company is also active in both the distributed generation and large-scale project development business. It has developed several solar parks across Bulgaria, Japan and its home country. Its shipbuilding division supplies outboard motors for fishing and leisure boats.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/06/13/new-photovoltaic-in-roof-system-from-switzerland/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,ROOFTOP SOLAR,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JUNE 13, 2022",New photovoltaic in-roof system from Switzerland,"From pv magazine Global
Swiss solar module manufacturer Megasol has conceived a new in-roof system that it claims can be used to deploy homogeneous and flush-fitting rooftop PV installations.
Called Nicer X, the in-roof system is available in two versions — the full-black and the translucent variants. The first system relies on 400 solar modules with a power conversion efficiency of 21.7%, black cell gaps, cross-contacts, and rear busbars. The second solution utilizes larger, transparent cell spacing enabling light to penetrate by around 10%.
Both solutions consist of three components: vertical supports, a ridge profile, and solar modules. The installation is easy, according to the manufacturer. In the first step, the vertical supports are screwed directly onto the existing roof battens after the old tiles have been removed. In the case of a new building, reduced roof battens can be installed.
In the second step, the ridge profiles are clicked and modules can be installed. “The modules are laid completely without tools — they are pushed up to the upper stop and then “closed, similar to a trunk lid,” explains Michael Reist, head of communications at Megasol. “An audible click and a corresponding haptic feedback confirm that it is securely locked in place.” In addition, it is also possible to visually check whether the solar modules are securely fixed. With the manufacturer’s snap-lock fasteners, the modules can easily be attached and detached several times.
According to Megasol, 20 square meters of the Nicer X substructure and solar modules could be deployed in one person-hour. The manufacturer also offers matching eaves grilles for the system if required. The system is also claimed to be completely rainproof from a roof pitch of three degrees, which is achieved by a double labyrinth seal.
The system is not only suitable for in-roof photovoltaic systems, but also for solar parking lots, canopies or facades. Existing parking spaces could be retrofitted and, in the case of facades, the system is particularly suitable for hall-like buildings or steel structures. In the case of non-insulated hall constructions, no further facade elements are necessary and the trapezoidal sheets can be left out completely.
