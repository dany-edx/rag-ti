The project comprises a 100 MW PV plant coupled with a 120 MWh utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS). 
Tata Power Solar Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power Renewable Energy, secured this INR 945 crore project on EPC basis from the Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd. (SECI) in December 2021. Its scope of work includes engineering, design, supply, construction, erection, testing, O&M and commissioning of the projects.
Tata Power stated the Tata Power Solar Systems team successfully completed the project within the stipulated timeframe despite the various challenges such as unsuitable full hard rock soil conditions and remote location of the project site. The team deployed the plant with 239,685 bifacial monocrystalline modules. The BESS for the project was supplied by Tata AutoComp Systems.
Deepesh Nanda, CEO and managing director, Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd, said, “The successful commissioning of the largest solar and battery storage project for SECI, reflects the technical expertise and project execution skills of Tata Power Solar. This will ensure round-the-clock green energy, and accelerate the renewable energy transition through innovative solutions.” 
The project is expected to generate 243.53 million units of energy annually and reduce carbon footprint by 4.87 million tonnes in 25 years.
R.P. Gupta, chairman and managing director, SECI, said, “We are committed to leveraging the latest technology in the renewable energy segment and this project supports the country’s energy transition vision. The project has been delivered on time by Tata Power Solar and will help in providing 24×7 renewable power.”
Tata Power Solar Systems is a fully integrated solar company with an EPC portfolio of more than 12.8 GWp of ground-mount utility-scale, over 2 GW of rooftop and distributed ground-mounted systems, and over 2 GW of rooftop and distributed ground-mounted systems, and over one lakh solar water pumps.

We are in the midst of a year-long acceleration in the decline of battery cell prices – a trend that is reminiscent of recent solar cell price reductions.
Since last summer, lithium battery cell pricing has plummeted by approximately 50%, according to Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world’s largest battery manufacturer. In early summer 2023, publicly available prices ranged from CNY 0.8 ($0.11)/Wh to CNY 0.9/Wh, or about $110/kWh to $130/kWh.

Pricing initially fell by about about one-third by the end of summer 2023. Now, as reported by CnEVPost, large EV battery buyers are acquiring cells at CNY 0.4/Wh, representing a price decline of 50% to 56%. Leapmotor CEO Cao Li said the company expects further reductions, with prices potentially dropping to CNY 0.32/Wh this summer, for a decline of 60% to 64% within a single year.
EnergyTrend said that energy storage battery cells are priced similarly to electric vehicle battery cells.
CnEVPost also reports that the battery cells being sold come equipped with advanced technologies, including faster charge rates, higher cycle life, improved temperature management characteristics, and higher energy density packaging.
A Goldman Sachs report in February attributes the accelerated price declines partly to a slight slowdown in electric vehicle adoption, leading to lower commodity prices. The finance group revised its growth projection for global battery demand to 29% for 2024, down from the previous estimate of 35%, with 31% growth expected in 2023.

United Solar Polysilicon (FZC) SPC has started building a polysilicon production facility at the Sohar Port and Freezone, a deep-sea port midway between Dubai and Oman’s capital, Muscat.
Local press in Oman reports the project’s investment exceeds $1.35 billion. Expected to be operational sometime next year, the plant will occupy an area of 160,000 square meters and produce 100,000 metric tons of high-quality metallurgical silicon annually.
The plant’s production process will involve pouring liquid metallic silicon from a furnace into molds, then cooling, casting, grinding and packing the ore for global export.
According to a statement released on the Omani government’s press website, the project reflects the government’s “keenness to encourage local investment and attract foreign investors”, and reflects part of the objectives of Oman Vision 2040, a unit of economic and social planning in the country.
Oman’s Undersecretary for Commerce and Industry at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Investment Promotion, Saleh bin Said Masan, billed the project as the first of its kind in the Middle East and said the project holds the promise of a more sustainable future for the Sohar Port and Freezone by increasing handling capacity in the years to come.
“This polysilicon project will enhance the status of the Sohar Port and Freezone as a global trade hub. Furthermore, it represents a significant achievement in the region’s economic growth and diversification, meeting the growing demand for metallurgical silicon in the markets of Asia, Europe, and North America,” he said.
The announcement follows news that in January, Chinese solar material manufacturer Shuangliang Eco-Energy Co announced it received a $58.3 million equipment order from United Solar Polysilicon (FZC) SPC and will supply polycrystalline silicon reduction furnaces, hydrogen production equipment, and refrigeration units for the plant.
