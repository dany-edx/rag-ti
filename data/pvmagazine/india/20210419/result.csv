The 670W Vertex module is based on 210mm wafers. It inherits the non-destructive cutting, high-density interconnection and other high-precision technologies of earlier Vertex modules. But, Trina Solar India director Gaurav Mathur, said, “The 670W module has even more power and the single string power gets 34% higher than [with] 500W+ modules in the industry.”
“Besides, 670W Vertex modules can be packed vertically – rather than horizontally – which means 12% more modules can be packed in each container, reducing shipping costs by 12% for each module,” Mathur added.
Trina said the multi-busbar technology and high-density interconnection improve the module efficiency to up to 21.6%, while the non-destructive cutting significantly reduces the risks of cell micro-cracking and power loss.
The module, as with other powerful products of the Vertex series, is claimed to reduce, significantly, both the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the balance-of-system (BoS) costs of a project, due to the reduced number of arrays that can be achieved with bigger and better-performing panels. 
The launch of the 670W+ Vertex module coincides with the India launch of solutions from the TrinaTracker business. TrinaTracker is a new brand under Trina Solar that focuses on trackers. Its trackers are compatible with Trina Solar modules as well as modules from other manufacturers.
TrinaTracker is available for use with modules from Trina and other manufacturers, for both 166, 182 and 210mm wafer including large-format modules up to 670Wp.
Speaking to pv magazine, Andrew Gilhooly, who heads the TrinaTracker business in Asia Pacific, said, “Trackers are made of different components so currently the tracker components come from various sources. Some components are made by TrinaTracker and some of the components come from various global suppliers.  We are currently exploring localized vendor qualification within India to overcome local duties for steelwork not originating in India.”
TrinaTracker sales within India are led by localized Trina module sales people, to ensure clients can benefit from continuity of the support that they already enjoy from the Trina modules business.  “Our local India team is capably supported by the APAC region TrinaTracker business for both pre-sales and during project execution and after sales,” said Gilhooly.
Currently, TrinaTracker is launching two types of trackers in India, the Agile tracker and the Vanguard tracker.
The Agile 550-1P dual-row system is designed with one-in-portrait con­figuration (1P), and can accommodate up to 120 modules per tracker. 
The Vanguard 550-2P single-row multi-drive system is designed to support larger modules improving the LCOE without compromising aeroelastic stability. It is compatible with modules based on 158/166/182/210 mm wafer size. It is designed with two-in-portrait con­figuration (2P), and can accommodate up to 120 modules per tracker.
“We have optimized [these] trackers’ performance in terms of the longer string length possible with [the new, larger] modules. We can fully accommodate these longer strings on longer and wider tracker structures and this means we can have up to 40 modules in a string, unlocking savings not only on the tracker cost on motors and piles but also savings on downstream electrical BOS costs with fewer string cables, combiner boxes, trenches and so on,” said Mathur. 
Trina Solar is the only solar module manufacturer that also makes trackers. This combination, the company feels, makes it very helpful for large-scale power plants, especially the low-cost power plants that are very sensitive to investment costs. 
“We feel trackers will be coming to India in a big way. Everybody wants to increase the energy output of their projects to achieve a lower LCOE. The combination of trackers and bifacial PV typically deliver a 15-20% boost to yield and accordingly unlock a reduction of 5-8% for LCOE as compared to fixed-tilt,” said Mathur. 
“Customers in India have always been very price-conscious. They need to maximize their return on investment. The way to achieve lower LCOE is to use high-power, high-efficiency bifacial modules and smart trackers. Trina Solar makes both, so it is better able to optimize the performance for lower LCOE,” added Mathur.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/19/uks-power-roll-signs-up-thermax-to-manufacture-solar-films-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,INDIA,UNITED KINGDOM",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 19, 2021",UK’s Power Roll signs up Thermax to manufacture solar films in India,"UK-based Power Roll has announced an agreement with Thermax Group, a Pune-headquartered energy and environment solutions provider, to develop the market for its lightweight, flexible solar film in India.
Power Roll claims its solar film technology can produce up to 20 times cheaper electricity than existing flexible PV and is on track to deliver the lowest levelized cost of electricity for any solar technology. The film is 25 times lighter than silicon PV and has a 20 times smaller carbon footprint. 
The film can be manufactured using high-speed roll-to-roll production processes, which eliminates many costly process steps typical of other solar photovoltaic technologies.
Power Roll views India as one of the most strategic markets for its technology and has, therefore, set up a business operation in India to support regional growth.
As per the agreement, Power Roll will collaborate with Thermax to assess the market potential for scale manufacturing and deployment of Power Roll’s unique solar film in India. The two companies will jointly identify applications for lightweight solar film and green energy solutions for the region. Over the agreement period, the parties will share knowledge on the low-cost production processes, efficiency and identify compelling use cases for solar film in India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/19/french-company-unveils-new-rooftop-pv-mounting-method/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",JOËL SPAES,"APRIL 19, 2021",French company unveils new rooftop PV mounting method,"From pv magazine International
Axter, a French waterproofing system supplier, has developed a new process to deploy rigid solar modules on several different kinds of buildings.
The company said its technique has been validated by the Centre Scientifique et Technique du Batiment, which is a French certification organization for the construction industry. The Surfa 5 Topsolar process, which was developed at Axter’s R&D center in Courchelettes, northern France, makes it possible to install rigid PV modules on buildings and roof terraces that are coated with bituminous waterproofing.
The system is a turnkey solution for installers, waterproofers, and building owners, Axter claimed. “It combines different types of insulation, single-layer or double-layer bituminous waterproofing processes, and several versions of couplings for installing flat or inclined modules,” the company said.
Surfa 5 Topsolar is suitable for three types of load-bearing elements: concrete, wood, and steel. It can be installed on rooftops with a slope of no more than 10%, with the modules laying parallel to the waterproofing plane or inclined by 10 degrees. This solution is designed to optimize the exposure of the panels and thus the performance of PV installations. In addition, the technique is said to facilitate strong wind resistance.
Axter manufactured the waterproofing membrane for the Surfa 5 Topsolar solution at its production site in Courchelettes. The aluminum components that make up the hitch were assembled on the same site. Five types of standard PV modules can be used with the Surfa 5 Topsolar system, including panels produced by France’s Voltec Solar.
“It seemed important to us to be able to associate a French supplier and manufacturer of photovoltaic modules with our Surfa 5 Topsolar solution,” said Axter CEO Peter Fleischmann. “The photovoltaic roofing sector is booming, driven by the ambitious objectives of the multi-year energy program which sets a target of 20.1 GW of installed photovoltaic power in 2023.”
