https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/10/energy-efficient-hydrogen-production-by-urea-electrolysis-using-ni2o3-electrocatalyst/,"GREEN HYDROGEN,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"MARCH 10, 2022",Energy-efficient hydrogen production by urea electrolysis using Ni2O3 electrocatalyst,"Urea electrolysis offers a cost-effective way of producing green hydrogen as it requires considerably less energy than conventional water electrolysis. It replaces the energy-intensive oxygen evolution reaction of water splitting with a more thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Low-cost, earth-abundant nickel (Ni)-based catalysts are widely used in this process. 
However, the main challenge associated with urea oxidation is retaining the prolonged activity of the catalyst as the strong adsorption of the reactive intermediate (COx) on the active site, referred to as catalyst poisoning, causes activity loss.
In nickel oxide-based UOR electrocatalysts, enhancing Ni3+ active species (NiO(OH)) is one of the effective ways to improve the activity. 
Alex C, Gaurav Shukla, Muhammed Safeer N. K., and Neena S John from the Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS), an autonomous institute of the Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India, have explored different electrocatalysts for electro-oxidation of urea in an alkaline media (KOH) and shown that surface-defective NiO and Ni2O3 systems having more Ni3+ ions are more efficient electrocatalysts than conventional NiO. With Ni2O3 catalyst, they found the UOR activity to be almost six times higher than with the conventional NiO electrocatalyst. 
In their study, Ni2O3 showed retention of 70% UOR performance even after 25 hours at an average current density of 25 mA cm−2, whereas the NiO system lost 50% of its activity within 10 hours even at a low current density of 5.1 mA cm−2. 
“The efficient and sustained UOR activity of Ni2O3 can be correlated with the highly tolerant Ni3+ ions in the Ni2O3 system towards COx poisoning compared to the tolerance of NiO, as proved by impedance studies,” said the researchers in their work published in the ‘Journal of Materials Chemistry A.’ 
The scientists used high-energy electron beams to produce surface-defective unsaturated Ni sites in NiO (e-NiO). Their study revealed that e-NiO prefers direct mechanism of urea electro-oxidation due to strong adsorption of urea molecule, whereas NiO favors indirect mechanism with low activity. Further, the prominent electrocatalyst poison COx could be removed by adjusting the molar ratio of KOH and urea with improved kinetics.
Alex and Gaurav opine that the e-beam treatment is an effective way to produce a large number of coordinatively unsaturated active sites on electrocatalysts. It was observed that these generated sites effectively adsorb urea and favor direct urea electro-oxidation mechanism (UOR). 
Safeer researched another Ni3+ oxide system (Ni2O3), revealing that active species Ni3+O(OH) on Ni2O3 possess high COx tolerance than NiO. The active species of high-valent Ni oxide system has a profound effect on catalyst activity.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/03/10/the-eu-plan-to-drastically-ramp-renewables-to-replace-russian-gas/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GEOPOLITICS,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 10, 2022",The EU plan to drastically ramp renewables to replace Russian gas,"From pv magazine Global
The EU’s plan to hit fast-forward on its Fit for 55 emissions reduction plan, in a bid to reduce the bloc’s reliance on Russian gas, will include a proposal to bring forward enough rooftop solar panels to generate up to 15TWh of clean electricity this year.
The European Commission yesterday stated its intent to draw up a “RepowerEU” package of policies “by the summer” to try and reduce by two-thirds the volume of Russian gas it imported last year, with the aim of securing that result by the end of December.
The emergency measure was drafted in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the connected threat to supplies of Russian gas, oil and coal to the EU.
A communication published by the EU executive yesterday included proposals to fast-forward the deployment of solar generation capacity – including rooftop PV – which, to date, had been planned to arrive by the end of the decade.
The commission said the EU imported 155 billion m3 (bcm) of Russian gas last year and it will aim to reduce 103bcm of that demand this year by varying its sources of gas supply and dramatically speeding up the deployment of renewables, green hydrogen, and energy efficiency measures. “Let’s dash into renewable energy at lightning speed,” said commission VP for the European Green Deal Frans Timmermans, as the RepowerEU plan was announced.
The commission pledged to deliver a solar energy document in June which will include a proposed European Solar Rooftops Initiative and the EU body said successfully installing enough panels to generate the hoped-for 15TWh of clean power this year would remove demand for 2.5bcm of Russian gas.
With the Fit for 55 package – which refers to a planned 55% cut in EU carbon emissions this decade – laying plans for 420GW of solar generation capacity by 2030, speeding up that planned rate of PV project deployment 20%, as the commission suggested yesterday, could reduce demand for a further 20bcm of Russian gas this year.
With the RepowerEU package set to recommend a further 80GW of solar and wind capacity this decade – on top of the figures included in the Fit for 55 plan – to power green hydrogen production, the commission called for EU member states to immediately get to work processing permits for renewable energy projects as quickly as their legislative systems allow, and to allocate the land and water bodies necessary for the raised ambition.
The commission has promised to deliver, in May, recommendations on how to accelerate project permitting and has also told member states and industry it may be necessary to stockpile critical and other raw materials necessary to continue the deployment of renewables.
The commission said the EU should aim to double the projected, Fit for 55 rate of heat pump deployment, to 10 million units over the next five years, a move it said could remove demand for another 1.5bcm of Russian gas this year.
The Brussels-based body said the bloc should secure an extra 15 million tons of green hydrogen this decade, on top of the Fit for 55 volumes, with 10 million tons more than planned to be imported, by 2030, and five million tons more to be generated on European soil. The inclusion of nuclear-fired hydrogen among the definition of the green form of the gas may prove contentious, however.
With solar trade bodies in Italy and Europe having criticized moves by the governments of Spain and Italy to protect households and businesses from rising energy costs by fixing electricity prices and clawing back profits from generators, yesterday’s commission announcement implicitly endorsed such moves, as an emergency measure to protect energy users.
