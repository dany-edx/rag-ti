https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/14/addressing-the-intricacies-of-bipv-fire-safety/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",,"JULY 14, 2023",Addressing the intricacies of BIPV fire safety,"Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) extends the areas available to generate solar electricity by integrating PV components into traditional building structures while maintaining architectural quality and integrity. It is particularly interesting in densely populated countries with limited land areas for further conventional PV installations. More generally, PV installations in the built environment provide electricity close to centers of consumption, reducing the need for additional grid infrastructure. However, the global BIPV market has faced slower development than anticipated, partly due to the complexity of building standards and codes. In particular, fire safety building standards present a significant challenge and have acted as a barrier to the development of the BIPV market. This article explores the complexities surrounding fire safety standards, the role of testing laboratories, and the efforts made by IEA PVPS Task 15 to address these challenges.
Diverse Fire Safety Standards
One of the key obstacles facing the BIPV industry is the wide array of fire safety standards that exist across different countries and regions. On the one hand, BIPV installations must comply with specific fire safety regulations, which vary greatly depending on the location and the local building tradition that has evolved there, often over centuries. On the other hand, there are certain classification requirements that apply globally. This creates a complex landscape where it becomes vital for manufacturers and suppliers of BIPV products to understand and adhere to a multitude of standards in different markets, and to recognize that the fire safety testing of conventional PV products is already deficient with regard to BAPV applications and is certainly not sufficient for BIPV products.
Navigating Testing Laboratories
To guarantee compliance with building-related fire safety standards, BIPV products must undergo rigorous testing. Testing laboratories, situated in various countries, play an essential role in assessing compliance with regional standards. However, for suppliers of BIPV products, identifying the appropriate testing laboratories can be a daunting task. The global nature of their operations further compounds this challenge, as they manufacture products in one country and install them in several others. Streamlining the process of locating accredited testing laboratories could help to alleviate this burden.
IEA PVPS Task 15 report provides international mapping of testing laboratories
Task 15 recently published the report: “Fire safety of BIPV: International mapping of accredited and R&D facilities in the context of codes and standards, 2023”.  The report provides a concise overview of currently used standards in different parts of the world as well as a description of regulations pertaining to fire safety in several important markets. It also presents more than forty testing laboratories around the world where construction products and materials are tested for fire safety. These laboratories are confirmed to have a common interest in the assessment of BIPV products and systems, even though not all of them may have any experiences of it so far.
The report serves as a valuable resource for BIPV suppliers, architects, and project managers, offering guidance on navigating fire safety standards and identifying reliable testing laboratories. However, it is important to note that while the report maps out the testing labs, many of them focus on products and materials and more seldom assess additional risks that arise from combining products into larger structures in buildings.
The Complexity of BIPV Fire Safety
The core issue lies in the complexity of BIPV fire safety, which requires industry guidelines from building regulatory bodies. To resolve this issue, collaboration between building regulatory bodies, building surveyors, fire engineers, façade engineers, fire rescue commissions, and testing laboratories is essential. By bringing together these stakeholders, a collective effort can be made to develop comprehensive guidelines that address the intricacies of BIPV fire safety.
Recommendations on test configurations
The paper, “Fire safety requirements for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV): A cross-country comparison,”[1] which was written collaboratively by experts from Task 15, provides valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of fire safety requirements, highlighting the need to satisfy both electrical and building-related aspects. It contains specific recommendations on test configurations to test BIPV components or estimating the hazard of a system that remains operating when a fire occurs. Further research should also be conducted on the impact of toxic smoke from BIPV modules based on tests or comparison with the composition of existing building components.
Contributing to the future of BIPV
The integration of photovoltaic technology into building facades and roofs must not compromise the safety of construction products, occupants, and firefighters. Prioritizing comprehensive fire safety guidelines, fostering collaboration among industry stakeholders, and adhering to international standards will ensure that the BIPV market can thrive while utmost safety in the built environment is guaranteed. As a valuable side-effect, traditional (BA)PV installations will also enjoy a higher safety level with respect to fire, as many of the same fire safety challenges are relevant for both BIPV and BAPV.
The third phase of Task 15, to extend international co-operation on BIPV topics for four years, is currently in the planning phase. Conducting pre-normative collaborative research within Task 15 can be one way of influencing BIPV standardization, as co-operation with formal standardization bodies is well established. In case you are a potential participant of Phase 3 of Task 15, please contact the Task Co-Managers. Phase 3 will address the topics of “Challenges and opportunities of BIPV in a de-carbonized and circular economy”, “BIPV in the digital environment”, “BIPV products, projects and demos: innovation and long-term behavior”, “BIPV training, dissemination and stakeholders’ collaboration”, “BIPV characterization & performance: pre-normative international research”, and “Activity devoted to the Fire Safety of BIPV.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/14/the-solar-glass-opportunity-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOLAR GLASS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JULY 14, 2023",The solar glass opportunity in India,"pv magazine: What is the current demand and supply for solar glass production in India?
Gautam Shahi: Currently, India can manufacture about 1,000 tonnes per day of solar glass, which is adequate for module production of 5-6 GW.
The country’s overall module production capacity, however, is 38 GW.
Hence, there is a massive demand-supply gap, with domestic production meeting only 15% of the solar glass requirement and the remaining imported from China.
For adding 35-38 GW of solar module capacity in the next three years or so, our solar glass capacity has to expand by 7-8 times to meet the demand.
pv magazine: What’s the potential for growth?
Gautam Shahi: Currently, our country has installed a solar power generation capacity of 66 GW, which the government targets to increase to about 300 GW by 2030. This will require substantial capacity addition in modules
We believe that for adding 35-38 GW of solar module capacity in the next three years or so, our solar glass capacity has to expand by 7-8 times to meet the demand.
pv magazine: Do you think the government policies are conducive enough to support local production and provide a level-playing field to domestic manufacturers?
Gautam Shahi: The government’s focus on ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, along with the impetus for module manufacturing through Production Linked Incentive (PLI) and Approved List of Models and Manufacturers schemes, will encourage domestic production in a big way.
Earlier, most of the modules, including glass, were imported.
The imposition of import duty on solar panels has fuelled module manufacturing in India, which will increase domestic consumption of solar glass as well.
pv magazine: What’s the case for new entrants?
Gautam Shahi: Getting the cost right, ensuring that the variability in the raw material, etc is being absorbed in the final product in the market, upfront high capital costs and technology have traditionally been some of the constraints for new players entering solar glass manufacturing.
Some of existing large players are global companies and already have a good presence in solar glass outside India. Globally, from the technology perspective, they already had that technology but then the module production itself was in a very nascent stage in India. Now that a large solar module capacity has been established in India, the local demand for solar glass is also increasing and is likely to increase further.
However, with discontinuation of import duty on solar tempered glass last fiscal, the momentum on domestic capacity addition will remain slow. Government’s initiative to restrict imports or improvement in efficiency of domestic players to compete with imports will be crucial to kickstart the capacity addition for solar glass in India and will be a key monitorable.

The analysts expect the nation to install around 20 GW of renewable energy capacity in FY 2024, led by the solar sub-segment. This will be followed by the installation of over 25 GW in FY 2025—thus leading to cumulative addition of 45 GW over the next two fiscals. 
Currently, India has a healthy pipeline of over 55 GW assets under development, which will drive significant capacity addition till FY 2025. Further, the indicative bidding trajectory of 50 GW annually will lead to capacity additions.

The analysts said India installed cumulative renewable energy (RE) capacity of around 125 GW as of March 31, 2023. Solar capacity leads the way at 67 GW, followed by wind capacity at 43 GW. 
The nation’s annual RE installations must exceed 40 GW to achieve the 2030 target of 500 GW capacity through non-fossil fuel sources with segment-wise targets of 280 GW for solar and 140 GW for wind. To facilitate this, the government has committed to the bidding of around 50 GW RE capacity annually for the next five years through central renewable energy implementing agencies such as NTPC, Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NHPC, and SJVN. The trajectory for FY 2024 includes 10 GW of wind capacity and 40 GW collectively from solar, hybrid, and storage-based capacity.
The analysts said one-year relaxation for the approved list of module manufacturers (ALMM) order is a positive for 25+ GW of unimplemented solar capacity awarded at a tariff of less than INR 2.5 ($0.030)/kWh. 
The decline in module prices also bodes well for the implementation of over 25 GW of unimplemented solar capacity.
“Although the non-tariff barrier of ALMM has been put on hold for a temporary period, developers continue to be affected by tariff-related barriers, such as the basic customs duty on cells (25%) and modules (40%), which restrict their returns. Despite the external macro-environment being beyond the government’s complete control, recent developments have shown a positive trend, with module prices declining to 21-22 cents per watt compared to the range of 28-30 cents per watt between October 2021 and December 2022,” said the analysts.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/07/14/assessing-shading-effect-of-cleaning-robots-in-solar-farms/,"HIGHLIGHTS,PV MODULE CLEANER,SOLAR PANEL CLEANING,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2023",Assessing shading effect of cleaning robots in solar farms,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI), part of Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), have investigated the impact of the shadow produced by moving cleaning robots on the performance and yield of utility scale photovoltaic plants.
“Cleaning robots are now being used at almost all desert PV plants and, usually, they run during the daytime, which creates a moving shadow on the PV modules,” the research’s corresponding author, Benjamin Figgis, told pv magazine. “We did a field study in Qatar to measure how a robot’s shadow affects the PV output in real time, and to see if hot spots were created.”
The scientists conducted a series of tests under clear sky conditions using the commercial robot Nomadd Desert Solar Solutions on different PV array configurations at the QEERI testing facility in Doha, Qatar, with a tilt angle of 22 degrees. They considered three main factors: module design, module orientation, and robot speed.
They specified that the DC current and voltage of the PV string were recorded at 4 Hz, from several minutes before the robot pass to several minutes. The current was measured by passing the string DC cable through a 10 A/75 mV shunt resistor and sensing the voltage drop with the same datalogger. String DC power (P) was obtained by multiplying the voltage and current values.
They explained that the speed of response of the inverter is a main critical factor, as the robot moves quickly over the modules. They also noted that the robot takes the same time to traverse the string regardless of the module type or orientation.
Through their analysis, the academics found that module orientation has an enormous effect on the impact of shadow.
“In landscape, the string current and power dropped severely as the robot passed, whereas strings with portrait modules were barely affected,” Figgis stated. “This was well explained by the layout of modules’ bypass diodes. Happily, there were no signs of cell hot spots, although bypass diodes did heat up if the robot stopped for some time.”
Figgs also explained that, notably, the inverter’s maximum power point tracker (MPPT) algorithm struggled to cope with the robot’s moving shadow – sometimes it increased the string voltage, sometimes it lowered it, and it took around a minute to re-establish MPP after the robot left the array. “For the set-up we tested, one robot pass reduced the day’s PV energy yield by around 0.16% for landscape modules. With portrait modules the loss was nearly zero,” he further explained.
The researchers also found that the decrease in power was larger for full-cell modules than half-cut panels, and that the heating of a module’s bypass diode occurred if the robot stopped on the module, but not while the robot was moving.
“The key lessons were that if a PV plant is being designed with cleaning robots in mind, their shading losses can be minimized by portrait module layout, which is usually the case for single-axis trackers,” Figgs concluded. “For landscape systems, it is best to run robots at night, although before dew has formed.”
The research’s findings can be found in the study “Effect of cleaning robot’s moving shadow on PV string,” published in Solar Energy.
The same group published in January a study providing an assessment of the degree to which cleaning robots could threaten the physical integrity of solar panels. They found that cleaning machines have a very minimal impact and that modules of similar sizes tend to exhibit roughly the same amount of vibration.

Germany battery manufacturer VoltStorage has unveiled a 50 kWh vanadium redox flow battery that is designed to optimize self-consumption in commercial and industrial PV systems
The VoltStorage VDIUM C50 is an AC-coupled battery with a system voltage of 48 V. The manufacturer offers a 20-year guarantee on the electrolyte and promises that it will degrade less than 0.3% per year.
It also offers a five-year guarantee on the power electronics. The new product comes in a common container and weighs 2 tons without the electrolyte. When fully filled, it weighs 6.5 tons. The electrolyte pumps and power electronics consume 40 W in standby mode.
The system can be cascaded in a 10-unit configuration and reach a total capacity of 500 kWh. The discharge capacity is 9 kW. At full power, the system is empty after six hours.
The manufacturer said that the system, thanks to the redox technology, can achieve a depth of discharge of 100%. When charging the system, operators should plan six hours for 80% and nine hours for 100%. At 10 kW, the charging power is slightly higher than the discharging power.
VoltStorage also said the system features an IP54 protection rating. It recommends installing it in an outdoor environment.
