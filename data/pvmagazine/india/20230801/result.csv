The nation has one of the largest manufacturing ecosystems in wind energy and is rapidly adding capacity in solar, said Raj Kumar Singh, Union Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, at an ICRA event.
The minister said India is set to emerge as one of the largest solar module manufacturers with considerable existing solar manufacturing capacity and even larger capacities under construction, including polysilicon.
The minister said India has the fastest-growing capacity in renewable energy. The nation has achieved the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 40% capacity from renewable sources ahead of the timeline and is on course to achieve the 50% capacity share of RE, well ahead of the NDC timeline of 2030.
India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, yet the per capita greenhouse gas emissions are substantially lower than the world average. The country is striving to achieve a fine balance between meeting its surging energy needs and reducing carbon emissions. India remains steadfast in its commitment to sustainable growth, renewable energy expansion, and electric vehicle adoption.
“By strategically balancing economic growth with environmental consciousness, the nation is determined to carve a brighter, greener future for generations to come,” said the minister.
Speaking on the occasion, Ramnath Krishnan, managing director and group CEO of ICRA Ltd, said, “India’s clean energy revolution has witnessed significant progress over the past decade, fueled by strong policy support from the Government of India and enhanced tariff competitiveness of solar and wind power. This momentum has enabled a substantial increase in renewable energy (RE) capacity. The recent announcement of a bidding trajectory of 50 GW per annum over the period from FY2024 to FY2028 sets a clear path in moving towards achieving the ambitious 500-GW non-fossil fuel-based capacity target by the government for 2030.”
While the trajectory shows promise, timely completion of the tendering process, risk mitigation during execution, and augmentation of the domestic solar supply chain are paramount to realizing the capacity target, highlighted Krishnan.

The MoU aims to accelerate and de-risk Australia’s energy transition with local production of PV modules, long-duration battery storage, and components for wind energy, stated Brookfield.
Brookfield and Reliance will explore avenues of direct capital investment and the development of skills, knowledge, and expertise in Australia’s renewable energy sector. The two partners will evaluate the setting up of advanced manufacturing operations to ensure a consistent supply of equipment to all renewable energy players in the market, including Origin Energy Markets, a company being acquired by Brookfield. 
Reliance Industries is currently setting up one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India, including gigafactories for PV panels, energy storage, electrolyzers for green hydrogen, and fuel cells. Its 10 GW solar cell and module factory is set to commence production by 2024. The company plans to double the facility’s capacity to 20 GW by 2026 and also aims for 50 GWh of annual cell-to-pack battery capacity by 2027. It claims to have a defined technology improvement roadmap to stay ahead in PV manufacturing.
Brookfield has a track record of committing long-term capital to enable the energy transition. Through the MoU with Reliance, it intends to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of the clean energy equipment required to develop up to 14 GW of new, large-scale generation and storage capacity in Australia.
“Australia has a proud history of manufacturing and an abundance of raw materials, but the industry is not currently cost-competitive. The energy transition creates an opportunity to bring advanced manufacturing processes created offshore to Australia, which would secure the supply of critical equipment for the transition to help drive down Australia’s emissions faster and contribute significantly to job creation,” said Luke Edwards, Brookfield Renewable Head of Australia. “We are establishing these types of global partnerships in manufacturing now to allow us to get started as quickly as possible given the ever-reducing timeline for Australia to reach its first emissions-reductions targets in 2030.”
Anant Ambani, director of Reliance New Energy Ltd, said, Reliance is firmly committed to the mission of creating a global clean energy ecosystem that is both beneficial to humanity and compatible with nature. Towards this end, it is pursuing opportunities for investment in India and globally with great enthusiasm and passion. “We are confident that Reliance and Brookfield will explore avenues in green energy in Australia, accelerating the nation’s transition to a Net Zero future and providing a fillip to the global green energy movement,” he added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/08/01/aerocompact-releases-universal-mounting-system-for-pitched-roofs/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 1, 2023",Aerocompact releases ‘universal’ mounting system for pitched roofs,"From pv magazine International
Austrian mounting system manufacturer Aerocompact has developed CompactPitch XM-F Reptile, a new “universal” solution for pitched rooftops compatible with various roof tiles.
The cover plate, positioned independently of the fastener unit, transfers forces directly into the roof structure, allowing easy adaptation to surrounding tile contours without machinery.
“The appropriate place for fixing the roof hook can be marked with a slight pressure of the thumb,” said Aerocompact. “The pre-assembled hook is fastened with two thin sheet metal screws.”
Installers can mark the appropriate place for fixing the roof hook, fastened with two thin sheet metal screws, and then attach the carriage at different heights based on the roof batten height.
The system also includes colored cover plates in red, brown, or anthracite, reducing assembly time by up to 40%.
“There are countless different types of roof tiles on the European market,” said Albert Vonbun, a product manager for Aerocompact. “Until now, installers have had to cut them to size with an angle grinder for the PV mounting system to fit.”
Aerocompact said that the system has a patent-pending labyrinth-style seal, offering a permanent seal during installation without additional effort.
“Overall, we reduce assembly time by up to 40%,” said Vonbun.
