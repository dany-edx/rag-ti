The acquisition expands DroneBase’s footprint throughout the Asia Pacific (APAC) and Europe while bringing to it the advantage of AirProbe’s proprietary Artificial Intelligence solution for aerial solar inspections and proprietary data analytics.
The AirProbe solution reduces the time needed to analyze aerial inspection data of solar energy systems by up to 50%. This enables solar owners, operators, and financiers to more quickly take action to fix high-value anomalies and defects to increase energy generation and improve system ROI.
AirProbe has inspected about 22+GWp assets globally, including rooftops and ultra MWp solar parks. It has a cumulative 5 GW of solar assets in India. This includes about 80% of solar assets in Bhadla (Rajasthan), 75% of assets in Pavagada (Karnataka), and 70% of Anantapuram (Andhra Pradesh).
“As both the number and size of solar energy systems deployed grow exponentially, inspecting and maintaining millions of systems will become more critical and more complex,” said Dan Burton, CEO of DroneBase. “DroneBase solved how to scale solar energy inspections and data capture and AirProbe solved how to scale solar data analysis with AI: together our solution is truly unbeatable.”
“India and the APAC region are growing markets for the renewable energy industry. With AirProbe, we have added the most-forward thinking aerial analytics developer and disciplined operator throughout APAC and EMEA.”
With the use of the technology, the asset owners are able to reduce their dependence on certain activities which were earlier being performed manually. For instance, using AI and drone inspections for construction monitoring, the owner is now able to visualize the project site and monitor the progress remotely with a high degree of accuracy. This delivers better insights, enabling improved efficiency, productivity, and informed decision-making based on practical conditions.
“Our mission at AirProbe has been to increase the adoption, reliability, and efficiency of solar energy systems by developing the best AI-enabled software solution. That aligns perfectly with DroneBase’s mission to continually deliver the best, actionable intelligence so that solar energy system operators and financiers can deliver more clean energy and grow their bottom line at the same time,” said Aditya Bhat, founder of AirProbe. 
Bhat will be based in Bangalore, India, and oversee operations in the APAC market.   
The terms of the acquisition deal were not disclosed. With the acquisition, DroneBase adds another 22 GW of solar energy systems under inspection, bringing the DroneBase total to more than 59 GW of both wind and solar energy assets under inspection. By the end of 2022, DroneBase expects to reach a processing capacity of 140 GW solar and wind energy annually.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/15/microgrids-make-sense-for-indian-cities/,"DISTRIBUTED SOLAR,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDIA",,"DECEMBER 15, 2021",Microgrids make sense for Indian cities,"Microgrids have traditionally been used in India to provide reliable access to remote off-grid rural communities. Urban areas, on the other hand, may not seem like likely candidates for microgrids as they tend to be well connected to the grid. However, urban areas can face routine power outages as well as impacts from extreme weather-related events and other externalities.
For instance, advanced electricity systems in countries like Singapore and Japan face less than five minutes a year of outages. In contrast, some Indian cities with the best grid service, like Mumbai and Delhi, can face annual outages ranging from under 20 minutes to under 20 hours respectively. This can go up to several days in a year in some other Indian cities.
These outages can be longer in cases where climate change induced extreme weather events ravage power systems, with electricity distribution being the most vulnerable part of the system. For instance, the infamous 2018 floods in Kerala and Cyclone Fani in 2019 that struck eastern India led to large scale destruction of electricity distribution infrastructure, leaving entire communities without access to electricity or telecom services.
Unreliable access to electricity can impose social and economic losses and increase vulnerabilities across different sections of society. Depending on diesel generators is not a great solution, as diesel is not only prone to disruption in supply itself, but it also compromises local air quality. Diesel-based electricity systems are also vulnerable to the cost of diesel, which has doubled over the past decade.
Therefore, microgrids can play an important part of a reliable urban electricity system. Microgrids with battery storage are distributed energy resources (DERs) that hold potential as an important infrastructure lever for bringing resilience benefits to the grid and playing a key role in envisioning the future of grid modernization.
Microgrids can make the electricity system nimbler and more robust in the face of disruptions. Their ability to function in “island mode” using sensors, controllers, and active management software ensures that power supply is maintained independent of the main grid even in event of disruptions. They also reduce reliance on transmission lines that are vulnerable to unmanaged vegetation and extreme weather. In addition, they provide flexibility to the grid during day-to-day operations. For example, microgrids that use on-site renewables such as rooftop solar can help relieve peak demand on the grid during afternoons, and later in the evenings through battery storage. This can help power distribution companies (discoms) avoid buying expensive power to meet peak demand.
These attributes help microgrids provide resiliency services to communities as well. As a region severely prone to destructive hurricanes, the Caribbean islands are a great example to showcase the vulnerability of power systems to extreme weather events, as well as the role that DERs can play in making that system more resilient and robust. After Hurricane Irma in 2017 devastated the electricity systems for many islands, the islands of Barbuda and Puerto Rico, among others, decided to rebuild their power systems by leveraging microgrids powered by renewables and batteries, as well as improved efficiency. Multiple microgrids that are interconnected can help tide over the risks that a centralized grid faces in extreme weather events.
Some additional ways in which microgrids complement the main grid are shown in the figure below.

 
Urban microgrids may not face many of the challenges that microgrid developers in remote areas tend to face. These include high capital cost and the cost of wiring and setting up of meters combined with low household electricity consumption that may not be able to pay for it. The rapid penetration and growth in electricity consumption in urban areas, as well as their dense nature, hold the potential to drive down these concerns. That being said, microgrids can increase electricity costs initially and hence challenge the benefits of high-quality and reliable electricity in urban areas as well.
Secondly, microgrids are conventionally associated with a risk of stranded assets once the central power grid arrives. However, in urban areas, microgrids would emerge most likely alongside the existing grids, with the main value proposition being improved quality, flexibility, and therefore, resilience of supply. This calls for innovation in business models to support microgrid proliferation. Policy should take cognizance of either discoms owning the microgrids, or of microgrid owners being able to sell the asset or electricity to the discom and continue operations, similar to the provisions in some state minigrid policies like that of Bihar.
A change in the technological and logistical setup in the power supply system will require a changed support ecosystem as well. Operations and maintenance costs for microgrids may be high because of a lack of trained technicians. Another challenge to consider is whether urban microgrids are covered under central government policies.
The government has taken introductory steps towards encouraging microgrids with the draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2021. NEP 2021 includes aspects that promote the use of minigrids powered by renewable energy and calls for enabling islanding of the system into microgrid and balancing electricity using storage, etc. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has drafted ancillary services market regulations that allow energy storage and demand response to participate in the market. This, along with draft NEP 2021’s call for distribution service aggregators, potentially makes DERs more viable, and consequently contributes positively to resilience building.
Another possibility that opens up with higher incidence of microgrids is that of creation of energy communities and scaling up peer to peer (P2P) trading, turning entire communities of consumers into prosumers. For example, some communities in countries like Australia, the UK, and the United States have been piloting blockchain microgrids that allow P2P trading at a neighbourhood level, creating a marketplace for transactions within virtual or physical microgrids. This is expected to unlock savings for consumers and improve grid resilience.
An interactive and decentralized microgrid that supports the larger power grid while integrating greater renewable energy has potential to make the sum greater than its individual parts. Transitioning towards this paradigm of flexibility, security, and resilience in the power grid will require upgrades in the policy and regulatory environment as well as business models for microgrids to attain scale. Yet this is critical work if we want to ensure reliable electricity for all.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/15/rays-power-infra-to-build-500-mw-solar-park-in-rajasthan/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,RAJASTHAN",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 15, 2021",Rays Power Infra to build 500 MW solar park in Rajasthan,"Rays Power Infra, a Rajasthan-headquartered engineering, procurement, and construction company, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Rajasthan government to build a solar park for generating 500 MW of green electricity in the State. The agreement was finalized during the ongoing Dubai Expo.
Rays Power Infra has 1 GW of the commissioned solar portfolio. Apart from the proposed 500 MW in Rajasthan, the company is constructing 500 MW of solar energy capacity in other States which is likely to come online in the next nine months. This will meet up to 50% of the power requirement for corporate customers and 50% for utility projects. 
Speaking on the latest development, Pawan Sharma, Director- Rays Power Infra said, “Rays Power Infra was constituted to promote cleaner, greener, and better environmental conditions. On the back of extensive research and development, testing and commissioning, we have established best-in-class solar projects at par with global standards in India and abroad. We are thrilled that the Rajasthan government decided to support our vision and signed an agreement to build a 500 MW Solar Park in the state. This MoU is an instrumental step towards eco-friendly tomorrow, and we are pleased to be a part of this initiative.”
The company also has global roots in Vietnam and Bangladesh, where it has recently installed large-scale solar projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/12/15/solar-remains-energy-of-choice-for-lenders/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,RENEWABLES,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"DECEMBER 15, 2021",Solar remains energy of choice for lenders,"A total of INR 24,376 crore (US$ 3,240 million) went to renewables projects in 2020, all of which were solar and wind. This is a 6% year-on-year increase from 2019. Solar PV accounted for 81% of renewable energy deals and 57% of all deals, finds the fourth edition of Coal vs Renewable Financial Analysis, authored by Climate Trends and Centre for Financial Accountability (CFA). 
This analysis assessed 42 project finance loans across 38 coal and renewable energy projects in India that reached a financial close between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Renewable energy projects are defined as either hydroelectric, geothermal, wave, wind, or solar power projects. Total capacity across all coal and renewable projects identified was 7.5 GW.
The report said total lending to renewables and coal energy projects amounted to INR 32,897 crore (US$ 4,435 million). Renewable energy projects, with INR 24,376 crore (US$ 3,240 million), accounted for the majority share of 74%. 
Solar remained the renewable energy of choice, accounting for 31 of the 37 RE deals. These financed a cumulative 5.18 GW of solar PV.
The States of Rajasthan and Gujarat attracted INR 18,671 crore (US$ 2,507 million), or 77% of all renewable energy loans. Meanwhile, Bihar, for the second consecutive time, received funding for a new coal project.
The report stated State Bank of India was the leading financier of renewable energy projects in 2020. Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC), and its subsidiary REC, were the sole state-owned financial institutions that provided project financing to coal power projects in 2020, finds the report. 
Lending to coal remains depressed
The report stated 2020 marked a slight increase in coal funding after two years of consecutive decline. However, this is still over 85% lower than the INR 60,767 crore (US$ 9,350 million) in 2017. 
“India’s funding trends are in line with what we are seeing globally. Finance for new coal projects has increasingly been withdrawn with international institutions moving away from funding coal fearing reputational, economic, and fiduciary risk. Federal Bank, India’s 7th largest commercial bank, announced a coal exit policy this year becoming India’s first bank to do so. PFC should follow in the footsteps of its private sector peers, move away from coal and towards renewable energy projects”, Joe Athialy, Executive Director, Centre for Financial Accountability. 
Primary financing to renewable energy projects in 2020 saw an 11% year-on-year increase. SBI’s project finance loans to renewable energy projects in 2020 increased by a massive 334% compared to 2019. PFC provided INR 2,160 crore (US$ 289 million) in project finance loans to renewable energy projects in 2020, which is about 60% of project finance it provided to coal projects. 
“Analysis shows that India needs an investment of around 38 lakh crores or US$ 500 billion in this decade to reach its 450 GW of renewable energy goal. For this to happen, not just international funds, domestic financial institutions must also chip in. PFC and REC seem to be funding more coal than renewable energy, which is not in line with the Central government’s stated objectives, including the commitments to phase down coal and turn to net-zero emissions in the long term. As renewables turn cheaper and easier to build, traditional institutions will realize that it is counterintuitive to keep funding more coal projects” Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends.
“It is encouraging to see fewer financiers for coal every year. Given the pace of transition, it will be of utmost importance for policymakers and the government to ensure the millions of individuals who are dependent on coal for their livelihood are taken along and that the transition is just” Dr. Sudhir Chella Rajan, Professor, Indo German Centre for Sustainability, IIT-Madras.
