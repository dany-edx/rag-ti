The projects are intended to be developed by NTPC Limited through its wholly-owned Subsidiary NTPC Renewable Energy Limited.
The projects shall be a hybrid of wind and solar power resources where the rated power capacity of one resource (wind or solar) shall be at least 33% of the total offered hybrid project capacity. The offered project can be connected to a single injection point or separate injection points on ISTS network.
The minimum project capacity (a hybrid of wind and solar PV) at a single location shall be 50 MW, increasing in multiples of 10 MW.
The work scope for the solar power project includes design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection, testing, commissioning, and operation and maintenance of the complete solar plant, including switchyard and power evacuation system, till interconnecting ISTS substation for three years from the date of successful completion of trial run.
The EPC provider shall acquire the required land for the offered solar project as per the prevailing government rules and arrange transfer of the title/lease of the land in favor of NTPC.
The solar plant is to be set up under Open category, allowing PV modules and cells of any origin.

Norwegian solar manufacturer REC Group has unveiled a new black solar module series for rooftop applications that is based on gapless technology, which raises the density of panels by eliminating the empty spaces between the cells.
The REC Alpha Pure Black Series is available in five versions with power ratings ranging from 385 to 405 W, and efficiency ranging from 20.8% to 21.9%.
The new product is made with 132 heterojunction, half-cut monocrystalline cells and its maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The open-circuit voltage is between 48.5 V and 48.91 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 10.10 A to 10.30 A.  All five versions of the module measure 1,821×1,016×30mm and weigh 20.5kg.
The panel can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius and their operating temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius. It is enclosed between 3.2mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, and also features a junction box with an IP 68 rating.
The manufacturer offers a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. It said the module series is eligible for the premium REC ProTrust warranty package, which offers up to 25 years coverage on product, performance and labor, with guaranteed power of at least 92% in year 25 of operation.
“Because aesthetics play a role in rooftop solar applications, this gapless layout combined with a black backsheet gives the REC Alpha Pure BlackSeriesa seamless appearance, which alongside its lead–free construction and high power, makes it a compelling solar panel choice for both residential and commercial rooftops,” REC explained.
The panels are manufactured at the company’s manufacturing facility in Singapore.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/04/27/premji-backed-indian-firm-to-make-solar-glass/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOLAR GLASS,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"APRIL 27, 2021",Premji-backed Indian firm to make solar glass,"New Delhi-headquartered Gold Plus Glass Industry (Gold Plus), India’s second-largest float glass manufacturer, is foraying into solar glass manufacturing. 
Speaking to pv magazine, Vivek Dubey, whole-time director, said Gold Plus Glass Industry would set up a solar glass factory in South India. The plant will have a capacity of 300 tonnes per day (tpd), and will be operational by September 2023.
Gold Plus Glass Industry is already in discussion with government authorities of at least two Southern states for land allotment and capital/revenue subsidies. The company is likely to finalize the state and the land parcel in the next 3-4 weeks.
The plant shall produce extra clear, textured glass with an anti-reflective coating. Thickness will range from 2 mm to 6 mm (including 3.2mm).
“The plant will be able to provide the complete range of glass required for solar PV modules, including 2 mm tempered solar glass,” Dubey told pv magazine.
At present, Dubey said, the idea is to meet domestic demand, but [the company] will also be ready to explore some export opportunities.
Currently, Borosil Renewables is the only solar glass manufacturer in the country. It has a factory at Bharuch in Gujarat, meeting about 40% of India’s solar glass requirement. Imports meet the balance of demand.
With an expansive solar energy target laid out by the Government, Gold Plus’ move to enter solar glass manufacturing should be welcomed by PV panel manufacturers, which are also in the process of expanding their own capacities. 
Solar energy is on Government’s top agenda, and recently the cabinet approved production-linked incentives for PV penal manufacturing to promote domestic manufacturing of panels.
Gold Plus is looking to fund the expansion through a mix of internal accruals, equity raise, and debt. KPMG has been appointed to assist the Company in the fund raise. The company is already backed by Azim Premji’s Investment arm,  Premji Invest, which invested INR 400 crore in 2018.
