A group of scientists from the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences designed a prototype of a solar photovoltaic tree that purportedly offers an optimal balance between energy production and thermal management.
The key feature of the system is a larger distance between the solar modules compared to conventional solar tree designs. This approach is intended to reduce shading losses between the panels while improving cooling and heat dissipation.
The prototype has a total diameter of 660 mm and relies on solar modules based on cells provided by Shenzhen Xiangxinrui Solar Energy Co., Ltd. China. Each panel has a size of 180 mm x 60 mm x 3 mm and an efficiency of 22%.  The solar tree also relies on a stem measuring 1800 mm in height and a flat wooden sheet segmented into fifteen branches.
In order to validate the proposed design, the scientists compared its performance with that of a flat PV system with the same characteristics. “Both the solar tree and the flat module were integrated and configured within the same electrical circuit, featuring six rings connected in parallel,” the scientists explained. “Each ring consisted of three modules connected in series, resulting in a total of eighteen PV modules.”
Both the solar tree and the flat PV system were tested with a south orientation and tilt angles of 20, 30 and 45 degrees.
The tests revealed that with the 45-degree angle the solar tree recorded a maximum temperature of 38.05 C and the flat system had 49.8 C. As a result, the solar tree configuration yielded a maximum power output of 14.54 W, while the flat system produced 11.8 W.
Under the 30-degree tilt angle configuration, the flat system reached a temperature of 51.3 C and the solar tree reached 40.75 C. The latter achieved a maximum power output of 13.84 W, compared to 11.05 W for the flat system. With the 20-degree tilt angle, the solar tree reached a maximum temperature of 33.95 C and the flat system of 43.86 C. The former produced 14.05 W and the latter 11.4 W.

“Empirical results indicate that the flat PV module’s temperature exceeds the solar tree’s by over 10 C, owing to the less efficient convective heat transfer,” the academics stated, adding that the temperatures of the ground shaded by the solar tree were reduced by 3–7 C compared to the unshaded ground. “The efficiency of the solar module configuration proposed herein witnessed an increment of 16–23 % relative to the flat module.”
The researchers also observed that the solar tree offers a land footprint reduction of 96 % compared with the conventional PV systems.
“An examination of the ground footprint revealed that the sunflower PV module afforded 85 % land savings relative to the flat PV module,” they stated. “The area under the solar PV tree can be used for parking and agriculture purposes.”
Their findings were presented in the study “Sunflower solar tree vs. flat PV module: A comprehensive analysis of performance, efficiency, and land savings in urban solar integration,” published in Results in Engineering.
Researchers from the Korea Maritime Institute recently proposed the use of solar trees to build photovoltaic plants in mountainous forest areas in land-scarce South Korea. They defined the new concept as forest-photovoltaic and explained that it would both maintain carbon absorption activities under the solar trees and produce solar power on the upper part of forest land.
Other researchers from Amity University, Noida, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, recently developed four different designs for solar photovoltaic trees that purportedly require less physical space than conventional PV systems in urban environments.

Under the contract, it will supply domestic content requirement (DCR)-compliant PV modules (modules built with made-in-India cells) for NTPC’s Nokh Solar PV Project in Rajasthan.
NTPC, a public-sector undertaking owned by the Government of India, is India’s largest power utility with an installed capacity of 73,824 MW (including JVs), with plans to become a 130 GW company by 2032.
The NTPC order is valued at around INR 1,700 crore ($204.58 million). The module supply is expected to be completed in a span of nine months.
Premier Energies manufactures bifacial PV modules at its 40-acre state-of-the-art facility in Hyderabad. Its Hyderabad facility has an annual production capacity of 2 GW of solar cells and 4 GW of solar modules, with a further 1.6 GW under construction.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/09/make-pv-modules-as-cheap-as-possible-but-not-cheaper/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 9, 2024","Make PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper","The dream of solar cell and PV module manufacturing outside of Asia has become increasingly distant. A combination of falling PV module prices and China’s PV module manufacturers allegedly sitting on up to two months’ worth of stock is adding to the maelstrom. Plans for GW-scale PV cell and module production facilities in the US and Europe have been delayed or outright scrapped, and to make it worse, Western markets are accumulating inventories stocked with products purchased for double the current end-of-the-year market prices.
This solar storm is wreaking havoc on the industry, leading to cracked glass in modules and an even more fractured supply chain. In times like these, it could be best to reflect on words uttered by Albert Einstein, who once reportedly said, “Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler”. His argument, that an idea should be made as coherent as possible without being stripped of its meaning, could be applied to solar PV in this current market. Make PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper. Because with anything in life, there is a final price.
How did PV modules become so cheap?
Solar has become the most affordable and fastest-growing energy generation technology. It has surpassed all other renewable and conventional electricity generation technologies year-on-year since 2015. Part of its popularity is rooted in price, with each company being extremely price competitive due to a range of market factors and product improvements. This includes lower kerf losses, better cell packing in modules, less silver, thinner glass, thinner frames, larger modules, cheaper electricity and most importantly, companies flooding the market with products. Consumers buying cheaper decentralized solar rooftop PV systems or utility-scale installation technologies have reaped the rewards. But as time wears on, particularly for large-scale operators, fissures have emerged.
The price of cheap PV modules
Over the span of a decade, PV modules have almost doubled in size with thinner frames, thinner glass and shorter mounting rails. Half-cut cell modules now normally have three holes in the rear glass allowing them to bear a significant weight of the PV load. The shift occurred in 2017 when 2-millimeter-thick hardened (not fully-tempered) glass became cheaper than the PV module gold standard of 3.2-millimeter fully-tempered glass. Around the same time, utility-scale PV power plants began to use mainly bifacial, double-glass.
Nearly all large-scale PV plants today use bifacial, double-glass modules with 2-millimeter-thick glass at the front and rear. But utility-scale solar power plants installed in recent years, which rely on 2-millimeter double-glass PV modules, are reporting up to 10% breakage rates.
The cracks observed are causing warranty claims and contractual disputes costing money, time and integrity. This means that cheap PV is not only leading to worse outcomes for the energy consumer but is also fracturing the industry, impacting PV module and PV tracker suppliers, engineering, product and construction companies, and PV plant owners. This is the case for making PV modules as cheap as possible, but not cheaper.
