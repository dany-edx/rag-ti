The 550 Wp mono PERC module, launched under the GMF72HM10 series, is built with 144 half-cut cells. The open-circuit voltage is 49.99 V and the short-circuit current is 13.8 A. Temperature coefficient of Pmax is -0.38% per degree Celsius.
Grew GMF72HM10 series mono PERC modules are available in output ratings ranging from 520 W to 550 W.
The modules measure 2,278 mm x 1,134 mm x 35 mm/40mm and weigh 29±3% kg. These come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year linear performance warranty. The power output at the end of 30 years is guaranteed to be no less than 82.05% of the nominal output power.
Grew Energy has an exhaustive expansion & development plan in place for the coming two years. Its first manufacturing unit started operations in October 2023 at Jaipur, Rajasthan with annual capacity of manufacturing 1.2 GW PV modules. It is extending this capacity with a TopCon module production line with 1.6 GW annual capacity at the same location. By March 2025, Grew Energy will have established a cumulative 6 GW of manufacturing capacity with one unit of 2.8 GW in Dudu and another 3.2 GW unit in Dholera, Gujarat.
To support its plans for manufacturing solar PV modules and components, Grew plans to raise INR 6,000 crore ($724 million), out of which 60-65% will be through debt, promoter investment and $100 million through private funding.

Featuring a rated power capacity of 1 MW (expandable to 2 MW), the electrolyzer can produce 200 Nm3/hour of hydrogen.
L&T stated the electrolyzer is equipped with two stacks and an Electrolyzer Processing Unit (EPU) ML400, which is indigenously manufactured and assembled, adhering to the latest international standards. The electrolyzer is claimed to offer exceptional flexibility and thermal stability. It will put to rigorous testing in the coming weeks to optimize its performance, and in turn, paving the way for full-fledged manufacturing of electrolyzers.
L&T Electrolysers Ltd, a newly incorporated entity of L&T, is setting up a pressurized alkaline electrolyzer manufacturing facility with a capacity of 1 GW per annum. It will manufacture electrolyzers at this facility under a technology license from McPhy Energy, France.
The company has developed the complete value chain from engineering to manufacturing, in collaboration with Indian vendors and suppliers. It plans to leverage its upcoming giga-scale facility in Hazira to meet the growing demand for green hydrogen, maximizing product localization through enhanced local supply chain, and automation for cost-competitiveness.
L&T Electrolysers has been allocated 300 MW/annum electrolyzer capacity under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) of the National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched by Government of India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and implemented by the Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI).

According to new analysis by Wood Mackenzie, renewable energy costs were 13% cheaper than conventional coal last year and are expected to be 32% cheaper by 2030.
“Utility PV solar has emerged in 2023 as the cheapest power source in the region, while onshore wind is expected to become cheaper than coal after 2025,” said Alex Whitworth, vice president, head of Asia-Pacific power research at Wood Mackenzie. “Renewables firmed with battery storage is becoming competitive with gas power today but will struggle to compete with coal before 2030.”
Big PV emerged as the cheapest power source in 11 out of 15 countries in the Asia Pacific in 2023. According to WoodMac, PV power costs saw “a significant decline of 23% in 2023, marking the end of two years of supply chain disruptions and inflation.”
Looking ahead, Wood Mackenzie predicts that new-build solar project costs will drop by another 20% by 2030, driven by falling module prices and increasing oversupply from China.
Meanwhile, distributed solar costs fell 26% in 2023, with the technology now 12% cheaper on average than residential power prices. Wood Mackenzie said this creates large potential for more rooftop solar applications.
“This trend has made distributed solar increasingly attractive for end-users in many markets in Asia Pacific, with costs already 30% below rising residential tariffs in China and Australia,” said Sooraj Narayan, senior research analyst, APAC power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie. “However, some markets like India with subsidised residential power tariffs will need to wait until 2030 or later to achieve competitive distributed solar prices.”
Overall, China is leading the way in bringing down the cost of renewables, with utility-scale PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind being 40% to 70% cheaper when compared to other Asia-Pacific markets.
Concerns about profitability, grid integration, backup, and energy storage persist among investors, even though declining costs are supporting investment in renewables.
“Government policies will play a crucial role going forward to support upgrading grid reliability, transmission capacity, and promoting battery storage to manage the intermittent nature of renewables,” said Whitworth.
In December, Ernst & Young said in a report that the global weighted average LCOE for PV is now 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative.
Earlier this year, Wood Mackenzie predicted strong yet flat global PV growth through to 2032. It estimated that around 350 GW of global solar will be annually installed for the next eight years.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/03/01/polysilicon-shipments-into-china-fall-to-lowest-level-since-2011/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-03-01,Polysilicon shipments into China fall to lowest level since 2011,"From pv magazine Global
Polysilicon imports into China have fallen to their lowest level since 2011, according to analysis from Bernreuter Research.
The research group used Chinese customs statistics to calculate that imports of the feedstock for solar cells and semiconductors fell by 28.5% from 88,093 metric tons (MT) in 2022 to 62,965 MT in 2023. This volume is slightly less than the 64,614 MT reached in 2011.
According to the head of Bernreuter Research, Johannes Bernreuter, the decline comes as leading non-Chinese polysilicon manufacturers Wacker, Hemlock Semiconductor, and OCI Malaysia increasingly shift their shipments from China to Vietnam, which is where three of the four largest Chinese PV module suppliers have set up wafer plants.
The three companies increased their polysilicon exports to Vietnam from 18,672 MT in 2022 to 33,265 MT in 2023, up 78.2% year on year. Bernreuter Research says this increase “more than compensated” for the 13,918 MT they lost in business volume in China in 2023.
The shift appears influenced by US import legislation. From June 6, the US Department of Commerce will impose duties on manufacturers in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam who use Chinese wafers to produce solar cells and modules, circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
Previously, the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which went into effect in mid-2022, banned products made in Xinjiang, China. This prompted Chinese PV module suppliers to create separate supply chains based on polysilicon from non-Chinese manufacturers for exports to the United States.
Bernreuter Research said that having a wafer production facility outside of China makes it easier for manufacturers to document to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency that no silicon metal or polysilicon from Xinjiang has entered their supply chains for modules destined for the US market. However, customs statistics show that polysilicon exports from China to Vietnam rose from 639 MT in 2022 to 4,970 MT in 2023 – an increase of more than 700%. Bernreuter Research said this “raises doubts about the claims of a separate supply chain and should sound alarm bells at the CBP.”
