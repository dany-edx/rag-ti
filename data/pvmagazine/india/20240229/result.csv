An international research team has proposed a novel photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) module design that purportedly reduces the risks of cracking in the panel’s PV unit.
“A critical issue for PVT collectors is cell cracking, mainly caused by thermal expansion during the heat transfer process between PV cells and the thermal absorber,” the group explained. “Due to the high temperatures, these expansions and contractions create small silicon cell flaws, which may result in numerous micro fractures/cracks. These cracks may cause the disconnection of cell parts, resulting in a reduction in the overall power generated by the PV modules.”
The scientists built a PVT module structure based on an aluminum alloy structure with an H-shaped pattern between the thermal absorber and the cells. Using the ANSYS software, they assembled a prototype based on a commercially available 44.2 W PVT module.
The new collector design was made up of the following components, from top to bottom: a transparent glass cover, a top ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) layer, a PV panel made of monocrystalline silicon cells connected in series, a bottom EVA layer, an H-pattern plate for thermal expansion, a thermal absorber that transfers heat to the heat transfer fluid, and an insulation layer.
“One of the main goals of this design was to allow thermal expansion in all directions (by expanding into its cavities), thus creating a smaller total expansion in any single direction, which in turn was expected to diminish the risk of cell cracking drastically,” explained the academics.
The research group simulated the H-shaped aluminum alloy pattern to have seven different widths, from one mm to seven mm, in addition to a plate design without the structure. “It is evident that the directional expansion values are lower for H-pattern expansion cavity dimensions of 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm compared to the plate with no cavity (0 mm),” they explained. “Beyond 4 mm, a notable increase in expansion is observed for the H-pattern plate with a 5 mm cavity dimension. Additionally, the expansion values for cavity dimensions of 6 and 7 mm are slightly less than 5 mm, but all surpass the H-pattern plate with no cavity.”
Overall, the simulation found the optimal design to be the one with 2 mm H dimensions, as it exhibited the lowest directional expansion of about 0.011 mm. Compared to a simulation of a reference PVT, which was the same commercially available module but without the Hs, the novel one reduced thermal expansion by 20%.
According to the researchers, the novel design reached a 10% increase in thermal efficiency. Electric efficiency was increased by 2%, and overall efficiency increased by 8%. “This study provides valuable insights into PVT collector design, offering a promising solution to the challenge of cell cracking,” the scientists concluded.
The novel module design was presented in the study “Mitigating PV cell cracking in solar photovoltaic thermal collectors with a novel H-pattern absorber design,” published in Applied Thermal Engineering. The research group was formed by scientists from the UK’s Kingston University and Cranfield University and Sweeden’s MG Sustainable Engineering and University of Gavle.

7,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/02/29/indonesian-government-abolishes-net-metering/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,ROOFTOP SOLAR,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-02-29,Indonesian government abolishes net metering,"From pv magazine Global
Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) has enacted MEMR Regulation No. 2/2024, which abolishes net metering for rooftop PV installations.
The country first introduced net metering in November 2018. It allowed solar project owners to export excess electricity to the grid, which is operated by state utility PT PLN, in order to reduce their electricity bills. Several improvements to the scheme have been enacted since the regulation’s inception.
The latest policy amendment, which went into force on Jan. 30, guarantees that customers who have already installed rooftop solar systems before this date remain bound by the previous regulation for the next 10 years.
Marlistya Citraningrum, program manager for the Jakarta-based Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR), told pv magazine that the 10-year rule will apply to projects that have been approved but not installed, as well as arrays that have already been approved and installed.
“As an on-grid rooftop PV user, I actually have questions about this transitional rule,” Citraningrum said. “considering that during installation, rooftop PV exports are still calculated as equivalent to 0.65 of the electricity tariff based on Permen ESDM No. 49/2018, not 1:1 like Permen ESDM No. 26/2021. This transitional rule needs to be clearly informed to current rooftop solar power users.”
The Institute for Essential Services Reform believes the loss of net-metering will “make it difficult” for Indonesia to achieve the government’s National Strategic Project target of 3.6 GW of rooftop solar by 2025 and a 23% renewable energy target set for the same year.
Fabby Tumiwa, the executive director of the Institute for Essential Services Reform, said that household or small business customers will delay the adoption of rooftop PV because their peak electricity demand occurs at night, while PV generates peak energy during the day. Tumiwa said that without net-metering, rooftop PV investment will become more expensive.
“Net metering is actually an incentive for household customers to use rooftop solar systems. With PLN’s controlled electricity tariffs, net-metering helps improve the economic viability of rooftop solar systems installed at a minimum capacity of 2 kWp to 3 kWp for R1 category consumers,” Tumiwa said. “Without net-metering and the relatively high cost of batteries, this minimum capacity cannot be met, resulting in higher investment costs per kilowatt-peak unit. This will reduce the economics of rooftop solar systems.”
Citraningrum told pv magazine that while no official explanation has been given for the change, it is “likely that financial constraints of PLN is one of the main reasons.” She said the end of net metering will not benefit residential and small business PV users, but will have little impact on commercial and industrial-scale PV users, as many of them do not export excess energy. Instead, she said she hopes the decision will “trigger more energy storage use and thus contribute to bringing the cost down.”
Figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that at the end of 2022, Indonesia had 291 MW of installed solar capacity.
