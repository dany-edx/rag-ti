IndiGrid said the total enterprise valuation, including net working capital and cash, will be INR 1,650 crore. Additionally, there will be an earn-out related to Change-In-Law (CIL) in basic customs duty (BCD) and goods and services tax (GST), to be paid to RSPPL as and when the first payment is realized.
In line with the terms of the definitive agreements and the power purchase agreement (PPA), along with the lock-in restrictions therein, IndiGrid will acquire 100% shareholding and management control of RSUPL, subject to requisite regulatory approvals.
RSUPL, located in Jaisalmer, has been operational since December 2021 and benefits from a 25-year PPA with Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) to sell power generated at a tariff of INR 2.71/kWh. In 2022-23, the solar project delivered a net PLF of 27.42%.
IndiGrid said the acquisition of this project fits well with their strategy of holding operational and revenue generating assets till maturity. For ReNew, the sale is aligned with its strategy to enhance shareholder value through capital recycling and investment into higher-return opportunities. After the transfer of the outstanding debt to the buyer, the transaction will result in a cash inflow of approximately $82 million, including change-in-law proceeds for ReNew.
RSUPL is a strategic addition to IndiGrid’s portfolio as it would be the largest capacity project located at a single site for the company. With this acquisition, IndiGrid’s peak solar capacity will cross 1 GW of operating solar assets and the total assets under management (AUM) of INR 285 billion.
Harsh Shah, chief executive officer, and whole time director of IndiGrid, said, “RSUPL is a high-quality solar generation asset located in one of the highest irradiation regions of India with reasonable operating track record. In-line with our strategic focus, RSUPL will help us ensure sustainable growth of our portfolio and aid in long-term cash-flow addition.”
During the first nine months of this fiscal, IndiGrid has done equity fund raising to the tune of INR 1,050 crore through preferential allotment and institutional placement. This has paved growth headroom for the company of INR 6,000 – 7,000 crore at a leverage threshold of 70% as per SEBI InvIT Regulations.
IndiGrid stated, the [300 MW asset] acquisition will be funded through a combination of equity, internal accruals, and debt. The net debt/AUM will be 62.5% post this acquisition, leaving adequate headroom for future growth

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/08/china-solar-cell-prices-decline-on-sluggish-downstream-demand/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 8, 2024",China solar cell prices decline on sluggish downstream demand,"From pv magazine Global
China cell prices decreased across the board as downstream demand remains sluggish. Monocrystalline PERC M10 and G12 cell prices were assessed at $0.0452/W and $0.0462/W respectively, down 6.61% and 20.89% from their last 2023 assessment on Dec. 12. TOPCon M10 cells also declined this week, falling 4.26% to $0.0584/W.
Cell producers have adjusted their operating rates to correspond to that of module factories downstream, which are expected to be less than 50% this December as this is currently the global off-season for solar installations, a solar market veteran said.

Cell makers no longer frequently receive PERC cell orders, and one major cell manufacturer has over 100 million pieces of PERC cells in stock, according to an upstream contact.
We may subsequently witness two scenarios in the cell market, the contact added. First, cell makers will concentrate on selling PERC M10 cells at a discount to clear their stocks. Second, demand downstream for n-type cells is anticipated to become mainstream soon in 2024.
TOPCon will continue to be their primary technical pathway in 2024, a major cell producer said. But as customer expectations for cell sizes have become increasingly varied, with growing demand for G12 and rectangular cells for example, 2024 may see cell makers continually alter production output for different-sized cells to suit client needs, the producer said.
Perhaps surprisingly, there is market chatter about an impending price hike for PERC cells. A slight and temporary price increase may occur when PERC cell inventories are successfully cleaned out amid low cell operating rates and several manufacturers notably reducing PERC cell production lines, a downstream contact said.
According to a market expert, PERC cells have reached their development limit as their efficiency can be improved no further. Subsequently, cell manufacturers may concentrate on enhancing and expanding the production capacity, efficiency and manufacturing yield of n-type cells, the expert said.

Undisclosed PV manufacturers can use specific patented TOPCon technologies from JinkoSolar by paying licensing fees. The company has not disclosed any details regarding the fees or the products, but it claims ownership of 330 TOPCon technology patents.
“This IP transaction between JinkoSolar and Licensee is a strategic win-win move by both companies, potentially strengthening the respective positions of the two companies in the markets,” JinkoSolar said in a statement.
Various high-tech industries engage in patent transactions to foster innovation, collaboration, and prevent legal disputes, so JinkoSolar’s move is not exclusive to the PV sector.
