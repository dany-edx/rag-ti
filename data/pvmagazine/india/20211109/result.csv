The EV charging infrastructure, with over 150 charging points, is spread across key locations in Bengaluru: BTM Layout, Kudlu, Jigani, Vijaya Bank Layout, Yeshwantpura, and Mahadevapura. It is synced with the Magenta ChargeGrid Smart app (Available on IOS and Android), enabling EV owners to check the real-time availability of EV charging stations and book slots and fleet operators to pay for EV charging points online. 
The Magenta EV charging hubs are equipped with a control panel for the fleet operators to manage and supervise the state of charging, charging schedule, and vehicle service schedule. These are developed focusing on the ease of use for fleet drivers and operators. Salient features include on-the-go charging on a 24×7 basis, overnight secure parking, maintenance and servicing of the vehicles while vehicles are being charged, and rest areas for the drivers. The charging hubs are equipped with EV chargers developed in line with Indian usage conditions.
Maxson Lewis, founder and managing director, Magenta, said, “e-Commerce companies are driving the commitment for electric vehicles in the last-mile delivery space. EV charging hubs play a key role in the success of the fleet business and operational efficiency. Our charging hubs at Bengaluru are planned in a 3 km radius around the e-commerce hubs and warehouses stretching to the outskirts of the city to Bengaluru Electronic city. The idea is to create the charging infrastructure in areas with the highest density of last-mile distribution hubs and enable seamless operations. These charging hubs have been developed with the EV fleet drivers in mind.”
Going forward, Magenta ChargeGrid plans to install nine more charging hubs by the year-end. It has partnered with several leading logistics and e-commerce companies like Amazon India, Porter, Udaan, BigBasket, and JumboTail for third-party last-mile logistics services.

The DRC will look into developers’ time extension requirements due to temporary disruptions in the supply of imported solar PV modules caused by factors such as Covid wave. 
The MNRE directive will apply to projects under implementation through MNRE’s renewable energy implementing agencies such as the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), NTPC, and NHPC and having scheduled commissioning date before April 1, 2022, after considering all time extensions including the extensions given on Covid-19, and considering the scheduled date of basic customs duty (BCD) imposition on the import of solar cells and modules as April 1, 2022. 
Notably, solar developers had approached the ministry seeking extension in project commissioning timelines and postponement of the BCD imposition on solar cell and module imports citing temporary disruptions in supply of imported solar PV modules on account of various factors. 
Having examined the issue, MNRE noted that generally, the procurement of solar PV modules for the solar power project takes place only in the last few months of commissioning and so only the projects scheduled for commissioning in the coming 5-6 months are likely to get affected due to this temporary situation. It also noted that to facilitate renewable energy (RE) projects, time extensions on account of the first and second waves of Covid-19 were already granted. 
As per the present provisions of the dispute resolution mechanism, the RE developer first approaches the concerned renewable energy implementing agency (SECI, NTPC, or NHPC) for seeking the desired relief. In case the applicant developer is not in agreement with the decision of REIA on the relief sought, the developer has the option of approaching DRC by filing an appeal within 21 days of REIA’s order.

In such a scenario, the importance of the green building concept gains prime importance and has been fairly well understood by the Government. 
Strong government support and the increasingly opportune economic situation have pushed India to be one of the top leaders in the world’s most attractive renewable energy markets. The government has designed policies, programs, and a liberal environment to attract foreign investments to ramp up the country in the renewable energy market at a rapid rate. 
However, to achieve the government’s ambitious renewable energy targets, and integrate two growing sectors of infrastructure and construction and renewable energy, the existing policies and codes or rule books like the National Building Code of India (NBC), Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), and Eco Niwas Samhita (ENS) need to be further enhanced. 
For example, ECBC says, “All buildings shall have provisions for installation of renewable energy systems in the future on rooftops or the site.”
These are very basic and general guidelines for efficient energy usage. It is urgent and imperative that not only should we adopt policies requiring all existing buildings as well as new construction to meet green building criteria but also put in place relevant laws and regulations for effective implementation of those policies. 
Also, with reference to using RE in the building sector, most of these Rules need specific details about energy generation. Right now, it is more to do with energy efficiency.
Like all other technologies, the practical installation of solar energy for buildings also has its share of challenges. To name a few are:
BIPV for building envelopes is a new Innovative technology, which, if incorporated at the initial design stage of a building, can fetch long-term benefits. The application of transparent PV glass panels for facades and skylights is still at a very nascent stage in India and has huge potential. 
By opting for products like Power Glass, one can get all the benefits of conventional glass and in addition to electricity generation. Some of the benefits of such BIPVs are:
And that’s why we say that way forward is to move from “energy-efficient buildings” to “energy-generating buildings.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/09/end-of-life-management-of-solar-pv-waste-in-india/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,PROCUREMENT,RECYCLING,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",End-of-life management of solar PV waste in India,"A new study on end-of-life (EOL) solar PV waste management in India makes PV manufacturers accountable for recycling and recovering the materials at the EOL stage and ensuring their optimum utilization management while advocating participation of all stakeholders to manage this emerging waste stream.
The study proposes an ‘extended producer responsibility’ (EPR) based regulatory framework for efficient and regularised management of India’s EOL solar PV modules after comprehensively evaluating the regulatory strategies adopted by the developed counterparts of the world. The EPR concept, as practiced in Europe, makes producers responsible for developing an efficient take-back system, i.e., collection, storage, transport, recycling, recovery, reclamation, and destruction of solar PVs. 
The study was done by Suresh Jain and Tanya Sharma, both from the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati, along with Anil Kumar Gupta from the National Institute of Disaster Management (under the Ministry of Home Affairs, the government of India).
Around 2.95 billion tons of solar power material (including PVs and balance-of-systems) is estimated to enter India’s electronic-waste stream by 2047, based on an expectation the nation will have deployed 347.5 GW of solar panels by the end of this decade. Given that, EOL solar PV waste management would become an imminent danger for India, requiring a strategic approach for its management.
The study says at present, solar power waste management is a neglected sector in India and follows an unregularised, unscientific and informal approach. Solar waste is currently regarded as general electronic waste under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. There is no mention of solar PVs as a potential waste stream in the E-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 and Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016. 
Further, the presence of an informal and illegal sector for managing the e-waste take-back system in India hampers circularity and requires regulation. 
Thus, there is very significant scope for the development of a regularised policy approach to managing this emerging waste stream, which can lead to long-term environmental benefits and the reduction of the resource scarcity challenges of the country, states the study.
The proposed framework provides for a multi-sector and multistakeholder approach for solar PV waste management by advocating the constitution of two committees: a technical and regulatory committee and an executive management committee. 
The technical and regulatory committee, comprising representatives from relevant central ministries and departments, would be responsible for developing policies in consultation with different partner states to regulate the EOL management of solar PV waste. It would be accountable for ensuring the implementation and functioning of the framework to reduce EOL solar PV waste.
The management committee, constituted either by the PV manufacturers themselves or as a public-private partnership organization comprising manufacturers and the government representatives, will work under the technical and regulatory committee on the execution of EPR. It will be responsible for managing the solar PVs that reach their EOL stage, including collection, storage, transport, recovery, reclamation of PVs from the source, as well as their destruction. The committee will be accountable for repurchasing solar PV modules and developing the transportation systems between end-users and EOL management units for the solar PVs.
The manufacturers would be responsible for financing, reporting, and information sharing with the two committees as in the WEEE directives adopted by the EU for solar PV waste management at EOL. The financing of the entire system would be borne by the management committee, being the extended hand of the manufacturers and importers of solar PV modules in India.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/09/solar-tile-with-anti-glare-coating-from-switzerland/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",Solar tile with anti-glare coating from Switzerland,"From pv magazine International
Swiss manufacturer Megasol launched, last year, a photovoltaic tile that is claimed to be compatible with a wide range of roof tiles.
Megasol is offering three standard formats that can be combined with one another, as required. “Compatible means that a ‘Match’ solar module can replace one or more tiles in an existing tiled roof without any further adjustments,” explained Michael Reist, marketing manager at Megasol, to pv magazine.
The solar tile is not only compatible with the most common roof tiles, it is also available in different colors. The Full Black and Terra Cotta variants have proven to be popular optics and other individual colors could also be created. According to the manufacturer, the photovoltaic roof tiles could be freely designed for any architecture.
“It is also possible to give the Match solar modules an individual look using glass structures,” Reist explained. “Classic solar glasses or, for example, the Creek, Diamond, River or Wave glass surfaces can be used.” For this, Megasol was also awarded the international Red Dot Award design prize this year.
The photovoltaic roof tile is also suitable for various roof shapes. In addition to being used on tiled roofs, it can also be combined with clapboard-like roofs such as fiber cement shingles.
One reason why photovoltaic roof tiles are still more of a niche product is that their energy conversion performance is rather lower and, at the same time, they have higher costs compared to conventional rooftop panels. But technological advances do not stop at solar roof tiles either. According to Megasol, Match consists of glass-glass modules which also work as the roof tiles. The product works without an aluminum frame or plastic housing. Since there are several standard formats for each type of tile, the performance of the photovoltaic roof tiles also varies accordingly. According to Megasol, the two standard products have a power output of 22 and 55 W and its most-power product reaches 99 W. With the colored variations, performance losses are normal, but these also showed “good performance values,” the manufacturer continues.
In addition, the photovoltaic roof tiles have a high load-bearing capacity and resistance to hail protection. The Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer assumes a service life of up to 50 years and offers guarantees for up to 35 years.
The system consists of two components: the glass-glass solar module and a mounting hook. According to Megasol, the photovoltaic roof tile is also suitable for integration into existing tile roofs and the existing roof battens can be used. Each individual module has a plus and minus connector. With the long cables, the photovoltaic roof tile Match can be wired both horizontally and vertically, as the provider explained. The simple structure also allows a simple replacement if a photovoltaic roof tile is damaged.
The watt-peak prices for in-roof solar modules are higher than those of conventional panels but, at the same time, the photovoltaic tile also has a roof function. “With Match, not only a photovoltaic system but also a new roof is installed,” Reist went on to say. “If the costs for a new roof covering are deducted from a Match roof, the result is more or less the costs of a rooftop PV system.” If the longer service life of the glass-glass solar modules is also taken into account, compared to the use of glass-foil solar modules in conventional roof systems, the costs for a Match system over the operating time could be even cheaper.

In the recent past, Megasol has taken on yet another topic which is a big issue for many operators of photovoltaic systems – or rather their neighbors: the glare effect of solar modules. Objectively speaking, the actual glare effect of solar modules is significantly lower than that of large window fronts or skylights, according to the Swiss photovoltaic manufacturer, due to the solar glass used. However, the subjective perception of glare effects caused by solar modules is sometimes different. This is why the manufacturer developed the ZeroReflect surface which is claimed to have zero glare.
Megasol developed this special surface coating independently of its photovoltaic roof tiles. “Existing solar systems can also be equipped with ZeroReflect. The costs incurred can be many times lower than the potential expenses for anti-glare reports, court hearings, or even just for lengthy discussions in a possible neighborhood dispute,” said Reist.
*The article was amended on November 8 to reflect that the manufacturer’s name is Megasol, and not Megasolar as we previously reported.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/11/09/insolight-unveils-20-1-efficient-translucent-photovoltaic-panel-for-agrivoltaics/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",Insolight unveils 20.1%-efficient translucent photovoltaic panel for agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine International
Swiss startup Insolight – founded by three researchers from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne – recently developed a new photovoltaic module for agrivoltaics applications. This move represents a significant change in the company’s strategy, as it previously specialized in concentrating PV module technology.
“We move to crystalline silicon due to its lower costs,” R&D engineer Laetitia Anglade told pv magazine. “The basic structure of the module is the same as that of our previous product and we just switched from expensive III-V multi-junction solar cells to conventional monocrystalline PERC products.”
The “Theia” panel has a nominal power of 106 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.1%. For comparison, the CPV module previously developed by Insolight had a 30% efficiency and power output of 160 W.
The new product measures 1,141 mm x 595 mm x 50 mm and weighs in at 15 kg. The open-circuit voltage is 44.8 V and the short-circuit current is 3.0 A. Its frame is made of anodized aluminum alloy and its junction box has an IP 67 rating.
The panel can be used with operating temperatures between -40 C and 85 C. The power temperature coefficient is -0.32% per degree Celsius. The solar cells are covered with protective glass and optical lenses to concentrate and direct sunlight onto them at around two times the intensity of standard solar glass.
The module was recently deployed at a large–scale pilot facility in Valais, Switzerland. The project was developed by Insolight’s partners – Swiss research institute Agroscope and energy company Romande Energie. The agrivoltaics project occupies a surface of 165 m2, with the land used for to grow raspberries and strawberries under pots. With this configuration, the Theia modules, based on Insolight optical micro–tracking technology, purportedly offer dynamic light adjustment while ensuring steady solar power production.
“The pilot plant was developed to replace and improve the protection used over crops against weather conditions, while producing energy at the same time,” the three companies said in a joint statement. “It allows Agroscope to study the impact of light conditions on crop development.”
Agriscope will analyze the agronomic data to gauge the control algorithm of the photovoltaic modules, irrigation and nutrient supply.
“At the same time, Romande Energie will evaluate the solar electricity production of the installation during the four years of the project,” the consortium said.
