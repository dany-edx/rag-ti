Maxeon Solar Technologies has released its new Maxeon Air technology platform.
The company said the platform enables it to produce frameless, thin, lightweight and conformable solar panels with efficiency and performance ratings that are equivalent to standard solar panels. The platform is the result of five years of research, development and testing.
Maxeon said its new Air solar panels can be adhered directly to rooftops without the need for racking or other mounting systems. Because of their adhesive, lightweight nature, the technology will initially target installations on rooftops that are not engineered to support the weight of conventional solar systems. In Europe, where Maxeon Air will first launch, the company estimated an unserved annual market for low-load roofs of more than 4 GW.
The Air panels do not use metal frames and contain no glass, resulting in an install load of roughly 6 kg/m². The product essentially appears to be a solar panel sticker, with Maxeon saying that the integrated adhesive layer enables installation directly on the roof surface, without racking, anchors, or ballast. This will enable installation on uneven rooftops.
The company said that the cells within the panels include a solid metal foundation, along with stress-relieved cell interconnects. It said these will protect against corrosion and enable fault-tolerant circuits that allow energy flow, even with cracked cells. Additionally, the panels feature an efficiency rating of 20.9%, a low power-temperature coefficient, shade tolerance, wide spectral response, and hot-spot resistance.
The product will become widely available in the first quarter of 2022.

India scored 62.7 in solar attractiveness, with the sector expected to grow significantly and with generation from solar PV forecast to exceed coal before 2040. 
The EY Index lists the top 40 countries by renewable energy investment and deployment attractiveness. It considers individual categories of solar PV, solar CSP, on-shore wind, offshore wind, biomass, geothermal and hydro to arrive at the overall score for renewables.
For overall renewables, the USA remained the most attractive destination, followed by China. 
EY expects the USA to hold its top spot for renewables attractiveness under President Biden as it noted, “The reacceptance of the Paris Accord, coupled with the recent announcement to cut GHG levels by 50-52% as early as 2030 and achieve 100% carbon-free power by 2035, will likely see increased investment interest in the US.” 
China’s position was helped with the addition of 72.4 GW of new wind power in 2020 as developers rushed to beat an on-shore wind subsidy cut. 
India rose one place to rank third in the overall renewables rankings.
China and the USA also maintained their attractiveness for solar, ranking second (with a 60.3 score) and third (57.6), respectively. Australia ranked fourth (56.1), followed by Egypt (54.4) and Israel (53.9).
Egypt’s score was helped with the nation’s ambition to increase the supply of energy generated from renewable sources to 42% by 2035. Out of this, it intends solar PV to provide approximately 25%, on-shore wind 14% and hydropower 2%. 
The United Kingdom climbed up one place to rank fourth for renewables investment. The rise was driven by close to 8 GW of new offshore wind capacity allotted for development, and the government’s consent for the development of the largest battery-storage project and £92m in funding for innovative green technologies. 
France’s renewables ranking improved to fifth place from seventh last year.

State-owned power generators are required to develop this capacity on a build-own-operate basis either for self-consumption or use by other government entities. The solar electricity can be supplied to the beneficiary either directly or via power distribution companies on mutually agreed charges.
IREDA has increased the tariff ceiling to INR 2.45/kWh from INR 2.20 earlier. These charges shall be exclusive of any other third-party charges like wheeling and transmission charges and losses, point of connection charges and losses, cross-subsidy surcharges, etc.
The maximum permissible viability gap funding (VGF) for the projects, earlier fixed at INR 70 lakh per MW, has been reduced to INR 55 lakh per MW; the actual VGF to be given to the producer would be decided through a reverse auction using VGF amount as the bid parameter to select the solar developer.
Further, the commissioning timeline for the project is set as 30 months from the award of the project, irrespective of the capacity awarded to the developer.
Half the VGF support will be paid upon award of each engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract. The solar developer must sign the agreement with the EPC contractor within 12 months of the project award by IREDA.

A company spokesperson told pv magazine that the plant will produce hydrogen from seawater and will be powered by a 30 MW solar plant and a 20 MWh storage system with an autonomy of 4 hours.
The facility will be based on double-reverse osmosis treatment with energy recovery followed by electrolysis of deionized water through proton exchange membrane (PEM). Furthermore, secondary electrolysis of concentrated brine will be implemented by cell membrane electrolysis.
pv magazine has created a Hydrogen Hub to collect all the news and feature articles on the topic of green hydrogen, making it easy for you to stay up-to-date. As the industry develops, we will report on the most significant technological changes, co-location projects, and business models.
The main electrolyzer at the facility will have an installed capacity of 20 MW and an estimated production of 1,000 tons per year. The produced fuel will be then stored in trucks for pressurized gas at 400 bar pressure.
Hydrogen will be used as fuel for public transport at the port and urban cleaning vehicles in the city of Almería. It will also be utilized to feed the port’s unloading machinery, the national and international transport of goods, and part of the energy demand of local manufacturing industries.
The project has a required investment of €80.5 million euros and is scheduled to be built by the end of 2024. Gransolar confirms that it has the interest and commitment of the Almería City Council, as well as multiple companies from different professional sectors, without providing further details.
Almería will not be the only Andalusian port with plans to produce hydrogen. The Port of Malaga is also expected to host green hydrogen production through a project that also contemplates the use of artificial intelligence.
