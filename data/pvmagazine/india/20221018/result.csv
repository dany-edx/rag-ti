The Assembly was attended by ministers from 20 countries and delegates from across 110 member and signatory countries and 18 prospective countries.
“It is our mission that ISA can assist member countries in formulating and implementing solar-ready policies and regulatory development of national energy landscapes and for engaging with the public- and private-sector entities to leverage low-cost financing to achieve ISA’s solarization agenda,” said India’s power and new & renewable energy minister, RK Singh, who inaugurated the assembly in his capacity as the president. “The ISA is structured as an international resource hub with in-house technical expertise that will be readily accessible by member countries and is capable of guiding project implementation at scale.”
ISA is headquartered in India and works with governments to improve energy access and security worldwide. It promotes solar power as a sustainable way to transition to a carbon-neutral future.
ISA aims to unlock $1 trillion of solar power investments by 2030 in its member countries while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing. It promotes the use of solar energy in agriculture, health, transport, and power generation sectors.
The Co-President of the Assembly, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, France’s Minister of State for Development, Francophonie, and International Partnerships, said: “The International Solar Alliance, co-chaired by France and India, has grown into a global provider of tangible solutions to enable universal access to affordable solar power.”
The ISA Assembly approved Solar Facility, a payment guarantee mechanism to mitigate risks associated with solar projects in Africa. The solar facility comprises two financial components: Solar Payment Guarantee Fund and Solar Insurance Fund. It is expected to stimulate high-potential solar technologies by attracting private capital into underserved markets in Africa while ensuring a payment and insurance mechanism as a first-loss guarantee.
The ISA will soon operationalize the solar facility to crowdsource investments from various donors across the globe. The proposed projects in Africa will be able to purchase payment guarantees or partial insurance premiums from these funds.
Ajay Mathur, director general of ISA, said, “With the solar facility, ISA is looking to support projects by reducing lenders’ apprehensions and enabling finance to flow for projects that otherwise may not have received funding. The payment guarantee fund will only provide a partial guarantee. With minimal default, the guarantee fund would enable investments in geographies that do not receive investments. In addition, the Solar Insurance Fund will reduce the burden of insurance premiums for solar developers in the pre-revenue phase of the project. It will offset the cost of insurance for a specified period.”
The ISA Assembly also approved the SolarX Grand Challenge, which will focus on innovation in decentralized solar energy applications that contribute to livelihoods, such as agriculture, health, and small-scale industrial applications.

At this rate, annual EV charger sales will reach 0.9 million units by the year 2030, with almost 85% of those projected to be type-2 AC chargers—according to a new report by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA), an industry alliance on energy storage, e-mobility, and green Hydrogen. 
The report, titled “2022 India Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure & Battery Swapping Market Overview Report,” examines the current EV market and makes predictions by the segment on charger type. It considers three different market scenarios for the ensuing decade: worst case, business-as-usual, and national EV scenario. 
The EV charger market represents public, captive, and private (e-4W) charge points deployed in the country. The report covers chargers of 3.3 kW and above ratings. 
As per the report, EV charger shipments in 2021 totalled around 17,000 units. This included chargers supplied by EV OEMs to be sold along with electric four-wheelers, procurement by state-owned companies, commercial fleet operators, bus operators, and charge point operators. 
“EV charger demand in India has witnessed an increase in 2022 owing to tenders announced by public-sector units such as Convergence Energy Services Ltd (CESL), NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd, Indian Oil Co. Ltd (IOCL), and Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), which is expected to add around 6,000 charging stations by 2023. Further, real estate developers such as Omaxe, Lodha Group, MyGate, and Rustomjee Group collaborated with EV charging station developers to deploy EV charging solutions in their new and existing properties,” stated the report. 
“Efforts taken by the Department of Heavy Industries through the FAME Scheme and release of EOI for the deployment of charging stations has aided in the wide-spread installation of chargers across the nation. State governments are also taking active steps to increase EV charging network in the state by providing attractive incentives in the form of capital subsidy and 100% reimbursement of state goods and services tax,” it said.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2022/10/18/greatcell-achieves-32-efficiency-for-inorganic-perovskite-solar-cell/,"HIGHLIGHTS,PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 18, 2022",GreatCell achieves 32% efficiency for inorganic perovskite solar cell,"From pv magazine Global
GreatCell Solar has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 32% for a 100% inorganic perovskite cell designed for indoor applications. 
“This is a single-junction, single cell with linear conduction width of 1.5 cm to simulate product-sized cells,” the company’s managing director, Paul Moonie, told pv magazine. “The inorganic perovskite crystallizes at room temperature, so processing is compatible with common flexible substrates.”
The Australian perovskite solar cell maker said the result is a world record for inorganic perovskite solar cells.
“It was not certified by an independent entity, as there is no established independent certification for low-light solar cell performance,” Moonie said. “However, we do comply with all relevant international standards such as IEC 63163, including for long-term stability and durability testing.”
The company built the cell with roll-to-roll coating technology. It designed the cell without a hole transport layer (HTL) and using carbon composite back contact, which it claims has excellent electrical conductivity.
“We are in the process of moving from semi-tech to full-scale production using this manufacturing technique,” he said, noting that, with further improving, the optoelectronic quality of perovskite and its interfaces, plus carbon composites-based back contact, may soon reach an efficiency of 40%. “Our aim is not just producing high-performance and long-life solar cells, but also utilizing low-cost materials. In saying that, our efficiencies are currently much higher than off-the-shelf indoor PV, and our potential customers are satisfied with our performance to offer advanced power solutions to their Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.”
In 2021, GreatCell acquired a solar module factory in Australia from Tindo Solar. In May, it announced plans to expand the factory.
