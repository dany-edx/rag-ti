The ChargeGrid Flare chargers—installed at HPCL’s Bandra Kurla Complex outlet in Mumbai and Nitimarg outlet in Delhi—provide a low-cost charging solution that causes less street clutter than other approaches. 
The ChargeGrid Flare—inclusive of power-saving efficient LED lamp, robust street light pole and electric vehicle supply equipment—can be remotely monitored through online mode. It has an automated payment gateway through the ChargeGrid App, which eliminates the need for a station marshal to monitor, maintain and operate the chargers at the location. 
The EV charger is an ideal solution for installation into car parking lots and at retail outlets. 
Maxson Lewis, managing director of Magenta, said their company aims to deploy 1000 ChargeGrid Flare across India this year and is in touch with original equipment manufacturers and fuel station owners.

The Indian solar glass manufacturer’s Q3 FY 2021 revenues stood at INR 140 crore, a 23% increase over INR 114 crore recorded in the previous quarter. 
In all, the manufacturer earned net revenue of around INR 300 crore during the nine months ended December 2020, a 74.3% rise over the corresponding period in the previous year.
The company acknowledged increased demand from the customers in export markets, given lower availability from China and Malaysia. 
“More geographies are getting added to the customers. Exports comprise about 16.1% of overall sales. We are restricting orders in both domestic and export markets in view of limited availability,” it stated.
Borosil Renewables produced at near full capacity of 450 tonnes per day during Q3 FY2021. Thinner glass (lower than 3.2 mm), which is required for bifacial modules, accounted for about 25% of the quarterly sales volume.
Expansion
With rising sales, the company is expanding its capacity from 450 tons per day to 950 tons per day by adding a third solar glass line of 500 tons per day along with processing facilities. The expansion is expected to cost about INR 500 crore. 
The project is proposed to be financed through equity of INR 200 crore, a debt of INR 200 crore, with the balance to be met through internal accruals. Towards this end, the company reported it has successfully raised equity finance of INR 200 crore by way of a qualified institutional placement.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/04/un-calls-on-bangladesh-to-put-renewables-first/,"POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,BANGLADESH",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 4, 2021",UN calls on Bangladesh to put renewables first,"From pv magazine International
The president of Bangladesh’s renewable energy trade body has echoed a call made by the UN for the nation to turn its back on coal and embrace clean power as its status at the global body could be set to change.
The United Nations’ committee on development policy on Friday recommended Bangladesh no longer be included on the international organization’s list of least developed countries.
The UN greeted the recommendation by advising: “Bangladesh should accelerate its efforts to scale back from coal fired power plants and shift to clean and sustainable energy.”
It was a sentiment described as “very appropriate” by Dipal C Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association.
“Graduation to [the] upper level [of development status] does not mean only raising per-capita income,” Barua told pv magazine. “Quality of life, environment, and health also has to be ensured.” The trade body chief added: “We should lower dependence on fossil fuel and raise power generation from renewables. The UN suggestion came for our survival, for our sustainability. It should be [a] non negotiable goal to us.”
Natural gas dominates Bangladesh’s power mix and coal’s marginal share has been raised recently by the commissioning of new coal-fired power stations, with more under construction. That is despite the fact Dhaka recently cancelled 13 long-planned coal power stations which had failed to take shape because of the high price of the fuel, as well as environmental considerations. The cancelled facilities, though, will be replaced by liquefied natural gas plants.
Mohammad Alauddin, chairman of government body the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), said the authorities are already on track to respond to the UN request. He said plans for half the nation’s electricity to come from coal generation–outlined in a power sector masterplan (PSMP) in 2010–had been reduced to 35% five years ago, and added: “The PSMP is now under revision again and will cut down coal’s share, considering facts and reality.”
Alauddin said Bangladesh’s newly-enacted, eighth national five-year plan–for 2021-25–gives immense importance to the implementation of renewable energy projects.
The SREDA chairman said Bangladesh has 750 MW of clean power generation capacity, led by solar, and multiple PV projects are under construction.
