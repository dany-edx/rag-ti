The company recorded a revenue of INR 3,615 crore ($434.78 million) in Q3 FY 2024, 19% up year-on-year, boosted by the newly commissioned transmission projects and higher energy consumption in the distribution business. Operational EBITDA at INR 1,454 crore was up 10% YoY. Profit after tax (PAT), at INR 281 crore, grew by 1%. During the quarter, the company posted a robust cash profit of INR 786 crore
Key transmission projects that made progress and were commissioned in Q3, included the 765 kV KBTL (Khavda Bhuj line), with 217 circuit kilometers charged during the quarter. This line, once fully commissioned, will help evacuate about 3 GW of renewable energy from Khavda, Gujarat. The company also commissioned a 400 KV Kharghar-Vikhroli double circuit transmission line, establishing the first-ever high voltage 400 KV connection in Mumbai. This will enable an additional 1 GW of power to be brought into Mumbai, meeting the city’s fast growing electricity demand.
AEML, the Mumbai distribution business, witnessed a 14.8% increase in the energy consumed. It saw one of the lowest distribution losses of 5.46% and added new consumers.
“Our growing portfolio with newly commissioned lines, coupled with favorable energy demand, continues to drive our growth. We are proud of our contribution to developing national transmission infrastructure, which is very critical to facilitate renewable evacuation, especially from the Khavda region,” said Anil Sardana, MD, Adani Energy Solutions.
“We are very excited about opportunities in all lines of business in AESL. The smart metering segment is consistently growing besides our existing T and D established industry position. To offer smart and tech-enabled smart metering solutions, our partnership with Airtel, Esyasoft, AdaniConnex will be very fruitful and will immensely augment our offering,” said Kandarp Patel, CEO, Adani Energy Solutions.

The company said in a statement that it is evaluating the development of multi-gigawatt-scale solar wafer manufacturing in the US market, with an initial target production volume of 6 GW.
The company said it is evaluating manufacturing locations, considering regional incentives, and actively working on strategic partnerships and wafer offtake agreements in the United States.
To lead the US operation, the company has named Jonathan Pickering as VP of business development, North America. He was previously an executive at JA Solar Americas and Applied Materials.
“Multiple top-tier solar companies have committed to advanced PV cell and module manufacturing at a multi-gigawatt scale across the US. But now we see a significant bottleneck in the supply chain for a domestic source of silicon wafers,” said Pickering, adding that the company will be able to offer US-made, thin silicon wafers.
Nexwafe is commercializing kerfless wafers. Its monocrystalline silicon wafers are grown directly in a gas-to-wafer manufacturing process that it claims is not only more efficient but also enables the production of ultra-thin wafers. Its wafers are compatible with conventional cell processing, and reportedly minimize wastage, offering a 60% reduction in the carbon footprint compared to conventional processes.
Nexwafe, which is based in Freiburg, Germany, announced a €30 million financing round in May 2023.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/29/adani-green-completes-funding-of-the-reserves-for-the-750-million-holdco/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,WIND-SOLAR HYBRID,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,2024-01-29,Adani Green completes funding of the reserves for the $750 million Holdco,"Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), India’s largest renewable energy solutions provider, announced today it has completed the funding for the $750 million 4.375% notes due Sept. 9, 2024 (Holdco Notes). The company completed the funding with INR 2,338 crore ($281 million) proceeds from the initial tranche of the promoter preferential allotment of INR 9,350 crore.
“The AGEL shareholders approved the preferential allotment with an overwhelming 99.9% majority on 18 January 2024 and thereafter the promoters funded INR 2,338 crore ($281 million) primary infusion into AGEL last week. AGEL has set aside the funds in the senior debt redemption account (SDRA) and other reserve accounts of the Holdco Notes, post which the funding of the reserves has been completed,” stated AGEL.
Other sources of funds include $300 million from TotalEnergies JV proceeds and $169 million from debt service reserve account, hedge reserves, and interest on reserve account.
The transaction for the TotalEnergies 1,050 MW JV proceeds closed on Dec. 26, and the funds are already lying in the SDRA of the Holdco notes.
With the latest fund infusion from promoters, the entire amount of the $750 million Holdco Notes is fully secured eight months before its maturity date. With this outcome, AGEL has fully defeased the Holdco Notes, eight months prior to the maturity date and has further resulted in significant deleveraging in AGEL by way of equity proceeds while continuing to deliver on the growth plans.
“Underpinning the repayment is the successful equity capital raise program of $1.425 billion (includes $1.125 billion of preferential issuance by promoters and $300 million from TotalEnergies JV), reflecting the deep interest of long-term investors, strategic partners, coupled with unwavering promoter commitment to meet AGEL’s strategic priorities of achieving its target of 45 GW by 2030,” stated AGEL.
AGEL develops, owns, and operates utility-scale grid-connected solar, wind and hybrid renewable power plants. With a locked-in growth trajectory up to 20.6 GW, it currently has an operating renewable portfolio of 8.4 GW, the largest in India, spread across 12 states, offsetting over 41 million tonnes of CO2 emissions cumulatively. The company has set a target of achieving 45 GW by 2030.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/29/mixed-signals-for-solar-cell-price-prospects/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,2024-01-29,Mixed signals for solar cell price prospects,"Solar cell FOB China prices have stayed consistent this week since there hasn’t been much of a shift in supply and demand fundamentals. Mono PERC M10 and G12 cell prices trended flat at $0.0482/W and $0.0473/W, respectively while the TOPCon M10 cell price remained flat at $0.0584/W week on week.
Mono PERC M10 cells on the Chinese domestic market remained at CNY0.387 ($0.055)/W, according to the OPIS survey. A portion of the price stability can be attributed to the upstream wafer prices stabilizing after ceasing to rise. The price of Mono PERC M10 wafers on the Chinese domestic market trended flat this week as a result of wafer producers’ attempts to boost pricing and restore profits being derailed by the weak demand, staying at CNY1.98/pc without any change from last week.
Nevertheless, cell suppliers are still attempting to invent fresh price hikes. According to a source from the cell segment, it is optimistic that the price may rise to over CNY0.4/pc by early February.
According to this source, market participants believe that Mono PERC M10 cell prices are at their lowest point for the foreseeable future, because such cells are poised to move from being mass-market products to customized products. “Manufactures don’t have to sell bespoke items at large losses,” the source added.
By contrast, a downstream source is cautious about additional Mono PERC cell pricing hikes before Chinese New Year, arguing that there isn’t sufficient demand to support the price increases. “The majority of new module purchase orders signed by European developers beginning in the second half of 2023 are n-type,” the source continued.
A developer concurred, stating that it may be difficult for all types of cells to raise prices in February and that the module businesses’ cash flow might not be able to support the price hikes of cells.
Even after switching to n-type cells, another cell supplier claimed that the manufacturers’ financial status has not significantly improved. The source stated that non-silicon costs like silver paste are the main reason why creating n-type cells is more expensive than producing Mono PERC cells. The market participant went on to say that N-type cells’ premium price is insufficient to cover these expenses, though the price of TOPCon M10 cells is between CNY0.08/W and CNY0.09/wp or about 21% higher than that of Mono PERC M10 cells.
Product diversification remains a key strategy for cell companies seeking to stay in business. A medium-sized cell producer told OPIS that they plan to start the production of TOPCon M10 cells with 16-busbar in 2024, which are more effective than conventional 10-busbar cells and require less silver paste.

6,https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2024/01/29/pv-may-help-csp-reduce-its-lcoe-by-18-in-saudi-arabia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-01-29,PV may help CSP reduce its LCOE by 18% in Saudi Arabia,"Researchers led by King Saud University have assessed several deployment scenarios for CSP plants in two Saudi cities – Ryad and Tabuk. They have found that hybridizing CSP facilities with PV projects could offer the best cost-competitive configuration.
The scientists said that the two cities have different weather and irradiance conditions. The scientists see “solar multiple,” which is the ratio of solar field thermal capacity to power block capacity, as the crucial factor.
“The study presents a new way of thinking about the potential of CSP plants not only to provide baseload generation, but to act as more flexible generation assets taking a combination of direct solar heat and excess electricity from PV or wind plants that would otherwise be curtailed, and delivering baseload power for a 100% renewable future,” they explained.
The researchers explained their findings in “Integrated CSP-PV hybrid solar power plant for two cities in Saudi Arabia,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. They presented the results of three different simulations conducted via the NREL System Advisor Model (SAM) model and covered three types of projects.
The scientists that all of their PV project configurations use AC power after the inverter as input.
“All simulations were performed using a typical meteorological year (TMY) time series for the meteorological variables including direct and global irradiance components, temperature, and wind speed,” they said. “The hybrid concept with a PV plant added to the CSP original baseload plant, the results show a reduction in LCOE of 18% for Riyadh and 7% for Tabuk keeping the plant capacity factor at a high 79%. The hybridization concept can extend the applicability of CSP technology to regions with less direct sunlight than would be economically feasible with CSP alone.”
Another recent study from Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University showed that Saudi Arabia’s futuristic Neom City would use the sources of renewable energy that have the best chances of being dispatched.
“There will be no competition between the different renewable energy technologies and synergies will be the key,” researcher Alberto Boretti told pv magazine.
CSP, which Boretti defined as the only renewable energy source with the added value of dispatchability, will prevail over PV and wind, as it relies on internal molten salt energy storage, so it doesn’t need external solutions for storage.
The Neom City project is part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to shift to a less oil-dependent economy.
pv magazine and Solarabic have developed a new event in the Saudi energy landscape – SunRise Arabia Clean Energy Conference 2024 – that combines their long-term market expertise. The event will take place in Riyadh on Jan. 31. One of the event’s sessions will include a discussion about green hydrogen and large-scale electrolysis projects.
