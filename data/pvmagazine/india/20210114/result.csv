The company recorded a 21.3% increase in revenues and a 373.8% increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) over the preceding quarter.
The EBITDA figure for the third quarter stood at an attractive INR 60.28 crore. Profit before tax was INR 53.63 crore from operations in the third quarter compared to INR 5.86 crore in the second quarter. 
“The improvement in performance was derived singularly from the manufacture and sales of solar cells,” stated the company, which has a capacity to manufacture 250 MW of solar cells and 250 MW of modules.
SL Agarwal, Managing Director, said, “The improved performance of the company during the third quarter is a reflection of the sharp turnaround in the ground realities of the renewable energy sector in India.” “This improvement has been driven by forward-looking government policy and has reflected in improved revenues and a substantial improvement in business quality.”
Agarwal said the company was able to moderate raw material costs as a percentage of revenues from 66% in the second quarter to 63.5% in the third quarter, strengthening overall margins and competitiveness.
Expansion
“The company is sold out for its complete manufacture of solar cells for the next six months,” said Agarwal. “In view of this reality, the company is restructuring its existing 250 MW solar cell capacity towards higher cell sizes and is evaluating to set up another 300 MW solar cell capacity to be commercialized over the next 12 months.”
The company is attractively placed to capitalize on the prevailing [renewables] sector prospects by allocating all its accruals into additional capacity,” said Agarwal. “From the fourth quarter onwards, the company’s interest outflow will decline sharply on account of virtually no long-term debt on the books. Besides, the company will commission its dormant 250 MW module from the last quarter.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/14/new-mounting-system-to-integrate-small-pv-into-wind-farms/,"HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JANUARY 14, 2021",New mounting system to integrate small PV into wind farms,"From pv magazine International
Experts agree that solar PV and wind power are equally needed to support the energy transition. The two technologies are rarely located at the same site, but this could change in the future.
At least, that is the dream of Werner Palm, the managing director of Swiss mounting system manufacturer Smartvolt AG. The company is now working with German wind specialist Westfalen Wind, which has deployed an innovative 96.8 kW pilot PV project in the gravel crane parking area of a wind turbine. The two companies used a Smartvolt mounting system to deploy pre-assembled solar module strings, which can simply be folded out on site.
“Thanks to our patented crane beam, it can be erected in three minutes per kilowatt, and dismantled in around six minutes,” said Palm.
The PV system can be easily dismantled if the wind farm’s floor space is needed for maintenance work, he noted.
“As a rule, this is only necessary once every 20 years,” added Daniel Saage, the managing director of Westfalen Wind.
Then the solar modules can be folded up and installed again after the maintenance work has been completed. Thus far, Smartvolt has not subjected the system to a long-term load test.
“But five to 10 times shouldn’t be a problem,” Palm said.

Both companies see the advantages of this combination because the technical infrastructure to connect the PV system to the grid via the wind turbine is already in place. In addition, there are no additional space requirements and an area that has already been sealed can still be used. The annual yield of the PV system is around 85,000 kWh, which could cover around two-thirds of the wind power plant’s own requirements per year. This is around 96,000 kWh and is usually generated by the wind turbine itself.
The local network operator has agreed to approve the PV project as a classic self-consumption system. Whenever the wind turbine is not spinning, its own electricity requirements can be covered with photovoltaics, which ensures that the wind generator is significantly more profitable.
However, Saage said bureaucratic factors are still preventing a breakthrough. The pure manufacturing costs for a 100 kW system are around €600 ($730) per kilowatt installed. In addition, there are building permit fees and compensation payments, as well as other costs. But if such obstacles are eliminated, a few hundred kilowatts of solar could be installed at wind farms without additional costs.
“This would significantly reduce costs and make the overall concept more economically attractive,” he said.
Westfalen Wind has said that around one-fifth to one-eighth of crane parking space could be used for PV systems. However, the wind turbines towers must not face south – ideally, the PV systems should be built with an east-west orientation. In the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, Saage sees the potential for 60 MW of solar at crane parking areas. Throughout all of Germany, capacity could reach 300 MW, he added.

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/01/14/new-metering-rules-will-deter-rooftop-solar-adoption-says-nsefi/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,ROOFTOP SOLAR,INDIA",UMA GUPTA,"JANUARY 14, 2021","New net metering rule will deter rooftop solar adoption, says NSEFI","The net metering provision under the recently notified Electricity (Amendment) Rules, 2020 has left rooftop solar developers worried. The provision restricts net metering up to 10 kW capacity in India and mandate gross metering above 10 kW, which, when implemented, will have a drastic impact on the entire rooftop solar industry, say developers.
Under net metering, electricity generated by the solar rooftop system is first utilized by the consumer to meet their internal/captive requirements. Excess electricity, if any, is exported to the grid. Subsequently, when the consumer imports power from the grid, the exports are adjusted against the imports, lowering the electricity bill.
Under gross metering, consumers are required to sell the solar electricity generated to the Discom–at a tariff (feed-in tariff) which tends to be lower than the rate at which they buy electricity from the Discom. The difference in rates for the electricity supplied to the grid and electricity purchased from the Discoms puts the consumers at a disadvantage.
Developers’ body National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI) says the new net metering restriction will prevent high-load industrial consumers from switching to solar and has sought the power ministry’s intervention to withdraw the restriction of 10kW capacity for net metering under the Rules 2020.
Investments at stake
In a letter to the power minister, NSEFI said, “Many states have enacted net metering regulations allowing net metering for capacity above 1 kW to 1 -2 MW in most states and few states up to the sanctioned load. These regulations have been issued in compliance with the state-specific directive under Section 108 of the Electricity Act 2003… Hence, significant capacity addition in the solar rooftop segment is already under financing and under-construction phase. As per a rough estimate, investment to the tune of INR 1500-2000 crore is either under contract or under commissioning phase.” 
MSMEs to be adversely affected
According to the NSEFI, Micro, Small and Medium Companies (MSMEs), which have made rooftop solar a mass movement in India, are set to be adversely impacted. 
“Covid-19 has already dealt a huge blow to the MSMEs and other industries, and saving energy cost is one way to strive and thrive for Indian manufacturers. Rooftop solar is one such opportunity for them to save cost and remain competitive. These new rules will not only impact the existing MSMEs, their operations and finances but also affect millions of clean energy jobs India will create in the solar rooftop segment,” it stated. 
The provisions will not only hamper India’s rooftop PV target of 40 GW (of which the nation has only installed around 4.55 GW so far) but also prevent industrial consumers from taking advantage of green energy, NSEFI said.
