They claim to have produced small-sized ingots with purity levels of 98% to 99%.
These purity levels slightly exceed the 3N purity level, which the scientists say is greater than that of metallurgical-grade silicon. It is also “good enough” for applications other than solar cells, like battery materials.
“Currently, we are working towards the purification process of recovered silicon to grow ingot better than 5N, so that same can be used in the fabrication of new solar cells,” researcher Sushil Kumar told pv magazine. “This work is expected to be completed in the next few months.”
The scientists used a modified hot pressing technology known as SPS, involving the passage of pulsed direct current with millisecond pulse widths, high current, and low voltage through the pressing tool and sintered body. This approach enables rapid heating and short processing times, typically within a few minutes. The researchers specifically applied this technique to consolidate the silicon powder obtained from the recycled solar cells.
They conducted the experiment on a 98 cm × 164 cm solar module, weighing 17.18 kg. They used a mechanical treatment to remove the aluminum frame (0.62 kg) and the junction box. They then cut down the remaining parts of the panel into small pieces of varying sizes, ranging from 9.5 cm × 11 cm to 12 cm × 16 cm.
The process involved thermally treating the recovered wafer pieces on a stainless steel plate at an optimized temperature of 480°C for 30 minutes in a muffle furnace, resulting in a total weight of 23.04 grams. Glass, silicon cell fragments, and connecting wires were recovered, while the EVA encapsulant and backsheet were removed. To eliminate residual ash adhering to the cell pieces, the cell fragments underwent ultrasonic cleaning with hot distilled water for one hour.
Subsequently, the researchers utilized SPS to consolidate the powder at temperatures ranging from 1,100 C to 1,200 C, significantly below silicon’s melting point of 1,410 C. The sintering cycles were conducted for up to 20 minutes under vacuum conditions.
The Indian team reported removal rates of 97.72% for aluminum and 99.90% for silver through this process. Using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, they determined that the resulting ingots achieved a purity level exceeding 3N.
“Despite the fact that recovered silicon from waste is used in the production, it is highly likely that ingots of much greater purity can be easily produced through upgraded recovery and purification techniques,” the academics concluded.
They presented the new technique in “Growth and analysis of polycrystalline silicon ingots using recycled silicon from waste solar module,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.

Solar panel makers use argon gas to purify silicon crystals which are then used in solar cells. This process requires vast amounts of argon, with some producers needing to ship in multiple tankers of the gas each day.
GR2L has developed a closed-loop, argon purge gas recovery and purification system, the ArgonØ, to recycle the high-purity argon purge gas used in the fabrication of silicon wafers for solar PV applications.
GR2L claims its ArgonØ machinery to be a world first that allows solar cell production – as well as other advanced manufacturing activities like microelectronics production, 3D metals printing, and aerospace heat treatments – instead to recycle up to 95% of argon used. The technology helps solar manufacturers to cut waste, emissions and costs.
Rob Grant, CEO and founder of GR2L, said, “With production of brand-new argon creating up to a tonne of carbon dioxide for every tonne of argon, our cutting-edge gas recycling technology helps solar facilities reduce their scope 3 CO2 emissions and produce solar fuel cells more efficiently.”

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/19/researchers-claim-pv-near-railway-tracks-is-technically-feasible/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,BANGLADESH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",Researchers claim PV near railway tracks is technically feasible,"An international team has conducted a technical and economic analysis to assess if deploying PV systems between or close to railway tracks is a viable option for rural applications and has found that this heavily criticized project typology may not only be technically feasible but also commercially attractive.
The main criticisms made of this approach relate, in particular, to two primary issues that may affect the performance of the solar panels – hard soiling and strong mechanical stress caused by the passage of the trains above the modules – two factors that could significantly reduce the system’s lifecycle and performance.
The scientists were aware of these risks and said that in Bangladesh, however, rail tracks are commonly built on soft alluvial soils that generally attenuate the vibration amplitude created by passing rolling stocks.
The scientists investigated, in particular, the feasibility of a net-meter-supported mini-grid solar photovoltaic power plant located near the nearside of the railway track in Bangladesh. They assumed a 128 kW array to be deployed alongside the rail track in the Bonomala region of Tongi in Gazipur, Bangladesh, with the distance between the rail track and the panel-bearing racking system pole being 3–4 meters.
The surrounding area has potential loads such as an 18.4 kW deep-tube well, two 5 kW shallow machines, a 35 KVA-driven poultry farm, and a 50 KVA-driven dairy farm. “Furthermore, a village market is surrounded by over a hundred families,” the researchers stated. “So, more than 100 kW of load demand exists.”
For the modeling, which considered solar panels, inverters, meters, wires, power requirement, output power, performance ratio estimation, meteorological data for the selected area, and tilt angle optimization, the scientists used the PVsyst software.
“The 128 kW power plant requires 342 solar panels racking on two or three rows of mounting systems alongside the railway track; thus, a total of 623 m2 of state-owned railway land is required that would be utilized both for transportation as well as renewable power generation,” they explained. “Furthermore, as the dimensions of the module are 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 35 mm, a 1.821 m2 area is required for racking every single module.”
For the PV system, the group assumed a tilt angle of 20.8 decrease, a module output of 375 W, three 33 kW string inverters, and a southern orientation. Their analysis also took into account a 1% array soiling loss, a 2% module mismatch loss, a 1% light-induced degradation loss, and other loss fractions such as string mismatch loss, module degradation loss, and DC wiring loss. Capex was estimated at $124,688 and opex for annual O&M activities was estimated at $4,748.
The scientists found that the system has a performance ratio (PR) of 77.3% and a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.052. They also found that its net present value (NPV) and payback time are $196,894 and 8.4 years, respectively. “Putting in place PV power plants next to the railway track might, all things considered, be a game-changing solution for Bangladesh’s rural areas, supplying reliable, affordable, and clean power to boost employment prospects, raise living standards, and lessen the effects of climate change,” they concluded.
Their findings can be found in the study “Techno-economic study of a photovoltaic power plant besides the railway track for rural uses in Bangladesh,” published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. The research group comprises academics from the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR), as well as from the RMIT University in Australia and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2023/09/19/dc-isolators-trigger-sharp-increase-in-solar-fires-in-australia/,"HIGHLIGHTS,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2023",DC isolators trigger sharp increase in solar fires in Australia,"From pv magazine Australia
Fire incidents caused by DC inverters in rooftop solar installations have increased sharply over the last 12 months in Australia, according to data gathered by the ABC.
In the Northern Territory this year, 11 fires have been caused by DC isolators, compared to just four in 2022. The state of Victoria saw 27 fires caused by isolators in the last financial year, up from 15 the year before. Meanwhile, Queensland had 11 last year, and Western Australia had 14 fire incidents caused by DC isolators. The Australian Capital Territory had at least one incident in the last year, while New South Wales authorities did not respond to requests for data. No data was shown for Tasmania.
Until 2021, Australia mandated DC isolators be part of every system. It was the only country to have such a requirement. After industry experts lobbied against the use of DC isolators, saying they actually made systems more vulnerable to fires and faults, the mandate was finally abandoned in November 2021. Since the requirement for DC isolators was only revoked in practice six months later in mid-2022, most solar installations on Australian rooftops will have DC isolators.
A spokesperson from Energy Safe Victoria told the ABC that a key driver in the increase in fire incidents was a lack of servicing of rooftop solar systems. He said that their research showed that although people with photovoltaic installations on their roofs understand the importance of servicing, they still don’t do it.
While existing laws recommend owners have their PV system inspected regularly and annually for system components like DC isolators, regular inspections are not required under state and territory electrical safety laws.
As pv magazine reported in November 2021, another disadvantage of isolator components is that they can degrade from environmental exposure. This can be due to specific installation methods and product types, increasing the likelihood of water ingress and ultraviolet radiation damage. This was again reflected in the accounts of those experiencing the fires in a report broadcast by the ABC yesterday. In 2021, pv magazine concluded that DC isolators may need to be replaced within the life of the panels of a PV system.
NT Worksafe has now issued a safety warning and advised people to check their solar installations – especially to make sure that DC isolators were not on or near wooden surfaces.
