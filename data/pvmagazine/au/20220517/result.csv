Somewhat vague in its scope, the announcement gestured towards hydrogen and the NSW treasurer and environment minister Matt Kean’s ambition of establishing the state as a hydrogen frontrunner.
The Danish ambassador to Australia, Pernille Dahler Kardel, also gestured toward collaboration on energy exports as a priority for the two governments, also suggesting the partnership might have a particular eye on hydrogen.
“Denmark is a world leader in clean energy, with wind and solar supplying 50% of Denmark’s electricity. Danish companies are also at the forefront of global clean energy technology development,” Kean said.
“This MOU provides a framework not only for NSW to learn from Denmark, but for Denmark to benefit from our experiences developing Renewable Energy Zones, the Peak Demand Reduction Scheme and the Energy Security Safeguard,” he added.
Before NSW linked with Denmark, the Queensland government announced its MoU agreement with the Netherlands and its Port of Rotterdam, Europe’s largest.
Queensland Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni announced last week an MoU had been signed with the port to collaborate on opportunities to develop a hydrogen export supply chain.
“The Port of Rotterdam has a target to import up to 20 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050, starting with imports of ammonia in 2025,” de Brenni said, noting the agreement solidified Queenland’s role in realising that target.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/17/commonwealth-regulators-hydrogen-certification-scheme-secures-17-projects/,"HYDROGEN,QUALITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 17, 2022",Regulator’s hydrogen certification scheme secures 17 projects,"Backed by the Australian federal government, the Clean Energy Regulator’s (CER) Guarantee of Origin scheme aims to align with international standards and provide confidence to trading partners in the burgeoning hydrogen industry.
CER confirmed 17 active or well-advanced hydrogen projects have signed up to help it understand how a Guarantee of Origin (GO) scheme could work for hydrogen.
Unlike the Smart Energy Council’s hydrogen certification scheme, the government-backed scheme does not focus solely on certifying green hydrogen but rather will measure and track emissions from a range of hydrogen production methods and technologies, issuing certifications based on that source data.
CER noted “practical applications” of a scheme are a critical step in the co-design process, which is presumably what the 17 projects will enable to agency to figure out. 
The trial is supported by a $9.7 million funding commitment made in this year’s federal budget.
pv magazine Australia has previously been told the scheme will work something like a ticket, which can be distributed by third parties but are validated on a single shared registry. Using such a model, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) would issue a set of numerically identifiable certificates which could then be traced and marked within a single registry. This system would prevent double counting as well as the need to cross check contracts, and would allow for automised reporting.
Such a scheme, pv magazine has been told, would also leave room for third party involvement, similar to the way GreenPower leverages off the Regulator’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) registries.
The hope is that such a model would prevent the fragmentation of having several different verification schemes run by different bodies, which could confuse international buyers. Given that the regulator already oversees Australia’s clean energy schemes, including our extensive small and large-scale solar certificates, the body seems an obvious choice to issue hydrogen certificates also.

Announcing the news, the company said it has substantially increased its order intake by multi gigawatt scale projects based on its 20-MW standard electrolyser module. “With its new location in Perth, thyssenkrupp nucera moves to the industrial area of Australia that offers ideal infrastructure for green hydrogen and green chemicals exports to global and key Asian markets, as well as local workforce and capabilities for project support.”
Western Australia is home to two of the world’s biggest hydrogen project proposals, the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub and the 50 GW Western Green Energy Hub. It will also likely become home to some of Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest’s mammoth hydrogen production plans.
The plans, and the potential they demonstrate, have not been lost on the 13,000 kilometre journey from Germany to WA, with Thyssenkrupp noting the new office is “ideally located to support the company’s growth.” The new Perth base is planned to have full sales and project-execution capabilities.
“Western Australia has many attributes that provide a strong competitive advantage in the growing global renewable hydrogen market with their combination of world-class renewable energy resources, vast land mass, established energy infrastructure and a history of exporting energy to international markets,” Johann Rinnhofer, managing director of thyssenkrupp nucera Australia said. “After having worked successfully with our Australian customers for many years, this new focus on the hydrogen sphere of Australia with a base in Perth was a logical business decision.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/17/water-secret-ingredient-in-new-processing-mechanism-for-perovskite-nanocrystals/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 17, 2022",Water ‘secret ingredient’ in new processing mechanism for perovskite nanocrystals,"Researchers from Melbourne’s Monash University have discovered water can be used as the key ingredient in the precursor solution which helps fabricate perovskites to their exact specifications.
Perovskites are a nanomaterial with a crystal structure which hold potential for the next generation of photovoltaics, semiconductors and LEDs. Perovskites have already shown similar efficiencies to silicon, are cheaper to make, and feature a tuneable bandgap, meaning the energy they are able to absorb, reflect or conduct can be changed to suit different purposes.
Perovskites, however, are infamously prone to defects – something which researchers like those at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science are seeking to solve.
Ordinarily, water is kept as far away as possible during the process of creating perovskites since the presence of moisture can lead to defects in the materials, causing them to fall apart more quickly when they’re being used in a device. Hence perovskites in scientific research are often made via spin coating in the sealed environment of a nitrogen glove box.
Now, though, the Monash-led team have found a simple way to control the growth of perovskite crystals by harnessing water as a positive factor. This liquid-based mechanism works at room temperature, so the approach remains cost effective.
Exciton Science
The team found that by changing the ratio of water to solvent during the early stages of the process, they could choose to grow different types of perovskite crystals, with structures to suit various purposes.
“By carefully tuning the concentration of water in the precursor solution, we realised the precise control of particular perovskite phases,” Dr Wenxin Mao of Monash University. The findings from Dr Wenxin and his team have been published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials.
Computational and thermodynamic analysis conducted by colleagues at the University of Sydney identified that the coordination of lead and bromide ions in the precursor solution was an important factor in determining which types of crystals are formed.
“We now understand the internal mechanics and function of water inside the precursor solution. By doing that we can further use water to control the crystallisation process,” lead author Qingdong Lin, a PhD student at Monash University, said.
To demonstrate the quality of the end product, crystals produced via this approach were coupled with back-contact electrodes through nanofabrication to create X-ray detection devices.
This test sample performed at a similar level to commercial X-ray detectors currently being used in real-world settings, the researchers said, and out-performed prototype perovskite X-ray detectors developed using slower, more complicated fabrication methods.
“We compared them with commercial X-ray detectors as well as other types of perovskites and we do have a very good responsivity and sensitivity to X-rays. Overall this project shows that we have found a smart way to control inorganic perovskite single crystals,” Dr Wenxin said. “The methodology is flexible and feasible and doesn’t require a very unique environment or technique to apply it.”
As well as solar cells, X-ray detectors and LEDs, perovskites created with this method may also be useful in UV light detection, lasers and solar concentrators.

A team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Cornell University, and Wuhan University have designed a nickel-based electrocatalyst with a 2-nanometer shell made of nitrogen-doped carbon to solve the two problems of nonprecious-metal hydrogen oxidation reaction electrocatalysts: low intrinsic activity from strong hydrogen binding energy and poor durability due to rapid passivation from metal oxide formation. According to their paper, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, nickel nanoparticles tend to adsorb oxygen-containing reaction intermediates. The “hydrogen fuel cell has an anode catalyst consisting of a solid nickel core surrounded by the carbon shell. When paired with a cobalt-manganese cathode, the resulting completely precious-metal-free hydrogen fuel cell outputs more than 200 milliwatts per square centimetre,” the researchers wrote. According to the team, an additional advantage is that the configuration of the active site increases the tolerance for carbon monoxide impurities in the hydrogen fuel. “This means the fuel cells do not need a special unit to remove carbon monoxide and can use less refined hydrogen, further reducing costs.”
Europe is a clear opportunity for Australian companies, and the Netherlands is taking the lead. Europe “is an important marketplace,” said Jason Crusan, vice president of technology at Australian gas producer Woodside, during the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam. Many Australian attendees took part virtually and in person. During the three-day conference, the Port of Rotterdam proved once more its hydrogen ambitions. Together with companies, it offered European institutions to supply northwestern Europe with 4.6 million tons of hydrogen annually by 2030. “This is considerably more than expected,” the port wrote on Tuesday. On Friday, Gasco, HyNewGen, Linde, Vopak, and Port of Rotterdam said they were concluding a feasibility study to develop a 200 to 500 MW green hydrogen project in Chile (Project Tango).
Also taking part in the event, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans underscored the importance of Australia, the Americas and the Mediterranean. “I started out today with scientific revolutions in Rotterdam, and I am ending with new energy forms coming from Africa and the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is back, which I find fascinating. But the Mediterranean and the North Sea are connected,” said Timmermans on Tuesday. 
Imports of green hydrogen and green ammonia “are already cost-competitive and can substitute most fossil fuels used by heavy industry and transport in the EU within eight years,” wrote Colorado-based non-profit organisation RMI in a study, adding that the European Union should incentivise infrastructures for industrial hubs, promote a certification system and define import rules that prioritise low-carbon fuels. “Incorporating green hydrogen and ammonia into trade policy with renewables-rich countries like Australia, Brazil, Chile, and North African nations will enable imports to reach the continent as early as 2024.” According to RMI’s work, imported green hydrogen from regions with optimal renewable power should cost less than US$4/kg (AU$5.7/kg) in 2024 (including transport), falling below US$2/kg (AU$2.87/kg) by 2030. Renewable hydrogen produced in Europe would then be cost-competitive in 2030. 
Trade Association Hydrogen Europe wrote that a reduction in hydrogen delivery price, an increase in renewable electricity generation, and hydrogen storage solutions are three necessary conditions under which steel can be produced economically from iron ore using hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Regarding costs, the end consumers should receive significant financial support till production costs fall, unless they are willing to pay a green premium. In less than a decade, hydrogen prices should not be an issue. “Electrolyser CAPEX alone, are expected to fall by around three-fourths compared to current levels – enough to enable renewable hydrogen production costs with low-cost renewable energy, to reach US$1.50/kg (AU$2.15/kg) by 2025,” wrote Hydrogen Europe in its “Steel from Solar Energy” study. With regard to scaling up, Hydrogen Europe wrote that the sector would need to access, alongside public support and both debt and equity finance to install the required additional renewable electricity generation. “Converting just a single steel plant with a capacity of 4 Mt of crude steel per year (EU average) would require: 1.2-1.3 GW of electrolysis running at full load, €3.3 billion of capital investment (including €1.2 billion for electrolysis) and between 10.2 to 21.7 ha of land for the electrolysis plant (AU$4.9 billion) (and additional area for new renewable power deployment).… When using solar PV exclusively for hydrogen production, the required electrolysis power would grow to around 4.5-5 GW, driving up the required CAPEX to almost €7 billion (AU$10.5 billion) for a single plant of average capacity,” Hydrogen Europe wrote. Multiple salt caverns could be necessary for storage capacity for a single steel plant, the trade association added. Hydrogen Europe launched the study during the Smarter E event in Munich.
In a new report, trade association RenewableUK calls for the creation of a green hydrogen roadmap in order to achieve the UK’s 5 GW target, fully exempt electrolysers from levies to reduce market distortions, and unlock strategic infrastructures. The report adds that high-skilled green jobs could provide ample opportunities for the UK to become an exporter of green hydrogen, especially to the EU. “The Scottish government has estimated that becoming an exporter of green hydrogen to Europe could create up to £25 billion of GVA [gross value add] and over 300,000 jobs in Scotland by 2045,” reported RenewableUK.
New Delhi-based Gail awarded a contract to set up one of the largest proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers in India. The project is to be installed at Gail’s Vijaipur Complex, in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna District. “The project has been designed to produce around 4.3 metric tons of hydrogen per day (approx. 10 MW capacity) with a purity of about 99.999 volume percent. It is scheduled to be commissioned by November 2023. In line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the project has been awarded to a vendor having domestic value addition of more than 50 percent,” Gail wrote on Thursday.
US-based heavy equipment and hydrogen technologies company Cummins is collaborating with heavy-duty truck manufacturer Daimler Truck North America (DTNA) to supply Freightliner Cascadia trucks with its Cummins hydrogen fuel cell powertrains for use in North America. “Freightliner will leverage Cummins’ fourth generation fuel cell powertrain, which provides improved power density, efficiency and durability,” wrote Cummins. Upon successful validation, the companies intend to have initial units available in 2024 for selected customers.
Meanwhile, Renault hopes to receive first orders for its hydrogen-powered minibuses and vans from the Netherlands and Germany soon, the head of the company’s light commercial vehicles department told Reuters.

Scientists at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the University of Leipzig in Germany have developed a new heat-storage material.
They claim it improves the energy efficiency of buildings, with potential use in passive cooling for PV modules and residential batteries. The new material is a shape-stabilised phase change material (ss-PCM) that can store up to five times more thermal energy than commercially available PCMs.
The ss-PCM is said to absorb large amounts of heat by changing its physical state from solid to liquid, and then releasing it when the material hardens.
“It could be used by the construction industry as large panels that could be integrated into walls,” said MLU scientist Thomas Hahn. “These would then absorb heat during the sunny hours of the day and release it again later when the temperature goes down.”
The ss-PCM was synthesised via a novel porogen-assisted sol-gel process, which resulted in high mechanical stability, according to the academics.
“In our invention, the heat storage material is enclosed in a framework of solid silicate and cannot escape due to high capillary forces,” said Hahn.
All the material configurations that were tested displayed a shape-stability of around 100%, a long-term performance of approximately 2,000 thermal cycles, and high chemical stability. The scientists said they achieved results regardless of the amount of porogen used in the synthesis.
“Until now the material is still only being produced in small quantities in the laboratory,” they said. “In the future, it can be combined with other steps to help to make buildings significantly more energy efficient or to passively cool photovoltaic systems and batteries, thereby increasing their efficiency.”
They introduced the material in “Influence of surfactants and organic polymers on monolithic shape-stabilised phase change materials synthesised via sol-gel route,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage. They also analysed the influence of the porogens sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) on ss-PCM properties.

The portrait, titled “The Big Switch”, started to take form when Rae heard Griffith speaking on the radio in March 2022 about the big switch to electricity for technologies that still run on combustion, a la fossil fuels. Griffith argued, as he has in pv magazine Australia, that electricity from the riches of renewable resources with which Australia is endowed would cut emissions and help our economy. 
Rae then contacted Griffith’s San Francisco office in the hope of painting his portrait for the Archibald Prize should he return to Australia, only to find that Griffith and his family had recently relocated from the US to Wollongong, NSW.

Interestingly, Rae’s portrait is a mix of oil on linen and solar panels. The idea was to create a “triptych for global warming”, a triptych being a three-panelled picture or carving, think Giotto’s 1330 “Stefaneschi Altarpiece” or Francis Bacon’s 1969 “Three Studies of Lucien Freud.” 
Rae made wonderful use of two solar panels to buffet the portrait of Griffith in the centre. Rae manages to capture a look of entreaty on Griffith’s face that lacks nothing in assurance. After all, when Griffith says “Electrify Everything”, he isn’t forwarding an outlandish idea, but rather the most reasoned and logical decision Australia could make, if only its politicians would flick the switch. 
“My portraits are always collaborations,” Rae told Art Gallery of NSW, “but this one went to the next level. We only had a month and the solar panels were quite an adventure. When we tried to cut them with a water jet, the toughened glass fractured but they were so beautiful we went with it.”

“Like this portrait,” Rae continued, “Australia’s climate policy is now going right down to the wire. It is crazed and cracked but the recipe is simple – electrify everything with renewables. We have to stop having debates, develop policies and hand the plans to engineers who are ready and waiting to get it done. Like Saul, they want to plug Australia into an abundant future.” 
The 2022 Archibald Prize was won by Blak Douglas’ portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens titled “Moby Dickens”. Rae’s entry was recognised as “Highly Commended”, the third such classification Rae has received in consecutive years.
