https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/30/agl-abandons-demerger-plan-in-the-face-of-investor-opposition/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 30, 2022",AGL abandons demerger plan in the face of investor opposition,"AGL Energy announced on Monday it will withdraw the plan to demerge its coal-focused generation business just two weeks before shareholders were due to vote on the proposal. AGL also announced chief executive Graeme Hunt and chairman Peter Botten will exit the company.
In a statement, AGL said the board “continues to believe that the demerger proposal offers the best way forward for AGL Energy and its shareholders” but no longer thinks the path is available.
“AGL Energy believes that the demerger proposal would have been supported by a majority of shareholders, both retail and institutional,” the statement reads. “However, having regard to anticipated voter turnout and stated opposition from a small number of investors including Grok Ventures, AGL Energy believes the demerger proposal will not receive sufficient support to meet the 75% approval threshold for a scheme of arrangement.
“In these circumstances, the AGL Energy Board considers that it is in the best interests of AGL Energy shareholders to withdraw the demerger proposal.”
Atlassian co-founder Cannon-Brookes, who has been a vocal campaigner against the demerger , took to social media to declare the announcement a “huge day for Australia”.
“Wow. A huge day for Australia,” he wrote. “Had to sit down and take it in. This live shot couldn’t be a better metaphor for a better, greener path ahead.
“We embrace the opportunities of decarbonisation with Aussie courage, tenacity and creativity.
“Lots of work but we can do this.”

Cannon-Brookes’ investment firm Grok Ventures acquired 11.28% of AGL earlier this month, becoming the largest shareholder in an attempt to defeat the demerger.
Under the proposed demerger, AGL would have been split into separate entities – energy retailer AGL Australia and generator Accel Energy which would have retained control of the existing coal-fired assets, including the Loy Yang A power station in Victoria, and the Liddell and Bayswater power stations in New South Wales.
Cannon-Brookes has described the demerger proposal as “deeply flawed”, claiming the two entities would be slower to shut down coal-fired power stations. AGL’s fossil fuel-foired power stations account for 8% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, making the company the single biggest emitter in Australia. Under the demerger proposal, Accel Energy was to continue burning coal until at least 2045.
AGL, which on Monday said it had spent an estimated $160 million on the demerger proposal, will now review its strategic direction, looking at how it can move forward in an environment of accelerating pressure on decarbonisation and energy affordability.
The board said its future directions would be guided by rapidly changing energy market policy settings, the continuing uplift in wholesale energy prices and growing shareholder expectations.
“Australia is at a pivotal moment in the transition of our energy system and the board remains strongly committed to decarbonisation,” the company said.
“AGL has been in ongoing discussions with key stakeholders in this regard and believes that the relevant dates for closure of coal-fired power stations will continue to be accelerated.”
AGL said shareholders and investors will be provided with an update on the strategic review in September, ahead of its 2021-22 financial year results update.
As part of the decision to withdraw the demerger proposal, AGL has also determined a “board and management renewal must occur through an orderly, expedited transition period with appropriate external advice”.
Chairman Peter Botten will resign from the board upon appointment of a replacement and Graeme Hunt will step down as chief executive officer and managing director. Hunt will continue to act in this role until the positions are filled. Board member Diane Smith-Gander and non-executive director Jacqueline Hey are also set to leave the company.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/30/developers-launch-crowd-funding-campaign-to-finance-nsw-solar-farm/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 30, 2022",Developers launch crowd-funding campaign to finance NSW solar farm,"Komo Energy is now seeking expressions of interest from potential investors with the company aiming to fund the construction of the planned $4 million Grong Grong Solar Farm being developed on the outskirts of the township, about one hour west of Wagga Wagga in south western New South Wales (NSW).
The Grong Grong Solar Farm capital raise offering has been launched through the Birchal platform, with Komo Energy saying it’s the first time everyday Australians have been able to invest in building a solar farm using the crowd equity finance model.
Komo Energy co-founder Jonathan Prendergast said the investment model provides direct ownership to the community and the response to the capital raise offering has “already been incredible”.
“A reason we are testing crowd equity and retail investment in a solar farm is that large-scale solar and wind is very complex,” he said.
“This crowd equity model hopes to show that everyday Australians are keen to support investment in new renewable energy, adding an additional model of finance to continue momentum in the transition to renewables and emissions reductions.”
The Grong Grong Solar Farm is being developed on a four-hectare site on landowner Gemma Purcell’s grain and sheep property about 500 metres from the town.

The 1.7MW solar farm, which has been designed battery ready, would have the capacity to power more than 700 households and reduce carbon emissions by 3,100 tonnes annually. The company intends to sell the clean energy generated on site to the NSW wholesale energy market and produce and sell Renewable Energy Certificates (LGCs) to the commercial market.
After three years in the planning and design stage, the developers said the project is now at finance stage and nearing shovel readiness, having secured an extendable 20-year land licence with Development Approval from the Narrandera Shire and procured an EPC contractor, and grid modelling approvals in place.
In February 2020, the project received a funding agreement for $1.3 million from the NSW Government Regional Community Energy Fund and is now aiming to raise the remaining approximately $750,000 needed to fund construction.
Grong Grong Solar Farm will also host the Haystacks Solar Garden, the first large-scale solar garden in Australia.

Komo Energy co-founder Gerald Arends said Australia was the perfect environment for community-owned solar projects.
“Australians lead the world in rooftop solar, now we believe we can expand that interest into owning shares in community solar farms,” he said. “The models combine the efficiency of mid-scale solar farms in strategically selected locations with community investment, a funding model that is popular overseas.
“It’s a key part of our mission to develop an ecosystem of local contractors and consultants to assist in the delivery and maintenance of these solar farms, providing jobs and investment opportunities for the immediate community.”
The call for expressions of interest in the Grong Grong Solar Farm investment is now open, with the raise open for investment on 14 June 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/30/australian-solar-projects-catalogued-by-global-mapping-tool/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 30, 2022",Australian solar projects catalogued by global mapping tool,"San Francisco-based Global Energy Monitor (GEM) has unveiled a new online mapping tool that catalogues utility-scale solar PV systems with capacities of 20MW or more.
The Global Solar Power Tracker (GSPT) can map solar projects of any status, including operational arrays or announced plants, as well as solar facilities that are under development or under construction. Each solar project is linked to a wiki page on the GEM wiki platform.
The tracking tool provides search results by project name, start-up year, operator, owner, country, capacity, and project status.
Currently, it catalogues 5,190 operating utility scale solar projects with a combined capacity of 298.7GW across 148 countries. It also includes another 3,551 prospective projects that would generate 651.6GW.
The mapping tool includes 260 solar projects in Australia, including 65 which have already commenced operations and 23 that have reached the construction stage. Another 95 are in the development phase.
GEM said Australia is ranked eighth for operating capacity with its 65 operational utility scale solar plants generating a combined 6.1GW of clean energy. China is a clear leader with 130.3GW of operational capacity, well ahead of the U.S. (43.4GW) and India (29GW). Vietnam (11.3GW) and Mexico (10.5GW) round out the top five.
Utility-scale solar accounts for roughly 65% of total global solar capacity with the remaining 35% being residential and commercial installations.
GEM project manager Ingrid Behrsin said the tool combines government, corporate, and other public information to provide project-level data, helping to show the speed and extent to which countries are building out solar power.
“Capturing the full extent of utility solar and wind built-out around the world is critical for measuring progress towards the energy transition,” she said. “With open-access project-level data like these, we are now in a much stronger position to track how countries are stacking up against their own stated renewables goals.”
GEM has also released a wind power tracker covering wind farm phases of 10MW or more. The online tool includes 13,263 operating utility-scale wind farm phases generating 681.4 GW in 144 countries, and an additional 5,235 prospective projects that would generate 882.0GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/30/novel-tech-for-extracting-hydrogen-gas-from-liquid-carriers/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 30, 2022",Novel tech for extracting hydrogen gas from liquid carriers,"From pv magazine Global | via the Hydrogen Stream
North Carolina State University (NCSU) has developed a continuous-flow reactor applying reusable photocatalyst and sunlight to extract hydrogen gas from its liquid organic carrier (LOHC) using less rhodium (Rh). The researchers achieved a 99% yield in three hours, reportedly eight times faster than conventional batch reactors. The room-temperature reactor resembles a thin, clear tube packed with micron-scale grains of titanium oxide (TiO2). The hydrogen-carrying liquid is pumped into one end of the tube. Only the outer grains of titanium oxide, the ones exposed to the sun at the other end of the tube, are coated with rhodium. These photoreactive catalysts react with the liquid carrier to release hydrogen molecules as a gas. “In a conventional batch reactor, 99% of the photocatalyst is titanium oxide, and 1% is rhodium. In our continuous flow reactor, we only need to use 0.025% rhodium, which makes a big difference in the final cost. A single gram of rhodium costs more than US$500,” said Milad Abolhasani, corresponding author of the paper recently published in ChemSusChem. According to the researchers, the system should be easy to scale up or scale out to allow for catalyst reuse on a commercial scale. “You can simply make the tube longer or merge multiple tubes running in parallel.” The flow system can run continuously for up to 72 hours before losing efficiency. The catalyst can be “regenerated” without removing it from the reactor in about six hours. The system can then be restarted and run at full efficiency.
Airbus launched its Zero Emission Development Centre (ZEDC) in Bristol, the United Kingdom, to develop, test, and manufacture cryogenic fuel systems. The centre will work on the full product capabilities from components up to the whole system and cryogenic testing. The new ZEDC joins other centres focused on cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks in Spain, Germany, and France. “All Airbus ZEDCs are expected to be fully operational and ready for ground testing with the first fully functional cryogenic hydrogen tank during 2023, and with flight testing starting in 2026,” the European aerospace corporation wrote. 
Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions reached an agreement with Ireland-based Fusion Fuel to study collaboration opportunities, aimed at expanding sales of electrolysers in Europe and Australia. Fusion Fuel will evaluate the use of Toshiba ESS membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) in its proprietary Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) eletrolysers; and Toshiba ESS will explore using its local sales channels to expand sales of Fusion Fuel’s PEM electrolysers in Australia. “Furthermore, the two companies will also explore potential collaboration for future sales of Toshiba ESS solid oxide electrolysis cells, which Toshiba ESS targets bringing to market in 2025,” Toshiba ESS wrote. 
Chile development agency Corfo signed agreements with regasification plant GNL Quintero, iron producer CAP, and industrial gas supplier Air Liquide to finance the development of the first green hydrogen production plants on an industrial scale in Chile. The GNL Quintero’s 10 MW project aims to develop, construct, and operate a green hydrogen plant in the Valparaíso Region. CAP’s 12 MW project focuses on the Biobío Region, while the Antofagasta Region will host Air Liquide’s 80 MW project. The three companies were awarded US$5.7 million (€5.3 million), US$3.6 million, and US$11.7 million, respectively. “These three initiatives are part of the six selected by Corfo last December, which, once installed, will have a total electrolysis capacity of 388 MW, equivalent in size to what is currently in operation worldwide. They are expected to generate investments of US$1,000 million and produce more than 45,000 tons of hydrogen per year,” Corfo wrote. 
The German Parliament passed the bill tabled by the Government to bypass specific procedural steps, like the need for an environmental impact assessment, to install two floating terminals in Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel by the coming winter.  The LNG facilities should be “hydrogen-ready.”
US-based Air Products, Oman’s energy group OQ, and Riyadh-based developer ACWA Power signed a joint development agreement toward a multibillion-dollar investment in a world-scale green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility powered by renewable energy in Oman. 
Air Liquide invested US$250 million to open its largest liquid hydrogen production and logistics infrastructure facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The facility will produce 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day, mainly for the mobility sector in California, wrote the Paris-based industrial gas business. 
French green hydrogen producer Lhyfe and the Swedish local energy company Trelleborgs Energi teamed up for a pre-study for a local renewable hydrogen production system in southernmost Sweden. The results are due to be presented in the summer of 2022. Earlier this week, Lhyfe entered into an industrial agreement with Spain’s EDP Renewables to identify, develop, build, and manage renewable hydrogen projects.
Algeria’s Sonatrach and Italy’s Eni signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accelerate the development of gas fields in Algeria and decarbonisation via green hydrogen.
