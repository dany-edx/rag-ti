The battery, set to be located on the NSW Central Coast, forms part of the state government’s response to last month’s announcement by Origin Energy that it will bring forward the closure of the 2,880MW Eraring Power Station to August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
Origin said its decision reflected “the rapidly changing conditions in the national electricity market, which are increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations”.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean has admitted the closure will cause problems for the grid if the capacity is not replaced but said the Waratah Super Battery, set to be the largest network standby battery in the southern hemisphere, will help to release grid capacity and secure the state’s energy future.
“There is currently existing generation across NSW that consumers in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong cannot access because of constraints in the transmission network,” he said.
“Currently, power lines must operate well below their capacity so they can handle any sudden shocks, like a power surge from a bushfire or lighting strike.”
The new battery will allow this reserve transmission capacity to be freed up and used to transfer additional energy to consumers from existing generation. It does this by acting as a ‘shock absorber’ for the electricity grid – absorbing any power surge, keeping the transmission system within its technical limits if there is an energy shock.

“The Waratah Super Battery will allow for more electricity to flow through the network, unlocking this excess capacity and supplying the families and businesses of NSW a reliable and stable energy supply,” Kean said.
The Waratah Super Battery, which will be initially funded through a new Transmission Acceleration Facility promised to “fast-track the delivery of critical transmission infrastructure”, is expected to be operational well before the Eraring Power Station is closed in 2025.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), which was established to oversee the state government’s renewable infrastructure plan, said it is “seeking innovative solutions and site options from the market” to deliver the battery.
The government said it will consider proposals to build the battery on any suitable site, including NSW Government-owned land.
Among the possible locations being suggested for the new battery is the former Munmorah Power Station site next door to the 667MW gas-fired Colongra Power Station near Doyalson on the Central Coast. The former 1.4GW coal-fired power plant was closed in 2012.
EnergyCo will host a virtual Market Forum on 31 March 2022 to provide interested parties with an overview of the project and the competitive battery developer procurement process.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/24/market-influences-tipped-to-end-rooftop-solars-record-run/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 24, 2022",Market influences tipped to end rooftop solar’s record run,"New figures published by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) show Australia’s renewable energy market continued to set new records in 2021 but Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BloombergNEF) analyst Leonard Quong says the nation’s embrace of rooftop solar PV may be on the slide.
“Australia’s residential solar market will pass its 2021 peak and deteriorating economics will see annual capacity additions slide to 2.5GW in 2022,” Quong said.
“The fall in installations have less to do with physical saturation of rooftops, although that is a factor, and more to do with the impact a tidal wave of solar is having on the market.”
The CER’s December 2021 Quarterly Carbon Market Report shows Australia set renewable energy records for the fifth consecutive year in 2021 with approximately 380,000 rooftop solar PV systems installed across the nation. The record number of installs delivered a combined total of 3.2GW of rooftop solar PV capacity, 7% more than the 3GW installed in 2020.
That surge led Australia’s clean energy generation to a record 31.4% of all electricity produced in the National Electricity Market (NEM), more than double the 15% renewable energy delivered to the market in 2017.
CER chair David Parker said rooftop solar had been a key contributor as renewable energy had continued to shine in 2021, with almost one third of the nation’s households now generating solar power on their roofs.
“Rooftop solar PV led the way for renewable energy with a record 3.2GW installed in 2021, despite extensive lockdowns and reduced installations in two of Australia’s biggest markets – New South Wales and Victoria,” he said.
“Australia’s uptake of rooftop solar PV at over 3 million systems and over 16GW of capacity is world leading, with one in three suitable homes now having rooftop solar.”

Despite rooftop solar’s impressive performance in 2021, Sydney-based Quong said market influences, including network curtailment of excess renewable energy have emerged as legitimate deterrents for those looking to make the switch to solar.
“The economic appeal of solar is declining as federal government rebates wind down and network operators put in place new rules to limit and control rooftop solar exports,” he said.
Quong said the curtailment regulations and winding back of rebates, combined with lower retail rates, have increased the time it takes for homeowners to see a return on their investment.
Meanwhile, Quong said decades of policy uncertainty and the challenges of integrating renewable energy into grids are starting to take a toll on solar.
BloombergNEF said investment in large-scale renewable energy capacity was just $2.2 billion in 2021, down 67% from its record high in 2018.
Despite forecasting a decline in rooftop solar installs for 2022, Quong said there is cause for optimism.
“There are bright spots on the horizon, corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) and state policies continue to drive demand for new capacity,” he said.
“States ambitions alone could see Australia exceed 60% renewable energy supply by 2035.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/24/turnbull-points-to-pumped-hydro-as-ultimate-storage-solution/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 24, 2022",Turnbull points to pumped hydro as ‘ultimate’ storage solution,"With the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasting at least 45GW/620GWh of energy storage will be needed to cater for the transition of the nation’s energy system from fossil fuels to renewables, former prime minister Malcom Turnbull has pointed to pumped hydro energy storage projects, including the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 project, as the ideal technology.
Speaking at the Australian Energy and Battery Storage conference in Sydney on Wednesday Turnbull said energy storage, and in particular Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES), is the single most important element in Australia’s ongoing energy transition.
“The transition will require not simply green power to replace coal, but vastly more supplies of electricity to cater for the electrification of sectors, like transportation, household heating which rely on fossil fuels as well as the production of green hydrogen,” he said.
“We need more storage and above all we need projects which provide at least eight hours storage and more and are in a form that can be widely emulated.”
This need for energy storage is predominantly driven by the urgency to replace aging coal units with AEMO’s modelling showing that up to 14GW of the current 23GW of coal-fired generation could exit the market by 2030.
In its Draft Integrated System Plan (ISP) released late last year AEMO highlights that 60% of coal capacity would come out of the Australian system in the next eight years.

In its Draft Optimal Development Path, AEMO says nine times today’s utility-scale renewable energy would be needed to continue delivering affordable, reliable and secure power to consumers.
To firm that renewable generation, major investment in storage is required, with 45GW/620 GWh of dispatchable generation, including utility-scale batteries, hydro and other forms of energy storage needed. These will play the critical role of filling the gaps when renewable energy is not available.
“We need much more storage,” Turnbull said on Wednesday. “AEMO suggests at least another 45GW and for all the obvious reasons of security and grid stability it should be distributed and ideally located close to existing transmission.
“Even more importantly it should be, wherever possible, in a format that is repeatable.
“Obviously pumped storage is not replicable in the way a battery is, but the raw truth is that about 95% of the world’s stored electricity is in pumped hydro systems.”
Turnbull pointed to the $4.6 billion expansion of the existing 4.1GW Snowy Mountain Scheme as a prime example of a long-duration energy storage solution.
The Snowy 2.0 project, which involves linking the Tantangara and Talbingo dams via 27 kilometres of tunnels, will provide 2GW of dispatchable energy and provide 350GWh of large-scale storage, enough to power the equivalent of 500,000 homes for over a week during peak demand.
“Snowy 2.0 is the ultimate long-duration storage asset,” he said. “It will be able to generate 2000MW for seven-and-a-half days without repumping. Which is enormously valuable.”

Turnbull, who is now serving as chair of Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), said pumped hydro energy storage projects are ideally suited to provide longer-duration forms of energy storage, with the economics for battery projects of that scale not yet competitive.
“It’s easy to see a business case for a battery that can discharge for an hour or two or three or four,” he said. “FCAS (Frequency Control Ancillary Services) revenues, basic arbitrage all stack up. But storage for eight or more and more hours is harder to justify, at least in today’s market. But if we want to keep the lights on all the time, we will need it.
“We have to plan for a world where we have stopped burning coal and gas and when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. We won’t have any electricity unless we have stored it in some way.”
Turnbull said the technology already exists to support the transition to a net-zero economy, dismissing the Federal Government’s continued support for coal and gas as “as irresponsible as it is surreal”.
“There is a lot of lazy, glib talk about how the transition to net zero requires new technologies, innovations yet to spring from the imagination of a new generation of inventors,” he said.
“Don’t believe a word of it. We have the tools to do this job, right now. Variable renewable energy – wind and solar – supported by storage – batteries, pumped storage and green hydrogen – can take us to a zero-emission energy world.
“Of course new technologies, and refinements to existing ones, will emerge – whether it is bigger and better batteries and electrolysers, smarter turbines, or the creation of virtual power plants to name just a few.
“That’s great. But it is no excuse for not moving fast today. We have no time to waste.”

Lithium iron phosphate batteries will overhaul nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) devices in 2028 and electric vehicle (EV) battery demand will continue to outstrip supply until next year, according to analyst Wood Mackenzie.
Pointing to EV battery shortages last year, prompted by rampant demand and rising raw material costs, WoodMac consultant Jiayue Zheng today predicted the vehicle market which accounts for almost 80% of current battery demand will amount to 3TWh of device storage capacity by the end of the decade.
The US-owned analyst issued a press release today in which it predicted European battery manufacturers will overhaul their North American rivals this year as global storage companies plan to develop 300 sites with a total of more than 5.5TWh of annual manufacturing capacity by 2030.
The 90% share of global device manufacturing held by Asia-Pacific countries – and dominated by China – last year is expected to retreat to 69% this decade, according to Edinburgh-based, Verisk-owned WoodMac.
By that point, Europe will have cornered more than 20% of the world market, according to the analyst, although Chinese giant Catl – Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd – will continue to lead, provided it follows through on plans for more than 800GWh of manufacturing capacity. South Korean rival LG has stated plans for around 450GWh of factories by 2030, according to WoodMac, with Japanese brand Panasonic expected to be the world’s third largest battery maker by that point, with annual production capacity of 300GWh.
A graphic issued by WoodMac, compiled from existing factory capacity and new project announcements, had Northvolt as the biggest European battery maker in 2030, with 150GWh of production capacity, and Farasis as North America’s sole representative, with around 125GWh of lines, although the Californian company plans to reach that milestone in 2025.
The analyst said NCM batteries retained half of the global battery market last year.

Tesla boss Elon Musk insisted on coming to Berlin from California for the official start of production of the first gigafactory in Europe. Just outside the capital, in Grünheide, in Brandenburg, the first Tesla Model Y rolled off the assembly line on Tuesday, and Musk handed it over to the new owners. A total of 30 cars were handed over to customers.
Brandenburg’s prime minister, Dietmar Woidke (SPD), also attended the commissioning ceremony; as did federal chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD); federal economics minister Robert Habeck; and Brandenburg’s economics minister, Jörg Steinbach, and environment minister, Axel Vogel.
“The fact that you have chosen Brandenburg is good for Tesla and good for the future region of Berlin-Brandenburg,” explained Woidke in his speech at the opening of the factory. “Tesla is the outstanding example of Brandenburg’s new economic dynamic. The first European gigafactory attracts a lot of attention everywhere. This ensures that our country becomes even better known as a high-tech location,” Woidke continued. The German state sees good opportunities to attract more investors. There are already plans for lithium-ion battery production in Brandenburg. Overall, a value chain for electromobility could emerge, so Woidke hopes.
🇩🇪🇩🇪 Danke Deutschland!! 🇩🇪🇩🇪
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 22, 2022

Musk tweeted “Thank you Germany” on the day of the opening, in German. He had announced the construction of the factory in Brandenburg in mid-November 2019. However, he only received the final approval two weeks ago. Before that, Tesla built at record speed at its own risk, and with some preliminary approval from the authorities. Numerous requirements still had to be met before production could start. Recently, the factory’s water supply caused a stir but this issue seems to be solved now.
The factory will create thousands of jobs. Tesla plans to produce up to 500,000 Model Y electric vehicles at the Grünheide site in the first expansion stage. The vehicle is an, approximately two-ton, mid-size car in the manufacturer’s range, with a starting price of around €64,000 (AU$94,000). The range should be around 500km. In addition, a production facility for battery cells will also be set up at the site.
