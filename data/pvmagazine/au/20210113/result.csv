https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/13/australian-step-change-could-see-over-40000-jobs-created-in-queensland-alone/,"EMPLOYMENT,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 13, 2021","Australian Step Change could see over 40,000 jobs created in Queensland alone","When the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) put out its integrated System Plan in July last year, it included four possible scenarios. The most ambitious was its Step Change scenario. It is also the only scenario, according to Solar Citizen’s report, which is compatible with limiting climate change to within 1.4°C to 1.8°C.
Focussing on Queensland, the community group determined the state would see more than double (233%) the amount of large-scale solar and wind generation built by 2030 than currently exists or is committed, while rooftop solar capacity modelled to become four times greater than Queensland’s largest coal generator, if AEMO’s Step Change scenario were adopted.
According to its modelling, approximately 43,500 clean energy job years would be created in the construction and installation of solar, wind and distributed storage by 2030 and an additional 2,000 jobs in operations and maintenance if global, state and federal governments choose ambitious emission reduction policies.
Those calculations do not even account for potential jobs in large-scale battery storage, pumped hydro or hydrogen projects, the report adds.
Under Solar Citizen’s modelling of the scenario, Queensland’s rooftop solar capacity grew to over 7000 MW by 2030. That translates to the creation of an additional 21,900 installation job years, and 750 jobs in operations and maintenance.
“By 2040 this grows to more than 9,200 MW and creates a further 12,700 installation job years, and another 440 jobs in operations and maintenance,” the report says.
Also modelled to thrive under the Step Change, distributed battery storage could grow its capacity to 1,250 MW by 2030. “This growth would underpin 6,500 installation job years by 2030, and 350 jobs in operations and maintenance. By 2040 this grows to more than 2,350 MW and creates a further 6,100 installation job years, and another 330 jobs in operations and maintenance,” the report reads.
Following the Step Change path would see even more sizeable benefits in the more distant future, according to the report. “By 2040, a total of 92,600 construction and installation job years would be created, and 4,600 in operations and maintenance. Averaging the number of construction and installation job years over the 20 year period equates to over 4,600 ongoing jobs over that period.”
By comparison, AEMO’s Central scenario, which reflects Australia’s current path, would see 21,700 fewer job years in the construction and installation of solar, wind and distributed battery storage by 2030. “By 2040 this will grow to a total of 43,300 fewer construction and installation job years. The Central scenario would also see almost 2,000 fewer jobs in operations and maintenance by 2040.”
Jobs creation has been a key drawcard for the push towards renewables worldwide, with numerous government’s turning to new renewable energy infrastructure to recover economically from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. In Australia, the Million Jobs Plan released last year by think-tank Beyond Zero Emissions envisioned a green scaffold on which Australia’s economy could rebuild and create 1.8 million new jobs through renewables and low emissions projects. Widely lauded, New South Wales, Victoria, and other smaller state state governments have since released state budgets that focus on renewable infrastructure and emission cutting technologies to create jobs and reboot the economy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/13/blossoming-west-australian-carbon-footprint-app-launches-business-edition/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 13, 2021",Blossoming West Australian carbon footprint app launches business edition,"It was 2012 when Vanessa Rauland, who was doing her PhD at the time, volunteered to help her local South Fremantle High School become Australia’s first carbon neutral school. The experience, which was complicated and would have been extremely costly had it not involved volunteers, became the seed for what would go on to become the ClimateClever app. “We saw the opportunity to simplify the process and make it more affordable,” Rauland told pv magazine Australia.
“Right from the start, I was really motivated by the clear opportunity that schools had to influence their communities through students taking their sustainability and ‘low carbon’ knowledge home and educating, upskilling and empowering their families to become more resource efficient and sustainable at home.
“There’s no denying that we need much stronger policies, regulations and climate action at the national level. But what is definitely clear, is that the local level is where real and quick climate action is being taken,” Rauland said.
While its genesis was schools, ClimateClever has gone on to develop an app specifically aimed at households and on February 1, will launch its business-oriented app. With arguably more incentive and obligation, businesses – especially big business – have come under increasing pressure to adopt strong climate targets. Designed to take businesses on the journey from measurement to implementation, ClimateClever’s business app allows companies to both measure their carbon footprint from a variety of sources and understand how to reduce it by choosing actions from a growing database of low carbon actions that have been added by the community.
ClimateClever
ClimateClever is hardly alone in that offering today though. Thanks to global climate strikes and a dramatic upswing in climate-change induced natural disasters, like the Black Summer bushfires, Australia’s cognisance and footprint calculation app scene today is very different than it was when the inspiration first struck Rauland in 2012. Yet while there are a now a number of emission-calculating platform, many of these, Rauland laments, are often frustratingly inaccurate.
“Having worked in the field of climate change and climate policy for over 10 years as an academic, I personally take the view that we don’t have the time and luxury of estimating anymore.”
With the list of possible carbon emissions sources as long as a piece of string, Rauland and the ClimateClever team have opted to focus on the main sources of emissions which can be accurately calculated, such as emissions from electricity, gas, water and waste. It is also in the process of adding flights and vehicles, and is hoping to one day be able to include food – though Rauland is waiting until there is an accurate way of capturing that data.
Pandering to human’s competitive streak, the app also allows users – be they schools, businesses or individuals – to compare their footprints. “This can be highly motivating, so we thought, why not encourage some healthy competition amongst our ClimateClever community?!”
Competitive streak aside, what Rauland found initially when the ClimateClever schools program launched in 2018 was a dearth of knowledge as to what’s normal. “Most schools had no idea how they were performing, let along how others were. By providing them with the ability to compare data, it helped them to identify where they were doing poorly, as well as discover the reasons for it.” Be they water or gas leaks, unhelpful behaviours like setting air conditioning temperature too low, or simply having more appliances than the average, comparison gives users a ballpark understanding. “Even at the household level, I often hear people saying ‘but isn’t five TV’s in the house normal?’”
Ultimately, Rauland wants to create through ClimateClever a network of climate champions who are able to see how much money they’re saving alongside their righteous planet saving.
The response to the apps, Rauland says, has blown the small Fremantle-based team away. Since launching its national schools app in 2018 following a ‘low tech’ excel-driven pilot, ClimateClever has partnered with a number of WA city councils, Curtin University, and many schools across Australia. “One of the things we often hear from our new users is around how easy it is to reduce your footprint without significantly affecting your lifestyle or investing a huge amount of money.”
“I know as individuals, we sometimes feel powerless and that as one person, we don’t make a difference. But collectively, our actions can be very powerful.
“By collecting the aggregated data, we can show the massive impact we can have when we work together. Plus, the more empowered and ‘climate’ aware a community is, the more likely they are to put greater pressure on our other levels of government to do the same.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/13/australias-green-hydrogen-certification-scheme-to-be-developed-with-german-peak-body/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,GERMANY",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 13, 2021",Australia’s green hydrogen certification scheme to be developed with German peak body,"The partnership, announced on Tuesday, will see the two peak bodies cooperate to ensure customers are able to buy certifiably green hydrogen, rather than variants made from fossil fuels. The national, industry-led Zero Carbon Certification Scheme will include the creation of a ‘guarantee of origin,’ allowing the production of the hydrogen, ammonia and other renewable hydrogen based fuels and materials to be tracked and authenticated.
The scheme will likely mirror the CertifHy scheme currently being developed in Europe, and will prove important as Australia gears up to become an exporter of renewable hydrogen-based fuels.
“Australia will be a major producer of renewable hydrogen, renewable ammonia and renewable metals and Germany will be a major consumer of these products. It makes absolute sense for Australia’s Smart Energy Council to directly partner with the German Energy Agency to help build these industries and develop a credible certification scheme,” Smart Energy Council chief, John Grimes, said.
“We are cognisant of the important work being undertaken by CertifHy on hydrogen certification and we would expect to work closely with them, noting that we will focus exclusively on zero emissions projects.”
The Smart Energy Council will work with the German Energy Agency through its Hydrogen Australia division. As part of the partnership, the bodies will also work together on initiatives to support new green hydrogen developments, as well as identify barriers, ultimately driving trade between Australia and Germany across the hydrogen supply chain.
The scheme will also cooperate with international partner network the Global Alliance Powerfuels, which is also headed by Germany’s dena, to foster the development of carbon neutral powerfuels.
Andreas Kuhlmann, CEO of dena and spokesman for the Global Alliance Powerfuels, welcomed the partnership. “International partnerships are key to tackling climate change and the attainment of our joint energy objectives,” Kuhlmann said in a statement.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/13/origin-to-build-australias-largest-battery-at-its-largest-coal-fired-power-station/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 13, 2021",Origin to build Australia’s largest battery at its largest coal-fired power station,"In late November 2020, Origin Energy (Origin) unveiled plans to build up to five big batteries as the Australian energy utility looks to pick up the pace on its transition to clean energy. 
One of these big batteries is set to be built at Australia’s largest power station – the 2.88 GW Eraring coal generator in the New South Wales (NSW) Hunter region. The coal-fired power station, which supplies around a quarter of NSW’s energy needs, is set to close in 2032. Building the battery at the site would allow Origin to use the ageing coal-fired power plant’s existing infrastructure and network connectivity. However, the exact size of the battery was not then revealed. 
However, yesterday Origin announced that it is planning the nation’s largest battery at Eraring Power Station with an overall capacity of 700 MW and a dispatch duration of 4 hours (that’s approximately four times larger than the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia). The announcement comes as Origin issued an Expression of Interest (EOI) as it looks for a large-scale battery energy storage supplier and installer. 
Origin Executive General Manager, Energy Supply and Operations, Greg Jarvis, said deploying a battery at Eraring supports Origin’s decarbonisation objectives and recent NSW energy policy announcements.
“We recognise we have an important role to play in positioning Origin’s electricity generation portfolio to support Australia’s rapid transition to renewables,” said Jarvis. “A large-scale battery at Eraring will help us better support renewable energy and maintain reliable supply for customers, by having long-duration storage ready to dispatch into the grid at times when renewable sources are not available.”
Origin has already lodged a Connection Enquiry with NSW transmission network service provider TransGrid to the aim of connecting the battery to the National Electricity Market (NEM). 
Once a preferred supplier is determined, required permitting achieved, and network connection established, Origin expects the operational capacity of this mega battery to be deployed over three phases, with the first expected to see completion by late 2022. 
“The deployment of this battery at Eraring will support Origin’s orderly transition away from coal-fired generation by 2032,” continued Jarvis, “while complementing the policy objectives of the NSW energy roadmap.”
The game is afoot 
The race for the title of Australia’s largest battery is certainly on. Indeed, Origin’s announcement came on the same day as French renewables giant (and owner of Hornsdale Power Reserve) Neoen filed planning documents for a 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery to be built west of Sydney. 
This follows on from a massive year for Neoen in 2020, in which the company was awarded a contract for a 300 MW / 450 MWh Victoria Big Battery to be constructed on the outskirts of Geelong as well as securing a 14-year contract with the Australian Capital Territory.
However, Origin has already submitted plans to build a two-stage, 300 MW solar and battery storage project near Morgan in South Australia. And has also outlined plans to install big batteries at three of its biggest gas generator plants – up to 300MW at Mortlake in Victoria, up to 200MW at Uranquinty in New South Wales, and an unspecified size on the Darling Downs in Queensland.
AGL, another of Australia’s largest and longest-serving polluters, is also making rapid headway toward its goal of 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage in its portfolio by FY 2024. AGL has already announced a 200 MW large grid-scale battery project based at Loy Yang in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, and a 250 MW, four-hour duration battery system in development at the site of its Torrens Island Power station in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/13/interview-utility-scale-battery-storage-in-sungrows-sights-for-2021/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JANUARY 13, 2021","Interview: Utility scale, battery storage in Sungrow’s sights for 2021","pv magazine Australia: How would you describe Sungrow’s performance in the Australian market in 2020?
Joe Zhou: Although it had its unique challenges, 2020 was a highly successful year for Sungrow Australia. Our market share in Australia for the residential segment has grown to 20%-22% and our new range of commercial inverters – which we call the CX Premium range.
Can you say what the volume of demand for commercial segment inverters?
The CX Premium has been well received. I can say we had megawatts of rollouts in 2020. I would say that our efforts over the past years, particularly in providing superior solutions and services, has finally paid off.
And what are you targeting in 2021?
Our target for 2021 is to grow our market share in the residential segment to more than 25% and get a stronger foothold in the commercial segment – with a market share of 10%-15%. For front-of-the-meter projects, we foresee the deployment of our central inverter stations in several sub-5MW solar farms and start our journey with few utility-scale projects as well.

Why is that it has been easier for Sungrow to sell into the residential segment, while utility scale remains a more difficult nut to crack?
Our local presence in the Australian market for more than 10 years helps us resonate with our customers and their unique needs. Our strong team of 20 personnel operate from our North Sydney office and our warehousing in Greater Sydney, which highly assists us to provide timely support to our customers.
I would say, at least for the next couple of years the residential segment will be our strongest market and we look forward to reaching similar accolades in the C&I and utility-scale markets in the coming years.
Australia has good governmental policies and a strong regulatory framework, which supports the uptake of solar PV, especially for the residential and commercial segments, which allows Sungrow Australia to serve this ever-growing industry.
Sungrow has deployed more than 450 MW of inverters in the Australian residential segment for 2020 and as mentioned earlier, we expect to make a bang in 2021 with our deployments in C&I and utility projects.
And remember, Sungrow is the largest inverter manufacturer worldwide. Our factories in China and India have more than 50 GW of annual deployment capacity in inverters and more 6 GWh of Battery Energy Storage Systems and we have a complete portfolio of solutions to address all of the market segments.
I understand this, but in the utility scale segment in Australia, SMA still enjoys very strong market share. How does Sungrow intend to tackle this? How would you characterise the unique grid challenges in Australia for utility scale projects, and how can Sungrow address this?
It is a very good question. SMA certainly does have the first-mover advantage of having entered the Australian utility market around five years ago and currently has a market share of around 65% in the utility-scale projects.
Sungrow has been enjoying a strong market share in utility-scale projects in the Americas, Europe, India, and Southeast Asia. However, the stringent grid connection requirements in Australia deterred Sungrow to enter this segment early on but we refocussed by growing our local grid connection team since 2018, which has paved the way to clear the GPS for a 300 MW project and many more projects are in the pipeline to get the GPS finalized.
I’m confident that 2021 shall mark the year for Sungrow Australia in this space.
Recent regulations in South Australia created complications for rooftop inverter suppliers. Sungrow partnered with Solar Analytics to address this. How did this work and how effective would you say it was?
The South Australia Government published its new remote disconnection requirement for solar and energy storage systems in 2020. Solar Analytics is one of the relevant remote agents that is nominated by the government and it can use Application Programming Interface (API) to control Sungrow inverters via Sungrow portal iSolarCloud. This control pathway is an innovative solution, with no need for any additional hardware and extra commissioning which minimizes the system and labour cost considerably. In addition, Sungrow with Solar Analytics API control is one of the first batches of integrated solution approved by the SA government which made our partnership highly effective.
Australia is a competitive battery storage market and growth is expected. How much does Sungrow engage with storage in Australia and what has been your experience?
Sungrow has been integrating C&I and utility-scale Battery Energy Storage Systems [BESS] since 2015. As highlighted earlier, we have a capacity to deploy 6 GWh+ BESS annually and we have successfully completed 1,000+ projects globally.
In the Australian landscape, we have already commissioned more than 10 C&I BESS projects since 2018 and we have a strong project pipeline for 2021. We are also in the final stages to finalize the GPS for a 100 MW/300 MWh of utility-scale BESS Project in Australia and we’re working on several other projects.
As for residential, we will be launching our new HV batteries this month with a capacity of 9.6 kWh, which could be stacked up to 100.4 kWh.
These HV batteries, coupled with our strong foothold on the hybrid inverter offerings, which include VPP capabilities, will see Sungrow entering this ever-growing storage market in Australia more.
