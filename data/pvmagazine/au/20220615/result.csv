The drastic moves comes after weeks of soaring prices which reached a climax on Monday and Tuesday after price caps came into effect and generators withdrew massive amounts of capacity, plunging the national grid into mayhem.
It is the first time such a measure has been deployed across the national market. The decision came after a crisis meeting between energy ministers, companies and regulators earlier today.
Publishing its market notice announcement at 2.01pm, AEMO said it had “determined that it is necessary to suspend the spot market in all regions… because it has become impossible to operate the spot market in accordance with the provisions of the [National Electricity] Rules.”
The suspension will be reviewed daily for each region.

In terms of the economics of what happens now, AEMO says generators will be offered a pre-determined pricing schedule for each region. This amounts to one compensation scheme and it is expected to simplify things after the operator was forced into the more chaotic market direction mode this week.
In making the announcement AEMO’s CEO, Daniel Westerman, said the market operator was forced to direct 5 GW of generation through direct interventions yesterday, and it was no longer possible to reliably operate the spot market or the power system this way.
“In the current situation suspending the market is the best way to ensure a reliable supply of electricity for Australian homes and businesses,” he said.
“The situation in recent days has posed challenges to the entire energy industry, and suspending the market would simplify operations during the significant outages across the energy supply chain.”
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY – IN THE SIMPLEST LANGUAGE POSSIBLE?

The energy crisis that has descended across Australia’s east is the result of a number of events which have compounded one another. Firstly, fossil fuel prices have been soaring globally, pushing up the cost of generation. Likewise, a number of Australia’s ageing fossil fleets have recently failed and are now out of action.
The onset of winter has also seen a cold snap descend on the country, driving up demand and driving down solar and wind output.
Furthermore, fossil generators, which still today very much dominate Australia’s electricity system, have benefitted from the disparity between supply and demand as it has driven up prices. It has led a number of analysts, including Victoria Energy Policy Centre director Bruce Mountain, to the belief that generators have widely been ‘gaming’ the system, withholding much needed capacity to fetch even higher prices.
The reached new peaks this week on Monday and Tuesday as price caps, another extreme measure introduced by AEMO recently, saw a mass exodus of capacity which has brought us to the situation today where the spot market has been entirely suspended by the operator.
New South Wales energy minister Matt Kean and Queensland’s Mick De Brenni both welcomed the move from AEMO this afternoon.
“This decision will help prevent energy companies from putting energy reliability at risk by unnecessarily withdrawing supply,” Kean said.
“This comes after the Australian Energy Regulator yesterday reminded generators of their obligations under the National Electricity Rules.
“I expect power companies to do the right thing by their customers and the country,” Kean added.

The study is being conducted by Xodus Group and is looking at the prospects of adding a green hydrogen component to the company’s ‘well advanced’ Bristol Springs Solar (BSS) proposal near the town of Waroona south of Perth.
“As part of the Green Hydrogen Study, the Xodus Group was asked to determine what size solar production, as a minimum, would be required to be able to commence green hydrogen production,” Frontier’s Managing Director Mike Young said. 
“We originally anticipated this would be larger than the Stage One Project (114Mwdc) to justify the additional capital costs associated with hydrogen production. The BSS Project is, however, uniquely located around significant existing infrastructure, which is critical for the hydrogen industry, meaning our initial capital costs will be significantly less compared to more remote projects for first production.”

“Our ability to service the most likely first adopters of hydrogen (gas pipeline and long-haul transportation) means we are also likely to have customers for our product,” he added.
Frontier recommenced trading on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in March after a strongly supported $8 million capital raising that the company said has validated its new clean energy strategy.
The Bristol Springs Solar Project is to built near the Worsley alumina refinery about 120 kilometres south of Perth, would have an initial generation capacity of 114 MW (DC) but Frontier said additional land acquisition opportunities are available that could allow for an increase up to 500 MW.
Young said the company remains on track to commence project construction in 2023, though it remains to be determined when the hydrogen element will be introduced.
“The development of our Bristol Springs project is well advanced, but the current project is only the first stage of our long-term vision,” he said.
“We aim to become one of the first commercial green hydrogen producers in Australia.

Jonathan Fisk, the company’s director and co-founder, attributed the rebound to the election’s delivery of a pro-renewable energy parliament coupled with surging energy prices.
“The first major wave of inquiries was the week after the election and more people who inquire are buying,” Fisk said.
“We’ve sold a lot more batteries. Of new PV system sales, almost one in two orders have batteries added. Storage is the tool that makes solar fly. 
“This greater appetite for batteries is also because more people want to future-proof their homes so they can add an EV [electric vehicle] when it arrives.”

Fisk said another major change in the 2022 market was customers ordering larger systems. “Two years ago, a customer ordering 25-35 kilowatt-hours of energy storage was a massive sale whereas now, it’s just another one before lunch,” he said.
“While the cheaper end of the market has died 1000 deaths, the premium end of the market is still going strong. There is a much greater degree of optimism out there. Customers are voting with their money.”
Fisk described the situation Australia’s solar industry now finds itself in as “the the eye of the perfect storm.” 
“Energy prices are increasing and are going to stay high for some time because of a decade of poor government energy policy with no investment in the grid. But we also face huge opportunities as the new government intends to spend money on upgrading the grid to remove restrictions on small-scale solar.
“Whereas a year or two ago, consumers only wanted solar to reduce the cost of power from the grid, now they want to buy enough solar and storage that they are independent from it, unless there’s a week of cloudy days.
“We are entering a new golden age for solar and storage.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/15/queensland-hits-back-at-sun-tax-scaremongering-as-energy-panic-deepens/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 15, 2022",Queensland hits back at sun tax ‘scaremongering’ as energy panic deepens,"As the panic around energy continues across the eastern seaboard, the Queensland government has dispelled claims from the Murdoch media and opposition Liberal National Party (LNP) that it would be introducing a ‘sun tax’ – that is, allowing household to be charged for exporting excess solar energy.
Queenslanders today awoke to headlines from Newscorp’s Courier Mail that a “‘Sun tax’ hit looms for solar customers.” 
Within hours, the state’s minister for energy and renewables, Mick de Brenni, issued a blunt statement saying: “there is no change to solar feed-in tariffs in Queensland.”
“It’s a bit rich from the LNP to be talking about solar when they cut solar feed-in tariffs.
“They didn’t get renewables then, and they still don’t get it now.
“The Opposition Leader should apologise for scaremongering at a time when Queenslanders should be encouraged to install rooftop solar.”
Fears about a ‘sun tax’ have been floating around for years, but reached a new level last year when the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) officially changed our energy market rules to allow networks to charge solar owners for feeding energy into the grid at certain times of the day, known as two-way pricing. Proponents of the rule change say the charges will help pay for infrastructure upgrades necessary for transitioning to decentralised renewable energy systems. 
Both Queensland and the Victorian governments quickly ruled out introducing such measures.
Community group and staunch opponents to the rule change, Solar Citizens, confirmed this morning that “there has been no proposal put forward by Queensland state-owned network providers to charge households.”
“Sky-high coal and gas prices alongside rolling breakdowns at fossil fuel power stations are causing Australia’s energy crisis. The only price relief right now is coming from rooftop solar,” Solar Citizen’s Deputy Director, Stephanie Gray, said.
In the meantime, New South Wales – which lags states like Queensland, Western and South Australia in the take up of rooftop solar, has had its Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) recommend higher feed-in tariffs for solar households. 
Each year, the tribunal recommends solar feed-in tariff rates for electricity retailers. For FY22-23, it is recommending  solar customers receive 6.2 to 10.4 c/kWh from their electricity retailer for exporting solar into the grid under an “all day” feed-in tariff rate.
The new rate recommendation is up from the 4.6 to 5.5 c/kWh guidance for FY21-22.

The scope of the $36 billion project has ballooned to 26 GW and is expecting to begin producing power by 2027. The project sparked controversy last year when when its proposal was rejected by then federal environment minister Sussan Ley on environmental impact grounds. 
Its developers, including InterContinental Energy and CWP Global, were unfazed, saying they would amend the proposal. 
Rumours of BP’s interest in becoming a stakeholder in the project first surfaced last month, but the company’s willingness to invest seems to have grown since then from the first thought 30% to today’s 40.5% stake.
Vestas and Macquarie also hold a stake in the hub, which will be located between Port Hedland and Broome in the state’s north.

Western Australia’s government welcomed the news today, saying the project will “catalyse significant new manufacturing and mineral processing opportunities for WA,” and adding that it has been “working closely with Intercontinental Energy and BP to get the project to this stage.”
“A project of this scale will require new supply chain facilities for the manufacture and assembly of equipment for wind, solar and hydrogen generation, which will create new, local, high-value jobs,” its Hydrogen Industry Minister, Alannah MacTiernan, said.
The project has been in the planning stages since 2014, getting bigger and bigger every year. In 2017 it was unveiled as a 6 GW hybrid plant, then the plan grew to 9 GW, 11 GW, and now 15 GW.

The 15 GW hybrid plant (10 GW wind, 5 GW solar) is only the first stage though – with its proponents planning to eventually expand to reach 26 GW of renewable wind and solar generation, servicing industries throughout the Pilbara such as mines and mineral processing, as well as Asian markets with green hydrogen and ammonia. 
The project is also promising at least 3 GW of generation capacity for Pilbara energy users themselves.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/15/western-australia-to-exit-coal-by-2029-in-response-to-competition-from-solar/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 15, 2022",Western Australia to exit coal by 2029 in response to competition from solar,"Western Australian (WA) government-owned Synergy will close its two remaining coal power plants by 2029 after WA Premier Mark McGowan announced a $662 million boost for coal-town Collie’s transition to new and emerging industry, and an additional $3.8 billion for new green power infrastructure around the state. 
McGowan said the $3.8 billion would be invested to 2030 “in new renewable generation and storage, mostly wind and batteries, to ensure WA has affordable and reliable power into the future.” 
Collie, approximately 200km south of Perth, has been powering WA with its two coal mines since the 1880s. The decision will see the 854 MW Muja plant shuttered by October 2029, and the 340 MW Collie plant retired two years earlier, in October 2027.  
The WA government had already committed more than $115 million towards the transition of Collie’s economy, including $1 million in funding for the first phase of a feasibility study into a 600-800MWh battery and green hydrogen industrial hub in the coal town. 
“My Government is absolutely committed to supporting Collie’s economic diversification to create new industrial and blue-collar jobs in town,” said McGowan. “Through our $622 million Collie Transition Package we will provide opportunities for workers and the community impacted by the retirement of State-owned coal power stations.” 

Why now? 
The McGowan government did not hesitate to give its reasons for putting a deadline on coal in the state. In a statement, the government said the retirement of Collie’s coal-fired power stations is “in response to WA’s overwhelming uptake of rooftop solar and renewables.” 
In a post to Facebook, McGowan said: “We know that the economics of coal-fired power have been coming under pressure for some time now. With the rapid uptake of rooftop solar, it’s been cutting into the viability of coal – and that pressure has been growing.” 
McGowan added that if the State continued with “business as usual,” it would “lead to around $3 billion of losses by the end of the decade.” 
Moreover, the ABC reported that McGowan predicted household power bills could rise by around $1,200 a year by 2030 if action to exit unviable coal power wasn’t taken now. 
Part of the transition package includes a $200 million Collie Industrial Transition Fund aimed to attract major projects and new industries to the town, particularly targetting potential opportunities in battery manufacturing, wind turbine manufacturing, hydrogen, green cement and minerals processing. 
“The package will work to attract new industries and create jobs, provide grants for local businesses, and support new training and career pathways for workers,” said McGowan. 
Energy Minister Bill Johnston seconded the Premier, saying Collie’s “location, existing power infrastructure and skilled local workforce means it will remain central to the State’s energy generation efforts.” 
“We are beginning work to roll out billions in new investment for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS),” continued Johnston, who described the transition to the state’s grid away from coal to be “the biggest job-creating infrastructure program in WA since Metronet.” 
Collie-Preston MLA Jodie Hanns said the additional funding from the McGowan Government ensured “every effort is being made to secure our region’s future. Collie has a long future ahead as an industrial town – including exciting opportunities in a number of new and emerging industries – ensuring there will continue to be high-quality local jobs in the region for years to come.” 
After the closure of the two state-owned coal-fired power stations, the only remaining coal-fired power plant operating in WA will be the privately owned Bluewaters generator, also near Collie. 
Just how long the Bluewaters plant can hold out against the rise of renewables is yet to be seen, but the plant has been in financial strife for some time. 
About the decision to withdraw from coal and to support the industry of the coal industry’s workforce, McGowan concluded: “It’s what’s right. It’s what’s just.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/15/lithium-ion-vs-vanadium-redox-flow-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 15, 2022",Lithium-ion vs. vanadium redox flow storage,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom have compared the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with that of vanadium redox flow batteries (VFBs) in a modelled commercial PV installation in California.
“The primary contribution of this work is to perform such multi-objective optimisations for VFB and LIB systems using the most detailed degradation models available for each technology,” they said, noting that they see solar oversizing, storage power, and storage duration as the main variables.
The group used a mixed-integer linear programming approach to calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of the storage solutions and a hybrid VFB-LIB system. The solar facility was assumed to have a capacity of 636 kW, to power a grocery store in a single-floor building.
“The facility is active seven days a week and displays a broad peak between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m.,” the researchers said. “In the summer, shorter load spikes occur during the active hours, presumably due to air cooling load.”
The roundtrip AC efficiencies of the LIBs and VFBs were assumed to be 0.94 and 0.78, respectively, and the plant operation was optimised 24 hours at a time, with the assumption of perfect forecasting of PV and demand within this time frame. A rain-flow-counting algorithm was applied to the state-of-charge (SOC) profile of both LIB and VFB in order to calculate their degradation.
The academics found that both the LIBs and VFBs, as well as their hybridisation, with an oversized PV array, could achieve a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of less than US$0.22 (AU$0.32)/kWh, while still providing a self-sufficiency ratio of 0.95.
“Between 0.8 and 0.95 SSR [self-sufficiency ratio], the optimum duration of both systems is six to 7.5 hours,” the scientists said. “The optimal choice of LIB or VFB depends on both the CAPEX assumptions and the assumptions regarding LIB cell temperature with respect to the ambient climate.”
The group said that LIBs are the cheaper option with a high self-sufficiency ratio, as they require battery oversizing and a lower number of cycles.
“VFB manufacturers should focus on sites with high upper ambient temperature ranges, as LIB will suffer increased LCOE in these situations,” the scientists. “Given the overlap in LCOE for LIB and VFB depending on the scenario, it is likely that other factors will come into consideration when making the choice between the two technologies.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/15/a-simmering-cauldron-of-renewables-revenue-cannibalisation/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 15, 2022",A simmering cauldron of renewables ‘revenue cannibalisation’,"From pv magazine Global
Swiss consultancy Pexapark has published a new report, “The Effect of Cannibalisation,” that looks at “renewables’ silent risk.” Ostensibly, the report is a “back to the basics” guide to “revenue cannibalism,” whereby the oversaturation of renewables on the grid at particular times could see technologies like PV eat into its own profits. But there are also some insights to be had into how the European market for power purchase agreements might deal with this growing risk. 
With more and more renewables set for development over the next decade, and renewed support in the form of the European Commission’s REPowerEU strategy, the cannibalisation effect poses a serious threat in the long-run “to the viability of renewables operating on the free market,” according to Pexapark. 
“Pricing cannibalisation risk into your PPA is important to ensure your agreed pricing is far not only today but also throughout the tenor of the agreement when cannibalisation impact is more prominent when renewables build-out increases,” it said. 
Of course, the risk of cannibalisation is already well-known.
“This is why in mature PPA markets,” the report states, noting that in Spain and Sweden, in particular, “we see the shift of buyers demanding baseload PPAs, and pay-as-produced (PAP) structures providing significant discounts, because the cannibalisation risk has been factored in.” 
Maritina Kanellakopoulou, an analyst for Pexapark, told pv magazine that the reason for this higher interest in baseload PPAs is not driven by energy storage. “We see a notable surge of interest in the solar-plus-storage topic,” says Kanellakopoulou, “[The levelised cost of electricity] is still too high to allow for large-scale adoption.” 
However, it’s not all doom and gloom.
“The higher interest in baseload PPAs is driven by the better demand and thus higher prices shown by utility offtakers,” said Kanellakopoulou. “For solar, baseload profiles have been called impossible, but physical backing by storage assets starts to make baseload hedging for PV assets much more palatable, as it addresses fears around the structural mismatch between production and contract profiles.” 
While widespread adoption of solar-plus-storage is still inhibited by price, it seems as if some deals of this nature are being done. Energy storage for baseload hedging for PV assets is becoming more “palatable,” and perhaps the age of solar-plus-storage enabling baseload PPAs is dawning. 
Of course, baseload PPAs are more mature for wind assets in Nordic countries and also in Spain. Kanellakopoulou pointed to the recent deal between Alcoa and Greenalia as an example of this. 
Because the market for PAP PPAs is becoming increasingly saturated by offtakers wanting to warehouse their cannibalisation risk, costs are starting to become prohibitively high. According to Kanellakopoulou, “storage is a genuine alternative which is not based on trading. The most immediate action one can take, is to review co-location with battery storage, as it’s the quickest way to shield from the cannibalisation effect.” 
Werner Trabesinger, the head of quantitative products at Pexapark and a co-author of the report, told pv magazine “that baseload-profiled PPA contracts receive substantially better prices, as they do not shift the burden of cannibalisation risk onto the offtakers. In other words, the economics of baseload – hedged PV assets is much more favourable.”
However, many project owners fear that entering into baseload hedges will push them into an active role in the spot markets.
“They fear is that spot markets might work systematically against them, causing poor overall performance,” said Trabesinger. “Colocated BESS assets help circumvent this issue, as they allow for storing production volumes for release during higher-priced hours. In this sense, they ‘future-proof’ assets against cannibalisation issues.”
The LCOE is still too high for widespread adoption of co-located solar-plus-storage projects, but the higher revenue from higher PPA prices – combined with the cannibalisation risk reduction provided by a BESS asset – significantly improves the profitability of such projects. As Trabesinger put it, “we feel that the tipping point might very soon be reached.”
