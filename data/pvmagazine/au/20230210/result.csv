The 2 MWh network battery, supplied by Melbourne-based battery technology company EVO Power and to be orchestrated by AGL on behalf of Essential Energy, is designed to address anticipated future network constraints and manage power variability in the trial area.
Connected to an 11 kV high voltage distribution wire on the Essential Energy network, the Sovereign Hills battery will absorb extra solar energy generated during the day and direct it into the grid at times of peak demand.
Essential Energy’s Chief Executive Officer John Cleland said this is expected to provide grid voltage regulation support, stabilise frequency and reduce demand on the network while reducing emissions.
“The network battery trial is critical because energy storage, and batteries in particular, are going to play a key role in enabling the energy transformation,” he said.
“As rooftop solar and other forms of solar proliferate, there will surplus electrons during the middle of the day that will need to be transferred into the evening peak and batteries and other forms of energy storage allow that to happen.”

Cleland said the Sovereign Hills battery trial will provide learnings that are expected to lead to further deployment of batteries across the Essential Energy network, supporting the energy transition of regional, rural and remote NSW.
“We expect this trial to support our capability growth to own and operate electricity storage across the network, solving local voltage variation, capacity limitations and broaden export capability,” he said. “Our customers have told us that they expect Essential Energy to support their renewable energy ambitions and we are transforming our business to help deliver on that.”
AGL’s General Manager of Commercial and Industrial Customers, Ryan Warburton, said the trial will help the company, which is constructing, commissioning and orchestrating the battery on behalf of Essential Energy, better understand the role of network batteries in enabling greater renewable energy into the grid.
“This trial is an excellent opportunity for us to understand the benefits of a network battery and use that data and insights how we can create value into the future,” he said.
AGL said the asset will also participate in the company’s growing virtual power plant, where customers join a network of connected distributed energy resources that support the electricity system when needed.

The solar PPA adds to a 690 kW rooftop solar array installed at the brewery in 2019.
The Woolooga Solar Farm, being developed near Gympie in Queensland’s southeast by oil giant bp’s renewables joint venture with UK solar company Lightsource, has already commenced generation and is expected to achieve full production early this year.
Lion, whose latest XXXX brand campaign asks Australians to “give a XXXX” about the world and environment, said the offtake agreement will see the company reach its target of 100% purchased renewable electricity by 2025 in Australia, two years ahead of schedule.

Lion Sustainability Director Justin Merrell said the deal also means the company is Australia’s first certified large-scale carbon neutral brewer.
“All of our beer produced here, up to 250 million litres annually, is now made using 100% renewable electricity,” he said.
“XXXX is encouraging all Australians to ‘Give a XXXX’ about the planet for the benefit of our environment, and for beer. Today’s announcement is another great example of how we’re investing in climate solutions to reduce our footprint.”
Merrell said the agreement will cut the brewer’s carbon emissions by an estimated 138,000 tonnes.
The renewable energy deal is the latest in a series of PPAs announced by the Queensland government. Earlier this week state-owned generator Stanwell signed an agreement to supply biscuit manufacturer Arnott’s Group with more than 68 GWh of renewable energy as part of a long-term PPA.

That came just days after state government-owned CS Energy finalised a deal with global investment manager AMP Capital which will see four major shopping centres in Queensland’s southeast source 100% of their electricity needs from renewable energy supplied by the 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said he expects more renewable energy PPAs to be announced in coming weeks as part of the state government’s Energy and Jobs Plan, which lays out a strategy to reduce household and business electricity emissions by 96% by 2040.
The Queensland government is aiming to supply 80% of the state’s electricity demand from hydro power, wind and solar farms by 2035.
“An increasing number of companies want to decarbonise their operations,” he said. “The pipeline of renewable projects in the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan means we will continue to see more and more companies make the transition and lower emissions.”

Indonesian PV developer SUN Energy’s 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia’s (WA) central Wheatbelt region was again the nation’s top rating solar farm for the month with an average capacity factor (AC CF) of 42.2%.
Merredin, which SUN Energy acquired from project developer Risen Energy in 2021, is a regular in Rystad’s top large-scale solar stakes.
Canadian clean energy investment firm Amp Energy’s 85 MW Hillston Solar Farm in southwest New South Wales (NSW) was second in the January rankings with a 38.8% capacity factor ahead of Bright Energy Investments’ 40 MW Greenough River Solar Farm in WA’s midwest (37.4% AC CF).
Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) 56 MW Moree solar farm in regional NSW was fourth ahead of Australian renewables developer Edify Energy and Germany-based Wirsol’s 60 MW Gannawarra Solar Farm in northwest Victoria.

NSW had five of the best performing solar farms in the month, including the Corowa, Nevertire and Colleambally facilities and generated 632 GWh from utility PV during January.
Dixon said new utility PV generation records were set in South Australia, where large-scale assets generated 95 GWh of solar, and Victoria (194 GWh).
All Australian utility PV and wind assets generated 3,885 GWh of clean energy over the month, up 7% on the 3,628 GWh generated in January 2022.
The best performing utility wind assets for the month were all located in WA with the top assets including the Yandin, Badgingarra, Walkaway and Mumbida wind farms.
Fifth on the list was the wind component of the Port August Renewable Energy Park in South Australia. The project, owned by Spanish energy group Iberdrola, is currently the largest operational hybrid wind and solar project in Australia.

The first stage of the park will initially consist of a 150 MW solar farm capable of generating 290 GWh of clean energy per year which will be utilised to help the aviation industry shift away from fossil fuels. Battery energy storage and green hydrogen generation is also earmarked for the precinct in the future with Christchurch Airport seeking to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry in New Zealand.
“This starts with the solar farm but we’re working to include green hydrogen generation down the track,” Christchurch Airport Chief Executive Officer Justin Watson said. “Kōwhai Park will enable low-emissions aviation and help provide the extra green energy New Zealand needs to transition away from fossil fuels.”
“We’re excited to have found partners with the technical capability to do this well and the values to ensure it’s done right.”
The solar farm, to comprise an estimated 300,000 solar panels, will be developed on a 300-hectare site adjacent to the runways at the Christchurch airport. The location is close to power distributor Orion’s network and to grid operator Transpower’s lines.
Subject to a final investment decision, construction of the solar farm is expected to commence in 2024.
The Kōwhai Park project is Lightsource bp’s first in New Zealand but it is unlikely to be the last.
In April 2022, Lightsource bp and Contract Energy entered a partnership to co-develop a portfolio of large-scale solar projects from which Contact will purchase the solar electricity via a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).

Contact Energy Chief Executive Officer Mike Fuge said the Kōwhai Park forms a solid foundation for the development partnership which has committed to creating up to 380,000 MWh of grid-scale solar generation by 2026.
“This project will deliver over half of that,” he said. “We’re bringing our proven track record of delivering domestic renewable projects in order to meet the massive anticipated demand for renewable electricity in New Zealand.”
Lightsource bp’s Managing Director for Australia and New Zealand Adam Pegg said the company, which has established itself as one of Australia’s largest solar developers, is excited by the opportunities in New Zealand.
“We’re delighted to launch our first project in New Zealand and to be partnering with organisations who, like us, want to play a leading role in New Zealand’s decarbonisation,” he said.
“Lightsource bp has a strong international track record of successfully delivering utility scale solar projects, and with our partners at Contact Energy we look forward to working closely with Christchurch Airport on the development, construction and operation of Kōwhai Park.”
The Kōwhai Park project is among multiple large-scale solar projects being pursued across the country.
New Zealand government-owned Genesis Energy and renewables partner FRV Australia plan to commence construction of a 52 MW Lauriston Solar Farm on New Zealand’s South Island later this year.
Renewables developer Lodestone Energy said it has already begun groundworks at the company’s 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm being built near the town of the same name in the far north of the nation’s North Island. Lodestone said the project is the first of five utility-scale solar farms it intends to develop across the upper North Island.

Ionblox says it has secured $32 million in funds in a recent series B funding round. The funds – provided by Lilium, Applied Ventures, Temasek, and Catalus Capital – will help the startup to scale its high-power cells for electric aviation and prototype its fast-charge EV cells.
The batteries are developed with lithium-ion cells that have pre-lithiated silicon dominant anodes. Ionblox said the technology leads to a powerful combination of 50% greater energy density and five times more power over lithium-ion batteries, while enabling fast-charge times of 10 minutes. The cell performance has been verified by Idaho National Laboratory.
A rapid charge can power 80% of the battery’s capacity in 10 minutes. For a 300-mile vehicle, this means you can charge 240 miles in the time it would take to stop at a normal gas station. Idaho Labs tests of 12 Ah pouch cells confirmed energy density of 315 Wh/kg. The battery can operate 1,000 charge cycles at the C/3 charge rate while retaining nearly 90% of original capacity.
The company said the breakthroughs in battery capability are particularly well-suited for cutting-edge electric aircraft like Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircrafts (eVTOL), where weight must be minimised, and power output maximised. The large-format pouch cells of up to 50 Ah, which also have applications in ground EVs, are currently being built on Ionblox’s pilot production lines.
“The Ionblox technology enables one of the highest performance cells for eVTOL aircraft existing today,” said Yves Yemsi, chief operating officer at Lilium. Yemsi’s company will work to integrate the new battery tech into its conforming aircraft, the Lilium Jet.
“Test results to date are showing the technology will deliver not only superior energy and power density for the Lilium Jet at launch but also very good aging performance,” said Yemsi. Lilium said it will support continuous improvement and industrialisation of the technology.
The battery provider received a development contract from the United States Advanced Battery Consortium to develop low-cost, fast-charge EV batteries. Ionblox is also partnering with Applied Materials for semiconductor equipment supply.
This second Series B round builds on a $24 million investment round in October, 2022. Founded in Fremont, California in 2017, as Zenlabs, Ionblox has more than 40 issued patents for pre-lithiation for all types of silicon-based anodes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/10/survey-shows-34-3-failure-rate-for-residential-inverters-over-15-years/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 10, 2023",Survey shows 34.3% failure rate for residential inverters over 15 years,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Bern University of Applied Sciences have conducted an online survey to investigate the “time to failure” (TTF) for residential inverters. They have found that 34.3% of the devices experienced their first failures after 15 years.
“I would say this failure rate is acceptable, even good,” researcher Christof Bucher told pv magazine. “One assumes the inverter must be replaced once in the lifetime of a PV system.”
The survey includes inverters from Fronius, Huawei, Kostal, SMA, SolarEdge, and Sputnik. However, the scientists said that the analysed devices are not representative of the current PV market, as they were purchased many years ago.
“The oldest inverters investigated in this study are from the early 1990s,” they said.
The survey includes data from 1,195 PV systems with 2,121 inverters and 8,542 optimisers. The biggest share of the inverters used in these systems had power ratings between 10 kVA and 15 kVA.
“A large part of the data was collected with the help of people who know the history of the PV systems well,” the scientists explained, adding that incomplete, unanalysable data records were deleted. “The survey gave respondents the opportunity to add their own comments to the technical data.”
In order to analyse the TTF, the research group used the Kaplan-Meier estimator, which is commonly used to estimate the survival function from figures that are censored, truncated, or have missing values. The survival curve shows which percentage of the population is still alive after how many years.
“The Kaplan-Meier estimator can be adjusted for different influencing factors, for example to the year of commissioning, the inverter manufacturer or the nominal power ratio,” the researchers explained.
The scientist said the survival curve considers how many inverters are still under observation in the corresponding year of operation. That could help assess when a certain percentage of the inverters will have their first expected malfunctions.
“However, because only little data is available for old inverters, the uncertainty in the survival curve increases with increasing inverter life,” said the scientists.
The survey showed that more than 65% of the inverters did not present yield-relevant faults by their 15th year of operation. The scientists said the TTF mainly depends on the manufacturer and a device’s location, with outdoor installations having shorter TTF rates. They said the overall reliability of an inverter is proportional to the reduction in the number of power electronic components. In inverters with power optimisers, the first fault often occurs earlier than in devices without optimisers, according to the scientists.
“The inverters and optimisers in this study represent a broad, albeit not representative, cross-section of the inverters and optimisers used in PV systems on buildings in Switzerland and Europe,” they explained.
When they first announced the survey in July, the researchers said the causes of the failures and defects had not been precisely recorded. They said at the time that the “the rule of thumb that inverters should run without faults for around 15 years” had been confirmed by their findings.
The research project will run until the end of 2025 and extended to other systems.
