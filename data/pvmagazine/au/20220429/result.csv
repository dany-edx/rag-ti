A group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has fabricated a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell that is able to harvest high-energy photons from a white-hot heat source and convert them into electricity.
The device is described as a heat engine with no moving parts that is able to produce power from a heat source of between 1,900 to 2,400 C. This concept is known as thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) and consists of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C. “It is a battery that takes in electricity, converts it to high-temperature heat, stores the heat and then converts it back to electricity by TPVs on demand,” the US group explained.
The system was built with two-junction TPV devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that were optimised for the planned temperature range and TEGS applications. These cells utilise band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter.
The scientists tested several system configurations and a thermophotovoltaic device with bandgaps between 1.2 and 1.4 eV was found to have the highest efficiency at 41.1% operating at a power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 C. Another device with a 1.2/1.0 eV bandgap reached a maximum efficiency of 39.3%, at a power density of 1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 C.
The thermophotovoltaic cell should now be integrated into a grid-scale thermal battery. “The system would absorb excess energy from renewable sources such as the sun and store that energy in heavily insulated banks of hot graphite,” the researchers emphasised. “When the energy is needed, such as on overcast days, TPV cells would convert the heat into electricity, and dispatch the energy to a power grid.”
The device was presented in the study “Thermophotovoltaic efficiency of 40%,” which was recently published in nature.  Their work demonstrated the main parts of the system in separate, small-scale experiments and the research group is currently working to integrate the parts to demonstrate a fully operational system. “Thermophotovoltaic cells were the last key step toward demonstrating that thermal batteries are a viable concept,” said MIT researcher Asegun Henry. “One of the advantages of solid-state energy converters are that they can operate at higher temperatures with lower maintenance costs because they have no moving parts.”

SEIA has lowered its solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by 46% due to the US government’s circumvention case against solar imports from Southeast Asia.
According to an updated analysis based on the organisation’s survey for solar workers and companies already affected by the investigation, SEIA has predicted that the case will result in a drop of 24 GW of planned solar capacity over the next two years, which is more solar than the industry installed in all of 2021. In losing this capacity, SEIA also estimates that the United States will emit an additional 364 million metric tons of carbon by 2035, missing the opportunity to effectively take 78 million internal combustion-engine vehicles off the road. By 2025, the imposition of tariffs will cause solar capacity to fall 75 GW short of the pace needed to reach the president’s goal, equal to the size of the entire US solar market prior to 2020.
These predictions are based on the assumptions of an affirmative decision on the Auxin petition, with tariffs imposed in the 50% to 250% range. The forecast is also based on sharply restricted module import supplies from countries named in the investigation, with manufacturers in unnamed countries needing time to pick up the slack.
According to the most recent publication of SEIA’s survey, with more than 700 responses by April 26, 83% of the respondents that purchase or use modules reported cancellations or delays in their module supply agreements. This is up from 75% reports of cancellations or delays when the first results of the survey were released on April 5, with those results stemming from roughly 200 respondents,
The impact is not just on solar projects. About 65% of respondents working in energy storage said they expect the investigation to have a devastating to severe impact on their business as well.
Based on SEIA’s voluntary reporting, responses have outlined to SEIA that a total of 318 utility-scale projects accounting for 51 GW of solar capacity and 6 GWh of attached battery storage are being canceled or delayed. What’s more is that a large percentage of delayed projects could move into the realm of cancelation, as developers don’t know when they might be able to get modules and some delays may drag on to the point of project failure.
With respondent data from 39 states, all but two of those states are reporting utility scale project cancellations and delays above 100 MW in capacity. Leading the pack is Texas, with just over 13 GW of projects at risk, California at 7.5 GW, Ohio at 4.4 GW, Indiana at 3.6 GW, and Illinois at 2.5 GW. The figures are especially problematic for Ohio and Indiana, both of which are states that have historically not been leaders in installing solar, but have hit their stride as of late and had been projected to be two of the most active states across the entire country for development over the next five years.
SEIA shares that these figures also likely only represent a fraction of the investigation’s true impacts. Across the United States as a whole, 42% of the known utility-scale solar development pipeline has been disrupted. Indiana and Idaho both reported 100% of each state’s known pipeline being disrupted.
In the top-five states, every gigawatt of canceled projects represents roughly $1 billion in investment at risk. The ratio is actually a bit higher in California, where 7.5 GW of at-risk projects account for roughly $8 billion in investment risk.
Around 70% of survey respondents report that at least half their solar and storage workforce is at risk and more than 200 companies report that their entire workforce is at risk.
“If tariffs are imposed, in the blink of an eye we’re going to lose 100,000 American solar workers and any hope of reaching the president’s clean energy goals,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “This would be a monumental loss for our nation, which has the potential to lead our clean energy future, with the right policies. Instead, the Commerce Department is on track to wipe out nearly half of all solar jobs and force a surrender on the President’s climate goals.”
It’s important to clarify that the figure of 100,000 jobs lost also includes new jobs not added, though SEIA asserts that the vast majority would be layoffs of existing workers. 16,000 to 18,000 solar manufacturing jobs would be not realised between 202223 due to the imposition of tariffs, the majority of which would be layoffs. For context, roughly 31,000 people were employed in solar manufacturing in 2020, the most recent year for which survey data is available.

Researchers from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics in China have investigated how to overcome the technical and economic hurdles that are preventing high energy density bromine-based flow batteries (Br-FBs) from becoming a mainstream technology for the storage of renewable energy sources.
“Br-FBs have been one of the most promising energy storage technologies with attracting advantages of low price, wide potential window, and long cycle life,” the scientists explained. “However, Br-FBs suffer from the sluggish kinetics of Br2/Br– redox couple and serious self-discharge, which hinder the further commercialisation and industrialisation of Br-FBs.”
They also pointed out the electrodes used in these devices as one of the critical components, as they provide the reaction sites for redox couples and may have a significant effect on the performance of Br-FBs. They also provided a comprehensive overview of different high-performance cathodes for high-power density and long-lifespan Br-FBs and these devices were compared with commonly used cathode materials. “At present, porous carbon fibre-based materials, especially carbon felts (CFs) and graphite felts (GFs), are the most commonly used cathodes in Br-FBs due to their low price, good electronic conductivity, outstanding corrosion resistance as well as controllable surface properties.”
Their work also identified modification methods aimed at improving the cathodes’ performance, such as surface treatment, metallic element modification, nonmetallic element modification, and structure decoration. The modification methods, however, are still unable to cope with poor bromine retention ability and unclear mechanisms of Br2/Br– redox reactions.
Looking forward, the Chinese group identified the most important challenges to address in future research: “The further development directions are as follows: (i). To continually develop advanced electrodes of Br-FBs with high activity and bromine retention capacity by enhancing their chemical surfaces and improving their physical structures. (ii). The reaction mechanisms on the electrode are not clear and need in-depth investigations. (iii) To improve the bromine fixing/retention capacity of electrodes by structural design, namely, to inhibit the diffusion and migration of bromine species to the negative side.”
Their findings were presented in the paper “Progress and Perspective of the Cathode Materials towards Bromine-Based Flow Batteries,” which was recently published in Energy Material Advances.

The following week energy market analyst ITK Services published its report, Origin Energy: Time to leave its origins behind, advised the only way for Origin to turn around its business was to get out of fossil fuels as soon as possible, and channel its funds into a massive solar and wind portfolio. 
ITK principal, David Leitch, said in a statement accompanying the report that “there likely is a large market for a pure green electricity retailer”; and Origin is already an investor in such a proven brand, with a 20% stake in Octopus Energy.
Origin appears to be taking Leitch’s advice as the company has adopted a strategy to accelerate the growth of its renewable energy portfolio. And in what looks to be the company’s biggest move yet, it has acquired the 900 MW Yarrabee Solar Farm development project in the Riverina region of New South Wales (NSW). 
Big solar buy up 
The purchase comes not long after Origin also acquired the 74 MW Carisbrook Solar Farm in central Victoria, which is set to reach commercial operation in 2023. 
“Origin aims to lead the energy transition to net zero emissions through cleaner energy and customer solutions,” said Origin executive general manager of energy supply and operations, Greg Jarvis. “And the acquisition of the Yarrabee Solar Farm development project demonstrates further progress on this ambition.” 
Co-developed by Reach Solar Energy and PwC Australia, the first stage of the Yarrabee Solar Farm is set to comprise 450 MW, but 900 MW already has planning approval. 
The project is situated strategically in the Transgrid transmission network, particularly the South-West Renewable Energy Zone. 
“We believe the Yarrabee Solar Farm can play an important role in helping Origin provide cleaner energy to our customers, while also reducing emissions from our generation portfolio,” continued Jarvis.

“More broadly, the team continues to focus on the multi-gigawatt opportunity to grow renewable energy and storage, through developing greenfield sites or acquiring advanced stage pre-construction renewable projects like Yarrabee.” 
Of course, Origin still has a long way to go. In February 2022, Greenpeace Australia published its latest Green Electricity Guide, in which Origin sat languishing at the near the bottom of the table in 44th place with one star, only just above other giants like AGL Energy and Energy Australia.

In March and on the back of straining relations between China and Australia, the Australian Government committed more than $240 million to critical minerals projects in a bit to end the country’s reliance on China and cement its place in the rapidly growing global electric vehicle and battery markets. 
This week battery minerals innovator Lava Blue was awarded a grant of $5.2 million from the Federal Government’s Critical Minerals Accelerator Initiative to support the development of Lava Blue’s processes for refining critical minerals used in the lithium-ion battery supply chain. 
Lava Blue’s managing director Michael McCann said the grant was a significant one which would contribute to a $12 million Queensland project over the next two-and-a-half years. 
“The grant will allow Lava Blue processes to be applied to recovery of a number of valuable minerals from vanadium pentoxide processing waste, including high purity alumina and potentially magnesium and residual vanadium,” said McCann. “The outcome will be to greatly improve the economics of vanadium recovery and provide new supplies of high purity minerals into global battery supply chains.”

Along with Lava Blue’s research partner, the Queensland University of Technology, the project will see the scale-up of processes for recovery of high-purity minerals at the Lava Blue Centre for Predictive Research into Specialty Materials at Redlands Research Park in Brisbane. 
High purity alumina (HPA) is used in the separator between battery anode and cathode.

“Battery minerals are not industrial metals,” McCann continued. “The high degrees of processing control required for materials to feed into battery manufacturing are at a totally different level to normal mineral processing. However, Australia is rapidly developing the capacity to produce battery materials and help drive the massive historical transition to a carbon-constrained, renewable energy future.” 
Lava Blue’s chairman, Sylvia Tulloch, said battery minerals and energy metals are needed over the next two decades “so that we can displace energy services currently supplied by around five billion tonnes of coal and 36 billion barrels of oil every year.”

The French Environment and Energy Management Agency (Ademe) has defined new standards for agrivoltaics in a new series of publications that have been published on its website. The documents provide a definition of “agrivoltaics,” along with a guide for the classification criteria.
“A simple classification of projects by type of PV system and/or by crop is not possible in the current state of knowledge,” the agency said. “Our work has enabled the creation of a decision tree, which is a real tool for analysing and identifying the most virtuous projects. A case-by-case analysis of the projects is essential in order to evaluate them and position them in the proposed classification gradient.”
Ademe defines agrivoltaics in the following way: “An agrivoltaic installation is a PV system whose modules are located on the same surface of an agricultural production, to which they bring the following services, without causing a significant qualitative and quantitative degradation of the agricultural yield, as well as a reduction of the revenue generated from the agricultural activity. Service of adaptation to climate changes, service of protection to extreme weather events, service of improving animal welfare, agronomic service for specific cultures.”
Agrivoltaic projects must always imply the presence of a farmer. Such installations must also be reversible and adapted to local conditions, without damage to the environment. Agrivoltaic installations should also be adaptable to new conditions.
“A more precise definition of agrivoltaism has been proposed and it is based on the notion of synergy between agricultural production and PV production on the same plot area,” Ademe said. “The PV installation must provide a service in response to an agricultural problem. For example, an agrivoltaic system can consist of PV modules above plant production to protect it from excessive sunlight, to limit water stress through a shading effect, or to reduce the risks associated with climatic conditions such as hail or frost. Thus, while producing energy, this type of device can, in certain configurations, provide a beneficial service to the agricultural production in place.”
In June 2021, French solar companies Sun’Agri, REM Tec, Kilowattsol, and Altergie Développement et Râcines announced the creation of France Agrivoltaisme, the world’s first trade body for the agrivoltaics sector.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have compared how PV or nuclear energy could power a crewed outpost for an extended period on Mars and have determined that solar offers the best performance.
“Photovoltaic energy generation coupled to certain energy storage configurations in molecular hydrogen outperforms nuclear fusion reactors over 50% of the planet’s surface, mainly within those regions around the equatorial band, which is in fairly sharp contrast to what has been proposed over and over again in the literature, which is that it will be nuclear power,” said UC Berkeley researcher Aaron Berliner, noting that two energy sources were compared for the power supply of a six-person extended mission to Mars involving a 480-day stay on the planet’s surface before returning to Earth.
The US team considered four different scenarios: nuclear power generation with the miniaturised nuclear fission Kilopower system, PV power generation with battery energy storage, PV power generation with compressed hydrogen energy storage produced via electrolysis, and hydrogen generation with compressed hydrogen energy storage (PEC).
“In our calculations, we assumed a capacity factor of 75% to account for the solar flux deviation throughout the Martian year and sized energy storage systems to enable 1 full day of operations from reserve power,” the group explained. “We then calculated the carry-along mass requirements for each of the power generation systems considered.”
The scientists found that, of the three PV-based power generation options, only the photovoltaics-plus-electrolyser system outcompetes the nuclear system based on carry-along mass. They also said that the optimal absorber bandgaps for the PV systems depend heavily on the location on the surface of Mars, the total depth of the air column above a given location, gradients in dust and ice concentrations, and orbital geometry effects that cause different effective air column thicknesses for locations near the poles.
“In conclusion, solar cell arrays with careful attention to semiconductor choice and device construction represent a promising technology for sustaining an Earth-independent crewed habitat on Mars,” the academics said. “Our analysis provides design rules for solar cells on the Martian surface and shows that solar cells can offer substantial reduction in carry-along mass requirements compared to alternative technology over a large fraction of the planet’s surface.”
They explained their findings in “Photovoltaics-Driven Power Production Can Support Human Exploration on Mars,” which was recently published in Frontiers.
