Marubeni’s subsidiary SmartestEnergy Australia has signed a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) as an offtaker for what will eventually be a portfolio of 30 renewable assets integrating solar, storage and hydrogen production scattered around eastern Australia and owned by Providence Asset Group.
Those assets, the majority of which have not yet been built, will include a mid-scale solar farms (around 10 MW each) which will incorporate dual technology, providing an integration between Li-ion batteries and green hydrogen energy production and storage units.
To this end, Providence Asset Group will deploy LAVO’s green hydrogen energy storage and production units, which were developed by the University of New South Wales. LAVO’s ‘green hydrogen batteries’ containerise metal hydride to store the hydrogen’s energy and only entered the market in June of this year – the first of their kind in Australia and across the world.

LAVO Chief Executive and Executive Director Alan Yu said he was “thrilled” about the deal. “It’s another vote of confidence in Australia’s renewable energy industry and provides an ideal base to demonstrate the technical and commercial benefits that commercial scale solar farms coupled with the LAVO | HEOS system can deliver. This will serve as a flagship project, highlighting the importance of grid-connected fuel cells and projects of this type.”
Providence Asset Group has only built five of the 30 solar farms so far in regional Victoria’s Katamatite, Numurkah, Echuca West, Echuca and Stanhope. Another six are currently in construction. Presumably the newly-signed PPA will leverage the Australian company to finish the remaining 19.
Under the terms of the agreement, SmartestEnergy will purchase the renewable generation output of the solar farms for an initial 30-month period, with both parties planning for a 10-year extension at the end of the initial period. When all the solar farms are operating, the combined generation output will be around 500 GWh per annum.
Providence Asset Group will also commence work on developing a green hydrogen export roadmap to Japan, which will again use LAVO’s technology.

Huawei has become the latest company to realise this, launching its new iPowercube series seeking to service the growing sector.
In June, Huawei introduced its iPowercube-M, iPowercube-S, and iPowercube-P to the Australian market, integrating solar,  grid connections, diesel generation and lithium-ion battery storage as part of a “one-stop solution”. The series have varying maximum capacities, with the iPowercube-M at 10 kW, the iPowercube-S at 100 kW and the iPowercube-P at >1000 kW.

Huawei is aiming to service both the agricultural sector as well as off-grid or poorly connected rural communities with the modular solution, though did not mention the booming demand from Australia’s mining industry.
“Since the official launch of the new iPowercube series in Australia, we have received significant amount of inquiries from the agricultural industry and regional communities. We have won a number of projects and the first deployment will be around August, 2021,” Huawei’s Solution Director, Kenneth Loh, told pv magazine Australia.
The series has been modelled on Huawei’s original iPowerCube solution which was introduced to supply power to telecommunication base stations in areas with off-grid or poor grid supply over a decade ago.
The units’ price, Loh said, depends on the site’s configuration. That is, power requirements, cabinet type, and the backup hours, as well as the scope involved.
The company claims the modular units shorten deployment time by 75%, with Loh saying the installation period of the mid-range iPowerCube-S is about 15 days including transportation, civil work, installation and commissioning.

Western Australia is leading the country’s off-grid or standalone power systems (SPS) rollout. In fact, last month microgrid specialists Hybrid Systems Australia announced it will establish the “world’s biggest” standalone power system manufacturing facility in the state as it looks to cater for growing demand for the technology.
The rollout has been led by West Australia’s government, which in February announced $218 million had been set aside to manufacture and install more than 1,000 SPS in regional WA over the next five years.

The state government says the program and funding is to support “Traditional Owners’ self-determination by putting renewable energy projects directly in the hands of Aboriginal community groups across Victoria”.
The successful recipients are:
Each of the Traditional Owner Corporations could be awarded up to $100,000 under the program, though specifically how much each group received hasn’t been made public.
The Victorian government noted in its statement that numerous Traditional Owner Corporations have already developed renewable energy plans by installing solar panels, developing feasibility studies and undertaking businesses cases for future community-owned renewable energy generation to be delivered during 2021-2022.
The program through which the funding was allocated is aimed at supporting Indigenous participation and adoption of new energy technologies, boosting skills and helping fuel a clean energy driven economic recovery.
“The government acknowledges the right to self-determination and recognises that only when Aboriginal people are central to the decision-making processes that affect their lives, will sustained and long-term changes in wellbeing and the health of Country be achieved,” the Victorian government’s statement read.
“This will see local Traditional Owner groups benefiting directly from Victoria’s boom in renewable energy,” Member for Northern Victoria, Mark Gepp, added.
Fortescue Metals Group today also announced it had awarded the single largest contract under its Billion Opportunities program to a West Australian majority-owned Indigenous business, Warrikal Pty Ltd.
Following a competitive tender process, Warrikal was awarded a five-year $350 million contract as one of the providers of maintenance and shutdown services across Fortescue’s Pilbara operations.
Founded by Koori businesswoman Amanda Healy and her business partners Roy Messer and David Flett, Warrikal was established in 2017 to provide innovative engineering solutions across the mining, marine and resource sectors. It has been providing mechanical maintenance, shutdown and project services across Fortescue’s sites over the past three years.
“We look forward to further developing our relationship over coming years, continuing to grow our operational footprint in the North West of Western Australia and strengthening our long-term commitment to the region and the communities in which we operate,” Warrikal’s Chief Executive Officer, Amanda Healy, said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/07/australia-needs-a-green-hydrogen-target/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 7, 2021",Australia needs a green hydrogen target,"There has been a lot of ‘hot air’ talk about gas in recent months. The Australian prime minister has shown his priorities by investing $600 million of taxpayer dollars in a new fossil gas plant in NSW, a power station the Energy Security Board head Kerry Schott says ‘doesn’t stack up’. The federal government has allocated next to nothing for tackling climate change but continues to throw money at opening up gas and coal fields.
Whilst the federal government is becoming increasingly isolated on energy and climate policy internationally, the states and Australian businesses are stepping up. Every state has a net-zero emissions target, and most have aggressive targets for decarbonising the electricity system. Some of Australia’s biggest businesses have set carbon reduction targets, including some fossil dependent companies. During Energy Week in May, Sydney’s biggest gas distributor called for a 2030 ‘green gas’ target to mirror the Commonwealth’s Renewable Energy Target. The call is being backed by the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia.
It has been 20 years since John Howard’s Renewable Energy Target kickstarted Australia’s longest-lasting and most effective climate policy — replacing coal and gas with renewables. Howard’s target was modest, mandating that electricity retailers procure an additional 2% of their energy from renewable sources by 2010.
From around 8% renewables in 2001, bolstered by Labor amendments, state schemes and voluntary programs, in the financial year just ended, renewable energy supplied 28.7% of the National Electricity Market and 30.4% in Western Australia’s SWIS. Turns out, Australians are very good at hitting bipartisan targets.
In February, the US re-entered the Paris Agreement, just three months after its formal withdrawal. President Biden’s aggressive climate plan and China’s net-zero target mark an inflection point in the global moves towards decarbonisation. Between the U.S., U.K., Europe, Japan, China and South Korea, our traditional allies and our trading partners are now moving in one direction. Australia must not allow itself to be marginalised, nor can we afford to miss this opportunity. Last September Prime Minister Scott Morrison mentioned gas 55 times in a single speech. But with the changed guard in Washington, Morrison’s so-called “gas-led recovery” looks more like a rhetorical relic from the dark days of 2020. These gas plans never made sense. All our cheap fossil gas has already been burnt or sent offshore, and our gas sector employs very few.
But there is another gas that could position us for great prosperity in a decarbonised global economy: “green” hydrogen made with Australian wind and solar energy.
The name hydrogen comes from the Greek words “hydro” (meaning water) and “genes” (meaning creator). It was named by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier because when it burns it creates water. Sometimes called the “God Molecule,” hydrogen can be used as a fuel and also as feedstock for industry. When produced with renewable energy, so-called green hydrogen enables the production of low-carbon, high-value goods such as “green” steel, fertiliser and ammonia. By committing to net-zero emissions, Japan, South Korea and China have signalled the beginning of the end for our carbon exports. Falling demand for our coal and fossil gas can be offset by growing demand for green hydrogen.
We already have all the technologies we need to be successful in this great transition. What’s needed now is a sustained cycle of deployment and repeated refinement, a partnership of policy, manufacturing, engineering and finance to drive green hydrogen down the cost curve. Most of the cost reductions we’ve seen in renewable energy over recent decades weren’t the result of technology research, but of repeated deployment backed by regulatory targets. If we are to become serious players in global hydrogen markets, we need to replicate this bipartisan success.
Before the RET, wind turbines and solar panels were expensive and renewable energy cost significantly more than electricity from coal and fossil gas. In a highly competitive and innovative market, costs fell sharply, such that renewable energy is now the cheapest form of new energy. And it’s been good for jobs; the renewables industry already employs more than our thermal coal sector. Most renewable energy jobs are in construction, but by 2025 there’ll be more ongoing jobs in renewables than jobs in coal power generation.
To date, Australia has largely focussed on the supply side of green hydrogen, taking a Field of Dreams approach: if you build it, they will come. But the truth is green hydrogen is not yet competitive, just like renewables two decades ago. It’s currently cheaper to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels. Demand for the green alternative won’t materialise until the cost tumbles.
We’ve been here before.
Now is the time to apply the RET template to hydrogen. Much like the RET, let’s start with a modest Green Hydrogen Target, requiring that, say, 5% of all gas used in Australia must be green hydrogen by 2030. The GET could be tailored to focus on supporting the use of renewable hydrogen in those ‘hard to abate’ sectors such as long haul transport (shipping for example) and industrial processes including green ammonia and green steel.
Most steel worldwide is produced in blast furnaces using metallurgical coal, much of which is sourced from Australia. Production of green steel involves a different type of furnace that uses hydrogen to strip off the oxygen molecules from the iron ore. The exhaust is water vapour rather than carbon dioxide. The world’s first green steel plant was opened in Sweden last year. One of the next could be built in Australia, using hydrogen from our own Green Hydrogen Target.
Ammonia is an important industrial chemical, but can also be used as a fuel or as a carrier for hydrogen. Japan’s Green Ammonia Consortium recently laid out a roadmap for using ammonia produced with green hydrogen to decarbonise a number of important sectors, including shipping. The EU is spearheading this juggernaut and could cumulatively invest over €569 billion (AU$889 billion) into green hydrogen with a corresponding 40 gigawatts of electrolyser capacity between 2025 and 2030. Germany itself recently released a €9 billion (AU$14 billion) National Hydrogen Strategy as part of its COVID-19 stimulus package. The industrial heavyweight is hyper-aware it doesn’t have the local resources to satisfy hydrogen demand, and is looking internationally for reliable suppliers of green hydrogen.
Once again Australia is the lucky country, with massive reserves of lithium and other so-called critical minerals for the low-carbon transition. Our boundless plains, windswept and sundrenched, are ready for the clean energy generators that will turn our vast renewable and mineral resources into zero-carbon, high-value commodities – including green hydrogen, green steel, green ammonia and low carbon aluminium.
As our trading partners pivot towards net-zero economies, Australia mustn’t waste another 20 years bickering over climate and energy policy. A Green Hydrogen Target could also be adopted at a state or multi-state level, just like the first renewable energy and greenhouse gas schemes.
A renewable hydrogen target will spur massive investment, bringing the cost of the God Molecule down the cost curve, and helping to secure Australia’s future in this century of decarbonisation.

At least that’s the thinking which led infrastructure developer AECOM to run analysis on sites it believes are particularly promising for renewable development, especially given they already have community acceptance for industry and are often well connected to vital infrastructure.
The company looked at all 58 petroleum fuel refineries and storage & import terminals in Australia and New Zealand and found many with significant potential, including seven ‘unicorn sites’ which it says are uniquely flexible and therefore especially valuable.
“It’s about bringing to attention the broader set of assets that exist within the petroleum industry,” Craig Bearsley, Director of Energy at AECOM Australia and New Zealand, told pv magazine Australia.
“There’s been a lot of talk about repurposing of our refineries, but that’s only four of the 58 sites… so actually if you look at the fuel import & storage terminals, they have often similar properties to those larger refinery sites and have value.”
“It makes a lot of sense for these sites to be repurposed to entirely renewable fuels or other renewable based businesses,” he added.

Since AECOM has worked with many of these sites’ owners, it had access to much of the necessary data already, including information which formed the metrics of desirability like infrastructure connections and location. “This is something we’ve been doing on a site-by-site basis for clients for many years, but we’d never stepped back and said ‘let’s look at all the sites and just run it through our spreadsheets,’” Bearsley said.
AECOM considered at ten different strategic attributes for each of the 58 sites, including:

While Bearsley said AECOM was considering all types of green energy industries, including big batteries and the creation of clean energy hubs, hydrogen is perhaps the most natural fit given it’s also liquid fuel and in that property shares some of the same requirements of petroleum.
“In the initial years, hydrogen is going to be a marginal business and every little advantage a site can get over another will be important,” he said. “By looking at all these different factors, you can start to determine the suitability of each site or its best end use. There were some sites that were really suited to a wide range of end uses and those were our so-called unicorn sites.”
AECOM found seven of these ‘unicorn sites’, but is keeping that list tightly under wraps. “Of course, we work with many of the clients who own those assets and are wanting to support them in transitioning those assets in the future or bringing in other investors or organisations that may be able to utilise those assets,” Bearsley said.
While just seven of the sites were considered ‘unicorns’, Bearsley noted many of the 58 sites were found to be highly useful and valuable even if they aren’t quite as flexible.
Despite that, Bearsley didn’t know of a single project being developed in any of the fuel import & storage terminals. “That’s why this is a thought leadership piece,” he said. “It’s really trying to get people looking further ahead to the next steps that we may need to take in transitioning the sector and the opportunities that exist.”

Speaking at the Australian Hydrogen Conference in May, Chief Executive of the CSIRO, Larry Marshall, described Australia as currently at the “forefront” of hydrogen – a position not often held by our island state and one we must “dig our teeth into.” In recent years, the agency has quadrupled its hydrogen investments and focussed massive amounts of research capacity on the future fuel.
Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, said the program will help promote strong relationships with research agencies in partner countries like Germany, Japan and Singapore to accelerate the development of a global ‘clean’ hydrogen industry.
The Morrison government continues to use the term ‘clean hydrogen’ to muddy the difference between renewable ‘green’ hydrogen and hydrogen made with fossil fuels (blue hydrogen) which claims to offset its production emissions with carbon capture and store technology (CCS). The federal government claims to have invested $1 billion to support Australia’s ‘clean’ hydrogen industry, though the amount allocated to definitively renewable projects is far lower.
“Investing in R&D and building connections with international partners are critical to Australia building and growing our own globally competitive industry. We recognise the important economic and job opportunities becoming a major global hydrogen player will deliver, while also lowering emissions,” Taylor said in a statement about the funding.
Newly appointed Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Christian Porter, who lost his revered position in the cabinet as Attorney-General following a serious rape allegation, said the research and development program will grow Australia’s hydrogen capacity.
“This program will also improve our understanding of future hydrogen supply chains and markets, and help us to harness the potential for an Australian clean hydrogen industry to grow our economy and create Australian jobs,” Porter said in the statement.
He added the new program will “build on and intensify recent collaborative efforts” between his department and the CSIRO in developing an ‘Australian Hydrogen Researcher Network’.

Swiss research institute Agroscope and energy company Romande Energie are building an agrivoltaic project with the support of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) at a site owned by Agroscope in Conthey, in the canton of Valais, Switzerland.
They are building the project with special transparent concentrator PV panels provided by Swiss startup Insolight. The Theia (Translucency and High Efficiency In Agrivoltaics) modules have an efficiency rating of 30% and purportedly let through up to 78% of sunlight.
“Combining two usage modes based on Insolight’s optical micro-tracking technology, these modules focus light on high-efficiency solar cells,” Insolight said in a press release. “When aligned, the optical system can generate energy (E-MODE), but it is also possible to unalign it to ‘leak’ the light (MLT-MODE). The solar modules therefore act like a ‘smart’ shade adjusting the amount of light they let through.”
This makes it possible to optimise the photosynthesis of plants during the seasons and reduce the negative impact of high summer heat on the yields and quality of agricultural products, while recovering the rest of the light in the form of electricity. Starting from July, the panels will be tested for four years on a 165-square-meter surface area. They will replace protective plastic tunnels on strawberries and raspberries.
“Dynamically adjusting the light transmitted to the plants paves the way for increased protection from climate variations and possible increases in crop yields thanks to the matching of the light to the needs of the plants and the lowering of the temperature during heat waves via the shading effect,” said Bastien Christ, head of the berries and medicinal plants group at Agroscope.
pv magazine has previously reported on Insolight‘s module technology. The company – founded by three researchers from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne – has developed panels that rely on expensive III-V multi-junction solar cells from an undisclosed manufacturer.
The cells only cover 0.5% of the panel surface and are covered with protective glass and optical lenses to concentrate and direct sunlight onto them at around 100 times the intensity of standard solar glass. The cells are reportedly able to track the sun through horizontal movement.

In its last quarterly earnings report, Meyer Burger noted that its 27%+ efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar panel would potentially hit the market in 2023. The solar cell in this panel has already been tested at 29.52%.
In late June, JinkoSolar noted in its quarterly earnings report that it expects to successfully test a laminated perovskite solar cell over 30% efficiency by the end of the year. The company also said it had completed the construction of a “high-efficiency laminated perovskite cell technology platform.”
Also in late June, 1366 Technologies merged with Hunt Perovskite Technologies with a goal of offering a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell whose efficiency is 30% greater than the best solar cells on the market.
A reminder: 1366’s CEO told pv magazine USA just six months ago:
In fact, not only do I believe that multiple gigawatts of tandem will be sold before the end of 2022, I am also confident that in a decade’s time, tandem will command more than 50% of our industry’s market share.
The more tempered members of our industry remind us, though, that historically speaking, scaling up solar panel technology from lab to market takes decades.
One professional wondered what JinkoSolar’s “technology platform” really is, and whether it’s appropriate for investors to consider it seriously yet. And another industry watcher expects the 1366 Technologies’ prediction of multiple gigawatts of tandem cell manufacturing capacity in place before the end of next year to fall flat.
This author won’t let any of that rationality dampen our excitement.
The greatest benefit of increased solar panel efficiency is that on a per-watt and per-kilowatt hour basis, everything is cheaper.
In the image above, created by LONGi Solar, there is a comparison between a 380 Watt solar panel and a 425 Watt unit. The units are the same size, but the 425 Watt model has 11.8% more wattage, due to improvements in efficiency. A 380 Watt model found online – LR6-72HPH-380M – had a 19% efficiency.
Note that in the rate-of-change column, hardware and land savings total 7% when shifting from a 380 Watt to the 425 Watt unit on a 1 GW ground-based power plant.
Now imagine that we have a 30% efficient solar panel: that’s a 57% increase in electricity production over the 380 Watt unit. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll pretend benefits scale linearly with the LONGi comparison above. That means the 7% system savings turns into almost 35% savings.
These construction cost savings generally scale with electricity cost savings. Solar is already being proclaimed king of cheap energy generation. If we knock another 35% off construction costs, exclusively from improvements to solar panel efficiency, that’s some pretty sweet icing on the cake.
Three additional benefits result from breakthroughs in solar panel efficiency. First, local land savings result in a reduction in local pushback. Second, a lower carbon footprint results from reduced equipment, transport, and labor needs. And of course, a massive boost to efficiency would certainly reinvigorate the spirit of the entire solar industry, for a third benefit.
The first two benefits are straightforward. For instance, pv magazine USA covered the fight to build what was the largest solar power plant east of the Rockies in 2019.
This fight highlighted that while solar is as popular as apple pie, there has still been a drop in its popularity due partially to agricultural and rural pushback. It also revealed concern about the environmental aspects of manufacturing massive amounts of polysilicon, and the subsequent recycling of those solar panels.
If land use is reduced by one-third and electricity used to manufacture is also reduced by one-third, then it seems logical to assume that the pushback should drop off to some degree as well.
 This image is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) Best Research-Cell Efficiency Chart. Many readers know this chart not because it is directly applicable to their lives, but because it’s just so darn cool to see the blistering progress that solar technology has achieved in recent years.
Records are cool, lasers that beam energy to specialized solar cells are cool, and even carbon-nanotube solar pipe dreams are cool (even if we never figure out how to manufacture them) because that’s simply how life, and innovation, works.
If – or, more likely when – the solar manufacturers of the world sort out the manufacturing challenges behind tandem perovskite+silicon solar cells, it will open a clear path towards 34-35% efficient solar cells (the current speculative peak efficiency value of this product).
Already multi-layered solar cell products are common in expensive markets – the International Space Station for instance – but it is still too expensive for practical surface-based electricity generation.
We will finally see multijunction high efficiency products for the common person.
Of course, multi-layered products are currently available for purchase. Panasonic’s HIT goes way back, and REC’s Alpha product was released less than two years ago. But these products haven’t yet fulfilled the promises of our efficiency dreams.
Those efficiency dreams, without a doubt, lie deep within the minds of Fraunhofer’s and NREL’s researchers, as we can see from the aforementioned 68.9% solar cell, which absorbs laser blasts, or the 47.1% six layer solar cell, which is manufactured with surprisingly achievable technologies.
As our planet experiences record heat waves as a result of carbon emissions, killing our most vulnerable, it’s nice to have something to dream about.

Q Cells and Samsung have signed a “zero energy homes” deal under which they will combine their hardware and software platforms to provide comprehensive energy services, including generation, energy storage, power consumption, and intelligent energy management.
The “zero energy home” concept involves the efficient use of energy directly produced on-site to enable energy independence and reduce emissions. This is achieved via “active technology” –generation resources – and “passive technology,” or energy efficiency measures.
The role of Q Cells in the partnership will be to provide solar modules and energy storage systems (ESS) to customers, as well as its Q.ONNECT home energy management system. The platform features an optimised ESS operation service that uses expected charge amount data and local weather forecasts.
When linked to Samsung Electronics’ SmartThings platform, the data will give homeowners control to optimise home energy use. The platform can link to Samsung and non-Samsung devices for centralised appliance management. The service is intended to give homeowners a clearer view of how energy is consumed by heat pumps and appliances, letting them set up a more sustainable energy management plan.
In addition, the two companies plan to cooperate on joint sales, mainly in the U.S. and European markets.
