ESI director Stuart Parry said the Maryborough facility will deliver significant social and economic benefits to regional communities while helping to support the state’s renewable energy targets through the production of low-cost, environmentally friendly batteries for large-scale energy storage.
“Our initial manufacturing base at Maryborough will manufacture and distribute iron-flow batteries that allow large-scale energy storage for wholesale electricity generators, energy retailers, and commercial and industrial customers,” he said.
“Our products are essential to Australia’s renewable energy future.”
Parry said he expects the Maryborough centre to be operational by 2024 and also revealed the company plans to expand operations, with ESI – an offshoot of Brisbane-based renewables investor Sword and Stone Capital Management – already assessing locations for a second Queensland facility, most likely in either Townsville or Gladstone.
“We have plans to expand our operations so that, by the end of 2026, ESI will deliver up to 400 MW of energy storage each year for the next 15 years, that is 6 GW of energy storage, or 20% of Australia’s renewable energy storage needs,” he said.
“When fully operational in 2026, we will have up to 500 highly skilled employees and contractors working at our facilities throughout regional Queensland.
“Longer-term, we plan to export our renewable energy storage solutions to the Asia Pacific region.”

The Maryborough facility will be the first of its kind in Australia with Parry saying EIS had identified iron-flow technology as superior to rival technologies, including lithium-ion batteries which have dominated the large-scale storage sector.
“Our batteries have a 10 to 14-hour storage capacity and a lifecycle of 25 years, something that is not provided by other battery technologies,” he said.
“The low-cost, environmentally friendly electrolyte also means that the product is ideally suited to remote locations.”
It is expected EIS will utilise flow battery and electrolyte management system technology developed by United States-based battery specialist ESS Inc with the device either deployed in containers or in a large-scale grid connected warehouse.
Among the claimed benefits of ESI’s modular iron-flow batteries is an expected service life of 25 years (20,000+ cycling capability with no degradation) and the use of abundant materials that can be sourced locally.
The electrolyte is non-flammable and non-toxic, the batteries can operate efficiently in ambient temperatures of – 5°C to 50°C, and are 100% recyclable. The batteries can also be stored charged for extended periods without losing charge and system storage capacity can be increased by increasing the liquid storage volume.
And while lithium-ion might have a lower capital cost per kilowatt-hour, ESS claims its iron-flow system can reportedly claim parity at four hours and win thereafter.
ESI said the design of the battery system will allow it to procure up to 80% of the battery components in regional Queensland.

Parry said ESI is fully integrated and will manufacture, install, maintain and finance energy storage solutions for their customers and once fully operational, the company expects its projects will contribute an estimated $4.5 billion to the Queensland economy.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles welcomed the manufacturing facility and said the government is working to position the state as the gateway for battery innovation, which he described as “a key component of the energy revolution”.
“Energy storage is key to unlocking Queensland’s renewable energy revolution as we power towards our target of having 50% renewables by 2030,” he said.
“Queensland is becoming a renewable energy superpower and we’re well-positioned to be Australia and Asia-Pacific’s energy storage gateway.
“In the near future, power generated from a nearby wind or solar farm will be stored in iron-flow batteries and help power Queensland.”
The start of work on the Maryborough manufacturing facility is the latest in a suite of big battery announcements. In recent days, energy generator Stanwell has revealed plans to a build a massive 1.45 GW/2.9 GWh battery storage system in Central Queensland while fellow government-owned utility CS Energy has outlined plans to build a 200 MW/400 MWh battery at Greenbank in Brisbane’s outer southern suburbs.
The batteries are among plans for 13 large-scale battery systems outlined by the Queensland government in the most recent state budget, alongside $15 million to scale up the National Battery Testing Centre in Brisbane and $5 million to finalise and release a Queensland Battery Strategy, due later this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/07/squadron-begins-work-on-3-billion-queensland-wind-and-solar-hub/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 7, 2022",Squadron begins work on $3 billion Queensland wind and solar hub,"Iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest’s private company Squadron Energy has marked the start of construction on the $3 billion Clarke Creek renewable energy precinct with a ground-breaking ceremony at the site of what it has described as Australia’s largest grid-connected renewable energy project.
The Clarke Creek project comprises an 800 MW wind farm, up to 400 MW of solar installations, and a battery energy storage facility of an as yet unspecified size although there have been reports Squadron is looking at installing up to 2 GWh of battery storage at the site.
The project, being developed across 76,300 hectares about 150 kilometres north-west of Rockhampton in Central Queensland, will be delivered in two stages. Stage one, which is now under construction, will comprise 100 wind turbines that will produce about 450 MW of clean energy by 2025.
Squadron has already signed a supply deal with Queensland government-owned energy generator Stanwell Corporation for most of the output of the first stage of the project. Stanwell has inked a 346.5MW Power Purchase Agreement as part of a 15-year commitment to the project.
Stage two of the Clarke Creek project will include the remainder of the wind generation capacity and an expected 400 MW solar farm teamed with a grid-scale battery energy storage system.
Squadron said when complete, the precinct could produce enough wind, solar and battery energy to power more than 660,000 homes equivalent to approximately 40% of Queensland households and will export lower cost electricity directly into the National Electricity Market (NEM).

The start of construction on the project comes just days after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) outlined its vision for the next 30 years of the NEM, including the massive investment required to transition from fossil fuels to firmed renewables.
AEMO’s current forecasts show a nine-fold expansion of wind and solar farm capacity is needed by 2050 to meet the nation’s net-zero emissions targets.
Forrest said the Clarke Creek project, which he described as the “largest renewable energy precinct in the southern hemisphere”, will be crucial in delivering on that demand.
“We will deliver affordable energy for Australian families and industry without destroying the environment like carbon emitting fuels do,” he said.
“When fully operational, Clarke Creek will displace enormous amounts of carbon each year by harnessing the renewable energy of the wind and sun to power our homes and commercial premises, providing cheaper energy without the hidden costs associated with coal-fired power stations.”

Forrest said Clarke Creek’s grid-scale generation capability is expected to displace 2.7 million tonnes of carbon each year and aligns with the Queensland government’s integrated energy plan for the state.
“We are investing in Clarke Creek not only to harness the renewable power of the wind and sun to energise our homes, our factories and our cities, but as a critical step towards breaking our reliance on fossil fuels,” he said.
Squadron Energy chairman John Hartman said the Clarke Creek precinct, with its combination of solar, wind and battery technologies, is just the sort of project AEMO is targeting as the shift to renewables accelerates.
Hartman said the project has an excellent combination of strong and predominantly night-time wind energy generation to complement Queensland solar production.
“There is currently a large supply gap in wind generation in order to meet 2030 projections due to the electrification of industry and transport, and we believe large energy hubs like Clarke Creek, which leverage multiple technologies and storage to deliver firmed power, are a crucial solution,” he said.
Squadron expects stage one of the project will create about 350 construction jobs and inject more than $100 million into the local economy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/07/renewables-investors-call-for-urgent-reform-of-regulatory-processes/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 7, 2022",Renewables investors call for urgent reform of regulatory processes,"The Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG), representing investors holding more than $24 billion and more than 70 renewable energy assets, has urged federal and state governments to urgently implement market reforms to deliver the certainty required to manage grid access and congestion for new wind and solar projects.
CEIG chief executive Simon Corbell said renewable energy generators have been curtailed across the National Electricity Market (NEM) because of ongoing problems with congestion in the grid and warned a growing number of developers and investors are now looking offshore for better opportunities.
“Grid congestion is a handbrake to renewable energy investment and must be urgently fixed,” he said.
“Investors could not be any clearer: we need urgent reform to grid access and congestion management to ensure the uptake of future clean energy projects in Australia. Without this, investors will continue to see higher levels of risk in the Australian market.”
The CEIG, which represents 18 renewable energy developers and investors with a combined generation portfolio of 11 GW, said a recent survey of its members had highlighted that investors consider the risks associated with grid congestion had caused a 100 to 250 basis-point increase in the cost of equity for renewable energy projects in Australia compared to other OECD markets.
As a result, many investors are now focusing their attentions on the United States, European and Asian market instead of Australia.
The CEIG’s call for urgent regulatory action comes after the Energy Security Board (ESB) recently released its consultation paper on grid access and congestion management reform. Four models are shortlisted for feedback, including a Congestion Management Model (CMM) which would impose a cost on generators connecting into congested parts of the grid.
Project developers connecting to uncongested parts of the grid would receive priority rights under changes to transmission access intended to support Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) being developed in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania.

The ESB’s proposed market reforms include a congestion management model.The CMM proposal has proven controversial and in its submission to the ESB’s latest consultation, the CEIG said the introduction of the model would likely lead to a “significant slowdown in new generation and storage investment”.
The CEIG has instead urged the ESB to support its alternative transmission queue reform proposal with congestion managed on a ‘last in, first curtailed’ basis with the most recent project connected to a congested part of the grid the first to face curtailment.
CEIG said its transmission queue reform would incentivise project developers to build new projects in parts of the grid with sufficient capacity, protect existing renewable generators’ ability to get their power onto the grid, and in turn deliver greater certainty for investors.
An information forum on the ESB’s proposed grid reforms will be held on May 26, with submissions on the paper due by June 10.
Corbell said investors will be watching closely with “urgent regulatory reform is needed to unlock Australia’s energy security”.
“Australia has no more time to waste,” he said. “The next three months will be vital to progress the detailed design of all shortlisted reform proposals before a recommendation is made to ministers at the end of this year.
“Getting reform right is critical to lower the cost of capital and therefore minimise the costs that will be paid by consumers for the generation, storage and transmission assets necessary for the energy transition.”

Indian developer Acme Group has announced plans to invest INR 52,474 crore ($9.7 billion) to build a green hydrogen and green ammonia project in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
It signed the initial agreement with the state government during the Tamil Nadu Investment Conclave. The project will produce green ammonia through the ammonia synthesis loop process with electrolysis-based hydrogen.
Acme will build a 5 GW solar PV plant to power 1.5 GW of electrolysis capacity for green hydrogen production and 1.1 million tonnes of ammonia synthesis loop.
“This will be the largest such plant in India and perhaps one of the largest in the world. It will produce green hydrogen and ammonia, which will help decarbonise sectors such as fertilisers, power, refining, and steel, among others,” said Acme Group Chairman Manoj K Upadhyay. “The project requires four ingredients – solar radiation, access to port, availability of land and skilled resources. Tamil Nadu offers all of these.”
Sandeep Kashyap, COO of Acme Group, said, that the company is willing to work with the government to help build the project, in addition to “an ecosystem of smaller units.”

Module manufacturer JinkoSolar has started manufacturing activities at its new n-type ingot factory in Xining, Qinghai Province. The factory has a capacity of 20 GW and should reach full utilisation rate by the end of the summer. Jinko is currently increasing the manufacturing capacity of n-type products to respond to the technical shift from p-type to n-type solar modules. With the recent commissioning of two n-type solar cell manufacturing bases in Anhui and Zhejiang, Jinko reached 16.9 GW if n-type TOPCon solar cell capacity at the end of June.
Panel manufacturer DAH Solar sealed a deal with the government of Chaohu City, Anhui Province, to set up a 5 GW factory to produce n-type TOPCon solar cells and modules.  The company wants to invest US$307 million in the new facility. The beginning of manufacturing activities is scheduled for the beginning of 2023.
Polysilicon and solar cell manufacturer Tongwei raised the price of all of its solar cells this week. The company priced its PERC 182 mm cells at CNY 1.26 (US$0.19) per watt, up 5%, and its PERC 210 mm cells at CNY 1.23 per watt, up 4.24%. It also increased the price of its M6 cells by 6% to CNY 1.24 per watt. Tongwei’s cell prices have been trending upward since the beginning of 2021
Energy giant China Power International Development will assume ownership of a raft of clean energy companies including more than 350 MW of solar generation capacity. The state-owned utility this week announced it will issue the equivalent of 14.19% of its stock in a deal worth CNY 5.78 billion to acquire facilities, including 294 MW of solar. It will also pay CNY 1.67 billion cash in a separate arrangement to acquire projects that include 56 MW of solar. The selling companies are subsidiaries of the State Power Investment Corporation Ltd, which is also China Power’s controlling shareholder. As part of the purchases, China Power will also have the right of first refusal to acquire any future clean energy projects the business units may wish to sell.
State-owned developer Beijing Energy International last week announced it had awarded a CNY 317 million engineering, procurement, and construction contract for the 150 MW first phase of a planned 300 MW agrivoltaic plant in Baise City, in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The contract was awarded to state-owned China Jikan Research Institute of Engineering Investigation and Design Co Ltd and private company Xi’an Boao Power Engineering Co Ltd.
Comtec Solar last week announced its auditors had calculated expected credit losses for 2021 would mean an annual loss of CNY 61.3 million (US$9.13 million). The unaudited figures published by Comtec at the end of March had estimated an annual loss of CNY 44.9 million.
Solar developer Shunfeng International has negotiated a deal for state-owned investor Sino Alliance Capital to take receipt of a 70 MW solar plant in Xinjiang in return for writing off a CNY 664 million (US$99.1 million) debt. Sino Alliance, which is indirectly owned by China’s Ministry of Finance, has been owed HKD 661 million (US$84.2 million) since the end of 2020. The Shunfeng investor has agreed to take ownership of Shunfeng solar project company Xinjiang Pu Xin Cheng Da Energy Technology Ltd with the asset worth a nominal CNY 528 million. Sino Alliance will also agree to write off the other HKD 155 million it is owed by Shunfeng. The proposed project transfer, which would leave Shunfeng with 176 MW of solar generation capacity, will be subject to a vote by independent shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. Shunfeng, which this week said it is owed CNY 601 million in three years’ worth of unpaid state solar subsidies, saw a proposed CNY 890 million sale of 132 MW of solar capacity to a state-owned buyer fall through in June, with the deal complicated by a court freeze on the developer’s assets. An updated list of overdue creditors published by Shunfeng indicated True Bold Global Ltd has been owed HKD 162 million since November 2019; the investors in a 2015 convertible bond (CB) have been claiming CNY 330 million since March 2020; backers of a 2016 CB have been owed CNY 255 million since October 2021; Rainbow Fort Investments has been due HKD 263 million since May 31; and the Hong Kong branch of China Minsheng Banking Corp has been owed HKD 141 million since June 30.
