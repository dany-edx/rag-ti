The AEC’s Quarterly Solar Report shows while coal-fired generation has more capacity, rooftop solar is continuing to expand with 109,000 systems installed in the second quarter this year.
The AEC said analysis of the latest data from the Clean Energy Regulator shows that at the end of June more than 2.86 million solar systems had been installed on Australian rooftops, delivering a total installed capacity of more than 14.7 GW, ensuring rooftop solar continues to eat into the market share once firmly held by fossil fuel-powered generators.
AEC chief executive Sarah McNamara said the average installed capacity of rooftop solar has steadily increased and continues to defy expectations.
“While the 2020-21 financial year was difficult for most industries due to the impact of COVID-19, Australia’s rooftop solar PV industry does not appear to have been overly affected, based on this AEC analysis,” she said.
“All jurisdictions, except the Northern Territory, hit records for the number of solar panels installed compared to the previous financial year.”
The AEC said that during the 2020-21 financial year, an estimated 373,000 solar systems were installed on Australian homes, up from 323,500 during 2019-20. Installed capacity also jumped from 2.5 GW to more than 3 GW while the average unit size reached 8.06 kW in June.
New South Wales led the way with more than 116,000 rooftop systems installed and 965 MW of capacity added to household rooftops during the 2020-21 financial year.
Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia also saw strong uptake, with a total of 212,000 installations and a combined capacity of 1.67 GW.
McNamara said continued low technology costs, increased working from home arrangements, and a shift in household spending to home improvements during the COVID-19 pandemic played a key role in the increased rollout of rooftop solar PV systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/05/construction-of-jabiru-solarstorage-hybrid-project-hits-next-phase/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 5, 2021",Construction of Jabiru solar+storage hybrid project hits next phase,"Energy Developments Limited (EDL) has confirmed the next phase of construction has commenced on a new off-grid integrated hybrid solar PV/battery storage/diesel power plant which will deliver at least 50% renewable energy to the remote Northern Territory township of Jabiru.
EDL, which will own and operate the Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Project, announced earlier this week that clearing works have been completed for the hybrid microgrid being developed at Jabiru, about 250 kilometres east of Darwin.
“EDL started construction of the innovative Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Project in June with site clearing,” EDL chief executive James Harman said.
“Our project team has completed site preparation works and is now starting to construct the diesel and battery components of the power station. Works on the solar farm will soon follow.”
The off-grid power system will comprise a 3.9 MW solar farm and a 3 MW/5 MWh battery energy storage system backed up by 4.5 MW diesel capability.
Juwi Renewable Energy, the Brisbane-based subsidiary of German renewable energy pioneer juwi, has been appointed to construct the 3.9 MW solar farm which will ensure at least half of the hybrid system’s energy generation is renewable.
“Once completed, our hybrid renewable power station will provide Jabiru with at least 50% renewable energy over the long term, without compromising power quality or reliability,” Harman said.
“We are excited about providing this sustainable energy solution to the people of Jabiru and are proud to contribute to the Northern Territory’s 50% renewable energy target by 2030.”

The diesel generators are scheduled to come online by the end of 2021 with the solar farm to be fully commissioned by February 2022.
The project is part of the Territory Government’s $135.5 million dollar commitment to help the Jabiru community transition from its recent history as a uranium mining town to a tourist destination.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said it will also help the government meet its target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
“Jabiru is an important town, and the gateway to Kakadu National Park and the West Arnhem Region,” he said.
“We are investing millions into Jabiru to transform it into the tourism and services hub we know it will one day be.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/05/egp-confirms-expansion-with-125-mw-battery-storage-plans-approved/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 5, 2021",EGP confirms expansion with 125 MW battery storage plans approved,"Elliott Green Power Australia (EGP) has confirmed it has received local government approval to develop a 50 MW/100 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) adjacent to its Susan River Solar Farm in southeast Queensland.
EGP said the Fraser Coast Regional Council has approved the development of a utility scale battery to be connected to the grid at the same location as the existing Susan River Solar Farm near Maryborough, about 300 kilometres north of Brisbane.
A source close to the company said the BESS development aligns with the Queensland Government’s ambition to introduce more storage solutions that support the continued uptake of renewables and provide security for the state’s electricity network.
“Given the market dynamics in Queensland, solar plus storage adds significant operating flexibility and value to existing high-quality generation capacity,” the source told pv magazine.
The Susan River BESS project is the latest in EGP’s battery developments with the company, a wholly owned subsidiary of United States-based hedge fund management company Elliott Investment Management, progressing development of 125 MW of battery storage across its Australian solar PV assets.
The company has already secured development approval for a utility-scale storage asset to be connected at its 56 MW Childers Solar Farm in southeast Queensland. The 25 MW/50 MWh project is expected to reach financial close before the end of the year.
EGP is also continuing to progress a utility-scale storage project at the 105 MW Nevertire Solar Farm in north-west New South Wales. The 50 MW/100 MWh project is currently progressing through approvals.
The source said the development of energy storage systems alongside the solar farms would enhance the operational profile of EGP’s existing assets and open new revenue opportunities including ancillary services and merchant arbitrage.
The expansion plans come despite EGP confirming it remains committed to the sale of its Australian portfolio with Bank of America appointed to oversee the sale.

The company said it would “not comment on market speculation” but the source told pv magazine 100% of EGP will be sold, with no complex minority shareholder considerations or listed company considerations.
The source said EGP has already received “significant inquiry in its portfolio of premium, highly contracted, de-risked strategically located assets”.
“Institutional investors, infrastructure funds and international strategics without a renewables presence in this market are seeking strategic market entry,” the source said.
“The combination of operational assets, development pipeline and management team are highly attractive to these investors.”
EGP is not alone in its decision to pull out of the Australia sector, with a number of renewable energy players looking to exit the large-scale wind and solar market.
Another portfolio could soon be on the block with U.S. private equity fund Denham Capital looking to offload its Australian solar PV assets.
Denham Capital, which owns 95% of Nexif Energy, has reportedly hired U.S. investment banking giant JPMorgan to oversee the sale of its renewable energy assets in the APAC, among them the soon-to-be-completed 464 MW Lincoln Gap Wind Farm in South Australia.
The 126 MW first stage of Lincoln Gap project has already been completed and construction has commenced on the 86 MW second stage. Plans and approvals are also in place for another 252 MW. The project also includes 10 MW/10 MWh of battery storage.
Singapore-based Nexif Energy also owns the 154 MW Snapper Point peaking generator in South Australia and a number of renewable energy assets in Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/05/maoneng-pushes-safety-message-for-mornington-battery-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 5, 2021",Maoneng pushes safety message for Mornington battery system,"Australian renewable energy developer Maoneng has cited safety concerns as the key driver for its decision to use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries at its proposed Mornington Peninsular Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).
Sydney-based Maoneng is planning to build a 240 MWp/480 MWh BESS at Tyabb on the Mornington Peninsula. The company is currently undertaking a competitive tender process to select its contractor for the project, which is expected to be completed by late 2022, but has already confirmed LFP batteries will be used.
In a statement issued just six days after fire damaged two Tesla Megapack battery modules at the Neoen-developed Victoria Big Battery, Maoneng said it would utilise LFP batteries at the proposed facility due to the technology’s strong safety performance.
Maoneng, which has announced plans to develop more than 1.8 GWh of utility-scale battery storage projects across Australia, said the decision comes after an extensive technical analysis of various battery types available on the global market.
“LFP batteries have a relatively much higher thermal stability and less dense chemical composition than other varieties prominent in utility scale batteries, such as NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) technology, therefore significantly reducing risks,” the company said in a statement.
Maoneng CEO Morris Zhou said safety is the company’s top priority, and it is important for people to understand how battery technology varies and risks are mitigated.
“Batteries will play an increasingly important and necessary role as Australia transitions from traditional energy sources to renewable energy,” he said.
“LFP technology has a very good safety record, which is why we have chosen it for the Mornington BESS.
“The batteries will be supported by other systems to enable a high level of confidence in our approach to safety.”

Maoneng’s decision comes just days after a fire started during testing of the 300 MW/450 MWh Victoria Big Battery, which is due for completion this year. It was more than three days before emergency services declared the fire under control but there has been no update on its cause.
Tesla announced earlier this year it would switch to LFP chemistry from NMC for its Megapacks, but it is not clear which chemistry has been used in the Victoria Big Battery.
Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy told AAP “physical inspections and investigations are now underway”.
Maoneng said in addition to the LFP batteries, the Mornington BESS will also have other safety management measures incorporated into its design.
Among these will be a state-of-the-art fire detection system, plus an advanced fire suppression system that operates 24/7 and deploys a condensed aerosol agent to automatically handle any potential hazard in minutes.
“The fire suppression system is globally proven and used in many critical applications to suppress fire in the enclosed special hazard conditions often found in power generation, battery energy storage, and oil and gas projects,” the company said.
“The agent itself is environmentally friendly, and typically remains suspended in the battery container to help prevent reignition.”
As well as the Mornington BESS project, Maoneng has also filed plans to develop a 225 MW/450 MWh battery energy storage at Gould Creek in South Australia and has a contract to develop four large-scale batteries, each 50 MW/100 MWh in capacity in New South Wales (NSW), for energy giant AGL.
Its portfolio includes nearly 300 MW of generation power from the Sunraysia Solar Farm in NSW and the Mugga Lane Solar Park in the ACT, which is enough to power over 50,000 homes across Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/05/australian-firm-partners-with-jsw-energy-on-green-hydrogen-projects-in-india/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 5, 2021",Australian firm partners with JSW Energy on green hydrogen projects in India,"From pv magazine India
Australia’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has signed an agreement with JSW Future Energy Limited, an arm of power producer JSW Energy Limited, to explore green hydrogen development and use in industrial and transport sectors in India.
FFI is committed to producing zero-emission green hydrogen from 100% renewable sources. It is actively establishing renewable green hydrogen and green industrial projects globally.
Under the agreement, FFI and JSW Energy will collaborate and conduct scoping work on potential projects in green hydrogen production. They will also explore opportunities to utilise green hydrogen for steel making, hydrogen mobility, ammonia, and other mutually agreed industrial applications in India.
JSW Energy aims to reach 20 GW of power generation capacity by 2030, with about 85% of the portfolio comprising green and renewable energy sources. It aspires to become a green energy future tech company by adopting innovative technologies like green hydrogen, offshore wind, and battery energy storage. Partnership with FFI provides it the opportunity to become a front-runner in green hydrogen applications in India.
The FFI-JSW partnership follows the recent announcement by state-run oil and gas major IndianOil to set up a green hydrogen plant at its Mathura refinery in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. Indian EPC contractor BGR Energy Systems has also partnered Fusion Fuel Green, an Ireland-headquartered green hydrogen technology company, to develop green hydrogen projects in India. 
Meanwhile, Reliance Industries has unveiled its plan to set up an electrolyser Giga factory to manufacture modular electrolysers of the highest efficiency and lowest capital cost. These will be used for captive production of green hydrogen for domestic use and global sale. 
The announcements come as the Indian government pushes for a green hydrogen economy. “India proposes to green industry sectors to replace Grey Hydrogen (drawn from imported natural gas) with Green Hydrogen, and for this, it will come out with a Green Hydrogen Purchase Obligation for different sectors like petroleum and fertiliser. This will also provide huge demand for domestically manufactured solar and wind equipment as well as storage,” said power minister RK Singh recently.
Hydrogen plays a critical role in the Indian economy, with roughly 6 million tons of hydrogen consumed annually, primarily in ammonia and methanol production and for use in refineries. A report from The Energy and Resources Institute estimated that demand could grow to as much as 28 million tons by 2050. 
Enabling cost-effective domestic production of green hydrogen is critical for India to reduce the carbon intensity of heavy industry and help achieve its energy security and emissions targets—as virtually all the hydrogen consumed in India today is grey hydrogen, the production of which emits roughly 9 tons of CO2 per ton of hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/05/crystal-arrangement-results-in-1000x-more-power-from-ferroelectric-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 5, 2021","Crystal arrangement results in 1,000x more power from ferroelectric solar cells","From pv magazine Global
Combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can raise the photovoltaic effect of solar cells by a factor of 1,000, according to researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) in Germany.
Their findings, published in the journal Science Advances, described a lattice arrangement of three different layers of ferroelectric crystals (in this case, of barium titanate, strontium titanate, and calcium titanate) that created a powerful solar energy producing effect.
Ferroelectric means that the material has spatially separated positive and negative charges. The charge separation leads to an asymmetric structure that enables electricity to be generated from light.
Ferroelectric crystals differ from conventional silicon cells in that they do not require a p-n junction to create the PV effect. In other words, there is no need to create positively and negatively doped layers within the cell. The researchers said that change could make solar panels easier to produce.
MLU researchers have been experimenting with barium titanate to take advantage of these properties. However, pure barium titanate does not absorb much sunlight; as a result, it generates a relatively low photocurrent. The research showed that combining ultra-thin layers of different materials can significantly increase a cell’s yield.
Researchers added a thin paraelectric layer to the cell. Although this layer does not have separated charges, it can become ferroelectric under certain conditions; for example, in low temperatures or when the chemical structure is slightly modified.
MLU physicist Dr. Akash Bhatnagar and his team discovered that a much stronger photovoltaic effect occurs when the ferroelectric layer alternates with not one, but two different paraelectric layers.
The team embedded barium titanate between strontium titanate and calcium titanate. This was achieved by vaporising the crystals with a high-powered laser, redepositing them on carrier substrates. The result was a material made of 500 layers that was only about 200 nanometers thick.
The MLU team irradiated the cell with laser light to test the new material, and the results surprised them. Compared to pure barium titanate of a similar thickness, the current flow was up to 1,000 times stronger, despite the proportion of barium titanate having been reduced by almost two-thirds.
“The interaction between the lattice layers appears to lead to a much higher permittivity – in other words, the electrons are able to flow much more easily due to the excitation by the light photons,” Bhatnagar said.
The studies show the effect is also resilient as it remained nearly constant over a six-month test period. Further research is underway to understand what exactly causes this photovoltaic effect.
