Launched in 2016, Okra has developed an Internet-of-Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence-enabled mesh-grid which shares power through an interconnected network of homes. The plug-and-play solar home system includes a solar panel, battery and a smart device. A cloud-based system monitors usage and required maintenance, while allowing for remote control.
At present, the company is focused on the Philippines, Haiti, Cambodia and Nigeria which is home to the world’s largest unelectrified population, totalling approximately 80 million people.
The funding was led by Singapore-based technology fund and advisory group SDGx, Schneider Electric Energy Access, Autodesk Foundation, Explorer Investments and Didendum. Okra is also opening its Series A round, with the aim of raising a further $6 million to help finance its expansion into other countries.
SDGx partner and chief impact officer Zarmeen Parvi said Okra Solar ticked all the boxes for the technology fund.
“It’s rare to see an Australian company scale so successfully into many international markets so quickly,” he said. “Okra Solar brings an impact multiplier that intersects and positively contributes towards energy access. This is a great example of how an impact multiplier also drives scale with commercial outcomes, while solving the world’s GHG emissions and climate change problems.”
Okra co-founder and chief executive officer Afnan Hannan said the funding will be used to scale up commercial operations and product development in Nigeria and Haiti as the company looks to expand.
“It feels great to lock in this funding so that we can accelerate our growth,” he said. “We’re excited to continue charging towards providing energy access for the 770 million people living in off-grid communities.
“Our mesh-grids leverage IoT and automation to make last-mile electrification affordable and sustainable – even for the most remote villages on the planet. Our innovation has spurred global demand from utility companies.”

Hannan said in contrast to centralized microgrids, Okra’s mesh-grid technology allows for all assets – from solar panels to batteries and inverters – to be installed at individual households.
This design ensures the majority of energy is generated and consumed at the same place but additionally, neighbouring households can also interconnect and form power-sharing clusters, where smart algorithms redistribute excess power.
Grid operators use Okra’s software to monitor, maintain, service and receive payment from end-users via the cloud.
The funding announcement comes after Okra recently signed a memorandum of understanding with African investment firm SAO Capital to scale up their existing projects to an additional 290,000 homes over the next three years.
Okra said if the partnership achieves its objectives, it will be the largest project globally to energise off-grid households with decentralised grids.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/23/wa-announces-ambitious-plan-to-cut-emissions-by-80-by-2030/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 23, 2022",WA announces ‘ambitious’ plan to cut emissions by 80% by 2030,"The Western Australian (WA) government announced on Thursday that all state government agencies will be required to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 2020 levels by 2030 as part of its plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
WA Premier Mark McGowan said the interim target sends a signal to the state’s private sector that climate action is a priority for his government.
It also provides a clear message that WA is open for investment in renewable energy generation, he said.
“My government has an ambitious climate agenda, which can be delivered responsibly,” McGowan said. “Action on climate change is crucial to diversifying the WA economy, creating long-term jobs, managing environmental impacts.
“This interim target sends a signal to the broader economy that we are serious about tackling climate change and setting up Western Australia for a healthy, prosperous low-carbon future.”
The emissions target announcement comes just a week after the government revealed the state-owned power provider Synergy will close its two remaining coal plants by late 2029 as part of a transition to cleaner energy.
McGowan said coal-fired generation is becoming increasingly unviable as the uptake of rooftop solar and other renewable energy grows. It is expected the closure of the Collie and Muja power plants will reduce government emissions on the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) by 80%.

McGowan said an estimated $3.8 billion will be invested to 2030 in new renewable power infrastructure, including generation and storage, to ensure WA has affordable and reliable power into the future.
The 2030 state interim commitment applies to all government agencies, including transport, health and education, as well as Government Trading Enterprises like Water Corporation, LandCorp and port authorities.
To help achieve the target, the government said it will deliver a range of initiatives including energy efficiency measures, buying renewable energy, purchasing more electric vehicles for its fleet and using local offsets. The state government has also committed to not building any new natural gas-fired power stations on the SWIS after 2030.
Work will continue “over coming months” with business and research institutions “to identify robust and credible emissions reduction pathways” through Sectoral Emissions Reduction Strategies (SERS), to be in place by late 2023.
Greenpeace welcomed the WA government’s new near-term climate targets but said more work needs to be done on the transition away from gas.
Greenpeace Australia Pacific Head of Clean Transitions Jess Panegyres said the emissions targets put WA out in front of the country’s energy transition, but warned “the McGowan government needs to get serious about reducing the role of gas”.
“With projects like Woodside’s proposed Scarborough and Browse gas fields set to release billions of tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution over the course of their operation, Western Australia’s gas industry undermines the state’s climate targets and impedes the clean energy transition,” she said.
“It’s time for Western Australia to fully embrace the renewable energy transition and leave polluting fossil fuels in the past.”
The WA government did not confirm if it would enshrine its climate targets in legislation. The Federal Government is however preparing to next month legislate a nationwide emissions reduction of 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Since its formation in 2018, Energy Estate has announced plans to co-develop more than 30 GW of large-scale projects, including solar PV, long-duration energy storage, wind, and hydrogen production.
Among the projects being pursued by the company is the 2 GW Central Queensland Power Project being developed in conjunction with Renewable Energy Systems (RES) about 30 kilometres inland from Rockhampton.
Energy Estate said the first stage of the development would focus on the construction of the Moah Creek Renewable Energy Project which is to combine 200 MW of solar, 400 MW of wind, and a minimum 600 MWh of battery energy storage. The intent is to supply heavy industry in the region, including the Boyne aluminium smelter.
Energy Estate has also teamed with Mirus Wind to develop the Walcha Energy Project near the town of the same name, about 55km south of Armidale in New South Wales. The planned 4 GW project would include a 700 MW solar farm, a wind component, a 100 MW/150 MWh battery and a pumped hydro power station.
More recently, Energy Estate announced it would partner with Sunshine Hydro to develop a super-hybrid green hydrogen project near Gladstone in central Queensland. Valued at up to $5.5 billion, the Flavian super-hybrid project would incorporate 1.8 GW of wind generation and 600 MW of pumped hydro with 18 hours of storage. The project would also include 300 MW of hydrogen electrolysers, 50 MW of liquefaction, and a 50 MW hydrogen fuel cell.
While most of the projects remain in the early planning and feasibility stages, Energy Estate co-founder Vincent Dwyer said the funding round will be used to fund the construction of its platform of projects in Australia and New Zealand and to fast-track the company’s development activities.
“We have now embarked on the next step of our journey,” he said. “This will result in the large-scale, flexible renewable energy portfolio we are co-developing with our partners providing decarbonised energy, whether in the form of electrons, hydrogen, ammonia or other e-fuels, to local consumers including heavy industry and into export markets.
“Given the current turmoil in energy markets in Australia and the importance of decarbonisation across the broader industrial supply chain, including but beyond just low-cost power, leaning large-scale flexible renewable portfolios into industrial energy solutions is an important next step in the decarbonisation journey.”
Energy Estate has engaged Nomura Greentech as its financial advisor for the capital raising initiative.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/23/philippines-approves-24-bidders-for-2-gw-renewables-auction/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,PHILIPPINES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 23, 2022",Philippines approves 24 bidders for 2 GW renewables auction,"The Green Energy Auction Bids Evaluation and Awards Committee (GEA-BEAC) of the Philippines’ Department of Energy (DOE) has approved 24 bidders to compete in an auction to allocate 2 GW of renewable energy capacity it launched in January.
“Of the 24 bidders, eight were from solar, another eight were from wind, seven were from run-of-river hydro, and one was from biomass,” the DOE said. “The success of this competitive process will set the benchmark for the future auction rounds, as the resulting Green Energy Tariff (GET) will reflect the value of electricity.”
The ministry said a new renewable energy auction will be held in 2023. Developers that did not qualify for last week’s auction can file their project proposals in the next round, it said.
“The first green energy auction in the Philippines was held today, which is a significant step in encouraging more power generation investments in renewable energy, while protecting the interest of Filipino consumers – a testament to the country’s commitment to developing indigenous and clean sources of energy at competitive prices,” said Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi.
The authorities want to contract 1,260 MW of PV, 380 MW of wind power, 230 MW of biomass, and 130 MW of hydropower capacity. Around 900 MW will likely be assigned to Luzon province, while the provinces of Visayas and Mindanao are expected to be awarded 260 MW and 100 MW, respectively.
The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has set a cap price for PV technology at PHP 3.628 ($0.066)/kWh for the exercise. The cap for wind power is PHP 5.2887.
The government of the Philippines announced plans to introduce the Green Energy Tariff Program auction in February 2020.

The battery acquisition is part of the Alice Springs Future Grid project, an initiative looking to iden­ti­fy and over­come bar­ri­ers to fur­ther renew­able ener­gy pen­e­tra­tion in the Alice Springs power system with a view to the town reaching 50% renewables by 2030.
The DKA Solar Centre is a solar panel testing, demonstration and research facility with datasets spanning more than 10 years of operation. The facility incorporates dozens of arrays of solar panels from various manufacturers with electricity generated by the various systems helping to power the precinct’s operations.
The solar arrays will now be complemented by a 300kW/358kWh lithium-ion battery system supplied via Penske Australia.
The containerised battery will store electricity generated by the DKA Solar Centre which can then be released back into the network as required. It will also support key operations at the Desert Knowledge Precinct when the precinct is disconnected from the grid and also provide grid support functions.
Future Grid project director Lyndon Frearson, from Alice Springs engineering firm Ekistica which is delivering the microgrid trial. said the initiative will help the team demonstrate how a commercial microgrid at a multi-tenanted site can operate when connected to, and “islanded” from, the main grid.
“We have been demonstrating solar technology from all over the world since 2008 at this site,” he said. “Now we get to explore the possibilities offered by complementing that existing technology with battery capability.”
Frearson said the acquisition of the BESS represents the final major equipment procurement effort for the Future Grid project which has also installed cloud cameras to aid solar forecasting, and is currently creating the Northern Territory’s first virtual power plant.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/23/solar-auctions-in-india-to-attract-large-developers/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 23, 2022",Solar auctions in India to attract large developers,"From pv magazine India
Large developers in the renewable energy sector have enough options to boost returns and will compete in auctions scheduled for this year, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The renewable energy capacity in India has jumped almost tenfold over the last decade, from 12 GW in 2010 to around 110 GW in March 2022. But the question is whether India will be able to continue its renewables growth trajectory as witnessed in the past, given fresh challenges in the sector.
The IEEFA report states the turmoil in global supply chains caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have pushed up components costs. Renewable energy developers also face higher financing costs as surging inflation has forced central banks to tighten monetary policy, pushing up interest rates.
However, these challenges will probably not have a lasting impact on India’s renewable energy story.
“We believe India will be able to continue its renewable energy capacity addition trajectory because current supply chain challenges will ease in the short-to-medium term, and the industry has enough cushion to absorb these downside risks,” said IEEFA Energy Finance Analyst Shantanu Srivastava.
The report states the rise in solar module prices is an aberration. IEEFA expects long-term average prices to revert to sub-$0.20 (before duties and taxes) levels from the current level of $0.28.
“Central and state nodal agencies should proceed with their pipeline of renewable energy auctions, given that interest from the large companies in the sector should continue, even in these unprecedented times,” said Ankur Saboo, an infrastructure finance specialist.
The report highlights various options before large renewable energy companies to enhance their return on equity and cushion against downward risks. According to Srivastava and Saboo, large renewable energy developers can lean on bond markets to refinance project debt at lower rates and take advantage of a non-amortisation period on debt repayments.
Margins on in-house engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) also increase returns. Selling stakes in operational projects to strategic investors such as global oil and gas majors and financial investors like infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) is another avenue for developers to increase returns. Finally, selling carbon credits to developed economies is increasingly considered a viable source of additional income for developers, further enhancing their returns.
The report shows how these measures can help a solar power project and a hybrid wind-solar power project to enhance their equity returns. It finds that refinancing at a 100 basis point lower rate of interest can help add 2% to a hybrid wind-solar power project’s equity internal rate of return (IRR).
In addition, bond market refinancing can help add another 2% to the equity IRR, in-house EPC can add up to 6%, and selling operational assets can add 4%. Revenues from carbon credit trading can add 3% to equity IRR, taking the total upside potential to 17%, over and above the baseline returns.
According to Srivastava, as attractive as the equity IRRs look, it is essential to note that sensitivity towards interest rates and raw material prices is extremely high and the margins of error minuscule. In worst-case scenarios, developers with a tight grip on capital and financing costs will be better prepared to weather any storm, he added.
