Like the solar farm it today acquired from previous owners Bookitja and Indigenous Business Australia (IBA), the project is to be based in Northam, a town about 100km east of Perth.
The output of the 10MW Northam solar farm will presumably soon be put towards powering Infinite Blue Energy’s 10MW of planned electrolyser capacity. 
The company is aiming to  produce up to 4.4 tonnes of renewable hydrogen daily, which equates to roughly 1,600 tonnes annually. The plan is for the project to be producing as early as next year, 2023. It is targeting the domestic heavy transport industry for offtake.
MEG HP1 appears to be a warm up of sorts, with Infinite Blue Energy more prominently showcasing its Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant, which it says will produce up to 25 tonnes of green hydrogen daily. Arrowsmith sits a fair way north of Perth, on the state’s coast. Infinite says this project will incorporate 65MW of solar and 90MW of wind in stage one, though timeframes for the project have not been given.
Back to the nearer term MEG HP1 project, it has won the support of the Western Australian Hydrogen Industry Minister, Alannah MacTiernan. “We see enormous potential for locally-generated renewable hydrogen to replace diesel in our heavy transport sector, helping to reduce carbon emissions and improving our fuel security,” she said.
“Indeed transport fuel probably offers one of the earliest opportunities for the emerging renewable hydrogen industry.
“Infinite Blue Energy’s MEG HP1 project is yet another positive step forward for renewable hydrogen in WA, and will play an important role in helping to stimulate early demand for hydrogen.”

The Vanadium Recovery Project, as it’s called, is kicking off in Pori, Finland, as part of a 50:50 joint venture between Critical Metals and Neometals, both of which are based in Western Australia. Last week, an open day was held at the site, on Finland’s west coast, for which the companies signed their lease. With pilots and pre-feasibility studies completed and looking promising, the full feasibility study for the project is due in June.
Critical Metals
It has already garnered support from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology’s (EIT) raw materials department, a body of European Union, which labelled the project “innovative” adding that it would be “significant” for securing energy independence in Europe.
Vanadium has been deemed a critical raw material by the European Commission, promising superior energy densities for batteries. It is at the heart of long duration energy storage solution, vanadium redox flow batteries, and is increasingly being eyed for next-generation lithium-vanadium cells for electric vehicles. On Monday, Neometals actually invested US$500,000 (AU$665,000) US-based startup Tyfast, which is developing a long-life, fast-charging lithium battery with a proprietary vanadium-based anode technology.
Approximately 75% of the world’s vanadium supply comes from China, Russia and South Africa – and given the materials growing applications coupled with deteriorating global relationships, battery players are scrambling to diversify supply chains.
“We’re going to be producing vanadium from a waste material [slag] that’s currently got next to no value, it’s a problem for the producers, and we’re not going to have any waste generation in the process – all the byproducts from this are going to be put into some kind of application,” Neometals’ General Manager for Metallurgy, Research and Development, David Robinson, told pv magazine Australia. 
Critical Metals/Tomi Glad
“So we’ve solved a waste problem, we’re making a high purity vanadium that’s going to go into high value chemicals or batteries for the future… and we’re actually taking 50 – 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into our process, where most refineries and operations would stick carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,” Robinson added.
“It’s a true circular economy,” Neometals’ lead for the project and its Chief Development Officer, Darren Townsend, said.
The project is the second major materials recovery venture for Neometals, which officially opened its commercial 10 tonne per day lithium-ion battery recycling plant in Hilchenbach, Germany with partner SMS Group just yesterday. The grand opening was attended by Australia’s Ambassador to Germany, Philip Green, who then jetted over to Berlin to witness Fortescue Future Industries inking a deal to become Europe’s largest green hydrogen supplier later that night.

Robinson is behind the unique vanadium extraction method at the heart of this project, though he is quick to point out that he can’t take credit for inventing carbonate chemistry. “I just stumbled across the application for it, that’s all,” he said. “You just needed the right crazy squirrel to find the nut.”
Crucially, the project’s chemical “sweet spot,” as Robinson puts it, is sodium carbonate, which has enabled the use of carbon dioxide as a reagent. Just one proton away from sodium bicarbonate (baking powder), McManus described the process as “essentially [using] glorified soda water.”
Robinson, who holds a doctorate in chemistry, wasn’t taken with this description, though he agreed the compound was a “nice safe reagent.” 
Why sodium carbonate is a sweet spot, Robinson explained, is because the carbonate gets used up in the leech while the sodium remains, allowing the addition of carbon dioxide (CO2) through which you can remake the carbonate molecule. “So the carbon dioxide bubbles in, makes carbonate, the carbonate reacts with the calcium, and in that process you liberate and make available the vanadium,” Robinson said.
“It’s very neat little bit of chemistry.”
Critical Metals/Tomi Glad
It appears this basic chemical trick, over which a family of patents are progressing having already been lodged in the EU, hasn’t yet been deployed for this promising application.
 “To my knowledge, there’s no one else using a green alkaline method to recover the vanadium out of steel stockpiles,” McManus told pv magazine Australia. 
The process does away with the need for high temperatures and pressures as well, minimising the project’s energy expenditure and adding to its green credentials.
Examinations of the Vanadium Recovery Project’s carbon lifecycle have found it to be slightly carbon negative, the team said, with supporter EIT Raw Materials saying it will save 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 compared to conventional vanadium mining over a decade. 
Using CO2 as a reagent “absolutely” opens the project up to the potential of carbon trading, which is far more developed in Europe. “We’re already lowest quartile costs for the project anyway, so we haven’t factored in any potential benefits [of carbon trading] into the project,” Townsend said. “So it’s all upsides.”
Despite coming from an abundant waste product, slag, the by-product of smelting ores and used metals, the green alkaline method is recovering battery-grade purities of vanadium pentoxide, V₂O₅.
“All the work that we’ve done from a bench-scale mini pilot and a full scale pilot recently is all being found at 99.5% pure,” Robinson said.
Critical Metals/Tomi Glad
Currently the method’s recovery rate is sitting at around 75%, a figure which is primarily dictated by the mineralogy of the slag, he added. While the project is kicking off Finland, where Critical Metals has an offtake agreement for around two million tonnes of slag, it has also put its foot on two stockpiles in Sweden. Both of these stockpiles have been drilled, tested and found to work. 
“I wouldn’t say [the alkaline method] is going to work on every single steel slag around the world, there’s certain requirements on when it’s going to work, but there’s certainly scaleability opportunity,” Townsend said.
Three things come out of the plant: vanadium, sodium sulphate, and a stabilised residue for which Robinson says there are a number of ‘promising’ chemical applications under development, especially in the construction industry. In fact, Finnish building company Betolar last week entered into an agreement with the project to potentially offtake the byproduct.
This puts the Vanadium Recovery Project on track for selling everything it generates. “Processing waste, generating no waste, creating a high value product, and carbon negative – it sounds like a good idea,” Robinson said.
The project was initially developed by Critical Metals, which had an ongoing relationship with nordic steelmakers. With personnel based in Scandinavia, Critical Metals put its foot on the opportunity, taking it to its 20% stakeholder Neometals to deliver the project using its chemistry knowhow. 
Neometals is now charged with pulling the vanadium out using its technology, which will then earn it the right to a 50:50 joint venture.
Critical Metals
If everything continues going to plan, Critical Metals and Neometals will form a separate company to run the Vanadium Recovery Project which is aiming to be in production by the end of 2024.
EIT Raw Materials appears confident, saying in a media release on Friday that Critical Metals and Neometals are “on the cusp of becoming a major producer of vanadium in Europe.”
To put it mildly, Europe – which is not rich in vanadium like Australia – is extremely eager to secure reliable supplies of the critical material for its burgeoning battery industries. 
Neometals’ Jeremy McManus said already the Vanadium Recovery Project’s product is proving popular. “The reason we’re enthused is because we’re actually getting people approaching us far earlier than you would with other commodities because they’re so desperate to secure green vanadium units,” he said. “Particularly because they don’t exist in volume in Europe.”
ASX
“The environmentally friendly recovery of metals and minerals from by-products will be a very important source of raw materials for Europe,” Olli Salmi, Director of Innovation Hub Baltic Sea at EIT Raw Materials said. “Further innovations, such as those achieved in this project, are necessary to secure the supply.”

The green, renewable hydrogen will primarily be produced in Australia and shipped to Germany in the form of ammonia, though the company did flag it plans to incorporate “FFI’s other planned global projects,” of which there are many. 
Both companies say they want to hit the five million tonne target “as soon as possible,” with the decade’s end seemingly the deadline. Germany, by far the largest economy in Europe, imports over 60% of its energy demand, the bulk of which comes from Russia. The country has been badly caught out by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a factor Forrest emphasised during his press conference – saying dictators will “always let you down” and emphasising the political ties between Germany and Australia.
Our team are in Berlin, about to make a major announcement about how #GreenHydrogen will help deliver #EnergySecurity for Europe. Tune in ⬇️https://t.co/yMC2QWhdRc
— Fortescue Future Industries (@FortescueFuture) March 29, 2022

When it comes to hydrogen – an important future energy source for Germany as an industry-heavy economy – the relationship between the two nations has been developing for quite some time. Earlier this month it was elevated by our respective governments launching a $125 million joint fund to develop hydrogen projects linking Australia and Germany.
The extent of this particular deal, however, blows the fund out of the water with Forrest pointing to a minimum investment figure of $50 billion.
Forrest is confident Fortescue will be able to deliver on the mammoth task given its capital success in the iron ore industry. “We’re now in a position as a very strong company to launch this brave endeavour,” he said.
To make five million tonnes of green hydrogen would require multiple tens of gigawatts of electricity – something Forrest pointed out Australia has the natural resources to deliver. “We have enough energy in Australia from a tiny, tiny fraction of our landmass to power all the world,” he said.

E.ON has around 50 million customers, primarily in Germany and the Netherlands, to whom FFI’s green hydrogen will be delivered with a specific focus on “medium-sized industrial customers in the regions,” which is where E.ON’s COO Patrick Lammers said the company is expecting the most hydrogen demand.
Lammers and Forrest signed the memorandum of understanding overnight in Berlin, joined by Michael Kellner, Germany’s Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action and Australia’s Ambassador to Germany, Philip Green.
As per the agreement, both companies have committed to a research and study partnership, “with further detailed documentation and steps required related to supply.”
With a company target to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, FFI has spent the last year making moves to vertically integrate itself. It plans to open the world’s largest electrolyser production plant in Queensland, which appears to be powering ahead having already gained state government approval and network operator cooperation.

The company is also planning to build a 1 GW solar PV module manufacturing plant, presumably also in Queensland though the location has not been confirmed. 
Fortescue is quickly becoming one of the biggest, if not the biggest, prospective green hydrogen producer in the world. It has been churning out partnership deals at an equally rapid pace, announcing a deal with aviation giant Airbus little over a fortnight ago.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/30/federal-budget-promises-billions-in-election-handouts-virtually-nothing-for-renewables/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 30, 2022","Federal budget promises billions in election handouts, virtually nothing for renewables","The 2022-2023 Federal budget (the budget) is in, but it’s not in tune with reality. Not only does the Morrison government think a splash of cash in the form of a small handout against the rising cost of living won’t be construed by voters as a paltry bribe, but the budget has little to offer the transition to renewable energy. 
When the Morrison government finally announced its 2050 net-zero emissions target before the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, few believed Morrison’s administration was taking the energy transition with any seriousness. This new budget proves it. 
The budget provides no major promises for how Australia will reach its 2050 net zero emissions target, nor does it provide any increased support for renewables uptake or the electric vehicle (EV) industry. What the budget does offer is $247 million over five years for the private sector to invest in hydrogen, $148 million for “microgrid projects” in regional areas, and $50 million for gas infrastructure. 
Indeed, according to The Guardian, the budget papers show a reduction in spending across clean energy agencies (including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation). Nor is this reduction insignificant, representing a 35% annual cut over four years.
Economist Nicki Hutley, a member of the Climate Council who was in yesterday’s budget session, calculated that just 0.3% of total expenditure for 2021-2024 has been committed to climate change initiatives, falling even lower, to just 0.2% in 2024-2026. Hutley said much of that 0.3% was already committed, and that the 2022-2023 budget adds ‘virtually nothing’. 
“Rather than investing in a green economic future, the Federal Government has used tonight’s budget to toss mere pennies at genuine emissions reduction initiatives, such as regional renewable microgrids,” said Hutley. “At the same time, significant funds are being spent on so-called ‘low emissions hydrogen’ and the costly and unproven carbon capture and storage.” 
“Ironically,’ continued Hutley, “while proposals for action on climate change are almost non-existent, the costs of climate-fuelled natural disasters are stark and mounting.” 
In his federal budget speech, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said “Australia is on the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050, and playing its part in responding to the critical global challenge of climate change.” Like his colleagues Energy Minister Angus Taylor and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Frydenberg leaned on the false dichotomy with which the Coalition excuses its lack of action on climate change or renewables and its propping up of the oil and gas industry, namely: “Technology not taxes will get us there.” 
Clean Energy Council (CEC) chief executive, Kane Thornton, stressed the importance of funding for the energy transition at this critical juncture. “Significant investment is required in the National Electricity Market and network to make this transition happen safely and smoothly,” said Thornton. “A 21st-century economy needs a modern electricity network that supports reliability, security and low-emissions technologies and delivers low-cost energy to consumers.”
And yet, as Thornton points out: “Tonight’s Federal Budget fails to look to the medium-to-long term future through an all-important lens of reducing the emissions that are having a devastating impact on the climate, the environment and on the lives of everyday Australians.”
“The lack of transmission investment is now one of the most critical challenges facing Australia’s energy industry,” continued Thornton. “Instead, yet another Federal Budget has prioritised the fossil fuel industry when Australia’s bottom line should be focused providing a better future for communities through clean, low-cost renewable energy and storage.”
The CEC was also quick to point out that the budget’s cut to fuel excise is at best a minor temporary measure, and the budget should’ve provided funds for the electrification of transport. 
“The transport sector accounts for nearly 20% of Australia’s emissions. The Federal Government’s own target is for 30% of all new car sales being electric by 2030, and tonight’s Federal Budget doesn’t get us any closer to that target,” said Thornton.
Clearly, the 2022-2024 budget has been focused entirely on keeping the Coalition in power at the coming election and entirely indifferent to its much-belated 2050 emissions target. In so doing, not only is the Morrison government condemning the country to the effects of the climate crisis, already keenly felt by many, but also condemning the economy to falter on the precipice of the green industrial revolution.

The two companies have also signed an agreement to jointly move Heliogen’s technology into Australia, hinting at the possibility of deploying at Woodside sites.
Founded by serial entrepreneur Bill Gross, also behind gravity storage company Energy Vault, Heliogen aims to revitalise concentrated solar thermal technology, promising to cut costs, water use, and plant footprints, making the technology viable for industrial applications not suited to solar PV. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was one of Heliogen’s early backers.
The Californian demonstration plant, which is now being backed by Woodside along with $52 million from the US government, will use advanced AI software to precisely aligns arrays of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a single target on the top of a solar tower, enabling storage in the form of high-temperature thermal energy.

Heliogen claims its baseline system will provide industrial-grade heat capable of replacing fossil fuels in industrial processes, including the production of cement, steel, and petrochemicals. It will also enable power generation through the addition of thermal energy storage systems, a turbine for power generation, and electrolysers for green hydrogen production.
The project promises to deliver clean energy with nearly 24/7 availability.
Heliogen revealed today that Woodside would acquire a stake in the company, though the size of the stake and how much Woodside has invested has not been made public. Woodisde has, however, said it plans to invest $5 billion in new-energy products by 2030.
There is potential for Woodside to use Heliogen’s technology for its own operations in Australia. It could also use the tech to begin producing hydrogen for export. 
It seems the companies are planning to target Australian mining in their push into Australia, where such companies are rapidly trying to decarbonise using a suite of different technological solutions.
“Our agreements represent a pivotal next step in the commercialisation of Heliogen’s breakthrough concentrated solar technology and the decarbonisation of heavy industry,” Heliogen founder and CEO, Bill Gross, said.

Another solar project built to meet the needs of Meta (Facebook) operations is underway, with a 70MW project in Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory breaking ground recently. Silicon Ranch is the project developer, a firm that has partnered with the tech giant on numerous renewable energy projects in the past. 
The project, called McKellar Solar Farm, was launched through TVA’s Green Invest program. The program is a platform for corporations looking to meet their environmental and climate goals by investing in renewables projects in TVA territory. Under the program, corporations typically sign a contract to purchase the project’s solar energy for 20 years. 
Tennessee’s own Silicon Ranch will fund, own, operate, and maintain the solar project, which has an estimated cost of US$90 million (AU$120 million). 
“TVA is the nexus for reliable, economical renewable energy solutions, and we have already committed US$3 billion to bring more than 2,000 MW of new solar to the Valley since 2018. This public-private partnership with Meta and Silicon Ranch demonstrates the strength of TVA’s community energy model to attract capital investment and high-quality jobs into the communities we serve while helping businesses meet their sustainability goals.” Doug Perry, TVA senior vice president, commercial energy solutions
Last April, Facebook announced it supported 100% of its operations with renewable energy by the end of 2020. Now, it targets net-zero across all value chains by 2030. Over the last three years, the social media giant cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 94%, exceeding its initial 75% reduction goal.
Facebook is no stranger to participating in large solar projects. It partnered with Silicon Ranch on three projects in Georgia with a combined capacity of 287MW, another 120MW in Utah, 160MW of solar in Virginia, and has 475MW in total PV projects contracted under TVA’s Green Invest program.
Facebook’s aggressive renewable energy sourcing is an environmentally responsible decision, but the high level of procurement brings attention to an important point: the internet is not free. While we use words like the “cloud” or “Metaverse” describe where internet and data operations take place, there are real-world, physical and energy related costs to these services. It is estimated by the environmental organisation Climate Care that servers are responsible for as much emissions as the global airline industry.
This idea of the internet as a physical thing constrained to natural resources was demonstrated in a Mozilla award winning concept project called Solar Protocol. The project connected a series of small data servers across the globe that are directly connected with solar PV and energy storage. When the sun shines in a given region on the planet, that region is activated as the host site for the cloud servers.
“How data is collected, managed, and trains AI systems has an impact on billions of lives. But that impact is often invisible. Creative Media Awards like Solar Protocol make the invisible visible,” said Kofi Yeboah, awards program officer at Mozilla.
This carbon intensity is only increasing with the advent of blockchain technology. One transaction of the cryptocurrency Ethereum is equivalent to the carbon impact of over 300,000 credit card transactions
“Solar Protocol is a great opportunity for us as artists to foreground issues of climate change and how technology is driving it,” said Tega Brain, an NYU professor and project lead. “The project has catalyzed conversations about AI and automation, as in-network user traffic is decided by solar energy. We are using intelligence from natural and dynamic versus a data-driven machine learning model… Why not think of planetary limits as intelligence? After all, they will shape the future of life on Earth whether we like it or not.”
Facebook has been able to rapidly accomplish its goals by becoming one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the world, contracting for around 1 GW of projects in 2020 alone. The company was the second-largest corporate procurer of renewable energy in 2019. It currently ranks third in the world on the list of renewable energy corporate buyers based on cumulative power purchase agreements since 2000, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
