“When it comes to transmission, social licence is the most important issue we have to face,” Bowen said. “A near-total rebuild of the grid comes with challenges, particularly for the communities where projects will be built.”
The federal government plans to increase the share of renewable energy in the national electricity network to 82% by 2030, a target the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) says will only be possible with a major build-out of the grid.
AEMO says 10,000 kilometres of transmission lines must be built to better connect the regions most rich in wind and solar resources to the load centres but the plan is coming under increasing pressure with several transmission projects facing delays amid growing community opposition.
The VNI West project, a proposed interconnector between Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), has been slammed as a “monumental mistake”, while landowners in the path of it and other major transmission projects have voiced concerns about fire risks, devaluation of property, visual impacts, and compensation.

Reg Kidd, chair of the NSW Farmers Energy Transition Working Group, said the “regional uproar” comes from the lack of meaningful engagement with the people who would be most impacted by these projects.
“The rising groundswell of opposition to transmission lines and the cumulative impact in some areas of renewable energy generation is a demonstration this is not working,” he said.
“While it may be convenient to say this needs to get done with haste, in regional NSW the cheap and reliable power for urban areas is coming at a real cost. Communities see a lack of planning, threats – not benefits – to rural jobs, road chaos, shortages of accommodation and a legacy of iron and wires across pristine landscapes.”
“At the end of the day you need the right thing in the right place, but it has to be done in the right way or it will never work.”
Bowen agreed that approval processes for transmission projects need to be improved to ensure communities in the path of lines were better heard, saying “these are big projects in small communities and we have to work closely with those communities.”
“I think they’re right. I think engagement and consultation with them hasn’t been good enough,” he said. “It needs to be earlier, it needs to be more real, it needs to engage in real community benefit. So, we’re doing all that.”
Bowen said the Community Engagement Review, to be led by Andrew Dyer, the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner (AEIC), will provide advice on the best way to maximise engagement and benefit in planning, developing and operating energy infrastructure, including for communities, landowners and First Nations people.
“The government is working with states, territories, communities, market bodies, and energy companies to ensure community consultation on new energy infrastructure isn’t just a tick-a-box exercise” Bowen said.
“Our reforms are focused on giving better information to landholders and communities about their rights, involving communities earlier and more effectively, and properly handling any complaints.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/05/solar-will-be-in-unassailable-position-as-cheapest-source-of-electricity/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 5, 2023",Solar will be in ‘unassailable position’ as cheapest source of electricity,"Global risk management firm DNV offered its annual outlook on the global energy transition. Solar was placed in the spotlight as the leader in renewable energy supply. 
“In 2050, solar PV will be in unassailable position as the cheapest source of new electricity globally,” said DNV. 
As the world transitions toward carbon emissions-free electricity generation, DNV expects the share in generation mix for coal to decrease 4% and gas to decrease 8% by mid-century. As the global fossil fuel industry becomes a metaphorical fossil itself, DNV expects the world energy mix to be 70% reliant on variable renewable sources like solar and wind power. Fossil fuels will represent just over 10% of the energy mix by that time. 
Along this path, solar capacity increases 22-fold in DNV’s energy transition vision. The firm said it views variable renewables as the cheapest and quickest route to both decarbonization and energy security. 
Costs are expected to improve by mid-decade. The global weighted average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar is currently about $75 () per MWh for solar and $180 per MWh for solar-plus-storage. DNV expects solar LCOE to drop to $45 per MWh by mid-century, with some individual project costs well under $30 per MWh.
“The main driver for this reduction in LCOE is the reduction of unit investments costs, which are around USD 900 ($1,345) A per kW as a global average now. This will fall significantly with every doubling of solar PV installation globally, reaching USD 650 ($970) per kW in 2050,” said the report.
Currently, the levelized cost of solar-plus-storage is currently more than double that of standalone solar. A continuous decline in battery prices will narrow this gap to around 50% by mid-century, said DNV.
Despite its higher costs, solar-plus-storage has an advantage in capture price. Plants with storage can charge their batteries when sunlight is plentiful during the day and sell the stored electricity when the price is high. DNV said that by 2038, the capture price advantage of solar and storage co-located projects will surpass the cost disadvantage, making these projects even more attractive.
“PV and storage systems are designed as a ‘package’ that can produce energy on demand, just like hydropower, nuclear, or combustion power plants,” said DNV.
In 10 years, DNV said roughly 20% of solar projects will be built with dedicated storage, and by mid-century such projects will reach about 50%.
DNV highlighted the impressive growth ramp of solar globally, which was 1 GW per year in 2004, 10 GW in 2010, and 100 GW in 2019. Despite global disruptions in supply chains due to COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 150 GW was added worldwide in 2021. DNV expects global annual installations to continue to rise, reaching 550 GW per year.
“By mid-century, total installed capacity will be 9.5 TW for solar PV and 5 TW for solar and storage. The resulting 14.5 TW of solar capacity is 24 times greater than in 2020,” said DNV. “While solar will have a share of 54% of installed capacity in mid-century, it will account for 30% of global on-grid electricity generation.”

“Our new products utilize rectangular silicon wafers and innovative module technologies like super multi-busbar (SMBB) design and double-layer coated glass, resulting in significant improvements in product conversion efficiency and stability,” said Huang Haiyan, Astronergy’s chief sustainability officer, in an interview with pv magazine. “We achieved a maximum module efficiency of 22.7% and a maximum power output of 615 W for this series.”
The manufacturer aims to ship 30 GW of solar modules in 2023, up more than 100% growth from 2022.
“By the end of 2022, we had approximately 20 GW of module capacity,” Huang said. “This number will increase to 50 GW by the end of this year, along with a corresponding growth in solar cell capacity to 45 GW.”
Astronergy predicts substantial growth in the global PV market this year, with an estimated 350 GW to 380 GW of newly deployed capacity worldwide, including 120 MW of new PV in China.
“We anticipate that our domestic sales will account for 55% to 60% of our total sales this year, while the overseas market will contribute 40% to 45%,” Huang said. “Last year, we shipped over 1 GW in Germany, capturing approximately 14% of the market share. We have also established a strong presence in other European markets such as Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Additionally, we are performing well in traditional and emerging markets like the US, Brazil, and Australia.”
