GE Renewable Energy’s Hydro Solutions CEO Pascal Radue said the company – which has a portfolio of 400 GW of renewable energy installed worldwide – will work with BE Power to optimise and finalise the design of the plant, assist with securing finance and commence commercial operations.
“We are really excited to join forces with BE Power at the forefront of the next wave of Australian pumped hydro storage,” Radue said.
Upon completion, the Big T pumped hydro power plant is expected to produce enough electricity to meet the consumption of about 200,000 local homes. When pumping, it will provide long-duration, high-capacity storage to absorb excess wind and solar output.
It is expected the facility will provide valuable system strength and inertia to the grid, safeguarding security and reliability as the Queensland Government pushes towards its target of 50% renewables by 2030.
In a statement released when the co-development agreement was announced in late December, GE Renewable Energy said given the scale of the transformation that the Queensland Government is pursuing, pumped hydro projects such as Big T represent the most cost-effective and long-lasting solution for the high capacity, long-duration storage that is required.
BE Power’s managing director Scott Walkem said the Big T project “will help facilitate new wind and solar projects and provide firming and grid support services at a critical point in the National Electricity Market (NEM).”
“Being the first new pumped hydro project completed in Queensland in over 35 years, the Big T will help balance the output of wind and solar across the market, ensuring power is available when needed,” he said.
The Big T proposal is one of a number of pumped hydro projects in the pipeline in Australia with the New South Wales and Federal governments backing the technology to support reliability and reduce volatility in the market with the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro storage project having received the go-ahead from both bodies.
Snowy 2.0 will provide 2 GW of fast-start, dispatchable energy and provide 350 GWh of large-scale storage, enough to power the equivalent of 500,000 homes for over a week during peak demand.
The Big T project will help build out the Queensland Government’s southern Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) which was identified by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in its final 2020 Integrated System Plan.
The southern REZ, one of three REZs unveiled by the State Government in 2020 as part of a $145 million investment in renewable energy, is proving popular with investors, benefiting from strong network infrastructure that can accommodate large amounts of renewable capacity.
The Big T project earned the tick of approval from the Toowoomba Regional Council in August, with Mayor Paul Antonio confirming BE Power had been invited to proceed to the next stage of the tender process as part of the council’s New Energy Generation project.
“I’m pleased with how the tender process is progressing,” Antonio said.
“We’re in the initial phase of a long-term, multi-stage project and council is excited to be taking steps toward generating energy through its existing land and water assets.
“If the project proceeds to delivery, council will provide access to land and water assets and the successful company will develop the project, including providing necessary infrastructure.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/07/vsun-energy-pushes-ahead-with-residential-flow-battery-plans/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 7, 2021",VSUN Energy pushes ahead with residential flow battery plans,"VSUN, a subsidiary of Australian Vanadium Ltd (AVL), this week appointed Western Australian engineering firm Cadds Group to undertake design and consultancy work on its 5 kW/30 kWh residential VRFB.
Manufactured by Chinese firm CEC, the VRFB has arrived in Australia but in a MOU signed with the Chinese manufacturer in September last year, AVL agreed to further develop the battery for the Australian market.
AVL managing director Vincent Algar said Cadds will design a new housing for the VRFB system and oversee any changes needed to improve the battery for Australian residential conditions.
“We are looking forward to working with CADDS Group to develop the design for the residential VRFB,” Algar said.
“This will give us the opportunity to provide feedback to CEC and ensure that the product is ideal for the Australian market.”
The VRFB will be tested at Cadds’ Perth headquarters and upon successful completion of testing VSUN will deliver the unit to a residential customer with a single-phase system for tests to be completed in a residential environment with solar energy input.
VSUN expects the battery will be market ready early this year as the company looks to benefit from a growing demand for battery energy storage systems in residential and small business settings.
“By initiating market growth in smaller systems we anticipate a knock-on effect for larger VRFB uptake, which in turn will grow the market for vanadium pentoxide in energy storage,” Algar said.
Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the residential market but VRFBs are gaining traction with advocates declaring they are safer, more scalable, longer-lasting and more reliable. Notably, vanadium flow batteries don’t degrade with cycling like lithium-ion options and are able to move electricity without generating heat.
VRFB manufacturers have typically pursued utility scale storage projects but increasingly they are targeting the household market.
VSUN said the 30 kWh capacity of its VRFB system would enable higher energy self-consumption during peak hours of solar energy stored during the daylight hours, significantly increasing the renewable energy penetration when compared with other configurations like solar only, or solar and lithium-ion systems.
Algar said the capacity would also allow an option to export excess generation at the WA Government’s Distributed Energy Buyback Scheme rates.
“With the state and federal governments’ eagerness for increasing manufacturing and green energy capability in Australia, this project is being launched at an ideal time,” he said.
In addition to the work VSUN Energy is undertaking with CEC, the company has ordered two 5 kW/30k Wh VRFB from V-Flow Tech in Singapore.
One is for a residential customer in Western Australia while the other is to be installed at the Beverley Caravan Park in WA’s wheatbelt region where it will be paired with a 6 kW solar system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/07/fujitsu-latest-to-roll-out-rooftop-solar-in-push-to-renewables/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 7, 2021",Fujitsu latest to roll out rooftop solar in push to renewables,"Japanese company Fujitsu has installed a 249-module solar PV system at its data centre facility in the Brisbane suburb of Eight Mile Plains. The system, which covers the entire roof space, came online in December and is expected to generate more than 148 MWh of energy annually, enough to power 22 homes.
Fujitsu Australia and New Zealand CEO Graeme Beardsell said the installation is part of the company’s goal of sourcing 100% of the electricity consumed at company locations, both in and outside of Japan, from renewable sources by 2050.
“The solar panel installation shows that Fujitsu is continuing to progress against its sustainability targets,” he said.
“Fujitsu continues to invest in more efficient operation of our enterprise-grade data centre facilities to support its customers, who are dealing with rapid digital transformation.”
The solar PV installation is one of many undertaken by businesses in Australia in recent months. Supermarket giants Aldi and Woolworths have both rolled out solar PV across their facilities while fast-food operator McDonald’s has also invested in solar.
Australian companies are not the only ones opting for rooftop solar with Singapore-based Cleantech Solar announcing on Wednesday it had entered into a long-term agreement with Indonesian-based tyre manufacturer Elang Perdana to deploy a large-scale rooftop system at its factory south of Jakarta, on the island of Java.
Cleantech Solar said the 4.5 MW system would generate more than 136 GWh of renewable electricity over the lifetime of the 25-year agreement, equivalent to offsetting an estimated 117,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.
The company has already commenced work on the installation but opted on Thursday not to provide specific details about the project, including number of modules, scope of the installation and cost. But by way of comparison, bottled-water manufacturer Danone-AQUA last year installed a 2.9 MWp rooftop solar power system at its Java factory which comprised more than 8,300 solar modules and covered more than 16,555 square metres.
Cleantech Solar said it will provide a complete turnkey solution and guarantee the performance of the solar PV system throughout the lifetime of the agreement. The installation is expected to be complete by mid 2021.
The project adds to Cleantech Solar’s impressive portfolio which already includes more than 500 MW of solar power assets including installations in India, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore.
While it has established itself as one of the largest commercial and industrial solar PV developers in the Asia-Pacific region, a Cleantech Solar spokesperson told pv magazine the company has “no plans yet” to enter the Australian market.
Elang Perdana managing director Dicky Mursalie said the installation is part of the company’s push to become a sustainable business that brings “positive impact to the communities we operate in”.
“Besides the aim of building a sustainable future, we would like to increase general awareness on environmental preservation as this solar project will play an important role in reducing our carbon emissions,” he said.
