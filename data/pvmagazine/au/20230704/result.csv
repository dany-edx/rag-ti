CleanPeak founder and Chief Executive Officer Philip Graham confirmed the milestone on social media with the company indicating the project will form the backbone of its ambition to deliver 100% renewable energy to its customers by 2025.
“Delighted to announce we made FID on the 40 MW Wangaratta Solar Farm,” Graham said. “The Wangaratta City Council issued their Notice of Determination, CBA approved a construction facility and we are now contracting equipment and construction counterparties with a view to begin activity at the site in August.”
The solar plant, being developed on a 72-hectare site adjacent to an industrial estate on the outskirts of the regional Victorian town of Wangaratta, is expected to commence generation in late 2024.
It will be connected into AusNet Services’ 66 kV distribution network and will deliver about 70 GWh of clean energy into the Glenrowan substation.
Originally to be a 33 MWp facility, CleanPeak lodged an amended plan to increase the project size earlier this year. In addition to the solar asset, the project also includes scope for a 15 MWh battery energy storage system with CleanPeak indicating it plans to seek a grid connection for up to 65 MWh of battery energy storage at the site.
The progress on the Wangaratta Solar Farm, which CleanPeak acquired from original developer Countrywide Energy in 2020, marks further growth of the Sydney-based company’s growing ground-mounted solar portfolio.
CleanPeak, which has previously specialised in delivering rooftop renewable energy assets for the commercial and industrial sector, earlier this year acquired the 13 MW Mugga Lane Solar Park near Canberra.
The company’s rooftop assets include a 5 MW PV system at the Tonsley Innovation District in Adelaide, a suite of embedded network projects at shopping centres throughout Australia and late last year it signed a deal with biscuit manufacturer Arnott’s Group to provide 5.25 GWh of clean energy from solar panels and batteries at the biscuit manufacturer’s facility in western Sydney.

Price differences of this order of magnitude cannot be absorbed by developers and are stalling utility-scale battery projects, the developer told pv magazine Australia. He did not want to be identified due to his ongoing involvement in the industry, but claimed his company has priced roughly 1 GW of battery projects.
By his estimation, TNSP charges have increased by 50% over the past 12 months, whereas materials and labour have increased by roughly 15%.
Moreover, TNSPs are requesting timeframes between 20 months to 24 months to construct terminal stations, precluding the possibility of quickly deploying much-needed storage systems.
Part of this increase almost certainly comes down resourcing issues on the TNSP side, leading networks to put forward high “safe” costs to cover themselves in light of the shortages of contract labour, high inflation, continuing supply chain distributions and the overall booming demand for renewable energy projects.
Pv magazine Australia contacted many of developers in the space, but understandably few would comment on record. Nonetheless, a number confirmed pricing for connections and terminal stations at the transmission level have jumped.
“The prices we’re seeing coming back for connections or terminal stations etc. are varying a lot. They are shooting up,” the developer said. “It’s frustrating.”
“This is the type of thing that stops a lot of [projects] in their tracks.”
While TNSPs are regulated by the Australian Energy Regulator, exactly how companies arrive at their pricing remains opaque. The developer claimed TNSPs offer no breakdown of costs or clear justifications for quotes.
Australia essentially has one TNSP per state – leaving developers with no option to ‘shop around.’ This system was recently critiqued by consultancy Nexa Advisory, though its report focussed on how this monopoly structure negatively impacts the speed and cost at which Australia can build out its transmission assets.
Nonetheless, the Nexa report noted: “There is no reason to believe that the current number of transmission entities, one per state, is the upper limit or optimal number in the NEM [National Electricity Market].”
The report also underlines that Australia’s current transmission markets are largely “protected from competition.”
This structure led the developer to question whether TNSPs were not over-inflating prices to maximise profits. “There’s no recourse.”
The developer claimed high connection and terminal costs were particularly pronounced in Victoria.
A spokesperson for AusNet, Victoria’s TNSP, confirmed pricing increases but insisted the network is competitive.
“While the cost of connection can vary markedly depending upon location and the complexity of the connection, fierce competition ensures connection prices in Victoria are as low as possible,” the spokesperson told pv magazine Australia.
“Transmission Network Service Providers (TNSP’s) are facing the same market pressures and volatility from supply chains, a squeezed contractor market, and increased fixed price risk costs that the entire sector is experiencing, including battery energy storage systems, wind, and solar developments.
“Suppliers and contractors delivering connection infrastructure are experiencing significant demand and resourcing is stretched across all jurisdictions. This has resulted in increased pricing to ensure delivery timeframes and resourcing can be maintained.”
“Risks allocations are being pushed to contractors due to tight delivery timeframes and financier pressures are directly impacting the construction pricing which is being exacerbated by the stretched contractor workforce. Weather, ground conditions, equipment delivery timeframes, availability of transmission network outages, access to site and approvals remain some of the key risks being managed by TNSP’s and contractors.”
“Macroeconomic pressures, which include the inflationary environment impacting labour, equipment and material costs; and increasing interest rates directly impacting the cost of funding; and increased annual land tax and rates charges impacted by the valuation of terminal stations and generation facilities. These macroeconomic factors are directly impacting the connection service charges when connecting into the transmission network for the term of the service, which can be up to 30 years.”

The 200 MWh first stage of the Kwinana battery project is expected to be fully integrated into the state’s main grid by the end of the week, just as work begins on the $625 million (USD 415 million) second stage which will provide four times as much storage capacity.
The 800 MWh second stage of the battery energy storage system, which is scheduled to be completed by late 2024, is being built on a three-hectare plot adjacent to the first grid-scale battery established at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station about 30 kilometres south of Perth.
Synergy, which will operate and manage the battery energy storage system, said the new battery will comprise 288 shipping container-sized battery modules and 72 inverter units that will employ new-generation technology to support grid stability by storing electricity when demand is lowest and delivering it back into the grid during peak times, providing vital system security for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).

WA Premier Roger Cook said the battery will serve as the “infrastructure of future”, playing a major role in the state’s energy transformation with WA’s state-owned coal power stations to be retired by 2030.
It is expected the battery will support the integration of more renewable energy into the grid, smooth fluctuations in demand and renewable energy supply and substantially contribute to grid security and stability.
“WA is a leader in the uptake of residential solar energy and these big batteries help to ensure our energy system remains reliable as we transition away from coal-fired power,” Cook said.
The WA government has allocated $2.8 billion in its latest budget for renewable energy infrastructure, including a 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery energy storage system to be built near the coal town of Collie in the state’s southwest.
The development application for the Collie big battery is expected to be submitted later this year.
The WA government has estimated that the SWIS may need about 50 GW of new renewable electricity and storage infrastructure to support increased demand over the next 20 years.

The 1.3 MW battery will store excess solar energy generated by rooftop PV systems during the day, discharging it back into the grid during periods of peak demand at night.
Western Australian Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the community battery is an important step in ensuring the state is maximising its rooftop solar resources.
“Project Symphony’s new community battery will provide valuable insights into how we can unlock greater economic and environmental benefits for the Western Australian community as we continue to transform the energy sector on our way to net zero,” Johnston said in a statement.
“In the face of a rapidly changing energy industry, customer’s rooftop solar systems, batteries, air conditioning and community batteries orchestrated together can play an important role in enabling the greater connection of renewables and the continued running of a secure and stable electricity system.”
About: Project Symphony
Project Symphony is a collaboration between the WA government, state-owned system operator Western Power and retailer Synergy, the Australian Energy Market operator (AEMO) and Energy Policy WA.
The virtual power plant (VPP) involves more than 900 customer assets – including rooftop solar, batteries and large appliances – across 500 households and businesses in Perth’s Southern River area, where more than 50% of homes have rooftop solar. Rooftop solar accounts for about 2 GW of renewable energy capacity across the state.
The $35.5 million (USD 23.7 million) project was announced in 2021 as part of the state government’s distributed energy resources DER Roadmap, and has already undergone significant successful system testing as part of its expansion.
Project Symphony has also received funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) as part of its Advancing Renewables Program.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/04/roof-integrated-solar-takes-44-less-time-to-install-on-new-construction/,"EMPLOYMENT,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 4, 2023",Roof-integrated solar takes 44% less time to install on new construction,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted a time-motion study on solar contractors installing roofing integrated PV (RIPV) on residential solar projects at several sites in the U.S. state of California. The researchers published their findings in a publication titled “Observations and Lessons Learned From Installing Residential Roofing Integrated Photovoltaics.”
The study primarily highlighted that new construction RIPV installs very quickly. However, the time required to retrofit RIPV is still comparable to that of standard solar installations. The installation times are still higher for retrofit RIPV, at least in part, due to the application of new techniques and the continued evolution of supply chains.
This analysis was prompted in part by the fact that building integrated PV (BIPV) have not kept up with forecast price declines. This is despite the fact that investing in BIPV during the retrofitting of roofing, siding or windows can reduce or eliminate the need for separate solar components. Even when these hardware and labour costs are factored in, the expense of BIPV installations still tends to surpass that of conventional installations.

To further understand why costs remained higher than anticipated, NREL interviewed industry experts and performed time-motion studies at various RIPV residential installation sites.
The research compared the time taken for RIPV installations with that of standard residential solar installations. In the U.S., 32% of the installation costs are attributed to racking and mounting, 32% to electrical work, 20% to meals, breaks, cleanup, and delays, and 16% to travel and installation preparation. Overall, the study found that standard installations required 6.9 worker-hours per kW installed.

NREL conducted its analysis by monitoring two distinct RIPV reroof sites, with each site using a different product. They also observed RIPV installations on new homes at nineteen additional construction sites in the vicinity.
The three field visits were conducted in central California:
NREL divided the RIPV installation process into four main steps. The process begins with pre-installation tasks including staging, unloading and preparing the roof. This is followed by the placement of fire-resistant underlayment, a task typically performed by roofing material companies, not solar installers. The third step involves the installation of flashings and solar modules, and the final step is the installation of wiring and monitoring.
The most time-consuming reroof step was the installation of flashings and solar modules, which took approximately 2.4 worker-hours per kW and accounted for 60% of the process time of an average installation. On average, the total installation process took about 6.4 worker-hours per kW at reroofing sites, and 3.5 worker-hours per kW at new construction sites.

NREL researchers found that the normalization of retrofit RIPV solar projects in the installation process could speed up installations. The team noted several delays caused by different suppliers delivering materials to project sites, exacerbated by limited product availability and contractors not maintaining sufficient stock. These factors led to unnecessary time wastage for the onsite installation team.
The two reroof projects highlighted that various RIPV systems require differing amounts of time for various tasks, each presenting a unique learning curve. While the NREL report didn’t specify which products were used, it appeared that Reroof A might be a more complex Tesla Solar Roof, whereas Reroof B could be a standard solar shingle product.

The installation complexity of the Tesla Solar Roof has been a known challenge, particularly due to the number of custom pieces required for assembly.
NREL also had the opportunity to observe new solar installations on pristine rooftops. These projects, on average, required a total of 13.2 worker-hours to install an average of 3.4 kWdc of solar, amounting to roughly 3.8 worker-hours per kW installed. This time frame was notably 45% less than the 6.9 worker-hours per kW necessary for a typical retrofit installation.
Inconveniently located vents and oddly shaped roofs often present frustrating challenges for solar designers.
Despite having a clean slate with plywood roofs free of shingles, crews working on new construction suggested that installation efficiency could be improved if architects and solar product manufacturers collaborated more. According to their feedback, aligning roofing materials’ dimensions more closely with those of solar products could increase solar module coverage on the roof, and accelerate solar solar product development by reducing the need for on-site customization.
Looking at specific characteristics, NREL found that projects installed on a single roofing plane were significantly less time-consuming. As expected, electrical work proved to be considerably quicker and easier on homes with bare frames already designed to accommodate specific solar hardware, as compared to retrofit projects involving fully constructed structures.
