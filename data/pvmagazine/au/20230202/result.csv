Developed and owned by Global Power Generation (GPG), a subsidiary of Spanish energy giant Naturgy, the ACT battery has enough storage to power approximately 3,000 homes for two hours and is now fully operational as part of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Naturgy said the battery, which actually commenced operations in November, will increase network reliability by reducing pressure and congestion on the grid, and better integrate the increasing supply of renewable energy into the Canberra network.
The ACT government has identified energy storage and battery technology as key to the city’s planned shift to full electrification. The government plans to electrify Canberra with renewable electricity over the next two decades.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the battery will help future proof the territory’s energy supply by reducing the load on Canberra’s electricity network and increasing network reliability.
“This battery is a significant first for the city, given energy storage and battery technology are a critical component of our zero emissions future,” Barr said. “We have even more battery storage on the horizon for the ACT, with a further 250 MW of grid-scale and neighbourhood batteries to be installed in the coming years as part of our Big Canberra Battery Project.”
That project aims to deliver at least 250 MW of grid-connected battery storage to support the electricity network. It also involves the rollout of a still to be specified number of neighbourhood batteries at sites around the city.
The Big Canberra Battery project is in addition to the 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery being developed in Canberra by Neoen. The French renewables giant has predicted the project will be operational later in 2023.
For Naturgy, the ACT battery is the first energy storage facility it has developed anywhere in the world and reinforces the company’s commitment to the Australian energy market.
“The launch of commercial operation of this facility represents an important step in strengthening our contribution to the energy transition,” GPG Chief Business Development Officer Pedro Serrano said.
“Looking forward, we are excited about the future of renewable energy in Australia. Our commitment to this country is firm and this is reflected in our strategic plan.”
Serrano said the company is planning to grow its Australian portfolio of renewable technologies including wind, solar and energy storage to 2.2 GW by 2025.
Naturgy already has a significant portfolio of wind farms in Australia, including the 125 MW Cunderdin hybrid solar-plus-storage project east in Western Australia, the 96 MW Crookwell 2 Wind Farm in New South Wales and the 180 MW Berrybank 1 Wind Farm in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/02/win-win-how-solar-farms-can-double-as-havens-for-wildlife/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Win-win: how solar farms can double as havens for wildlife,"Solar farms are mostly built in rural areas. This has raised concerns about a potential decline in both agricultural production – as arable land is used for solar energy production – and wildlife habitat.
But there are ways to expand solar infrastructure so both nature and people win. We’ve already seen this in so called “agrivoltaics”, where land under and around solar panels is used to grow crops and graze livestock. But what about “conservoltaics”, combing conservation and solar energy?
My new research examines whether solar farms could also be used to help conserve native species. I found solar panels can provide valuable habitat for wildlife – and potentially benefit both the land and farmers.

Our wild landscapes are diminishing and protected areas, such as national parks, cover only about 9% of Australia.
Many agricultural landscapes have been cleared of trees to provide pasture for livestock. It means wildlife that rely on trees have lost vast tracts of habitat.
So we must find new places for wildlife to forage, rest, shelter and breed.
My work examines how solar parks on agricultural land can double as wildlife habitat. It involves surveys and trapping to identify what plants and animals occupy solar farms, how long they take to recolonise, and how we can promote even more biodiversity.
My new paper coins a new term for this dual land-use: conservoltaics. I highlight research from overseas into how solar parks can bring conservation benefits, and describe the research still needed.
Solar panels add three-dimensional structure and complexity to an environment. They can provide animals shelter from predators and the elements, much like artificial reefs in lakes and oceans. They can also act as perch or nesting structures.
Solar infrastructure also creates a mosaic of sun and shade patches – and so provide many “micro-habitats” for plants and animals.
Research from Europe has shown large solar farms can enhance the diversity and abundance of plants, grasses, butterflies, bees and birds.
What’s more, vegetation between solar panel rows can also provide travel corridors, nesting sites and shelter for wildlife.

Research suggests several management strategies that can maximise the benefits of solar farms for wildlife.
Land managers should provide a diverse mix of flowering plant species to encourage pollinators. And grass between solar panels should not be mowed too short or too often. Pollinators prefer tall vegetation where they can forage – though vegetation should not be so tall that it shades the solar panels.
The use of herbicides and other chemicals should be avoided where possible. And solar farms should be connected to other vegetated areas, using features such as hedgerows and wildflower strips, so wildlife can move between the solar farm and other habitats.
Landholders who combine solar farms with wildlife habitat may reap several benefits.
They could receive financial returns by earning environmental credits through schemes that reward carbon sequestration and biodiversity improvements.
They may also improve the health of their land by, for example, increasing pollination or providing habitat for predators such as raptor perches or nest boxes – which in turn could help control pests.
Much work remains, however, to understand these opportunities.

The benefit of renewable energy in reducing carbon emissions is well known. But more work is needed to understand how solar farms can benefit wildlife.
Research is also lacking on how to locate, configure and manage solar farms to best enhance biodiversity. Collaboration between industry, land managers and researchers is needed so clean energy production and conservation can go hand-in-hand.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/02/recharge-industries-looks-to-revive-british-battery-gigafactory/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Recharge Industries looks to revive British battery gigafactory,"Australia-based Recharge Industries is considering making a play to buy failed battery startup Britishvolt from administrators in a move that could resuscitate plans to construct a $6.6 billion (GBP 3.8 billion, USD 4.71 billion) lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing plant in England’s Northumberland region.
Britishvolt had planned to build a lithium-ion battery cell gigafactory on a 93-hectare site at Blyth in Northumberland that at full capacity would have been able to manufacture enough cells for more than 300,000 lithium-ion batteries a year.
Those plans are now in disarray after Britishvolt appointed administrators in January, after running out of capital. The project had a promise of ($173 million (GBP 100 million) in funding from the British government, but that funding was only to be provided once the factory’s construction work hit a certain milestone that has not been reached.
It is understood that more than a dozen bidders have come forward following the appointment of administrators with potential buyers including Indian conglomerate Tata and Indonesia-linked fund Dea Lab. Britishvolt founder Orral Nadjari, who was removed as chief executive in 2022, is also said to be preparing a bid for the business.
Australia’s Recharge Industries has already submitted a preliminary bid for assets and is now looking to advance that process with administrators at EY reportedly pushing to close the deal by Feb. 3, 2023.

A successful offer would give Recharge Industries, owned by United States-headquartered investment firm Scale Facilitation, immediate scale in the booming battery energy storage industry.
Recharge Industries Chief Executive Officer Rob Fitzpatrick told The Guardian that should the offer proceed, the operation would provide the Australian company with greater access to Europe.
“Demand for lithium-ion battery storage is continuing to go through the roof,” he said.
Recharge Industries also plans to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles and stationary energy storage at a factory to be built at Geelong, southwest of Melbourne.
The company’s stated goal is to start construction by the end of the year, targeting 2 GWh of production annually in 2024 and 6 GWh by 2026. At full capacity, the factory will manufacture up to 30 GWh of storage capacity per year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/02/new-code-of-conduct-launched-for-new-energy-tech-retailers/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",New code of conduct launched for ‘new energy tech’ retailers,"The New Energy Tech Consumer Code (NETCC) replaces the Approved Solar Retailer (ASR) program to expand the scope of consumer protections beyond solar and storage to also cover other new and emerging technologies including electric vehicle (EV) charging, home energy management systems and community batteries.
Launched on Feb. 1, 2023, the NETCC program sets minimum standards of practice and consumer protection in relation to all aspects of customers’ interactions with participating retailers. This includes marketing, finance and payments, installation, warranties and complaints handling processes.
The Clean Energy Council (CEC), which will administer the program, said Australia is already a world leader in small-scale renewable energy generation and much more growth is anticipated. The energy market is also continuing to expand and diversify with the introduction of new and emerging technologies including microgrids, virtual power plants (VPPs), community batteries and home energy management systems.
“It is vitally important, therefore, that consumers are well protected in this market,” the CEC said.
The NETCC has been designed by peak industry and consumer bodies to build upon the mandatory consumer protection regulations defined by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
The program is governed by the NETCC Council, which comprises the CEC, the Australian Energy Council, the Consumer Action Law Centre, Energy Consumers Australia, Energy Networks Australia, and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre and Renew.
The NETCC Council said the program is voluntary with retailers able to apply to join. That being said, the council said “all approved solar retailers have now become new energy tech approved sellers.”
The council said approved sellers who were already approved solar retailers will now have six months to make the necessary updates to ensure they meet NETCC requirements by Aug. 1, 2023.
NETCC Council Chair Clare Petre said the code will not only help providers achieve the highest standards of service and consumer protection but will also aid consumers to navigate the expanding array of new energy tech products and services.
“The code will be key in supporting consumers as they embrace new energy tech as part of a renewable energy future,” she said.

ZeroAvia conducted a 10-minute test flight this week for what it claims is the world’s largest aircraft to be powered by a hydrogen-electric engine. The UK company’s 19-seat Dornier 228 testbed aircraft is retrofitted with a full-size prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain on the left wing. “This is the largest ZeroAvia engine tested to date, and places the company on the direct path to a certifiable configuration to be finalised and submitted for certification in 2023,” it said. The aircraft has a 600 kW powertrain twin-engine on its left wing and a single Honeywell TPE-331 stock engine on the right. “The hydrogen-electric powertrain comprises two fuel cell stacks, with lithium-ion battery packs providing peak power support during take-off and adding additional redundancy for safe testing,” the company said, noting that the hydrogen tanks and fuel cell power generation systems were embedded in the cabin.
Chinese researchers has reported a superaerophilic/superaerophobic cooperative electrode that can promote bubble removal in electrolysers. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beihang University researchers introduced titanium-based superaerophilic (SAL) stripes covered with gas cushions on the platinum-based electrode. Superaerophobic (SAB) electrocatalytic regions surrounded the SAL stripes. The stripes acted as gas channels to transport hydrogen out. They noted that bubble adhesion on the electrode, bubble dispersion in the vicinity of the electrode, and poor dissolved hydrogen diffusion are common problems in electrolysis. “Benefiting from the enhanced mass transfer, the overpotential for the SAL/SAB cooperative electrode at −10 mA cm−2 is only −19 mV, compared to −61 mV on the flat Pt electrode,” they wrote in Science Advances.
Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology researchers have found that hydrogen production systems based on waste heat systems at 22.91% offer the highest overall efficiency. System efficiency ranges from 11.6% to 22.91%, while the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) ranges from USD 1.19/kg to USD 12.16/kg, the researchers said. “The lowest value is obtained when waste heat is employed, followed by the grid, PV panels, and wind turbines. Wind turbine systems are not recommended at selling prices of USD 8/kg and USD 10/kg,” they wrote in a recent article in Energy Conversion and Management.
Centrica Business Solutions is working with Germany’s 2G Energy to provide customers with 100% hydrogen-ready combined and heat power (CHP) systems in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Italy. “With a return on investment of less than 12 months for some projects, hydrogen ready CHP remains an energy saving quick-win,” said the England-based company. 
Fusion Fuel has signed an offtake agreement with Portuguese natural gas utility Dourogás for green hydrogen from its projects in Portugal. “This represents Fusion Fuel’s first offtake contract aimed at blending green hydrogen within the Portuguese natural gas grid,” said the Irish company. The Evora facility will likely be commissioned this year. The facility is expected to produce roughly 40 tons of green hydrogen per year.
Hydrogène de France (HDF Energy) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the province of Kinshasa, Congo, to construct and operate a green hydrogen solar plant. “This is the first project of its kind planned in Central Africa,” claimed HDF Energy. It said it is considering a location in the southern part of the country.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/02/zinc-bromine-redox-flow-batteries-with-superpower-density/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 2, 2023",Zinc-bromine redox flow batteries with superpower density,"From pv magazine Global
Unlike their cousins, vanadium redox flow batteries (RFBs), which suffer from intrinsic low energy density, zinc-bromine RFBs have high theoretical energy densities (440 Wh/kg). However, the poor kinetics and poor reversible behaviour of Br2/Br− redox activity pose significant barriers to realising that potential.
To increase the efficiency of the flow cell, researchers at the Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CECRI) in India have developed graphite felt (GF) supported platinum-nickel (PtNi) bimetallic alloy-based electrode. The 3D structure GF -based metal particles decorated electrode-based flow cells showed an impressive performance at all the tested conditions.
The Ni-rich Pt0.5Ni1@HT-GF-based flow cell accomplished a superpower density of about 1550 mW cm−2, which is greater than that of a bare GF-based flow cell at 1260 mW cm−2. The cycle life showed excellent stability up to 300 cycles with coulombic, voltage, and energy efficiency of 97%, 86%, and 83%, respectively.
According to the researchers, the improved redox kinetics parameters are due to the high electro-catalytic nature of the heat-treated Ni-rich PtNi coating deposited on the GF. In the process of testing, the sample cell was subjected to different current densities from 20 to 140 mA cm−2.
Considering the high cost of platinum, the metal’s content was kept to a minimum and the redox reaction was augmented on the back of nickel’s catalytic activity. The bimetal catalyst was deposited on the 3D GF network electrode via a chemical reduction method.
The new research is said to offer a promising approach to developing effective electrode materials for a superpower RFB system. The scientists discuss their findings in “Nanocatalyzed PtNi Alloy Intact @3D Graphite Felt as an Effective Electrode for Super Power Redox Flow Battery,” which was recently published in Advanced Materials.
