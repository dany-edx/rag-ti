ACEN, a subsidiary of the Ayala Corporation conglomerate, is seeking to raise more than $600 million as part of its strategic aspiration to grow its renewables capacity in Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.
The company, which already has ~4,000 MW of attributable capacity in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India said its Australian portfolio includes several solar, wind, battery, pumped hydro and energy storage projects across NSW, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia in development and construction.
“The New England Solar Farm, the first of these projects, is expected to be in operation by 2023,” the company said.
The estimated $768 million project is being developed near Uralla in northern New South Wales (NSW). Construction of the first 400 MW stage of the solar farm and 50 MW/50 MWh battery energy storage system commenced earlier this year.

The project will eventually see a 720 MW solar farm co-located with 50 MW/50 MWh battery energy storage. There is also potential for the energy storage system to be scaled up to 200 MW/400 MWh.
ACEN says once the entire 720 MW is installed, it will produce about 1,800,000 MWh of clean electricity each year – enough to power about 250,000 homes.
Other projects in the company’s Australian portfolio include the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project in NSW; the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project also in NSW; a share in the Rise Renewables 250 MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300 MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia; and the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system.
The agreement with MFUG comes just months after ACEN secured a $100 million loan from DBS Bank Australia.
Manoj Bhatia, MUFG’s global head of subsidiary banking, Manoj Bhatia, said the loan facility would support “ACEN’s aspiration towards becoming a leading renewable energy provider in Asia”.

Aleees, which claims to be one of the few companies outside China with complete LFP cathode material manufacturing capability, will explore the development of a production facility in Darwin capable of manufacturing up to 200,000 tonnes of LFP battery cathode material each year.
The facility would exclusively source phosphoric acid from Avenira’s Wonarah Phosphate Project near Tennant Creek in the Barkly region.
A final investment decision for a pilot facility is expected early in 2023.
Once operational, the pilot facility will manufacture up to 10,000 tonnes of LFP battery cathode material per year. Capacity is expected to be gradually ramped up to 200,000 tonnes per annum with the facility to be expanded in phases over the next 10 years.
Aleees Australia president Brandon Chang said the agreement between the trio has the potential to have a “significant impact on strengthening the lithium battery supply chain in the world.”
Avenira executive chairman Brett Clark was also optimistic about the agreement, claiming it would aid the company’s ambition to value add to its mineral resources.
The lithium cathode material is a critical active material used in electric vehicle and stationary energy storage batteries. It determines the capacity, safety and durability of the battery.
“This MOU opens the door for Avenira to learn from Aleees about LFP battery cathode manufacturing technology,” Clark said. “[We can] leverage this experience to optimise the production of phosphoric acid from the Wonarah Project and develop downstream assets to produce Australia’s first LFP precursor cathode material.”

The NT government, which will work with Aleees, Avenira and their supply chain partners to identify a suitable site in Darwin for the facility, estimates the project will initially create 100 jobs, growing up to 1,000 jobs and generating more than $6 billion in revenue annually once scaled to full production.
NT Chief Minister Natasha Fyles described the prospective plant as a “significant economic and strategic opportunity” for the Territory, one that would position it as the “next Australian home of advanced manufacturing”.
“Increasing demand and the transition to renewable energy, battery storage and use of high technology products has resulted in global organisations looking to establish diversified, reliable and stable supply chains,” she said.
“The project will position the Territory as the next Australian home of advanced manufacturing, develop new skills and jobs, as well as support our objective to achieve a $40 billion economy by 2030.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/23/australia-backs-new-us-deal-to-deliver-billions-in-clean-energy-investments/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",Australia backs new US deal to deliver billions in clean energy investments,"Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen announced on Friday he and United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry had signed a letter of intent to break down barriers for U.S. companies looking to invest in Australia’s clean energy industries and increase renewables deployment.
The Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI) is expected to serve as a platform to connect Australia with U.S.-based companies seeking to rapidly deploy clean energy to offset electricity demand in their sectors.
Bowen said the signing of the CEDI will make it easier to encourage cost-competitive and efficient markets and implement credible and transparent systems for investors.
“By setting up a favourable market environment for investment, we are signalling to U.S. companies that we welcome international partners to support our clean energy future,” he said.
“The initiative also sends a signal to the world that Australia is open for business as a reliable investment as the world heads towards net zero emissions by 2050.”
The U.S. Department of State (DOS) said Amazon, Google and Unilever are among a group of nine U.S.-headquartered companies that have already lent their support to the CEDI, expressing interest in investing in Australia’s clean energy generation infrastructure.
“Together, these companies seek to unlock between $US2.2-$US2.8 billion ($3.3-$4.2 million) in Australia’s clean energy infrastructure arising from commercial and industrial sector operations,” the DOS said in a statement.
“Many of these firms are already working with their supply chain partners in Australia and confirm the desire to support their suppliers with clean energy procurement as more options become available.”

Online retail giant Amazon is among those to have already established a firm foothold in the Australian renewable energy landscape, signing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for a combined 262 MW of clean energy capacity across three utility-scale renewable projects in Australia.
The three projects, including the 150 MW Suntop and the 110 MW Gunnedah solar farms in regional New South Wales, are expected to generate a combined 717,000 MWh of renewable energy annually for Amazon.
The DOS said Australia’s addition to the CEDI could serve as a model for other countries working to expand corporate procurement of renewable energy.
“The experience and expertise of Australia’s regulators, utilities, and private sector, and the Australian government’s active engagement on regional energy security, will be valuable additions to the CEDI,” it said.
Bowen said the signing of the CEDI was another step towards closer ties between Australia and the U.S. on climate action.
“It is another milestone for our relationship with the U.S. after we signed the Australia -United States Net Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership in July,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/23/ark-energy-floats-3-gw-renewables-hub-for-queensland/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH KOREA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2022",Ark Energy floats 3 GW renewables hub for Queensland,"A consortium including three of Korea’s largest conglomerate groups has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Queensland government with a view to building one of Australia’s largest renewable energy hubs near the coal-mining town of Collinsville to unlock the state’s hydrogen potential and establish a green energy export corridor, connecting northern Queensland to Korea.
The Han-Ho Hydrogen consortium, which comprises Australian-based Ark Energy and its parent company Korea Zinc, as well as petrochemicals group Hanwha Impact and fellow Korean conglomerate SK Gas, are seeking to produce and export more than 1 million tonnes of green ammonia a year to Korea to meet forecast demand as the north Asian nation seeks to meet its climate commitments.
At the heart of the consortium’s plans will be the development of Ark Energy’s Collinsville Green Energy Hub, about 90 kilometres south-west of Bowen, which will have the potential to generate up to 3,000 MW via a mix of wind and solar.
The renewable energy would be used to power electrolysers to produce green hydrogen, which would then be converted to ammonia for export to Korea.
The project is forecast to produce and export more than 1 million tonnes of green ammonia a year from Australia to Korea by 2032.
Ark Energy chief executive officer Daniel Kim said the project has already signed up 12 landholders in the Collinsville area for the renewables hub but he acknowledged there remained “challenges ahead”.
“The scale of what we’re embarking upon doesn’t exist today,” he said. “The shared vision of this consortium is to transform the bilateral relationship between Australia and Korea from one that has been underpinned by resources and fossil fuels to renewable energy and green hydrogen.”

Korea, which has committed to net zero by 2050, is already the third largest importer of ammonia in the world and the Korea Institute of Economic energy research estimates the nation’s total demand for ammonia will exceed 21 million tonnes by 2030.
Most of the green ammonia to be produced by the Collinsville Green Energy Hub is expected to be absorbed by the consortium members.
“Our partners and our parent company are major players in Korea’s hydrogen economy and have a forecast demand for more than 2 million tonnes of green ammonia per annum from 2030,” Kim said.
The consortium aims to make a final investment decision in 2027 or 2028, with construction expected to take about four years, Kim said.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the signing of the MOU is another step forward in the state’s quest to be a hydrogen powerhouse.
“We welcome this major new consortium to Queensland, to accelerate progress in our green hydrogen industry and advance green energy exports to Korea,” she said.
“What you’ll be seeing over the coming decade is large renewable precincts developing in regional Queensland, that is an indisputable fact.”

The announcement of the proposed 3 GW Collinsville Green Energy Hub is the latest move from Ark Energy which has quickly established itself since its launch in January 2021.
Earlier this year, Ark Energy completed its purchase of Sydney-based renewable energy developer Epuron Holdings in a deal that gives it access to a potential 9 GW pipeline of utility scale wind and solar PV projects.
The buyout of Eporon followed the acquisition of a 30% stake in Acciona Energy’s 923 MW MacIntryre Wind Farm in Queensland which is scheduled to be fully operational by 2024.
Ark Energy is also pursuing plans to develop a renewable hydrogen facility at parent company Korea Zinc’s Sun Metals zinc refinery in Townsville.
The SunHQ hydrogen hub, which will be equipped with a 1 MW electrolyser, is expected to produce about 158 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, powered by renewable energy from the 124 MW Sun Metals Solar Farm located next to the refinery.

Fire broke out in a battery energy storage facility housing a 182.5 MW Tesla Megapack system, where at least one of the battery units caught on fire. The facility is operated by utility PG&E and is located in Monterey County, California, in the United States.
“There have been no injuries to onsite personnel, and there are no electrical outages for customers at this time due to the incident,” Jeff Smith, operations and communications manager at PG&E, told pv magazine.
The fire started at 1:30 am Pacific Time (PT) on the morning of September 21, and was fully controlled by firefighters at the North Country Fire Department by 7:00 pm PT. It caused California’s Highway 1 to shut down. The County Sherriff’s Office lifted its twelve-hour long shelter-in-place advisory at 7 pm PT and reopened the roads. Residents had been asked to shut all windows and turn off ventilation systems due to the hazardous material emitted by lithium-ion battery fires. The County Office advised via Twitter that smoke may still occur in the area for several days despite the fire being fully controlled.
According to local media reports, firefighters let the initial megapack burn out and worked to prevent flames from spreading to adjoining batteries and structures in the large-scale system, as per protocols recommended by PG&E and Tesla to the fire department. The cause of the fire is still unknown, and a joint investigation will be carried out by PG&E and Tesla.
“Safety systems at the facility worked as designed and automatically disconnected the battery from the electrical grid,” Smith said. Property damage to the battery is expected to exceed $50,000, according to preliminary information shared by PG&E.
The Californian facility is one of the biggest utility-owned, lithium-ion battery energy storage systems in the world. A Tesla Megapack also caught fire last year in the Victorian Big Battery in Moorabool, Australia.

It’s a blip. While the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to a temporary fossil fuel resurgence, it also accelerated Europe’s renewable ambitions. And the United States and Australia have finally passed climate bills. This week, federal energy minister Chris Bowen announced “Australia is back” on climate action.
There’s better news too. In March this year, the world hit one terawatt (TW) of installed solar. By 2025, the world’s polysilicon factories are predicted to bounce back from supply shortages and churn out enough high-purity silicon for almost one terawatt of solar panels every year.
Coupled with major growth in wind, pumped hydro, energy storage, grid batteries and electric vehicles, the solar boom puts zero global emissions within reach before 2050.
Best of all – Australia could show the world how to add solar to their grid. You might not suspect it, but we’re the global leaders in finding straightforward solutions to the variability of solar power and wind. We’re showing that it’s easier to get carbon emissions out of electricity generation than many predicted.

This surge in the renewable supply chain allows sustained exponential growth that is already disrupting fossil fuel markets in some countries, notably Australia.
This year, global fossil fuel prices have skyrocketed in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In turn, that’s generated intense interest in solar and wind energy to boost domestic energy security, particularly in Europe, which needs to wean itself off Russian gas.
To cut our dependence on Russian fossil fuels, we need renewables.
We need clean, cheap and home-grown power. That’s why we propose to further increase our 2030 target for renewable energy to 45%.

While fossil fuels are concentrated in countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and Australia, solar and wind resources are widely distributed. Most countries can generate all their own energy from the sun and wind.
Europe could readily become energy independent, harnessing its enormous North Sea offshore wind resources and solar in the south. Even densely populated countries such as Japan and Indonesia have far more solar and wind resources than they need.
Solar and wind now provide the cheapest new electricity generation in most markets. As a bonus, the widespread uptake of solar and wind will eliminate many of our worst air pollutants and improve our health.
In a word, cost. Solar and wind have won the race for the energy of the future because they are cheap. Once built, the fuel is free, and does not need to be imported or dug up.
Wind and solar are being built three times faster than everything else combined. It follows they will dominate future energy markets as existing fossil fuel generators retire and electricity use grows rapidly.

Nuclear generation hasn’t grown in the past decade. Coal and gas plants able to capture and store carbon have not got traction in the energy market. Hydroelectricity can’t expand much further. There will, however, be a huge market for off-river pumped hydro energy storage.
There are no serious technical, environmental or material constraints to solar power on any scale. However, solar has been hit by supply chain issues in recent months, with major price spikes in polysilicon. These are common to any rapidly growing industry, and should resolve as more suppliers see the opportunity and enter the market.
Most of the world’s population live at moderate latitudes with good sunshine on most days. Here, solar is effectively unlimited. Those further north have abundant wind energy (particularly offshore wind) to offset weaker solar in winter.
Sceptics point out you need more land or sea to produce the same amount of electricity as fossil fuel plants. While true, solar farms can happily coexist with livestock and cropping to create a double income for farmers. The solar electricity needed to power the world and eliminate all fossil fuels can be generated from about 1% of the land area devoted to agriculture.
Image: World Bank
Once we have cheap clean electricity, we can use it to eliminate the use of fossil fuels altogether by electrifying nearly everything: transport, heating, industry and chemical production. This could reduce emissions by three quarters.
Global electricity production will need to rise sevenfold to about 200,000 TWh a year to give everyone the energy needed to reach developed nation living standards. But this is not all that hard over the next 30 years. And the alternative – keep pumping warming pollutants into the atmosphere – will make the lives of our children harder and harder.
Together, solar and wind have passed 2 TW of installed capacity. That means we’re about 2% of the way to reaching the almost 100 TW of solar and wind required to decarbonise the world, while raising living standards.
Annual solar deployment needs to double every four years to get the job done by 2050–60 – similar to the global growth rate achieved over the past decade.
You might not think it, given the decade of political climate wars, but Australia is the world leader in terms of solar electricity produced per person.
Image: Andrew Blakers
In Australia, solar and wind are booming while coal is rapidly falling. We’re already on track to reach 80-90% renewables by 2030. Remarkably, our per capita solar generation is twice as large as the second-placed countries (Germany, Japan and the Netherlands) and far ahead of China and the USA.
Australia is quietly demonstrating how to accommodate huge new flows of cheap, clean electricity. The world will soon follow suit.

The campaign by Cape Town to wrest control of South Africa‘s municipal electricity supply away from the nation’s debt-stricken national utility has prompted the city to tender for its first grid-connected solar power plant.
The planned solar project, in Atlantis, to the north of South Africa’s legislative capital, would be operational in 2024 and would supply 14.7 GWh of clean power annually for 20 years from its 7 MW generation capacity, according to the Cape Town municipal government website, which carried details of the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services tender this week.
Former mayor of Cape Town, Dan Plato, in October 2020 announced his intent to encourage all of South Africa’s cities to turn away from state power company Eskom and secure electricity supplies from independent generators instead.
At that point it was not clear whether a recent change made to national energy rules which permitted cities to procure power from non-Eskom entities – a change made after a legal challenge from the Cape Town authority – would also relate to power stations owned by municipal authorities themselves. Recent developments in Cape Town suggest that it does.
Plato had voiced a desire to escape the regular electricity black-outs – termed load-shedding – which afflict his and other Eskom-supplied cities. His successor as mayor, fellow Democratic Alliance politician Geordin Hill-Lewis, touted the other moves Cape Town is pursuing to break free from the utility.
Hill-Lewis said this week the city – one of three capitals in South Africa, along with Pretoria and Bloemfontein – had allocated ZAR 15 million ($847,000) for a feed-in tariff program to pay small scale generators R1.01 for each kWh they inject into the city grid; had changed the rules recently to permit commercial and industrial solar generators to sell electricity to the city network; and is tendering to buy electricity from 200 MW of independently-owned power station capacity.
Reuters had reported, in October 2020, the city was seeking to procure power from 300 MW of clean energy capacity within five years.
The EPC tender for the Atlantis solar plant is due to close on October 25.
Quoted on the Cape Town government website, Hill-Lewis said: “The city currently purchases most of its electricity from Eskom. High Eskom price escalations expected in future may not be financially sustainable for the city and its residents. It is expected that the Atlantis solar plant will enhance the city’s financial sustainability as the cost of generating the electricity would be lower than … bulk procurement from Eskom. Reducing … dependency on Eskom also means the city can develop and explore more climate-friendly power sources than Eskom’s coal-fired power stations.”

The two devices, called SV-BASE13-C and SV-BASE19.5-C, respectively are part of the company’s Sunvault series.
“With this launch, SunVault is now available in five configurations: 13 kWh, 19.5 kWh, 26 kWh, 39 kWh and 52 kWh. Some of these options include multiple inverters,” Sunpower said in a statement.
The SV-BASE13-C storage system has a storage capacity of 13 kWh and maximum usable energy of 12 kWh. It measures 164 cm × 71 cm × 36 cm and has a weight of 217 kg.
The SV-BASE19.5-C battery features a storage capacity of 19.5 kWh and maximum usable energy of 18 kWh. It has the same size as the SV-BASE13-C system and weighs 267 kg.
Both lithium-ion systems use LiFePO4 as the cathode material and have a round-trip efficiency of over 86%. Their nominal internal voltage is 51.2 V and the maximum (AC) continuous backup output current is 28.3 A.
Both batteries can operate with an ambient temperature range of -20 C to 45 C and feature an IP54 protection level. The new products come with a 10-year warranty and, according to the manufacturer, can operate for unlimited cycles.
“With these new storage sizes and higher power output through multiple inverters, SunVault’s modular configuration allows customers to get the storage size they need today with the reassurance that they can grow their system as their home energy requirements change,” Sunpower said. “The new SunVault sizes will be available beginning early 2023.”
