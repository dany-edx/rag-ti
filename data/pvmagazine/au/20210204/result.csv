The massive write-down in the company’s financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2020 also includes $1.112 billion relating to increases to environmental restoration provisions and another $532 million comes from impairments across AGL’s generation fleet and natural gas assets. The charges were offset marginally by a positive tax effect of $878 million.
AGL is not the only energy company to highlight the challenges the major utilities are confronting with Origin Energy revealing lower energy prices would likely deliver it significantly lower earnings.
In a statement released on Thursday, Origin indicated its electricity gross profit is expected to be down by up to $290 million year on year due to falling wholesale power prices, increased network costs and the impacts of mild summer conditions on demand and volatility.
Smart Energy Council board member Simon Holmes a Court took to Twitter in the wake of AGL’s announcement, declaring it a sign of transition in the industry.
“We’ve left the era where high prices are hurting consumers, now entering an era where low prices hurt generators,” he wrote.

AGL said the “onerous contracts” which have taken such a chunk out of its bottom line relate to long-term wind offtake agreements which the company signed between 2006 and 2012 to support the development of the renewables sector at that time.
“The offtake agreements were entered into when prices were significantly higher than spot and forecast prices for electricity and renewable energy certificates today,” AGL said in a statement.
AGL said the massive write-down follows an accelerated deterioration to long-term wholesale energy market forecasts in recent months, a point confirmed by energy market analyst Paul McArdle, who said average spot prices through 2020 were down at levels not seen for many years.
AGL CEO Brett Redman said while the long-term outlook is for a sustained and material reduction in prices, that would lead to expectations of increased supply.
“As Australia’s largest energy retailer and largest generator of electricity, we continue to see material opportunities for AGL to participate in the energy transition as customer needs, community expectations and technology evolve,” he said.
“Notwithstanding these charges, our broad and diverse portfolio of electricity generation assets will continue to have a vital role to play in enabling the transition of the energy system.”
Despite the massive write-down, AGL anticipates it will have an ”immaterial impact” on its underlying profit for FY21, which is unchanged from the range of $500 million to $580 million.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/04/analyst-warns-large-scale-market-could-slow-record-growth/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Analyst warns large-scale market could slow record growth,"New figures published by Australian solar analyst SunWiz reveal a record 5 GW of solar power systems – equivalent to almost 15 million average solar modules – was installed across the nation in 2020.
With every state and territory except Tasmania smashing records in 2020 for the volume of solar modules and system size installed, Australia now has 20 GW of solar capacity nationwide – up from 15 GW in 2019.
SunWiz managing director Warwick Johnston said Australia had led the world in uptake of solar on a per-capita basis in 2020, following on from a record year for installations in 2019.
Johnston said the annual growth rate for rooftop solar PV across the nation has exceeded 33% for the past four years and accelerated in 2020.
“The number of Australians installing rooftop solar systems increased by 40% compared to 2019 levels,” he said.

The sub-100 kW market exploded in 2020 with a record 2.9 GW installed nationally, including a record 324 MW in December. In the same month, the average system size in the small-scale technology certificate (STC) market increased to 8.7 kW, driving the average system size for the year to a record 8.0 kW.
Records were also toppled in the large-scale generation certificate (LGC) market with the 5-10 MW sector, a blend of solar farms and behind-the-meter installations, continuing to grow with record deployments in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia but it wasn’t enough to offset an overall decline in the over-100 kW market.
The capacity commissioned in the LGC market was down on 2019, with SunWiz attributing the drop in part to a decline in solar farms over 50 MW while the sub-10 MW LGC market was down 29% on the previous year.

SunWiz conceded that some projects installed in 2020 had not yet been registered and may come to light in 2021, but said it is unlikely there will be sufficient volume for growth to have occurred in the LGC market.
Johnston predicted the LGC market would continue to face challenges in 2021 with the commercial sector “most likely to be somewhat steady in 2021” delivering an estimated 250 MW of sub-10MW LGC projects, while the development of solar farms has slowed.
“When compared to the start of 2020, there’s currently reduced levels of solar farms under construction and in advanced stages of development,” he said.
“This means the capacity of solar farms commissioned in 2021 is likely to reduce by an amount dependent upon when the largest projects complete. A reasonable guess would be 1.5 GW of projects over 10 MW.”
Despite concerns for the LGC market, the overall market is expected to continue growing at record rates, driven by the small-scale installations although Johnston tempered expectations, saying the STC market would more likely be ‘consistent’ in 2021 as opposed to seeing ‘continued growth’.
A ‘continued growth’ market would deliver another 40% growth in the sector, to 4.2 GW but Johnston
“We see this as optimistic due to increasing headwinds in the industry,” he said.
A ‘consistent’ market would mean sustaining the levels set in the second half of 2020. This would equate to 3.2GW annually.
“This seems reasonably achievable,” Johnston said.
“A contraction could come due to any combination of feed-in tariff reduction, increased hurdles to network connection … (but) there’s no observable wall the industry is about to hit. Therefore the contraction should be at worst 10% reduction on 2020 levels,” he said.
“Our best estimate is for a 3.35 GW STC market in 2021.”
“This would produce another record year,” Johnstone said. “However, this is heavily influenced by growth levels of residential PV.”

Owned by German investment company Wirtgen Invest, the 323-hectare Glenrowan West facility comprises approximately 350,000 solar modules installed on single-axis trackers. It is expected they will generate an estimated 261,100 MWh of renewable energy each year.
The facility, located about 250km north of Melbourne, is the first renewable energy generator to connect to AusNet’s Glenrowan Terminal Station.
Works are set to continue in the coming weeks with Wirtgen indicating construction need to be completed on blocks of inverters and modules with the facility to enter commercial operation at the end of March.
“Our goal remains to deliver on the commitment to provide clean energy to the national grid for the next 30 years,” Wirtgen said in a statement.
Glenrowan West Solar Farm is Wirtgen Invest’s first foray into the Australian market but it has aspirations to add to its portfolio.
In a statement, the company said it is committed to assisting meeting the demands for clean, sustainable power across households and businesses, whilst continuing to contribute more specifically towards Victoria’s Renewable Energy Target of 50% by 2030.
“Once the project reaches commercial operation … the Victorian market will benefit from an additional 149 MWp of renewable capacity and the solar farm will provide enough energy to power the equivalent of 41,000 households with green electricity, whilst preventing the emissions of approximately 310,000 tonnes of CO2 per year,” Wirtgen said.
The Germany-based organisation acquired the project rights to Glenrowan West from Overland Sun Farming in July 2019 and construction commenced in January 2020 with Wirsol Energy, the Australian arm of the Wircon Group, and WiNRG delivering the project management services while Signal Energy Australia has taken the lead in engineering, procurement and construction.

Q Cells Australia’s head of business Peter Bae said he was excited by the move, rating New Zealand one of the most exciting emerging renewable power markets in the world with the country aiming to being carbon-neutral by 2050.
Government-owned energy supplier Transpower has forecast the nation’s solar market is expected to more than double by 2025 and residential rooftop solar is expected to be a major growth sector.
“To meet the burgeoning market demand for quality solar solutions in New Zealand, we are excited to be introducing Q Cells to the local market at this time,” Bae said.
The move is the latest in a busy couple of months for Q Cells Down Under.
In October, Q Cells launched the Q.MAXX-G2, a solar module “custom made for Australia’s harsh conditions”. The G2 offers a power range between 350-360W, a 15-year product warranty, and a 25-year performance warranty.
That was followed by the release in December of the Q.PEAK DUO ML-G9+, the company’s first ‘zero gap’ solar module.
The G9+ is among the products already available in New Zealand and Bae said others will follow in the coming months.
“Following our first installation in October 2020, over the next months we expect to launch a number of our higher-end solutions to cater to New Zealanders who are looking for long-term performance, extended warranties and aesthetically appealing options that are designed to blend better with their surroundings,” he said.
Think Solar, comprising Wanaka Solar, Queenstown Solar and Dunedin Solar, is the first installer to partner with Q Cells in New Zealand.
Think Solar director Dean Dunning said he had actively pursued Q Cells in a bid to address market concerns about quality issues in the New Zealand solar market.
“While many New Zealanders have been early adopters of solar technology, the industry has experienced challenges around perceptions of quality,” he said.
“We have seen Q Cells being used in Australia. We’ve been impressed with the quality and the company and were also looking for a higher quality panel with long warranties.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/04/flexible-heat-pumps-ideal-for-power-grids-congested-by-solar-and-wind/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Flexible heat pumps ideal for power grids congested by solar and wind,"From pv magazine Global. 
The use of heat pumps and more flexible heating systems coupled to wind and power generation may be particularly beneficial for countries with serious grid congestion issues like the Netherlands.
This is the main conclusion of a recent report published by Dutch electricity transmission system operator (TSO) Tennet, in which its experts analysed how the use of heat pumps and smarter heat networks may contribute to the creation of more flexible electricity demand, which would, in turn, have the twofold advantage of reducing fossil fuel consumption and not wasting surplus renewable energy generation during peak hours.
The Dutch high-voltage grid operator said that in hours with poor renewable energy production, part of the heating systems could be idled temporarily, and in hours with a lot of electricity from the sun and wind, the heat systems could be powered by these two sources to provide extra heating. “In 2030, this concept could already provide between 0.5 and 1 GW of temporary flexibility and, in order to achieve this, the heat pumps must be intelligently controlled,” Tennet explained.
The flexible demand created by this approach would help to level off peak loads during strong generation of wind and solar if the capacity of the electricity grid is in danger of being exceeded. “This flexibility is needed to make maximum use of variable solar and wind generation in hours of abundance, and to reduce electricity demand in hours without solar and wind electricity,” the authors of the report affirmed.
Flexible heat pumps would be key in this scenario as they can switch back temporarily, while a well-insulated building can remain sufficiently heated for a certain time. Furthermore, hybrid heat pumps that can be powered by both gas and renewables would also represent an optimal solution, as they can temporarily rely on the fuel in the event of electricity shortages. “This reduces the peak demand for electricity and keeps homes warm,” the report notes, adding that on days with abundant solar and wind power production, heating systems with heat storage may also save some sustainable heat to power the building the following day.
According to Tennet experts, this flexible electricity demand for heat would not only contribute to CO2 reduction by using the electricity as much as possible in hours with abundant wind and sun but also by utilising it as little as possible in the hours with largely gas-fired electricity. “This helps to keep consumers’ energy bills from being higher than necessary in the future,” they further explained. “This advantage can be achieved through a contract with flexible prices with the supplier or a discount when flexibility is made available.”
The report states that these benefits will be negligible in the near future, although they may become bigger by 2030 and will continue to grow when more and more electricity from solar and wind is produced.
Tennet and Viessmann, a German manufacturer of heating, industrial and refrigeration systems, are currently working on a joint pilot project to use the potential flexibility of heat pumps for congestion management in power grids. The ViFlex project is aimed at combining a three-digit number of heat pumps and electricity storage systems to form a virtual power plant. With this approach, the heat pumps are bundled in virtual power plants to absorb surplus electricity from renewables and relieve the power grid.
The project relies on Viessmann heat pumps that can be operated with 100 percent renewable electricity. “These heat pumps can work and fill the heat storage system when a lot of solar power comes from the roof or the wind is blowing strongly in Germany and there is a lot of wind power available in the grid,” Tennet explained.

New Zealand’s net emissions rose by 57% between 1990 and 2018, placing it among the poorest performers in the OECD. As one of New Zealand’s six climate change commissioners I have been part of the process of making a clear case to government that we must take “immediate and decisive action on climate change” across all sectors.
Breaking: New Zealand roadmap to net zero unveiled. Here's what it means for you.https://t.co/5oLgapQdDC
— The Spinoff (@TheSpinoffTV) January 31, 2021

The commission’s priorities include a rapid shift to electric transport, accelerated renewable energy generation, climate-friendly farming practices and more permanent forests, predominantly in native trees. It also says New Zealand must raise its pledge under the Paris Agreement, known as the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), because its current commitment is not compatible with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5℃ above pre-industrial levels.
Ambitious but realistic carbon budgets
The good news is the draft carbon budgets are achievable, with technologies that already exist.
The commission’s advice is built around 17 recommendations that cover many sectors of the economy. One of the key messages is that Aotearoa New Zealand cannot plant its way out of trouble but needs to make real cuts in emissions and eliminate the use of fossil fuels.
Most of the solutions are well known. We need to reduce emissions from transport, from energy and industry, from agriculture and from waste.
Reducing transport emissions is crucial as the sector was responsible for 36.3% of New Zealand’s emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases in 2018 and accounts for most of the growth in emissions over the past 30 years.
Recommendations for the transport sector include electrification of the vehicle fleet, improved public transport networks and better integration of active transport (walking and cycling). A rapid increase in electric cars would reduce emissions from private and commercial transport, while supporting low-carbon fuels like “green” hydrogen and biofuels would help the freight sector (including heavy trucks, shipping and aircraft).
Part of the transport story is urban planning — changing how people and goods move around. The commission recommends limiting urban sprawl, making walking and cycling safer and easier and shifting more freight from road to rail or shipping.
The commission also calls for rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation, and energy generally, to phase out the use of coal. Between now and 2035, it estimates New Zealand could cut transport emissions by 47% and those coming from heat and electricity generation by 45%.
I can’t stress this enough. We’re heading for economic change, to decarbonise the country. There’ll be winners and losers. Who they are depends on decisions by govts, informed by advice out a week from today by the Climate Change Commission. Have your say! https://t.co/pAs5PLeaKo

Emissions from agriculture
Methane accounts for 43.5% of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions, and more than 80% of total methane comes from cud-chewing farm animals. But the short-lived nature of methane in the atmosphere means we do not need to reduce methane emissions so fast.
The Zero Carbon Act calls for a 24-47% reduction in methane emissions by 2050, compared to net-zero for carbon dioxide.
The commission’s advice is that biogenic methane emissions can be reduced by 19% by 2035 while further improving productivity in the sector through better feed, fewer but more productive animals and continued research into emission-reducing technologies.
The commission calls for real cuts in emissions rather than offsets through tree planting, but argues forestry should continue to play an important role in the long-term storage of carbon, for example if timber is used in buildings or furniture and to provide bioenergy.
It recommends a shift towards more permanent native forests to improve long-term carbon storage, biodiversity and soil retention.
Waste is another sector with significant potential to cut emissions. Per head of population, New Zealanders throw away roughly twice what an average OECD citizen does. The commission recommends moving towards a circular economy, where resources are valued and reused.
In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the main issue in the waste sector is methane release from decomposing solid waste. Capturing that gas at source could reduce methane emissions by 14% by 2035.
Cost of a fair transition
The commission’s draft budgets recommend an overall reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions of 36% by 2035, starting with 2% by 2025 and 17% by 2030. It estimates the cost of achieving this is less than 1% of projected GDP, much lower than was initially thought.
The payoffs for public health, for our environment and biodiversity make this a good investment, let alone the huge avoided costs from unchecked climate change.
The commission’s recommendations will go through a public consultation process until 14 March, and the government has until the end of the year to decide which parts of the advice it takes on board.
An important aspect of the advice is inclusiveness and support for all sectors of society as we move to a low-emissions future. The commission takes a te ao Māori (Māori world view) approach, making it clear that Aotearoa must have an equitable and fair transition.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/04/how-to-cut-emissions-from-transport-ban-fossil-fuel-cars-electrify-transport-and-get-people-walking-and-cycling/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,NEW ZEALAND",,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021","How to cut emissions from transport: ban fossil fuel cars, electrify transport and get people walking and cycling","From The Conversation NZ. 
The Climate Change Commission’s draft advice on how to decarbonise New Zealand’s economy is refreshing, particularly as it calls on the government to start phasing out fossil fuels instead of relying on offsets and carbon trading.
Until now, New Zealand has relied heavily on its Emissions Trading Scheme, but the evidence is clear that it has failed to reduce emissions. The commission’s package includes carbon budgets out to 2035 and detailed pathways to achieve them across all sectors of the economy.
For the transport sector, which is responsible for half of New Zealand’s energy-related emissions, the commission suggests a sweeping set of changes to electrify the country’s car fleet and to replace imported fuels with local renewable electricity.
It’s exciting to see a national-level plan that actually cuts emissions. But it raises two questions: is it feasible, and is it the best or only option?
Transforming the transport sector
Land transport was always going to be squarely in the commission’s sights. Its emissions have doubled since 1990, and, unlike agriculture, it’s not a protected export industry.
The commission calls for cuts in transport emissions of 47% by 2035, achieved by:
To achieve this rapid electrification, New Zealand would need to produce more renewable electricity. Only one large wind farm, the 840 GWh/year Turitea wind farm near Palmerston North, is currently under construction.
In the commission’s proposed scenarios, New Zealand would need another renewable electricity plant like this every year from now on. At the moment, New Zealand has only 690 MW of wind turbines, and no utility-scale solar generation. The industry would need to scale up considerably.
Other live issues are the planned 2024 closure of the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter, which would make a lot of renewable electricity available, and the NZ Battery pumped-hydro project.
The promise of deep cuts to fossil fuels
The proposed shift away from fossil fuels is clearly feasible technically, but would need a quick and radical change in policy. Unfortunately, New Zealand doesn’t have a good track record of carrying out the sweeping regulatory changes that will be needed.

Apart from the proposed import ban on petrol cars from 2032, the EV plan involves a system of subsidies and fuel efficiency standards. Last week, the government introduced a refreshed fuel efficiency standard, with a target of 105 gCO₂/km by 2025.
But the car industry appears to have won several concessions, including a halving of penalties (to NZ$50 per vehicle per gram of CO₂ over the target), a delay in the standard’s introduction until 2023 and a separate target for utes.
The EU did not begin to see rapid EV uptake until 2020, when a new 95 gCO₂/km target kicked in, along with fines of €100/gCO₂/km and generous incentives. Achieving the Norway-like transformation of the car fleet the commission envisages will likely require more incentives and stronger oversight of the market.
Is this the only way?
The commission’s plan doesn’t question the overall structure of the transport system. In the view of some critics, the present system is inequitable and disadvantages people who can’t or don’t want to drive, including children, older people and people living with disabilities.
It has contributed to poor health and safety outcomes, traffic congestion and car-dominated city streets. At an annual cost of NZ$17,000 per household (not counting greenhouse gas emissions), it is also expensive.
The commission’s technical advisory panel included representatives from the car importing industry and other road transport groups, but no experts on walking, cycling, public transport, public health or urban planning.
The massive road-building programme undertaken by both National and Labour governments, set to continue far into the future, is not mentioned, despite considerable evidence that it increases transport demand, sprawl and emissions.
There is no requirement to reduce parking, a topic currently contested in urban forums and already being studied by the government. Nor are there any plans for passenger rail or improvements to inter-city public transport.
Changing the way cities grow
New Zealand’s housing crisis has already prompted a rewrite of urban plans throughout the country to enable higher densities, especially near transport hubs. The commission recommends that, before 2025, all levels of government should embed links between urban planning, design and transport so that communities have integrated and accessible transport options, including safe cycleways.
A glimpse of what can be possible comes from Ireland:
You don’t need a complicated model to accept that these steps are more in tune with the required emission reductions.
Those who argue that infinite growth is not possible on a finite planet will not find much to agree with in the commission’s report. Other perspectives, such as those outlined in the recent book A Societal Transformation Scenario for Staying Below 1.5ºC critique the growth and technology biases in most climate scenarios.
Another model of the future could involve less energy, less travel and less consumption overall, but an equivalent or higher standard of living.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/04/swinburne-researchers-novel-catalyst-to-produce-green-hydrogen-from-seawater/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 4, 2021",Swinburne researchers’ novel catalyst to produce green hydrogen from seawater,"Researchers from Swinburne University’s Centre for Translational Atomaterials and Shaanxi Normal University have managed to develop a novel catalyst which is capable of producing high-performance solar light-triggered hydrogen from seawater. If there is one thing we all know about seawater, it’s that there is a lot of it, so it is no surprise that this line of scientific discovery has great potential.
In order to utilise this new catalyst, the researchers also had to develop a prototype device known as the ‘Ocean-H2-Rig’ which is able to float on the ocean surface producing green hydrogen from seawater.
One of the easiest and greenest ways to produce hydrogen is through photocatalytic water splitting, which uses solar energy to split water into its composite atoms, securing the hydrogen and harmlessly emitting the oxygen.
The novelty of the single-atom platinum catalyst these researchers have developed is that the photo-generated electrons and holes triggered by solar radiation do not try to recombine, a saving which greatly improves hydrogen production efficiency.

Lead author of the research paper published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Tianyi Ma, said that the team “used the single-atom platinum catalyst as the electron extractor. It is synthesised by a scalable and low-cost calcination method, easily produced at large scale.” Moreover, Ma continued, “The high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is what we need for industrial application.”
According to Baohua Jia, Founding Director of the Centre for Translational Atomaterials, the reusable catalyst “promotes highly efficient hydrogen production with an outstanding quantum yield of 22.2% under LED-550 illumination, which stands among the best catalysts ever reported.”
The idea of “Solar Rigs” floating on the world’s oceans converting seawater to hydrogen fuel is not a new one. In 2018 scientists from Columbia University in the U.S. developed a device called “a floating photovoltaic electrolyzer”. Columbia’s Daniel Esposito even worked out how much of the ocean’s surface would need to be covered by giant “solar fuel rigs” in order to generate enough hydrogen fuel to replace the 2018-levels of global oil use, telling Smithsonian Magazine 63,000 square miles (approximately 163,169 square kilometres), or an area equivalent to the state of Florida. Sounds like a fair bucket, but actually that figure corresponds to about 0.045% of our terraqueous globe’s oceanic surface.
Of course, none of this is to mention the enormous obstacles this technology would have to overcome, not only technically and materially but environmentally. Which is to say, metals like platinum and titanium are expensive and the ocean is a truculent place – the sea giveth and the sea taketh away.
Nevertheless, Australian researchers are on the cutting-edge of this promising line of green hydrogen technology.
