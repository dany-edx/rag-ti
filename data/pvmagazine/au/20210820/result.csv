United Energy, which services 660,000 customers across Melbourne’s east, southeast and the nearby Mornington Peninsula, said the 30 kW/66 kWh batteries will be mounted to electricity poles at strategic locations across its distribution network.
Each of the batteries, to be manufactured by Melbourne-based Thycon, will have the capacity to support up to 75 homes in the immediate vicinity. When the rollout is complete, the battery fleet will be able to store the electricity needed to support 3,000 homes.
Each battery will be charged during off-peak periods or when local rooftop solar systems are exporting into the network and will discharge electricity during peak periods and solar systems are no longer generating.
United Energy general manager electricity networks Mark Clarke said in addition to reducing stress on local network in times of peak demand, the batteries will also be able to regulate voltage and increase the hosting capacity of solar PV in the local grid.
“It is an important step forward in setting up the kind of flexible network we need to manage electricity exports from rooftop solar and other private generators in the future,” he said.
Clarke said the pole-top batteries, the design of which mirrors the existing distribution transformers that are already mounted to poles across United Energy’s Melbourne network, will provide an opportunity for everyone to access renewable energy, whether they have rooftop solar or not.
“A community battery is a way of storing energy that can then be used locally when it is needed,” he said.
“It is a great way of ensuring solar PV exports from homes in the community are consumed locally.
“From a network perspective, it also helps defer traditional investment so can save money for customers on future network tariffs.”

Clarke said the batteries will operate as a virtual power plant (VPP), providing demand management services and increasing hosting capacity for rooftop solar.
United Energy has signed a deal with retailer Simply Energy for the market trading rights of the VPP.
When the batteries are not required by United Energy, Simply Energy will operate them to provide wholesale power and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS).
Simply Energy CEO Shannon Hyde said the batteries presented enormous opportunities for customers in Melbourne’s south-east.
“The program shows the versatility of battery technology in supporting networks, creating opportunities to trade energy and delivering for solar and non-solar energy customers alike,” he said.
The battery rollout has secured financial backing from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which will provide a $4 million grant in support of the project.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said distribution connected batteries has enormous potential to facilitate increased levels of rooftop solar while minimising costs.
“As more and more renewable generation comes online, it’s crucial to address the challenges of a changing energy mix and build the grid of the future,” he said.
“We’re excited to see United Energy trial a novel approach to battery storage that provides benefits to current and future solar customers and reduces network costs, while also increasing the level of dispatchable generation in the power system.”

The large-scale battery rollout follows a successful two-battery trial last year in Melbourne’s Bayside area.
United Energy expects to install and commission the first three batteries later this year.
Meanwhile, the Victorian government has awarded $3.68 million in grants to jumpstart the roll-out of neighbourhood-scale batteries and energy storage studies to maximise benefits of solar for households, businesses and community organisations.
State Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio on Friday announced 16 groups have secured grants as part of the Neighbourhood Battery Initiative which is funding pilots and demonstrations of a range of neighbourhood battery ownership and operational models to unlock the potential of neighbourhood-scale energy storage.
“Neighbourhood batteries are an important part of our transition to renewable energy,” she said.
“They can soak up energy from household solar and allow for the whole community to benefit from this clean energy.”

In the past four years AEMO has connected 121 new generation projects but 97 GW of proposed generation projects – double today’s entire NEM capacity – remain in the pipeline. This includes 46 GW of wind, 33 GW of solar and 10 GW of hydro.
AEMO said many of the wind and solar projects are located in electrically weak parts of the grid, prone to poor system strength and thermal and capacity limits. This is presenting technical difficulties and contributing to connection delays, reinforcing the need for reliable modelling.
Developers of large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia are currently required to submit to AEMO for testing models outlining what impact a proposed project will have on the grid.
If that modelling is delayed or denied, the developer is required to ‘tune’ their model which can be a costly and slow process.
AEMO said the connections simulation tool will allow project developers and their partners and electricity networks to rapidly test and refine their renewable energy plant and project configurations using the same detailed wide-area power system simulations being used by the market operator to assess connections applications.
AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman said the connection simulation tool is expected to significantly streamline the applications process, while reducing the risk, costs, and timeframe required to complete connections approval.
“Our energy sector continues to move through its most extensive transformation in a century, leading the world in the uptake of renewable generation on a per capita basis,” he said.
“The connections simulator will give developers the option to utilise the wide-area power system information used by AEMO for the first time to evaluate their project models quickly and efficiently. This will help enable new generation and storage capacity into the power system.”

As well as the connection simulator, AEMO is developing an operations simulator that provides a ‘digital twin’ of Australia’s energy systems. The first of its kind in Australia, the data-informed replica will allow highly detailed analysis of the grid’s behaviour and help inform future planning, system design and policy scenarios.
Westerman said the digital twin will improve agility and quality of decision making for consumers and for policy makers.
“Given the increasing portion of renewables with technically complex control systems, the operations simulator will enhance AEMO’s ability to prepare for and quickly respond to events threatening secure power-system operations,” he said.
The simulator project has secured $2.23 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Advancing Renewables Program with CEO Darren Miller confident the on-line tool will help integrate and fast-track renewable energy into the energy system.
“Australia’s energy system is evolving rapidly with most of the growth in generation coming from rooftop solar and large-scale solar and wind,” he said.
“The proposed connections simulation tool will assist large-scale developers by providing a detailed source of energy data and modelling that incorporates our electricity systems, thereby allowing them to accelerate their development process and manage potential risk before going through the formal grid connection process.”
AEMO said testing on a working prototype of the connection simulator will commence this month, with a staged rollout of the tool expected to commence later this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/20/western-power-ready-to-welcome-microgrid-to-energy-mix/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Western Power ready to welcome microgrid to energy mix,"Western Australia (WA) grid operator Western Power has announced the Kalbarri microgrid, which will utilise wind and solar PV power, battery energy storage and the grid to improve the reliability of electricity supply to the community on the state’s mid-west coast will be switched on in September ahead of a November launch.
The microgrid will be powered by 1 MW of rooftop solar and a 1.6 MW wind farm and backed by a 5 MW/2 MWh battery energy storage system. The smart system will be connected to the grid and will be able to reverse power flows overnight when stored energy is insufficient to meet demand and disconnect from the larger network should a fault occur.
“It can run independently or connect to the main electricity network. During an outage the microgrid maintains supply to the community using both solar and wind, and stored energy in the battery,” Western Power said.
Western Power said the project will be one of Australia’s largest microgrids capable of operating in complete renewable mode.
First announced in 2016, the microgrid was scheduled to come online more than two years ago but it has been beset by multiple delays, during which the community has been forced to deal with ongoing energy supply problems and extended outages.
A Western Power spokesperson has however told local media the microgrid is on track to become operational early next month when an eight-week trial is expected to commence.
“The microgrid was expected to become operational in June 2021, however this was delayed due to Tropical Cycle Seroja,” the spokesperson told the Geraldton Guardian, referencing the cyclone that ripped through the region in April.
“We’ve also had challenges associated with the loss of a key delivery partner and finding an alternative delivery partner that had the necessary skill set to finalise the project.”

The announcement comes as welcome news for the Kalbarri community, which has had to deal with ongoing energy supply problems.
The coastal tourist town, about 600 kilometres north of Perth, is currently supplied by a combination of wind, rooftop and commercial solar systems, and a 140km-long rural feeder line connecting it to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) at Geraldton.
About 2,000 customers are served by the 33 kV feeder line which is exposed to the elements and susceptible to interference which can cause extended outages.
As recently as August 11 the community endured five power outages in a single day. The disruptions were highlighted in State Parliament last week when the local member questioned Energy Minister Bill Johnston about delivering reliable power for Kalbarri.
The Western Power spokesperson said had the microgrid been in place for recent faults, residents would have experienced no outages.
“While incidents on that line or within the microgrid area can and will still take place, the expectation is for fewer or shorter duration outages,” the spokesperson said.
When power to Kalbarri from the feeder line goes down, the battery will kick in and along with the renewable sources, supply power for a period of time while the fault is repaired.
Western Power has said the Kalbarri microgrid could be used as a blueprint for other regional areas and help in the development of further renewable generation across the rural edges of the electricity network.

CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall said the national science agency is uniquely positioned to use breakthrough science to develop, implement and demonstrate effective pathways to net zero emissions.
“As a large 100-year-old organisation spread across 55 sites nationally, CSIRO has many challenges to emissions reduction but we believe if we can do it, it will inspire other large companies to leverage Australian science to travel the path to net zero emissions,” he said.
“CSIRO is in a strong position to make science real, by translating it straight from our established energy lab and into our operations, while also directly assisting our industry partners to work towards their own net zero emission ambitions.
“CSIRO has been actively reducing its carbon emissions over the last five years, and we are now anticipating 70% reduction.”
Marshall said the CSIRO can help accelerate the transformation to net zero by using cutting-edge technologies in solar, wind, hydrogen, next generation batteries, predictive analytics and energy efficiency technologies.
“Our longer-term plans will really put our science to the test as we try to transition … towards net zero emissions,” he said.
“We are exploring innovative options such as using hydrogen to power future research vessels or applying renewable or hybrid energy to power remote facilities.”

Key to the achieving the net zero target will be the Newcastle Energy Centre, home to the CSIRO’s energy research hub and the only high-temperature solar thermal research facility of its type in Australia.
CSIRO Newcastle site leader Gregory Wilson said the Energy Centre is ideally placed to lead the way for CSIRO.
“Our Newcastle Energy Centre has an established track record for developing and evaluating new ways to drive energy efficiency, generate renewable energy, store energy and reduce emissions. It is also home to the largest solar thermal array of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere,” he said.
“We have the opportunity to take the best of our science and testing and apply it across our site which already features 425 kW of solar and wind energy infrastructure, and 600 kWh of battery storage.”
Wilson said increasing onsite renewable energy generation and optimising control of onsite energy storage will be among the initiatives the CSIRO will pursue as it looks to achieve its net zero targets.
The CSIRO also plans to convert its gas systems to electric, electrify its transport fleet, and increase the uptake of clean-energy power purchasing agreements across all of the agency’s sites.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/20/perovskite-silicon-tandems-could-rapidly-scale-solar/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Perovskite-silicon tandems could rapidly scale solar,"From pv magazine USA
Researchers at Oxford PV, an Oxford University spinoff that focuses on perovskites, have been working on an efficiency solution that they said can help to scale up solar more rapidly.
The group is using perovskites to squeeze more power out of solar cells, pushing past the “Shockley-Queisser” 26% efficiency barrier that is posed by conventional silicon materials.
Perovskites fulfil all the optoelectronic requirements for a PV cell, and can be manufactured using existing processes. Perovskites can be layered onto a conventional cell in tandem with silicon. These features, said the developers, make perovskites ideal plug-and-play materials to integrate with silicon technology.
Metal halide perovskites have been targeted by the research community for their properties, and have been under research and development for more than a decade. Perovskites are, in many ways, a foil to silicon, said the researchers. While silicon is a weakly absorbing material that requires hundreds of micrometers of thickness to fully absorb sunlight due to its indirect bandgap, perovskites are strongly absorbing, direct bandgap semiconductors. As such, they need less than a micrometer of material thickness.
Silicon requires energy-intensive fabrication processes to create high-purity single crystals necessary for low-defect densities, where perovskites are inherently defect-tolerant and can be processed at low-temperatures into polycrystalline cells. 
While the two materials behave quite differently, the end result is two high-quality materials that can deliver power conversion efficiencies of around 26% by using low-cost fabrication routes.
The increase in efficiency created by perovskite-tandem cells can help to offset some of the carbon emissions needed to produce high-purity silicon used for conventional solar PV cells, said Oxford PV.
Combining the perovskites in tandem with silicon, rather than rebuilding a process for pure-perovskite or other material combination, allows for a faster and less costly scale-up of manufacturing. Furthermore, existing supply chains already contain the physical elements that comprise perovskite materials, paving a clear path to scale up the technology rapidly.
Higher-efficiency cells do exist, like the III-V multi-junction devices built by Spectrolab and Azur Space. However, these are typically used in outer space, where cost is less critical than minimising wafer area. These cells can operate at 40% efficiencies, but are expensive, and currently cannot compete with the conventional silicon market in a way that tandem cells could.
Oxford PV has been researching tandem cells for seven years, and the group said it is now close to starting mass commercial production in a factory in Brandenburg, Germany. The International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics forecasts the entry of tandem cells into the market after 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/20/australian-scientists-set-out-to-use-wastewater-for-green-hydrogen-electrolysis/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 20, 2021",Australian scientists set out to use wastewater for green hydrogen electrolysis,"Researchers from Monash University, in league with national water utilities, are setting out to uncover ways in which wastewater can be used to produce green hydrogen even more sustainably.
Although the federal government isn’t quite helping, Australia is set to be a green hydrogen superpower in coming decades. With the Sunburnt Country’s natural resources of wind, solar and open space, it is the ideal exporter of green hydrogen and ammonia to energy hungry net-zero committed nations such as South Korea and Japan. However, as many Australians are well aware, water is not always a resource Australia has an abundance of, so utilising wastewater could be a great boon.
According to the Sustainable Hydrogen Production from Used Water (SHPUS) project, at least 5.5 billion litres of water will be needed annually if Australia is to meet its 2030 hydrogen production target as set out by the National Hydrogen Strategy. That’s the annual water consumption of 1.6 million people.
The SHPUS project, which recently received an ARC Linkage grant, is looking to make sure Australia’s future hydrogen export market doesn’t exacerbate the nation’s water scarcity problems. To this end, the project is developing an innovative way to repurpose wastewater for use in the water electrolysis process.
Researchers from Monash University’s Department of Chemical Engineering, including Professors Xiwang Zhang, Professor Huanting Wang, and Dr Yinlong Zhu believe there is more than enough wastewater generated by Australia’s major cities that freshwater consumption can be minimised.

“The amount of wastewater currently available for use is far more than the amount of water required in water electrolysis for hydrogen production,” said Zhang. “Most of the treated water throughout Australia is currently discharged to surrounding water bodies or recycled for irrigation after being treated in centralised municipal wastewater treatment plants. Given the volume of the treated water from these plants is highly consistent, it is a promising water source for water electrolysis.”
Monash’s researchers are joining forces with the utilities, including Southeast Water, Melbourne Water, Yarra Valley Water and Water Corporation via Water Research Australia (WaterRA).
WaterRA’s Dr. Arash Zamyadi said that while current water treatment processes effectively remove the majority of pollutants, there are still some small “residual organics and ions” remaining, and we need to know how to remove them too.
“There still remains a knowledge gap in how the impurities affect water electrolyser design and process operation,” said Zamyadi. “Through this research, we hope to develop an in-depth understanding of the impacts of water impurities in used water on the performance and durability of water electrolysers, and subsequently develop guidelines for the design of highly durable water electrolysers and the operation and upgrade of existing wastewater treatment plants.”
With Australia’s hydrogen exports expected to bring in $10 billion to the Australian economy each year through the annual sale of more than 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen and/or ammonia by 2040, the sustainability of this supply chain is of immense importance.

Japanese PV module recycling specialist Next Energy and Resources Co Ltd, and Japan-based Japanese conglomerate Marubeni Corporation are planning to use blockchain technology in the process of identifying solar modules at the end of their lifecycle that are suitable for recycling or reuse.
The technology, which is currently being developed with the support of the Japanese Ministry of Environment and the Mitsubishi Research Institute, should be able to inspect the solar modules and provide data on the traceability and components used, as well as verifying that these data were not modified or tampered with.
The use of this transparent technique, according to Next Energy, will enable the identification of a larger amount of modules that can still be reused or recycled, which would result in a reduction of the amount of waste in landfills and, in the case of modules being reused, would also lower their carbon footprint.
No more technical details on the inspection technology were provided.
Next Energy has been active in the PV module recycling business with its ‘Reborn’ set of standards since 2005. It claims to have inspected more than 140,000 used modules to date.
