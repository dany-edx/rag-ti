ACEN Australia Chief Executive Officer Anton Rohner said the first stage of the solar farm is now progressing through its hold point testing process after the project was granted formal approval to send power to the grid by the Australian Energy Market Organisation (AEMO) in December.
Rohner said the first stage is expected to be generating at full name plate capacity of 400 MW in the coming months.
“We’re going through the commissioning process as we speak,” he said. “We are approximately 100 MW today and … you’ll see us ramping up to full production over the next four to five months.”
The New England Solar Farm is being developed in two stages and will eventually comprise a 720 MW solar installation combined with a 50 MW/50 MWh big battery which has scope to be scaled up to 200 MW/400 MWh.
Construction of the first stage of the big battery has already commenced and ACEN expects a financial investment decision to be made on stage two of the solar farm later this year, with construction to begin before the end of 2023.
“We’re just corralling the appropriate contracts into place and making sure we have the appropriate panels, the right environmental approvals and infrastructure in place,” Rohner said.
Once the entire 720 MW project is complete, it is anticipated it will produce 1,800 GWh of renewable electricity each year, enough to power more than 250,000 households.

Rohner said ACEN has opted to build the New England Solar Farm on a fully merchant basis to ensure it is online in time to help replace closing coal-fired power stations in NSW.
“We wanted to get things built, to decarbonise Australia,” he said. “I truly believe that the work ACEN Australia is doing to accelerate Australia’s transition to a renewable energy future is here and now – and it starts with New England Solar.”
ACEN Chief Executive Officer Eric Francia said the official opening of the New England Solar Farm establishes Australia as a “stronghold” for the company’s renewables expansion in the region.
“The Australia team continues to harness the country’s outstanding potential for clean energy to help ACEN reach its goal of 20 GW of renewables capacity by 2030,” he said.
Francia said ACEN Australia has more than 1 GW capacity in construction, and more than 8 GW capacity in the development pipeline.
ACEN Australia’s pipeline of projects includes the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project in NSW, a share in the Rise Renewables 250 MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300 MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia, the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project near Dunedoo in NSW, and the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/16/authority-flags-solar-feed-in-tariff-increase-for-regional-queensland/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 16, 2023",Authority flags solar feed-in tariff increase for regional Queensland,"The Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) has released a draft determination suggesting that the 2023–24 regional solar feed-in tariff for customers on state government-owned utility Ergon Energy’s network could rise to 12.952 cents (USD 0.08) per kWh, about 3.5 cents per kWh more than the existing tariff of 9.3 cents per kWh.
QCA Chair Professor Flavio Menezes said the proposal to increase the feed-in tariff for small-scale solar customers in regional Queensland was based largely on a projected increase in wholesale energy costs.
The QCA said the draft regional solar feed-in tariff is 39.3% higher than the 2022 tariff, but noted it is likely the final tariff will differ from the draft figure.
“The price estimate in the draft determination is indicative only, as it is based on information at the time,” it said. “For the final determination, it will be based on updated data and feedback from stakeholders.”
Renewable energy advocacy group Solar Citizens welcomed the potential tariff increase for regional Queenslanders, saying the state’s solar owners are playing a critical role in bringing down wholesale electricity prices for everyone.
“At the moment we’re seeing very high wholesale power prices due to high global coal and gas prices, and the only price relief we’re getting is during the day when the state’s 900,000-plus solar homes and businesses are generating cheap, local electricity,” Solar Citizens Deputy Director Stephanie Gray said.
Gray said the higher power prices should dictate that all solar owners should get more for the electricity they supply, but said those in southeast Queensland, where private retailers set their own feed-in tariff, are missing out.
The average reward offered to small-scale solar customers in the state’s southeast for feeding excess electricity into the grid is trending downwards and sitting at about 5.7 cents per kWh.
“Slashing feed-in tariffs is what many retailers are doing to recoup some of their profits,” Gray said.
The QCA has called for stakeholders to provide feedback on the draft determination before April. 14, 2023. The final determination is expected to be published by June. 9, 2023, and the feed-in tariff will apply from July. 1, 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/16/south-australian-network-operator-unveils-new-transmission-line/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 16, 2023",South Australian network operator unveils new transmission line,"The completion of the 270-kilometre Eyre Peninsula Link transmission project, an upgrade to the existing high-voltage electricity transmission network supplying the region, will provide a more secure power supply to homes, businesses and communities, says ElectraNet.
ElectraNet Chief Executive Officer Simon Emms said after two years of construction and more than five years of planning, a new double-circuit 132 kV electricity transmission line is now powering the Eyre Peninsula.
“Eyre Peninsula Link is a significant investment in the region, giving residential and business electricity users a more secure and reliable power supply,” he said. “As well as improving supply reliability, the new line future proofs the region’s high-voltage electricity supply to support growth and renewable energy development.”
The Eyre Peninsula Link project entailed the construction of a double-circuit 132 kV electricity transmission line from Cultana to Port Lincoln, via Yadnarie, replacing the previous transmission line which was more than 50 years old. The project included the installation of 500 new transmission towers and upgrades to substations at Cultana, Yadnarie, Port Lincoln Terminal, Wudinna and Middleback.
As well as a more secure and reliable power supply for homes and businesses across the Eyre Peninsula, ElectraNet said the new transmission line will also provide increased capacity to connect more users to the electricity network and enable new renewable energy and mining projects to connect to the grid in the future.
The project will also pave the way for a future upgrade to the Cultana to Yadnarie section to 275 kV.

Emms said the Eyre Peninsula Link is one of the biggest construction projects yet undertaken by ElectraNet with about 200 workers on average involved in delivering the project, with the workforce peaking at 300 early in 2022.
“Despite the challenging weather conditions and ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was successfully delivered, which is a huge achievement and a credit to all involved,” he said.
ElectraNet said the cost of the new transmission line had been largely offset by avoiding the cost of replacement works on the existing transmission line and annual Port Lincoln generator network support payments.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/16/sale-of-sun-cable-mega-project-attracts-multiple-bids/,"FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY,SINGAPORE",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 16, 2023",Sale of Sun Cable mega project attracts multiple bids,"Sun Cable’s administrators, FTI Consulting (FTI), say “multiple parties” have lodged non-binding indicative offers for the ambitious $30 billion-plus (USD 20 billion) Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) project, which includes up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory (NT).
Sun Cable is largely owned by mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s private firm Squadron Energy and technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ private investment company Grok Ventures. The company entered voluntary administration on Jan. 11, 2023, citing an “absence of alignment” among shareholders.
Both Squadron and Grok Ventures were expected to make individual non-binding proposals for Sun Cable. While FTI says the sale of the company has “elicited strong interest” over the past two months with multiple parties having lodged non-binding indicative offers.
FTI did not identify the bidders but indicated external potential buyers had emerged.
“The shortlisted bidders include a range of potential buyers including parties that are not existing Sun Cable shareholders,” FTI said.
Sun Cable’s AAPowerLink project proposes to build up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in the NT’s Barkley region to help power Darwin and then Singapore via a 4,200-kilometre submarine transmission link. Sun Cable had hoped to begin construction in 2024 and was aiming to be providing power to Darwin in 2027 and Singapore in 2029. The project is estimated to cost more than $30 billion.
Grok Ventures has indicated it wants to continue with the original vision for the AAPowerLink project, while Squadron has called for an overhaul of the plans with Forrest suggesting he would scrap the cable to Singapore, potentially using the solar to power green hydrogen projects.
However, FTI says it is unlikely Sun Cable will be broken up, noting that the sale process has advertised the operation as “a complete development, including AAPowerlink, and the sale continues to be progressed on that basis.”
FTI is now looking to “progress a shortlist of bidders through to the submission of binding proposals” by the end of April, with a view to completing the sale process by the end of May.

The First Peoples Adoption of Renewable Energy (FPARE) Program provides individual grants of up to $50,000 to traditional owner corporations, registered Aboriginal parties and recognised traditional owner groups through a competitive process.
Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the funds will empower Australia’s traditional owners to self-determine how they would like to take part in the energy transition while assisting their access to and management of renewable energy.
“We’re working with traditional owners to enable them to shape how clean energy is developed in their communities, protecting country while delivering clean power, jobs and economic opportunities,” she said.
D’Ambrosio added that the program will build renewable energy capacity and capability for traditional owners and Aboriginal communities through education and awareness, information-sharing programs, and support for the development of projects that build renewable energy capacity.
Projects could include installing solar panels, developing feasibility studies and undertaking business cases for future community-owned renewable energy generation projects, as well as build on projects funded under the previous Traditional Owner Renewable Energy Program (TOREP).
Applications for grants of up to $50,000 are now being accepted. Submissions close April. 28, 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/16/longi-reveals-plans-to-open-5-gw-solar-module-factory-in-us-market/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"MARCH 16, 2023",Longi reveals plans to open 5 GW solar module factory in US market,"Chinese panel maker Longi Solar and US solar project developer Invenergy have agreed to jointly construct a 5 GW solar panel factory in Pataskala, Ohio, via a newly founded company, Illuminate USA. A press release from Illuminate USA says the plan will cost USD 220 million ($332.5 million). Invenergy said it has invested USD 600 million in the facility.
Illuminate USA says that the construction of the facility will generate 150 jobs. Once it is up and running, it will require 850 individuals to keep it going. The factory will make single and bifacial solar modules.
Invenergy’s involvement with solar panel manufacturing follows an emerging pattern in the US market. According to the Solar Energy Industries of America “Solar & Storage Supply Chain Dashboard,” Invenergy’s total US solar module assembly fleet is above 58 GW. That figure includes proposed facilities, as well as facilities being constructed or expanded, and excludes capacity from Longi.

According to Longi’s quarterly presentations, the company hopes to reach 85 GW of solar panel manufacturing capacity by the end of 2023. This would make it the world’s largest solar panel assembly company. It is already one of the largest solar wafer and cell manufacturers.
The recently signed Inflation Reduction Act offers solar panel manufacturers a collection of incentives for manufacturing solar hardware in the US:
Data from BloombergNEF suggests that in the US, solar module assembly costs roughly USD 84 million for each gigawatt of annual manufacturing capacity. The machines assembling modules cost approximately USD 23 million per gigawatt, and the remaining costs go towards facility construction.
pv magazine’s Vincent Shaw said the machines used in standard Chinese monoPERC manufacturing lines deployed in China cost approximately $8.7 million per gigawatt.
A 10 GW solar panel manufacturing facility built by Longi cost USD 349 million in 2022, excluding real estate costs.
In 2022, Longi announced a $6.7 billion solar campus that will manufacture 100 GW of solar wafers and 50 GW of solar cells per year
