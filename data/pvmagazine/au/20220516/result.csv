It also successfully tested the intelligent systems required to orchestrate the clean energy over a simulated bi-directional balancing market trading interval.
Delivered in collaboration between the state government, state-owned electricity providers Western Power and Synergy, and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), Project Symphony aims to demonstrate how increasing levels of DER, including rooftop solar and residential batteries can be co-ordinated for the benefit of the grid and consumers.
AEMO WA and Strategy executive general manager Kate Ryan said the recent testing process was a “very exciting” milestone for the project and for energy customers and marks the start of how households and businesses could experience broader financial and environmental benefits from their DER assets in the Western Australia (WA) electricity system.
“This is the first step in realising the full capabilities of Distributed Energy Resources such as rooftop solar, batteries, and large appliances in supporting the energy transition to grids capable of handling 100% instantaneous penetration,” she said. “It is a significant milestone not only by the project partners involved, but for the future of Western Australia.”
WA households are embracing renewable energy technology at record rates with figures released by the state government showing rooftop solar installations increased by more than 600% over the past decade. More than 400,000 homes and businesses, about 36% of customers, now have rooftop solar connected to WA’s main grid.

In 2021, WA households added 191MW of generation capacity to their rooftops, bringing the total amount of residential solar capacity in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) to 1,362MW. The combined residential solar output from all this distributed renewable rooftop generation exceeds the gross output capacity of WA’s largest power station – Synergy’s 854MW Muja Power Station.
While the influx of rooftop solar and other DER assets provides opportunities, it also presents major challenges for the electricity system which was not designed for two-way energy flow. In response, the state government has implemented its Distributed Energy Resources Roadmap, with Project Symphony key to its delivery.
The project, which is due to run until mid-to-late 2023, is initially targeting the Perth suburbs of Harrisdale, Piara Waters and Forrestdale. The VPP is piloting a version of the `Open Energy Networks’ (OpEN) hybrid model, which defines roles and responsibilities for transitioning to a two-way power grid, enabling the integration of customer DER. In this model, a VPP is dispatched centrally but devices are coordinated locally via energy retailers or aggregators.
AEMO Distributed Markets WA manager Tom Butler said the recent testing of systems involved in the project had been a major success.
“The system integration testing saw seven organisations, including project and technology partners across five different time zones, conduct 20 integration tests over five days,” he said.
“It involved the partners’ platforms communicating with each other, providing both instructions and responses that support real electron flow changes to and from DER, whilst engaging with a simulated market environment. It is a great achievement for everyone involved.”

Of the test scenarios conducted, AEMO said 19 were successful with proponents confident the outstanding scenario would be rectified as part of future testing.
The testing involved Synergy registering a facility comprised of aggregated DER determining its available capacity for a trading interval, and incorporating a basic Dynamic Operating Envelope (DoE) at the National Metering Identifier (NMI) level. This allows an aggregator to prepare and provide a market submission to AEMO.
Synergy also managed customer assets from load to generation, to meet AEMO’s dispatch instructions. Western Power monitored the network during the scenario.
Western Power Project Symphony program manager Andrew Blaver said the successful integration was a critical milestone in planning for the future of the WA energy system.
“This is exciting for the project and for the people of Western Australia, as it marks the beginning of the Western Australian electricity system understanding how households and businesses could experience broader financial and environmental benefits from their energy assets,” he said.
Blaver said further testing is already underway with the focus on improving automation between the integration layers of the systems, including enabling the aggregator to receive automatic dispatch instructions from AEMO and then set an automatic dispatch of the aggregated facility into the market. The testing is set to continue for different use case scenarios until the VPP system stability period commences, currently planned for October 2022.

The project, spread across 45 hectares near Cooktown, about 240 kilometres north-west of Cairns, has been operating since 2017. Touted as “Australia’s first large scale solar-plus-storage array”, the project has a power purchase agreement for 100% of output in place until 2030 with Origin Energy. The project has an expected remaining operating life of approximately 20 years.
MPower said the Lakeland transaction is valued at $8 million, comprising deferred consideration of up to $350,000 over a three-year period following completion and the assumption of an existing $7.66 million debt facility in place with German bank NORD/LB. MPower said the equity required for the transaction will be internally funded.
The acquisition remains subject to a number of conditions, including third party consents and the finalisation of amendments to the existing debt facility structure but MPower expects the transaction to be completed by the end of June.
MPower, which will take responsibility for the operations, maintenance and asset management of the Lakelands facility upon completion of the transaction, said the Lakeland solar farm and storage facility is expected to generate annual revenue from the sale of energy and large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) of approximately $1.8 million and annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of more than $800,000.
MPower chief executive officer Nathan Wise said the purchase of the project is strategically aligned to the company’s portfolio and fast tracks its plans to own and operate a portfolio of Australian renewable energy assets.
“The acquisition of the Lakeland project is an exciting opportunity for MPower that accelerates and expands our BOO (build, own and operate) strategy,” he said. “It provides us with an established, operating hybrid renewable energy asset that will increase the company’s revenues from day one.
“We intend to immediately deploy our expertise to upgrade the project and enhance its value.”
MPower, which has a history of designing, constructing, commissioning and maintaining solar farms, said it will look to deliver immediate operational improvements, including upgrades to infrastructure and implementation of its proprietary solution for the remote control and monitoring of renewable energy projects.
Wise said the project’s lithium-ion battery storage capacity further enhances MPower’s capability to own and manage assets in the battery energy storage sector. The project also expands the company’s geographic footprint, adding Queensland to the company’s existing development projects in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
“This significant transaction lays a solid foundation for us to now accelerate the build-out of our BOO portfolio which is progressing very well,” he said. “A number of significant steps forward are imminent. Furthermore, we continue to assess other underperforming renewable assets that might form part of our BOO portfolio and where we can improve asset performance.”

The university expects its Recycling and Renewable Energy commercialisation hub (REACH) will generate more than $1.4 billion in revenue and 2,500 jobs in the next decade.
The REACH initiative will see Deakin team with other educational institutions, Australia’s national science agency CSIRO, and more than 20 industry partners across the country to accelerate the commercialisation and manufacture of clean energy and recycling technologies, including battery energy storage solutions and green hydrogen production.
Deakin Research Innovations executive director Ross Mahon said the initiative will drive significant innovation and job creation with forward estimates calculating that REACH industry partners would generate $1.4 billion in revenue within a decade.
“Through the REACH program we will create more than 2,500 jobs within 10 years and provide a solid technology platform for further investment during this time leading to as many as 7,000 jobs,” he said.
“Collaboration with universities and TAFE institutes will create a job-ready workforce qualified in emerging technologies, and a high number of graduates will feed into companies associated with REACH.
“More than 40% of the companies involved are small and medium enterprises that will perform 80% of the work in regional Australia. Deakin’s proven production and pilot facilities will provide a springboard for next-level commercialisation both locally and overseas, driving ongoing economic and employment benefits.”

REACH will engage researchers from Federation University, RMIT University, Swinburne University of Technology and the University of Southern Queensland, alongside CSIRO and TAFE institutes.
The program will also involve more than 20 industry partners including Brisbane-based battery manufacturer Li-S Energy, Perth-based engineering outfit Oztron Energy, HB11 Energy, Clean Energy Resources Australia and Geelong oil refinery owner Viva Energy Australia.
Initial target projects include establishing an Australian supply chain for the manufacture of advanced technology batteries with greater energy density and shorter charge times. The initiative will also seek to build local capability to store and use hydrogen across a broad technology base.
Deakin Research deputy vice-chancellor Professor Julie Owens said REACH would capitalise on the university’s strengths in battery technology and hydrogen, and those of the CSIRO, as well as industry, university and TAFE partners, accelerating ideas into smart, sustainable manufacturing solutions.
“REACH will help build Australia’s sovereign capability in key manufacturing priorities, driving the country’s single largest recycling and clean energy advanced manufacturing ecosystem,” she said. “By strengthening research, development and production opportunities onshore, we can ensure that our manufacturers are more internationally competitive.
“REACH will help create a model for rapid and successful translation of research to commercialisation, increasing Australia’s competitiveness across a broader spectrum of technology advances.”

The funding is part of the $242.7 million Trailblazer Universities program announced by the federal government in November as part of a push to improve commercialisation rates for Australian research. The program offered up to $50 million each over four years to four universities through a competitive process.
Deakin’s announcement comes just days after the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the University of Newcastle (UoN) were awarded $50 million in federal funding to develop and commercialise “world-leading” technology in solar, renewable hydrogen, storage and green metals.
UNSW and the UoN announced on Wednesday they will lead an industry-backed clean energy and recycling business and research initiative designed to “help Australia and the world transition to sustainable recycling and clean energy solutions and systems”.
The Australian Trailblazer Recycling and Clean Energy (ATRaCE) Program – will include a total investment of more than $200 million including university and industry investment.

Hanwha Q Cells has revealed plans to expand its solar module production capacity in the United States and its PV cell capacity in its home market, South Korea.
“Our company has currently a capacity of 12 GW for both cells and modules spread across Korea, Malaysia, China and the US,” CEO Justin Lee told pv magazine at a press briefing for the Smarter E event in Munich, Germany.
It wants to invest US$320 million (AU$465 million) in the expansion plan, of which US$170 million (AU$247 million) will be devoted to the construction of a 1.4 GW factory at an unspecified location in the United States. Another US$150 (AU$218 million) million will be used to expand cell capacity in South Korea, where the new investment will increase domestic cell capacity to 5.4 GW.
The new US factory is expected to begin production in the first half of next year. This will raise its total US panel capacity, which also includes a 1.7 GW manufacturing facility in Georgia, to more than 3 GW.
“We see strong demand for Made in America modules, especially among the residential sector,” said Lee.
He noted the importance of the polysilicon supply chain that the company is setting up in the US market, where Hanwha Solutions recently acquired a stake in REC Silicon, with the aim of supporting the company in restarting its factory in Moses Lake, Washington, in 2023.
“Currently, we are still sourcing around 95% our ingots and wafers from China, but this will change soon, as we have also recently signed a $1.2 billion deal with Korean manufacturer OCI, which is increasing its manufacturing capacity in Malaysia,” Lee said. “We are not planning, however, to restart our own polysilicon production in Korea,” he also stated.
The company also plans to improve the carbon footprint of its products, as a big portion of the power supply used for new production, or polysilicon supply, should come from hydropower or other emissions-free energy sources.
“Growing uncertainties tell us that securing reliable, sustainable energy has become more important than ever before,” Lee said. “To do this, Q Cells will increase renewable supply from diversified sources and find cleaner ways to produce energy. That way, we will contribute to both energy security and net-zero emissions.”
Lee said the company is open to building more factories in other parts of the world.
“But carbon footprint rules would not be enough and other incentives such tax credits may be necessary,” he said in response to a question about whether the company would be open to producing PV modules in Europe.
The regional diversification of the company’s production activities is also a response to the crisis triggered by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
“High polysilicon prices and logistics costs are becoming unsustainable,” he said, noting that shipping costs currently account for between €0.04/W and €0.06/W per module. “We expect lower polysilicon prices before the end of the year or in early 2023, but we will never go back to 2019 levels.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/16/vertical-pv-system-for-green-rooftops/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 16, 2022",Vertical PV system for green rooftops,"From pv magazine Global
“Our system is specially designed for green roofs in areas where there are strict height limitations to the buildings or where there are limitations to the visual appearance on the roof structure,” CEO  Trygve Mongstad told pv magazine.
The system is based on heterojunction solar cell technology with an efficiency of 22% and a bifaciality of up to 90%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.26 C.
“The mini modules are from our suppliers, we cannot disclose details at the moment, but we are working with suppliers both in Europe and Asia,” said Mongstad. “Currently, we are doing assembly at locations in Norway and Spain, and the units for our pilot installations so far are 100% manufactured in Europe, including the solar panels.” 
Called HM–1 QUATTRO–220S, the system creates a 10 cm distance from the rooftop to the lower edge of the solar panels, which will be suitable for the bulk of green roofs with sedum plants.
“The product is also easy to retrofit on existing green roofs, where there is a total of tens of millions of square meters available, especially in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, but also in Scandinavia and other European countries,” said Mongstad.
The units consist of a mounting system and solar panels in a single pre-assembled piece, which the manufacturer said makes them very fast to mount. The geometry with low-building vertical panels has no or very low need for fastening or ballast, which further simplifies the mounting job. Each unit measures 1,600 mm x 1,510 mm x 350 mm and weighs 24.5 kg. It also features an IP68 enclosure rating and 3.2 mm double-tempered glass.
“The mounting systems are made of aluminum and provide support for each panel, while also tying together the installation as a whole for better wind load performance,” Mongstad said. 
The system is sold with a 12-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty.
“The great benefit for the customer will be that our warranty also includes the mounting system, not only the solar panel,” said Mongstad. “The building owners and building planners we talk to especially appreciate the accessibility to the rooftop for maintenance after mounting, as it is easy to walk around in the installation and move single or multiple units if local maintenance of the roofing membrane below is needed. This comes in addition to the valuable energy production profile, as well as other benefits such as a low roof load of 10 kg/m2.”
The company wants to sell its systems in Europe in 2022 and 2023, with a focus on Scandinavia and northern Europe.
The new product will be on display at booth A4.254 at the Smarter E trade show.
