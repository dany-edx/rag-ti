One of the project’s major critics, a community-based group known as the Moorabool and Central Highlands Power Alliance (MCHPA), in June filed a dispute with the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), claiming, among other things, that AVP and Transgrid did not comply with the National Electricity Rules in choosing the most economical route for the project nor did it meet consultation requirements.

The dispute has today been dismissed by the Regulator, which deemed “none of these grounds provide a basis to require AVP and Transgrid to amend” their VNI-West design.
The Moorabool and Central Highlands Power Alliance said it is “seeking legal advice in relation to the determination.”
It also noted the AER ruling is “a separate dispute to the Alliance’s Supreme Court challenge at trial in September against the Victorian Government’s Ministerial Orders, which awaits the judge’s decision.”
The VNI-West interconnector was identified as an “actionable project” in Australia’s energy transition roadmaps, known as the Integrated System Plan (ISP), from both 2020 and 2022, published by the Australian Energy Market Operator or AEMO. “Actionable projects” are given a streamlined approvals processes.
In 2023, VNI-West’s proponents, AVP and Transgrid, outlined a preferred route option for the project, Option 5A. This would connect the VNI-West to a terminal station at Bulgana in Victoria’s west, then link up with a substation near Kerang in north central Victoria before crossing the Murray River north of Kerang, linking to the EnergyConnect line at Transgrid’s Dinawan substation north of Jerilderie in New South Wales.
Consultation on the plan saw over 500 submissions of opposition, with high-profile critics labelling the project a “monumental mistake”, claiming it would be easier to upgrade existing transmission lines and that the project could triple transmission charges.
Nonetheless, by May Victorian Energy Minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, signed a ministerial order to progress the preferred route for the proposed 500 kV double-circuit overhead transmission line.
The project is a potent example of the social license issues being encountered in Australia’s energy transition. That same month, May, Australia’s Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, described Australia’s process for assessing transmission projects, known as the regulatory investment test for transmission or RIT-T process, as “not a fit-for-purpose process.”
Much has been said about shortcomings of the RIT-T process, but most concerns boil down to the fact that the process fails to look at either environmental or social impacts of proposals.
Minor reforms to the RIT-T process are scheduled to come into effect in November, next month, but these are not expected to quell critiques. “When it comes to transmission, social licence is the most important issue we have to face,” Bowen said in May.
Despite the VNI-West project steadily progressing through the approvals pipeline, criticism and debate around the project shows little sign of quietening.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/17/massive-lithium-takeover-deal-collapses-following-rinehart-intervention/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",Massive lithium takeover deal collapses following Rinehart intervention,"On Sunday, US company Albemarle Corp., the world’s largest lithium producer, dropped its $6.6 billion (USD 4.2 billion) takeover offer for West Australian lithium hopeful Liontown Resources, saying “growing complexities associated with the proposed transaction” meant that the takeover was “not in Albemarle’s best interests.”
After Liontown Resources’ board backed Albermarle’s refreshed bid in September, Australia’s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, set about upping her stake in the publicly listed Liontown, growing it from an original 4.9% stake to a 19.9% as of Friday, October 13. According to the Australian Financial Review, her company Hancock Prospecting spent around $1.3 billion doing so. 
It isn’t completely clear what Rinehart’s play was, with many positing she had hoped to block the takeover, though Hancock Prospecting recently indicated its willingness to partner with Albemarle in owning and operating Kathleen Valley and its onshore lithium processing ventures.
Billionaire Gina Rinehart has stifled Albemarle’s $4.2 bln bid for Liontown. Now the minerals producer has to raise cash just as prices for lithium are falling. She needs to show why her spoiling tactics were worth it, says @AntonyMCurrie https://t.co/jBK8WTp3NB pic.twitter.com/Ya3XzYpAEn

Either way, Albermarle decided it would not move forward under these new conditions. Liontown Resources has now entered a trading halt as it seeks to raise funds for its flagship Kathleen Valley lithium mine project.
Liontown had hoped the Kathleen Valley lithium mine, which is one of the largest and highest-grade hard rock lithium deposits in the world, would start producing from the middle of next year. It remains it be seen whether this timeline will be impacted by the corporate turmoil, but it is worth noting Hancock Prospecting repeatedly cast doubts on Liontown’s ability to deliver the Kathleen Valley project.
Hancock Prospecting bought much of its stake in Liontown in the last week at $3 a share, matching the Albermarle offer. Analysts now expect Liontown’s share price to drop, with a number of trading houses downgrading the stock’s rating.

In terms of Albermarle’s reaction, its CEO Kent Masters said: “our engagement with the Liontown team has been meaningful and productive. We appreciate the level of cooperation we have received, and we thank the entire team for their efforts. That said, moving forward with the acquisition, at this time, is not in Albemarle’s best interests.”
Albemarle has already made significant inroads into mining and processing lithium in Australia. The American company already has spodumene resources and lithium conversion facilities at Greenbushes and Wodgina and Kemerton.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/17/the-human-factor-why-australias-net-zero-transition-risks-failing-unless-it-is-fair/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",The human factor: why Australia’s net zero transition risks failing unless it is fair,"From the Conversation
For those people focused on meeting the profound challenge of shifting our economies from fossil fuels to clean energy sources, recent headlines from Europe have made alarming reading.
In September, after five months of fierce controversy, Germany’s ruling coalition managed to pass a law banning new gas boilers in homes and beginning a phase-out of existing ones. Yet public protests and likely electoral setbacks in some parts of the country have forced the government to soften the new law.
That same month, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also delayed bans on gas boilers, along with new petrol and diesel cars. Climate activists like Al Gore were dismayed, but Sunak said: “If we continue down this path, we risk losing the consent of the British people” (for net zero policies).
And in 2018 the French government scrapped a proposed fuel tax increase after fierce protests from the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) demonstrators.
These conflicts all show that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 requires not only technology and policy changes but an understanding of the human element – the individuals, workers and communities whose lives will be profoundly affected by these changes.
To transform our energy system, all of us will need to join forces to make fundamental changes in our lifestyles. But these changes cannot fall on everyone in the same way; they must be in line with what is called a “just transition”.
The notion of a “just transition” emerged from the US labour movement in the 1980s as a means to shield workers from the impact of new pollution regulations that potentially threatened their jobs. Today, it has gained prominence as a fundamental principle for achieving climate goals.
The concept proposes a comprehensive approach that ensures a fair distribution of both the benefits and burdens of any significant economic transition. Properly implemented, it enables governments and other stakeholders to avoid a backlash from the wider population as they seek to enact sweeping and necessary change.
The risk of such a backlash is real. Uncomfortable realities about the fairness of proposed solutions to climate change are emerging. London’s recent expansion of its ultra-low emissions zone to encompass all the city’s boroughs provoked strong protests.
Media coverage pitted supporters of the initiative against drivers from low socio-economic backgrounds who struggle to afford low-emissions vehicles and face paying penalties for older, high-emitting cars.
Public discourse concerning the energy transition typically centres around the energy trilemma: ensuring a secure energy supply, reducing carbon emissions, and keeping prices affordable for consumers. Yet vital distributional and equity aspects both between and within nations are far less often addressed.
The problem is made worse by the rising cost of living, which falls harder on low-income households. In Australia, large- and small-scale energy policies have driven up network costs associated with renewable investments. Low-income households now spend twice the amount of their disposable income on energy than average-income households do. An increasing number of households are falling into energy debt as they are unable to pay their energy bills.
What’s more, research shows that households without access to solar power, many of whom are on low incomes, largely fund government-backed renewable energy programs, since the costs of funding these programs are distributed through energy bills.
In these programs, governments assure renewable energy developers a fixed energy price to secure their support to provide renewable energy. Consumers who can afford to install solar get cheap power; those who cannot are left paying the difference in their bills.
These pressures help to explain why trust in the energy sector has eroded. The sector needs to put people and communities first in the delivery of products and services.
Australia’s task in ensuring a just transition is not easy, when policymakers already have much to do to deliver an integrated climate and energy policy. While our effort on climate change compared to other countries has improved on last year, it still ranks 55th in the Climate Change Performance Index, below the USA and China, and its performance is categorised as “very low”.
One risk is that as Australia falls behind other countries in its energy transition, if it were to suddenly accelerate its net zero ambitions to keep up with the pace of change elsewhere, it could lose sight of the transition costs imposed on different groups.
For example, to-date mining workers have borne the brunt of costs associated with the transition to renewable energy. Areas with recently closed coal-fired power stations have experienced an average increase in their unemployment rate of around 0.7%, holding other factors constant. Hardest hit have been regions heavily reliant on coal mining and coal-based power generation, such as Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, and Queensland’s Mackay and Fitzroy regions.
People in these areas around the world need plans that help them to learn new skills and find new jobs, and encourage new ways to start businesses and make money. Without such alternatives, people often struggle not only to find jobs and pay bills but to sustain their physical and mental health.
Governments can reduce the risk climate change poses to their security and reputation by conducting an honest accounting of how green policies affect people’s wallets. They need to be brave and release information on the less visible aspects of the transition, such as rising unemployment in areas traditionally reliant on coal, and higher energy prices for those who rely on grid energy.
The race against time to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 makes the concept of a “just transition” not a far-fetched dream but a dire necessity. Only by addressing the financial and fairness concerns of hard-pressed individuals, workers, and communities is Australia’s journey to a net-zero future assured.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/17/monash-researchers-achieve-lithium-sulphur-battery-breakthrough/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 17, 2023",Monash researchers achieve lithium-sulphur battery breakthrough,"A team of researchers from Monash University’s Faculty of Engineering have developed a new lithium-sulphur (Li-S) battery design featuring a nanoporous polymer-coated lithium foil anode that “significantly” improves the number of times the battery can be cycled.
Lead researcher Declan McNamara said when compared with similar coated lithium anode systems, the polymer coating cell has exhibited outstanding performance across a range of metrics.
“This coating is a step towards highly efficient, easily manufactured Li-S batteries,” he said.
Li-S battery technology continues to prove popular among researchers and commercial developers, with the potential for the metallic lithium and sulphur combination to deliver more energy per gram than lithium-ion batteries.
The technology does however have its limitations. Typically, Li-S batteries contain a lithium anode (negative electrode) and sulphur cathode (positive electrode) with a separating layer. When the battery charges and discharges, the lithium and sulphur react which leads to the formation of polysulfides, rapidly reducing the battery performance.
“Metallic lithium is a bit of a double-edged sword,” McNamara said. “Lithium is packed full of energy, but in a bad battery, this energy is wasted on side reactions. On the other hand, if the energy is channelled correctly, it can make some incredible energy storage devices that are easier to make.”
In this new battery configuration, the researchers at Monash have coated a lithium foil anode with a nanoporous polymer which they say allows the lithium ions to move through while protecting the anode from corrosive sulphur compounds.
“The polymer contains tiny holes less than a nanometre in size, one billionth of a metre, which allow lithium ions to move freely while blocking other chemicals that would attack the lithium,” McNamara said. “The coating also acts as a scaffold for lithium, and helps it charge and discharge repeatedly.”

In their paper, the researchers say the polymer coated anode had exhibited improved capacity retention over 275 cycles, adding that the new design reduces the amount of lithium required in a single battery and does not require nickel or cobalt, removing the need for minerals that have a significant environmental and social cost.
Mainak Majumder, from Monash’s Faculty of Engineering, said these developments are promising steps towards more widespread adoption of Li-S batteries and other lithium metal-based energy storage systems.
“The study establishes a new framework to protect Li-metal from rapid decay or catastrophic failure which has been an Achilles heel for Li-S batteries,” he said.

The NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap calls for at least 12 GW of additional renewable energy generation backed up by 2 GW of new long-duration storage by 2030, helping to replace capacity lost as the National Electricity Market transitions from predominantly coal-fired power to renewables.
CEFC Chief Executive Officer Ian Learmonth said the investment, the first to be finalised through the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund, would underpin investment in regional NSW and pave the way for substantial new flows of clean energy in the state.
“Rebuilding our energy system is a large and complex task, with infrastructure projects requiring considerable capital, expertise and time to bring online,” he said.
“As a specialist financier, we are able to use our capital to support investment flows through to project delivery and revenue generation, providing confidence to the market and private sector investors.”
The Rewiring the Nation fund is a centrepiece of the federal government’s climate change targets, which include 82% of energy in the grid from renewable sources by the end of the decade as part of its legislated target of a 43% reduction in 2005-level emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
The CEFC, which has estimated an additional 29 GW of large-scale renewable generation will need to be installed by the end of the decade in order to reach the national renewable energy and emissions goals, has been tasked with assessing potential projects and distributing money to states and territories.
It has already allocated billions to support major transmission projects and infrastructure builds in Western Australia, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania, but this $100 million commitment is the first investment to be finalised.
The CEFC said its investment priorities under the Rewiring the Nation fund include transmission (including Integrated System Plan projects), distribution network (including distributed energy resources) and long-duration storage projects.
“Other opportunities may include projects which reduce emissions and support or strengthen the security, reliability and affordability of Australia’s electricity grids, including demand management projects,” it said.

They claim it can achieve a steady-state power conversion efficiency of 25.1%.
They said they tried to overcome shunting, which is a typical issue when scaling up perovskite solar technologies from small-area cells to large-area devices. “Shunts” in PV cells create alternate pathways for a solar-generated charge, leading to power losses. Reduced shunt resistance is associated with multiple forms of module degradation and failure, including hotspots and potential-induced degradation.
The scientists built the 24 cm2 tandem cell with a lithium fluoride (LF) interlayer placed at the interface between a hole transport layer (HTL) made of poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and a wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite absorber. This interlayer is the key element that reportedly improves physical contact at the buried interface and mitigates shunting. The deposited the PTAA and WBG perovskite layers through blade coating.
“Sub-optimal interface contact with substantial voids could act as shunting pathways,” the scientists said. “A LiF interlayer was found to avoid the formation of interfacial voids, which is one possible reason for the reduced shunting of etched tandems with a LiF interlayer.”
The researchers deposited the other layers of the tandem cell by sputtering, thermal evaporation, and atomic layer deposition (ALD).
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the 24 cm2 tandem cell showed an efficiency of 25.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.89 V, a short-circuit current density of 18.1 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 0.736.
“This is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most efficient two-terminal tandem devices reported in the literature with areas of over 10 cm2,” the researchers said.
They introduced the tandem cell technology in “Shunt mitigation toward efficient large-area perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells,” which was recently published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
“The strategy developed here is valuable for developing efficient, reproducible, and large-scale perovskite-silicon tandems,” the scientists said.

Solar energy continues to attract more funding as the world moves along the transition from fossil fuels to renewable and emissions-free energy. This year, through nine months, over $45.5 billion in venture capital, public market, and debt financing was invested in the solar industry worldwide.
United States-based technology firm Mercom Capital Group reported that this level of funding represents a 55% growth over the first nine months of 2022, which totaled $29.48 (USD 18.7 billion). The number of deals decreased 5%, according to the report, but the 124 deals inked thus far in 2023 represented a significant leap in capital injection over last year.
“Despite inflationary challenges, financing in the solar industry has remained robust through the first three quarters of 2023 thanks to a strong global push toward decarbonization and substantial incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act,” remarked Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer, Mercom Capital Group. “M&A activity, on the other hand, has faced adverse effects, especially in the realm of project acquisitions, due to increased due diligence, higher costs, delays, and a tight labor market.”

Through nine months of 2023, venture capital (VC) funding activity rose 4% year-over-year, with $8.99 billion across 51 deals, said the Mercom report. Solar downstream companies led activity in this area, closing 28 deals worth $4.41 billion over the period.
The largest VC deals included $742.5 million raised by 1KOMMA5°, $674.7 million raised by Enfinity Global, $591.2 million raised by Silicon Ranch, $567.5 million raised by CleanMax, and $551.7 million raised by Juniper Green Energy.
Public market financing over the report period reached $11.35 billion across 19 deals, a 47% leap year-over-year.
Debt financing had the most robust growth, totaling $25.22 billion over 54 deals, an impressive 93% growth over 2022 first-nine-month totals.
Securitization deals totaled $5.04 billion over the first nine months of 2023, increasing 39% year-over-year.
Over the report period 75 solar merger and acquisition transactions occurred, representing a pullback from the 90 deals struck over that period in 2022. The largest transaction was Brookfield Renewable’s acquisition of Duke Energy’s unregulated utility-scale renewables business, which was valued at $4.41 billion.
Over 31.6 GW of projects were acquired through the first three quarters this year, a significant increase over the 52.1 GW acquired through three quarters in 2022.
“Project developers and independent power producers (IPPs) were the most active acquirers of solar projects in Q3 2023, picking up 2 GW, followed by insurance companies, pension funds, energy trading companies, industrial conglomerates, and IT firms with a total of 1.6 GW. Investment firms acquired 959 MW; electric utilities acquired 877 MW; and oil and gas companies acquired 759 MW of projects,” said the Mercom Capital report.
