Part of the Public Housing Renewables Program, the trial is one of several sub-projects that make up the ASFG project, a collaborative effort led by the Intyal­heme Cen­tre for Future Ener­gy.
The solar panels and battery systems are to be installed by 14 May 2023 with the trial to produce data and lessons on how various metering types, such as prepayment and post-payment meters, interact with the Alice Springs Virtual Power Plant (VPP).
Switched on late last year, the VPP is one of the simulations, investigations and trials being conducted as part of the ASFG project. Operators are investigating how the orchestration of distributed energy resources can enable higher penetration levels of renewables into the grid while building on system security and stability. The townwide VPP already involves about 50 participants and comprises about 300-400 kW of rooftop PV capacity.
Future Grid Project Director Lyndon Frearson, from Alice Springs engineering firm Ekistica, said the latest trial will ensure that public housing tenants are able to share in the benefits of renewable energy.
“Integrating renewables into public housing and rental properties has proven to have many barriers, both in the NT and around Australia,” he said. “Alice Springs Future Grid has provided a platform to work collaboratively with tenants, Territory Housing, Power and Water Corporation, Jacana Energy and local contractors to find solutions for those barriers.”
The houses for the trial were selected based on the type of prepayment meters used and considerations around existing network constraints. Roof and switchboard conditions, and the degree of shading were also criteria for the suitability of the houses.
NT Energy Minister Selena Uibo the trial will help inform the design and delivery of future public housing stock with the integration of renewable energy crucial to the development and delivery of the Territory government’s renewable energy targets.
“We know lessons learnt through this public housing solar and battery trial will help inform planning around future public housing builds and management of solar power on the current stock,” she said.
“By investing in rooftop solar systems, we can make a material difference to the lives of public housing tenants who will benefit from a reduction in their power bills, while also generating clean energy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/04/bowen-says-budget-will-back-energy-storage-investment-mechanism/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 4, 2023",Bowen says Budget will back energy storage investment mechanism,"Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen has confirmed the government’s commitment to a capacity investment mechanism that is predicted will drive at least $10 billion of investment in large-scale energy storage projects that are “both renewable and dispatchable.”
Australia’s federal, state and territory energy ministers in December signed off on a Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) to incentivise new investment in renewable energy generation backed by batteries, pumped hydro and other long-duration storage technologies to support reliability and security as the energy market transitions away from fossil fuels.
Speaking at the Smart Energy Conference in Sydney on Wednesday, Bowen indicated there will be financial support for the capacity investment mechanism in next week’s Federal Budget, with the first auctions under the scheme to begin later this year.
“I’m pleased to have had very productive conversations with state ministers who will be first cabs off the rank in terms of the rollout of the capacity investment mechanism,” he said.
“It will be conducted jurisdiction by jurisdiction. And later this year we’ll be beginning with the first auctions under the capacity investment mechanism.
“We’ve agreed with the states involved as to which they’ll be and how it will work. I look forward to providing further updates, and there will be important measures in the Budget to support that as well.”
Bowen said the CIS is “absolutely essential” to delivering on the government’s ambition to increase renewable energy to 82% of the nation’s electricity supply by 2030.
“The capacity investment mechanism is key to providing that stable and certain environment for investment in dispatchable renewable energy,” he said.
“By insisting that investments under the capacity investment scheme will be both renewable and dispatchable – it can’t be one or the other, you’ve got to be both – we are ensuring that the investment occurs in the storage which is so necessary.”
The Federal Budget, to be delivered on 9 May, 2023, will also include $314 million in tax breaks for small and medium-size businesses that invest in electrification and more sustainable and efficient energy systems, including solar and battery energy storage, during the 2023-24 financial year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/04/iea-tips-australias-outstanding-solar-economics-to-drive-rooftop-growth/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 4, 2023",IEA tips Australia’s ‘outstanding’ solar economics to drive rooftop growth,"While Australia remains in the top 10 for both new PV installs and total market, the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) latest Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (PVPS) report shows that there was a “pull back” last year with early estimates indicating close to 4 GW of solar was installed, down on the 5 GW deployed in 2021.
The state of the Australian PV market has been detailed in the IEA’s PVPS Annual Report 2022 which reveals that a cumulative 29.7 GW of PV and at least 3.36 million rooftop solar systems have been installed in Australia.
The IEA said Australia remains in the top 10 for both new installs and total market. Australia was ranked 9th for annual installation capacity with 3.9 GW and 6th overall for cumulative capacity.
Australia also remains in the top 10 countries with highest PV penetration, ranking 5th with 15.7%, and ranks No.1 in the world for installed solar per capita with 1,166 watts per person. Australia leads the way from the Netherlands, with 1,040 watts installed PV capacity per person and Germany with 807 watts per person.
While still showing strong volumes, the report notes that PV installations in Australia contracted slightly in 2022, dropping 1.1 GW on the 5 GW installed in 2021.
The IEA attributed the contraction to supply chain issues and investment lags and said it expected these issues to be resolved in 2023, suggesting the market landscape in Australia is paving the way for an increased rollout of rooftop solar, particularly commercial PV deployment.
“The economic fundamentals for residential and commercial PV are outstanding,” the agency said. “Australia’s high electricity prices and inexpensive PV systems means payback can commonly be achieved in 3-5 years.”
“2023 is expected to see stability in rooftop solar – with some growth in commercial and industrial installations.”
The IEA’s positive outlook comes in spite of its latest report showing that the average price for a residential solar PV system increased in 2022 to more than $1.10 per watt after subsidies, or about $1.55 per watt on average without a subsidy. In 2021, the average price for a residential system was less than $1 per watt after subsidies, or about $1.50 per watt without subsidy.
The report also reveals that the average system size in the sub-100 kW market grew further to over 9 kW per system in 2022, a trend the IEA said “reflects both the growth in commercial installations, and the growth in the typical size of residential systems, as householders prepare their homes for future addition of batteries and electric vehicles.”
While the IEA is upbeat about the rooftop solar sector, it said the residential storage market also remained strong with more than 19,000 new batteries installed with small-scale solar systems in 2022, increasing the total number of batteries installed to upwards of 60,000 by the end of the year.
The IEA said the Australian storage market remains “favourably viewed” by overseas battery and inverter manufacturers due to its high electricity prices, low feed-in tariffs, excellent solar resource, and the large uptake of residential PV.
The IEA said interest in large-scale solar also remains strong. The agency said although investors continue to have to navigate “regulatory challenges and transmission limitations”, 1.7 GW of new larger-scale solar was added to the systems in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/04/solar-assets-are-underperforming-expectations-by-8-what-is-the-root-cause/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MAY 4, 2023","Solar assets are underperforming expectations by 8%, what is the root cause?","Each year, the United States-based Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) releases its PV Module Index, tracking the latest trends in solar module quality, performance, reliability, and emergent technologies.
The latest annual report, PV Module Index 2022 opens with remarks about the rise of TOPCon solar modules, a technology increasingly being adopted by major panel suppliers.
TOPCon was first demonstrated at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in 2013 and is now gaining market traction and acceptance.
The technology is comprised of n-type PV cells with passivating contacts. The modules have strong surface passivation and effective carrier transport, both of which contribute to a strong open-circuit voltage and high efficiency. The shift to TOPCon comes as p-type passivated emitter and rear-contact cell (PERC) modules begin to reach their theoretical efficiency limits.
RETC said this boost in efficiency has made TOPCon “the buzziest word in solar.”
The report noted that while Longi is “betting big” on p-type TOPCon, many other leading module companies, like JinkoSolar, Jollywood, JA Solar and Trina Solar are making significant investments in modules with n-type TOPCon cell designs. 
“Via higher open-circuit voltage values, you can achieve higher efficiencies and power ratings. In and of itself, that is likely going to move manufacturers to n-type TOPCon cell designs, as soon as they can get there,” said Kenneth Sauer, principal engineer, VDE Americas.
RETC said due to manufacturing complexities, high-efficiency n-type cells using heterojunction technology (HJT) and interdigitated back contact (IBC) cells are relatively expensive to produce and remain a niche part of the market. By comparison, n-type TOPCon cell production is very similar to the PERC manufacturing process, making for an easier transition from existing manufacturing lines.
“Though today’s n-type TOPCon modules cost slightly more to produce on a per-watt basis than p-type mono PERC modules, the efficiency gains result in a lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in large-scale field deployments. Best of all, leading experts expect n-type TOPCon to benefit from an accelerated learning curve,” said the report.
However, as with any emergent technology, the report notes that moving towards TOPCon may carry some risk. While n-type TOPCon PV cells have proven resilient to light-induced degradation and light and elevated temperature-induced degradation, some evidence exists of susceptibility to ultraviolet-induced degradation (UVID), which could chip away at module longevity.
Researchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have documented front- and back-side power loss from these technologies. The data does not point to a single degradation mechanism but suggest that different cell designs degrade via different pathways, said the report.
“We’re not trying to sound an alarm for no reason,” said Cherif Kedir, chief executive officer at RETC. “We just want to test the potential for UV degradation to educate ourselves and the industry. If there’s no problem, we can all move forward with our lives.”
Kedir recommends module makers conduct accelerated UVID testing as part of a technical due diligence survey. If cell passivation layers are improperly tuned, they can break down under this exposure. He recommends evaluating each new cell design on a case-by-case basis.
“If there is a problem, we will publish a report so that the industry can get out in front of the issue,” he said.

In the paper “A review of solar hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors and systems,” published in Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, the scientists explained that PVT technologies may show strong potential in urban environments, which traditionally have both thermal and electrical energy demands while offering limited space for deployment.
Crucial for PVT system development will be trade-offs between heat and electricity generation, depending on different applications and environmental conditions.
“This introduces challenges for the design and operation of PV-T collectors, and solutions to overcome this conflict have been proposed, for example, through spectral splitting, amongst others,” the researchers specified.
In their work, they covered previous experimental and computational studies, identified performance enhancement opportunities, and analysed the implications of widespread deployment at the solar-generation system level.
“Specifically, we first proceed to classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air-water, heat-pipe, building-integrated and CPV-T collectors,” they said. “This is followed by a presentation of techno-economic performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids.”
Their review includes conventional PV-T collectors, air-based systems, liquid-based installations, water-based collectors, refrigerant-based systems, heat-pipe-based technologies, dual air-water systems, building-integrated PVT arrays, and concentrated PVT collectors.
Their analysis also includes possible collector modification designs, PVT configurations for glazing, novel thermal absorber technologies, and the use of phase-change materials (PCMs) and aerogels. Furthermore, it explains how new technologies such as tandem solar cells, selective coatings, spectral splitting, dichroic mirrors/filters, holographics, luminescent splitters/concentrators, nanofluids, or heat transfer and optical absorption techs may be integrated into PVT systems.
The study also provides a final overview of all conclusions drawn by the group and a series of recommendations for future further adoption of PVT technologies. Looking forward, they said more studies on the long-term operation of PV-T systems to assess the long-term reliability of PV-T collectors are strongly needed, as well as system cost assessments and certification rules for PV-T collectors.
The research group included scientists from the Imperial College London and the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, the Zhejiang University in China, Boise State University in the United States, the Cyprus University of Technology, and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia.
