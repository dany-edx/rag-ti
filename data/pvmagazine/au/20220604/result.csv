The Siemens result isn’t a surprise because if you look at the actual deployment of renewable energy, then Southeast Asia is a laggard. However, I think that we can now finally detect very clear winds of change. I will take you through a quick tour of the region to explain that a bit further.
Starting with the richest country in Southeast Asia, Singapore. In October 2021, Singapore issued a request for proposal (RfP) for companies to tender to supply it with renewable energy and stated its goal that at least 30% of its electricity supply should come from renewables by 2035, while releasing expert studies that its power sector can go net zero by 2050. That is seismic change in the positioning of Singapore in terms of renewable energy. Previously, Singapore was always saying that it didn’t have space [for renewable energy], because it is a small country. Now it has moved decisively to rely on renewable energy nonetheless and issue an RfP to developers to build that capacity around Singapore and then export it to Singapore.
Vietnam, as you know, has already been at the vanguard because it achieved a record-speed deployment of renewable energy in 2019/20/21 – and Vietnam is now up there with the best of the world in terms of what it is doing on renewables.
The Philippines is also in very good shape because it has legally binding Renewable Portfolio Standard obligations imposed on the utilities. These force the utilities over time to increase their renewable energy percentage. So, when we talk about Southeast Asia, I think that Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines are now in line with the most progressive countries on renewable energy.
In terms of the big markets, there is Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. I would say in all three cases we are seeing clear movement as well, although there are no overarching nor ambitious goals that have been announced. Indonesia has had a goal for a while, but it is not delivering on it on the ground – however, we do see things changing at the developer level across the country. In Thailand we see developers gearing up for a change in the posture of the regulator. And Malaysia has been making some progress on renewables.
We should layer into this what is going on in the gas markets. A lot of these countries are highly dependent on gas. For example, 95% of Singapore’s electricity is powered by natural gas. A large proportion [of electricity generation] is similarly dependent on gas, such as in Thailand. With gas multiplying in price by anywhere between a factor of two and 10, it is very clear that people are taking another look at the sun and the wind. I expect all of these countries to ramp up their efforts because of the volatility in the gas markets, on which a lot of them are dependent. Out of all these countries, only Indonesia is energy independent.
That’s correct and strengthens the argument: The volatility of supply and price of natural gas is a reality all of ASEAN are aware of today and thinking through.

I think you have to ask some of the developers who were bidding to find out more. But the short of it is that Myanmar became unbankable, and it doesn’t have anything to do with renewable energy itself, but because of political risk. But I should note that even TotalEnergies stopped investing in fossil fuels in Myanmar. And if Total, which is notorious for investing in all sorts of high-risk projects and countries, is not investing in Myanmar, then I am not sure that renewables has anything to do with that conversation at all.
It is encouraging! And a lot of people have been working closely with the Indonesian government, effectively nudging them forward but also counteracting a lot of the propaganda that comes from the coal industry against renewables.
Activity on the ground doesn’t lie, and what we do see is small Indonesian renewable energy developers popping up all over the place and starting to develop deals, in a way that we were not seeing even a year ago. That is a very good sign because it means that the country is communicating that it is turning the corner on renewables. Usually, you need to watch what the locals are doing to get an inkling as to what the trend might be. That certainly was not the case a year ago. So, the IEA and everyone else working with the government helps, because it helps set the direction of travel.
Personally, I think it is neutral. If we contrast Vietnam with Indonesia, both have the same type of setup. You have PLN in Indonesia and EVN in Vietnam and both have monopoly positions. However, Vietnam built renewables at the fastest pace globally for a couple of years, while Indonesia did nothing. So, it is not just about the structure of your utility system for the installation of renewable energy. But there are also liberalised energy markets that work better than others. It is certainly one factor, but it is neither the leading factor nor the least important.
Much more importantly, it is about political will. What we need in Indonesia is to have the political will to make that decisive turn to renewables, so that the monopoly government owned utility gets with the program. It is not going to do it of itself and on its own for precisely the reasons that you mentioned.
And from Vietnam, can we deduce that when given the right signals in terms of the adoption of renewables, that things can move very quickly?
Yes we can. All it took in Vietnam was political will and a determination to accelerate renewable energy deployment. Then, it happened, very fast, because renewable energy is cheaper and cleaner and preferred by local communities.

Line Hydrogen wants to replace the more than 80 million litres of diesel Australians consumed daily in 2021 with green hydrogen. To do this the startup must become one of Australia’s early commercial scale green hydrogen producers for domestic diesel replacement. 
Line Hydrogen is launching its inaugural $100 million green hydrogen project in the growing hub of Bell Bay in Tasmania’s north. The aim of the project is to produce 1,500 kg of green hydrogen daily for offtake by heavy haulage transport, particularly in the mining industry. 
The company is also planning a $200 million project in Southern Queensland’s Toowoomba. 
In April 2022, Line Hydrogen partnered with Victoria-based Climate Capital with plans to source the renewable energy necessary for hydrogen electrolysis from Climate Capital’s planned 5 MW ground-mounted solar farm in George Town, Tasmania. 
According to founder and chairman Brendan James, the reason Line Hydrogen is seeking crowdfunded investment rather than the traditional institutional investment is to let community investors to get in on the ground floor as the hydrogen market takes off.

Why now? 
Troubled by the over-dependence on diesel in industry, particularly resulting from poor grid access in rural areas, James says Line Hydrogen was started as a solution to “make processing projects sustainable in a climate changing world, and protect ourselves from global oil shocks going forward.”
In a webinar with Birchal in May 2022, James recalled starting the company at the same time as Russia annexed Crimea, and a resultant oil crisis ensued. Seven years later, the world is in the grip of another energy crisis due to Russian aggression against Ukraine, and global energy prices have skyrocketed for any nation with oil and gas dependency. 
Perhaps the crucial change in those seven years has been the continuing decline in the cost of renewables. James described co-location of green hydrogen production plants as strategically integral. 
“The project will be located on 10 ha of land owned by Climate Capital for up to 7.9 MW of behind-the-meter DC power. Climate Capital also have an option over an adjacent 30 ha that will allow the project to scale up to 40 MW in coming years.

Government support
Line Hydrogen has already received the support of the new federal Labor government, which has pledged $5 million in funding as part of its Tasmanian funding initiatives. 
On May 7, now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said hydrogen has “enormous potential, and over time Line could build at least five hydrogen refuelling stations in Tasmania, creating jobs right across the state.” 
“We need to take action now,” says James. “The new government has made it clear that Australian hydrogen should be produced by Australian companies for all Australians, and now is the time for all Australians to have a say in our green future.” 
Crowdfunding campaign 
Line Hydrogen is welcoming Australians to support the company with investments starting at $250. The company has already received expressions of interest in recents weeks from over 1,000 people. 
“Our mission is to be Australia’s leading new energy producer,” continued James, “integrating both the production and end-use market demand by delivering near-term commercial-scale green hydrogen. We aim to achieve these by providing cost-competitive hydrogen supply, while facilitating and engineering end-use market demand.” 
The crowdfunding campaign has already received funds from 419 investors totalling $998,910. 
Line Hydrogen is targeting full production by mid-2023.
