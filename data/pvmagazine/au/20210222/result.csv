The Commission became involved in the determination because more than 50 ‘unique’ public objections to the project were received.
At an electronically conducted public meeting in January, the community of the Yass Valley Shire voiced concerns which reiterated written submissions around land use compatibility, visual impacts of the 190 hectare (470 acre) solar farm; biodiversity; traffic impacts during construction; and land values and other economic impacts.
On the whole, the Commission came to the decision that the Project, which will provide enough renewable energy to power the equivalent of 37,000 homes “is in the public interest”.
The IPC’s Statement of Reasons for Decisions says, “on balance… the impacts are acceptable and capable of being appropriately mitigated through the measures required under the conditions of consent imposed by the Commission”.
Those conditions include setback and vegetation screening requirements that will minimise visual impacts on nearby residents — the solar farm comprises four large and two small solar fields distributed across two pieces of land bordering Tallagandra Lane on the outskirts of the village of Sutton.
RES is also required to establish and manage a 60-hectare conservation area for the Gold Sun Moth; and to take measures to protect the habitat of the Superb Parrot and the Legless Lizard — in all, a marvellous diversity of creatures common to the area, which warrant conservation efforts.
A global, UK-based, renewable energy developer with more than 19 GW of projects to its name, RES acquired the locally contested project from Australian company Renew Estate, in April last year.
CEO of RES in Australia, Matt Rebbeck, said at the time, “Developing new clean energy projects can be challenging and the RES project team is able to leverage our significant experience gained in Australia to see this project through development and into construction.” 
The solar farm site appeared to be well situated, on land that has historically been used for cattle grazing, and which retains little native vegetation.
As a renewable-energy proposition, it has that critical component of close proximity to the 132 kV grid network, with available capacity to connect.
Simon Currie, a director at Renew Estate is an advocate of community engagement and benefit sharing throughout the development of renewable projects, as is RES, which Rebbeck has emphasised is “committed to sourcing both jobs and materials locally where feasible, enhancing an increased demand for local services such as accommodation and food services”.

A number of movements and initiatives throughout Australia suggest there is a community appetite for still greater direct engagement with and equity holding in renewable-energy developments.
Independent MP, Helen Haines, for example, is today introducing a Bill to Federal Parliament that would support community development of renewable projects of all sizes, with technical advice and grant funding; and which would require large renewable projects to make 20% equity available to local potential investors.
She told ABC Radio National this morning that her Local Power Agency Bill,  which requires $483 million in Government funding, is designed to address the fact that, “Right now, every major solar farm and wind project is in regional Australia, but what we don’t see is those local communities having direct buy in.”
RES was not available for comment today on a revised timeline for Springdale now that IPC conditional approval has been received, but the project is expected to generate 200 jobs during construction with a further five positions ongoing over the lifetime of the project, and a $100,000 locally managed Community Benefit Fund will also kick in at commencement of construction.
The company’s 2 GW of renewable-energy projects in Australia includes the now Lighthouse-owned 72 MW Emerald Solar Park in Queensland, for which RES continues to provide asset-management services; the 200 MW proposed Avonlie Solar Farm near Narrandera in NSW, which is expected to begin construction later this year; and the 176 MW Pallamana Solar Farm incorporating battery storage and located north west of Murray Bridge in South Australia, which is expected to be operational in mid 2022.

Haines argued on ABC Radio National this morning that although new renewable projects are being built “at a lightning pace in Australia” and almost all are based in regional Australia, local communities often miss out on the full economic potential of those investments.
The Member for Indi said that the current methods of funding, including investments made by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) have proven highly effective in propagating Australia’s renewable energy boom, but tend to favour larger corporations and investors, “We don’t see those local communities having direct buy in; they’re inactive bystanders, mostly passive consumers of energy.”
The Australian Local Power Agency would enable community participation and ownership or part ownership of projects via three avenues:
Asked by ABC Radio host Fran Kelly on RN Breakfast this morning whether there was interest from the Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor in her proposal, Haines said she had spoken with both men and “They’re really interested in what I’ve put forward.”
Importantly, she said she is also rallying the support of her colleagues across the parliament, particularly regional MPs: “I’ve said to them, as regional MPs we need to find new ways to develop regional Australia. Right here in front of us is this renewable energy boom. We need to be part of the action, make sure that our local communities really see the benefit.”
Haines has previously expressed her dismay and frustration at the Federal National Party pushing legislation to underwrite new coal and gas projects. “My Bill would extend that same underwriting support to locally owned renewables projects,” she said.
The Bill itself has been developed out of Haines’ Local Power Plan, launched in September last year after consultation with communities and energy experts, including Juliette Millbank of Totally Renewable Yackandandah, Ben McGowan from Indigo Power, and Marnie Shaw, a Research Leader in the Battery Storage and Integration Program at the Australian National University.
Haines says there are already more than 100 community energy groups in Australia, “and 13 in my electorate”, many of whom were represented in the Local Power Plan.
Surf Coast Energy Group in Torquay, for example, was quoted in the Plan as saying, “Renewable energy will play a key role in the resilience of our community as it responds to converging crises in ecology, economy, equity and energy.”
The North East Track Local Learning and Employment Network in Wangaratta, expressed the conviction that establishing regional renewable-energy development support hubs woud “also provide information and resources for young people to learn about the career opportunities in the renewables sector”.
“Renewable energy provides jobs and career paths to depressed rural communities,” said the Manilla Community Renewable Energy Group, which added that renewable projects are “Essential in providing jobs and training in rural Australia. It’s an activity for the benefit of the community and it gives people a feeling of control over their future.”
Haines’ broad vision for the agency is to establish a potential “sunbelt of 10,000 locally owned renewable power stations stretching from Esperance to Carpentaria bringing … an infinite supply of cheap, clean local power to regional Australia”, as the Local Power Plan’s website describes it.
Her legislation tabled today is expected to be seconded by Zali Steggall, independent MP for Warringah, who last year proposed a Climate Change Act that would see Australia commit to a zero emissions target by 2050, and the establishment of an independent Climate Change Commission to advise government and monitor progress towards that goal.
Haines has said that the new agency could use its proposed budget to support more than $4 billion of new clean energy investment over the coming ten years, while providing measurable outcomes in rebuilding and re-energising local communities.

“Hybrid power solutions offer the potential to significantly reduce the amount of fossil fuel power generation within the Kakadu National Park, said Dave Manning, juwi’s Global Head of Hybrid in a statement on Friday.
Renewable energy offers a power source more suited to both the aspirations of the local Indigenous community to develop the town as a culturally appropriate centre for tourism, and the commitment of the NT Government to attain 50% power generation from renewables by 2030.
Jabiru’s new hybrid power system consists of 3.9 MW of solar, a 3 MW/5MWh battery and 4.5 MW diesel capability, and will deliver at least 50% renewable generation to the township.
The integrated hybrid plant will be owned and operated by EDL, and construction is scheduled to commence shortly, with the expectation that the diesel power station will be up and running by the end of this year, and the solar farm and battery will exert their green influence by early 2022.
In December 2020, the NT Government paved the way for the town’s electricity network to receive and distribute energy from the new plant, with $10 million worth of upgrades as part of a $135.5 million investment in Jabiru, which it said at the time was “pivotal” in establishing the township as a “vibrant cultural centre” of the West Arnhem region.
“Jabiru has the potential to be a real drawcard for Territorians and visitors alike,” said Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner, who added that his government’s “ongoing investment in critical services and infrastructure is helping the township get there, to ensure it prospers sustainably for years to come.”
For juwi, this is its sixth project either delivered or under construction in Australia, and builds on the early success of its landmark DeGrussa project, a 10.6 MW solar array, plus 6 MWh battery, integrated with existing diesel generation to supply Sandfire’s copper and gold mine site in Western Australia. It became fully operational in 2016, and at the time was the world’s largest diesel-solar hybrid system, and the largest off-grid PV system in Australia.
Juwi has become a specialist in developing hybrid power plants for non-grid-connected industries such as mining, using its juwi Hybrid IQ software to intelligently integrate system components into existing islanded networks.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/22/silver-renewable-lining-to-abras-rich-new-silver-mining-project-in-wa/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"FEBRUARY 22, 2021",Silver renewable lining to Abra’s rich new silver mining project in WA,"Within months of exploration that confirmed the wider influence of its “best high-grade lead-silver drill-hole ever”, Abra Mining has entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Contract Power Australia that will likely lead to construction and operation of a hybrid power plant at the Abra Base Metals Project between Newman and Meekathara in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia.
Subject to Abra Mining Proprietary Limited proceeding to final investment decision for the Project, Contract Power will build, own and operate the electricity-generation facility which is designed to combine a 6 MW solar array and 2 MW of battery energy storage with a 10 MW natural gas-fired power station and a 900 KI  LNG storage and regasification facility.
Galena Mining, which owns 77.28% of the joint-venture Abra Base Metals project, announced the agreement last week, with Managing Director Alex Molyneux saying that, “Integrating solar with relatively clean natural gas instead of diesel achieves a marked reduction in Abra’s carbon footprint compared to alternatives considered in the tender process.”
Importantly, Contract Power’s design for the power-generation plant “also offered the most cost-effective solution, in line with our feasibility study estimates”, said Molyneux.
The mine is expected to have a 16-year life, producing high-grade lead-silver concentrate, and the PPA is contracted for this period with an option to extend.
Based in Western Australia, Contract Power is wholly owned by Pacific Energy and specialises in design, construction and operation of remote power stations for the mining and government sectors.
Pacific Energy owns and operates a total of around 500 MW of generation capacity across some 40 power stations.
It is currently building the Fortescue Metals Group Solomon Power Station, using 15 Rolls Royce Bergen low-emissions, medium-speed gas generators, and in the past has largely concentrated on gas-fired generation.
However, Contract Power has also recently partnered with Western Australian utility Horizon Power on the Esperance Power Project, which combines a 4.4 MW central solar farm, with two 4.3 MW wind turbines, gas-powered generation, a 5.5 MW battery energy storage system, and high-efficiency gas generation. From 2022 the hybrid generator will provide up to 46% of the coastal community’s annual electricity needs from renewables.
On its website, Contract Power says, “ever increasing requests and desire for reduced running costs” in tandem with “regulation changes for sustainable power products” have led Contract Power to invest time and money on research, development and trialing of new hybrid systems.
In developing the power mix for Abra Base Metals Project, Contract Power’s Managing Director, Leon Hodges, said the company’s “combined LNG and renewables integration capability has allowed our design team to maximise solar penetration as high as the economics and technology allows, providing the Abra project with the highest reliability and lowest cost of power on an unsubsidised basis.” 
The Gascoyne region is already home to the Sandfire Resources DeGrussa copper mine, which exemplifies the benefits of hybridisation, such as savings on diesel fuel, reduction in emissions and reduced noise pollution from diesel generators. And Gold Fields’ Agnew Gold Mine, powered by wind, solar, battery and gas is also loosely in the ‘hood.
These desert flowers, all turning their faces to the sun, form the vanguard of the next wave of renewables to sweep the country.
