The Victorian Government today announced an initiative to consult with the sector on the potential benefits of a Market Facilitation Platform, to help businesses access renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs).
Jessica Venning-Bryan, Chief Customer Officer of Flux Federation, a software-as-a-service provider serving the energy-retail sector, approaches the challenges from a different perspective. She believes that however C&I customers approach their transition to renewable energy, they will need the services of energy retailers, and that retailers must provide new, tailored and flexible services that bridge the gap between businesses’ decarbonisation commitments and achieving a reliable renewable energy supply.
She spoke with pv magazine Australia about the need for technology that enables innovative tariff design and accurate billing across all of a C&I customer’s energy requirements — including reverse flows from their own renewable generation.
 
pv magazine: What are the pain points, the C&I industry is facing in relation to energy supply?
Jessica Venning-Bryan: Anyone with some commercial volume load is really starting to turn their thinking to how they’re going to decarbonise. Australia has seen a lot of really promising commitments from some big companies, like Coca Cola Amatil and Coles supermarkets that have committed to 100% renewables within certain time timeframes. 
They’re good examples of companies that have taken a public stand, but they really only have two ways to achieve that: they either do it via a power purchase agreement PPA with a renewable generator, or they need to do it behind the meter themselves — or a combination of behind-the-meter and purchased green energy.
It can be hard to make progress around getting the right sort of commercial construct for a PPA in place.
Going behind the meter, the investment required to build a plant big enough to meet the load that many C&I customers have is quite significant, and that plant requires maintenance. So the mixed model is probably the most realistic — where you do some of that behind-the-meter generation yourself and then you’re purchasing some of it in the market. 
So these big companies are at an interesting juncture where there’s a lot of public pressure, and their license to operate more broadly is tied up with making a commitment to decarbonise, but the question becomes, “How are we actually going to do it? What makes the most sense?” 
Inevitably, whichever option you take, you still have to have a billing relationship with a retailer of some sort. Most billing software currently used by retailers is not sophisticated enough to accommodate this new world. C&I has always been the poor cousin when it comes to investments in software by the energy sector. 
Why is that, when they can be such a big portion of a retailer’s revenue?
Mainly because they are largely account managed, so they’re very relationship-oriented customers. Mass market customers are much more likely to switch if they have a bad customer experience that can’t be smoothed over; and residential consumers also have different expectations around what service looks like, how they engage with their utility, what their app does. Those services have kind of been put to one side in the CNI sector, but it can no longer work like that. 
The C&I sector now, because of the public commitments they’ve made, are having to come up with ways to both meet their own energy needs, and do it in a way that’s commercially viable, which means they’ll be asking and expecting more from their retailers. Then we come back to this conundrum that exists right across the sector, which is, how does the software that we use to manage our customer relationships, including billing, how does it adapt to these new technologies.
What do you see as the low hanging fruit — industries that could provide great demonstration points for innovative tariffs and perhaps flexible billing?
Any business that has high cooling needs. So, groceries, for example, cold storage, anything dairy, anything that has a very high refrigeration load, because that has to run 24/7. So, there are other industries that are high load but only during the main working hours of the day. Manufacturing is a good example; although some manufacturing plants run 24/7, lots of them just kind of work, either 16/7, or 16/5. Refrigeration is the big one, then manufacturers that do run 24/7, and big data-processing warehouses. Data processing is becoming more and more relevant as technology businesses move into Australasia from other parts of the world and as Australasian technology businesses grow. And of course, you have to address all the companies that have really started to fly the flag for looking at their own energy consumption and their carbon footprint.
When we start thinking about climate change, it’s super important that people are doing their bit at the household level, but huge gains are going to come when these big companies start to decarbonise, and it’s in everybody’s interest to support them to do this. A third of energy demand in Australia comes from the commercial and industrial sector. That’s why Flux Federation and our parent company Meridien Energy [New Zealand’s largest gentailer]  are really interested in this sector because we know it’s been underserved from a technology point of view, and we know that globally humankind has most to gain from making it easy for them to decarbonise.
So, what’s missing in the retailer-C&I-consumer relationship? 
From the retailer point of view, when they have customers that are doing some things behind the meter, but they also have to top up their load, how do you actually juggle those two things? In order for the retailer to have a commercial relationship with the customer that makes sense for both parties, it requires a bit of innovation around how that tariff is designed. If a company has perhaps invested in PV and a battery, there are still challenges around the intermittency of renewables. Bbatteries make that a bit easier to manage, but it doesn’t completely go away, which means in that commercial relationship between the retailer and the customer they need to design a tariff that isn’t time bound but more load oriented. There are lots of different ways you can do that, but you’re automatically into some quite complicated tariff structures.
Our FlexiBill product is a truly flexible interface for retailers to design those tariffs— they can almost have client-based tariffs tailored to the specific needs of a site, which is super important. You’re not going to show up at Coca Cola factory and a Unilever factory, for example and see exactly the same setup with exactly the same demand. They could be in different states, where the weather conditions are different, which means the generation environment is different. 
So really the sector is going to find itself having to be far more bespoke to particular client needs, and they warrant it because they are big consumers, so they’re profitable for retailers. But operationalising a highly bespoke suite of tariffs … it might be fine to do it once for one customer but how do you do it for 1,000 or 3,000 or 5,000 customers. Being able to offer those very bespoke tariffs that are very much designed around the generation portfolio of a particular C&I business, and very much tailored around their particular consumption needs, is where the market needs to go, but they have to have software that enables them to do that and that’s what we offer. 
How can flexible software at the retail level enable more renewable energy uptake?
It’s all around creating a commercial environment that works for everybody who’s participating. We’re not going to see more commercial and industrial grade customers invest in those renewable technologies behind the meter unless they can actually make a business case add up, and being able to make a business case add up depends on what you’re going to be paying for the times when you’re not producing your own energy, and also potentially your ability to export that as well, at a competitive rate. PV-to-grid or EV-to-grid or battery-to-grid; those sorts of flows have to be commercially negotiated between the retailer and the client as well. So, until the retailer can innovate around a particular customer, the customer is very unlikely to find a business case that makes sense for them to invest in renewables, so they’re not going to do it. All the things in the system have to come together in order to get the customers who are consuming energy to invest in renewable technologies.
What level of awareness do you encounter at the energy retail level? 
I’m not sure whether they’re joining the dots between these commitments that are being made in the C&I customer space, and how they can enable them while achieving a commercial outcome for their businesses.
Nobody needs to become a charity [in the name of mitigating climate change]. The system has to make sense for everybody, and retailers provide an important set of services that they should be able to charge for, but they do need to keep up with these emerging changes, and the willingness of some of these big customers to invest, and be able to accommodate that, but also create good outcomes for themselves. 
We see time and again, retailers doing very manual, very labour intensive things to make parts of their operations work with a more modern system. But you just don’t have to do that anymore. There are lots of aspects to the value of investing in a more modern software stack to run your business. I think the thinking is there but I still don’t know that people are really understanding the operational reality for their teams of serving this emerging C&I customer, and some of the bigger questions around decarbonisation, and actually how simple it would be to bridge that gap.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/18/victoria-invites-consultation-on-how-to-make-renewable-energy-more-accessible-to-ci-users/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"OCTOBER 18, 2021",Victoria invites consultation on how to make renewable energy more accessible to C&I users,"The Victorian Government this morning launched a paper for consultation with business owners — commercial and industrial (C&I) energy users —  to understand “how it can facilitate more competitive renewable electricity supply options” for this complex and diverse group. Its proposition is to create a market facilitation platform to provide C&I businesses with easier access to renewable energy contracts such as power purchase agreements, and thereby also facilitate expansion of clean-energy generation in Victoria.
“As we transition to renewable generation and storage, we want to understand the best way to create a more competitive electricity supply for businesses,” said Lily D’Ambrosio, Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change.
The Market Facilitation Platform Consultation Paper comes under the auspices of the Powering Business in Victoria program, which aims to attract and retain industry in the state by providing more competitive electricity prices and thereby boost employment opportunities.
It also has the dual and reciprocal purpose of transitioning businesses to renewable energy options which will stimulate a continued pipeline of renewable energy projects to replace retiring coal generation and mobilise the whole state toward its interim emissions reduction target of 45-50% below 2005 levels by 2030. (Victoria’s Climate Change Act 2017 set a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050.)
The consultation on the value and potential structure of a market facilitation platform, “is an opportunity for everyone including businesses and renewable energy providers to share their perspectives on how to reduce barriers to accessing low-cost, clean electricity”, said D’Ambrosio.
The paper recognises the diversity and variety of electricity needs of C&I businesses, including their level of demand and the times of day at which they have the greatest need for energy.
Installation of rooftop solar for behind-the-meter consumption by businesses is still low in Australia  — 5% of C&I energy consumers have rooftop, compared to around 21% of homes — partly because many businesses don’t have the resources to devote to solar system development, many also don’t own their premises, or have the space or rooftop structure to support solar arrays, or perhaps they don’t have the ability to finance a solar installation for returns that extend over time.
A such, the Market Facilitation Platform Consultation Paper focuses on how to make power purchase agreements (PPAs) more easily accessible to businesses.
The PPA is an agreement between the buyer (typically described as the offtaker) and a renewable energy generator for the provision of electricity, either in a contractual of physical sense, with an agreed pricing structure over a fixed period of time.
For businesses, PPAs provide energy price certainty over the period of the contract; for the developer/generator, they offer certain revenue streams for part or all of the energy they will produce over the lifespan of a project and make it easier to secure finance.
For example BHP earlier this year signed a 10-year contract with Risen Energy’s Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia for 20 MW of electricity to power its Nickel West Kwinana Refinery; and in August, it extended that PPA for a further 30 MW to be directed to BHP Nickel West’s Kalgoorlie Smelter.

Other businesses, or offtakers, may be able to opt for ‘sleeved’ contracts for renewable energy through their retailer; where the retailer enters into a PPA with the renewable generator, and incorporates the PPA energy price into the retail tariff it charges the C&I electricity user.
Although the benefits of PPAs are that they have the potential to make energy more affordable for C&I users, as well as less volatile in cost, and cleaner in line with both business and government sustainability goals, the factors to consider in the purchasing of PPAs can be complex.
The Market Facilitation Platform Consultation Paper summary of barriers to the uptake of PPAs includes:
The Victorian Government proposes that a Market Facilitation Platform, could “share information about new and existing renewable energy projects and facilitate financial and contractual relationships between renewable energy suppliers, C&I electricity users, retailers and investors seeking to enter PPAs” and provide other services such as:

The Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) invites interested parties to respond to the Market Facilitation Platform Consultation Paper by Friday November 26.
The paper itself poses a number of questions that will help businesses in particular formulate a submission. Or participants can choose to fill out a brief survey (at the bottom of this page), responses to which will also inform the state government’s next steps.
DELWP is also holding three online information briefing sessions in October (same content, different times) at which it will provide an overview of the process and the issues, and answer questions.
The state government summarises its Powering Business in Victoria strategy as “leveraging Victoria’s global competitive advantage in renewable energy … to make it easier and more affordable to do business in Victoria” — the more feedback it receives on it’s MFP paper, the more its response will reflect commercial energy users’ true needs.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/18/drones-and-software-loop-the-loop-on-autonomous-intelligent-pv-plant-monitoring/,"INSTALLATIONS,QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"OCTOBER 18, 2021","Drones and software loop the loop on autonomous, intelligent PV plant monitoring","“The thing that really impressed me is how far technology has advanced around PV performance and reliability monitoring,” Dr David Parlevliet, Murdoch University’s Deputy Head of Engineering and Energy, told pv magazine Australia when the in depth report he co-authored on behalf of the Australian PV Institute (APVI), reviewing portable onsite inspection methods for PV was released last week.
The report — Qualification of PV power plants using mobile test equipment — is published by the International Energy Agency’s PV Power Systems Task 13, and incorporates input from participating countries worldwide, with the aim of keeping the PV industry up to date with the latest technologies and best practice for optimising PV performance.

The value of large-scale PV installations relies on the modules performing to their anticipated yield, but the sheer scale of many PV plants today means 100% technical inspection is unfeasible.
“In Australia,” says a statement from the APVI, which partnered with international contributors on the report, “drones play an important part in identifying underperforming power plants.”
pv magazine Australia recently reported, for example on South Australian utility SA Water’s decision to contract UK aerial solar inspection and data analysis company, Above, to monitor the performance of its 370,000 solar panels deployed over 33 separate sites as part of utility’s  Zero Cost Energy Future Initiative.
Rapid advances in infrared inspection using drones mean aerial surveillance now provides a clear overview of the operational status of installed PV arrays, as well as identifying specific PV strings or modules for further detailed analysis using mobile PV test centres, writes the APVI.
Importantly, says the report, the quality of such on-site inspection results is now comparable to insights gained in lab tests, and can reliably contribute to information required to implement repairs and substantiate warranty claims on faulty panels, without the need to ship them to offsite laboratories for assessment — which in turn poses the risk of damage to panels during transportation, and can result in lengthy downtimes of one or more PV strings.
Parlevliet is also Chief Remote Pilot at Murdoch, and brings deep experience of the capabilities of drones and the regulations governing their safe deployment, to his work on the paper.
He says, “The drones themselves are significantly more advanced than they were even in relatively recent years.” In addition, they’ve become more commercially available, and the cost of the technology has fallen such that, “you can get an infrared equipped system from a common drone manufacturer for a few thousand dollars, which makes it a lot more accessible to small companies or users.”
But he says the greatest advances have been in two areas. First, the level of autonomy possible in drone capability — that is, drones are being programmed to fly a path according to a neural network “trained” using various orthophotos (aerial photographs that have been geometrically corrected so that the scale across the image is uniform and it can be used like a map) of PV plants; dynamic path planning by machine learning algorithms then optimises a surveillance path according to the capabilities of the drone and the particular nuances of each site.
The second area of advance is in machine learning as applied to processing and analysis of the vast amount of data gathered during surveillance using drone-mounted electroluminescence and thermal infrared imaging of utility-scale plants.
Existing aerial PV inspection systems developed by established innovators, such as Raptor Maps and Above, are lauded by the report, yet it says that their current “reliance on (semi-) manual image data processing” represents a drawback as “human error drives down the diagnostic accuracy of IR [infrared] imaging for PV”.
Integrated autonomous monitoring and analysis are fast becoming a reality, as the abovementioned companies and researchers work to realised the potential for this technology.
Parlievliet’s colleague and a co-author on the report, Mohammadreza Aghaei, from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, has designed and developed an autonomous monitoring system for large-scale PV plants which handles capture of imagery, automatic transfer of that data  to a ground control station via RF channel, and secure relay of classified data by Google Cloud Storage to a database for processing. “After preprocessing and postprocessing of the aerial images and data, the entire processed information is transferred to the decision support system and O&M operator for future actions,” says the report. At this point, the autonomous system evaluates the information, identifying and analysing specific faults and failures, and their position in the solar farm, with a high degree of accuracy.

The report gives equal weight to the review of other inspection methods — such as mobile PV test centres, plant-testing vehicles, “dark” and “daylight I-V testing, outdoor photoluminescence imaging and spectroscopic methods — in a similarly thorough manner.
Its analysis of each technology also clearly describes the types of failures it can detect, “Best-practice recommendations” and how to measure uncertainty aspects.
Drone-mounted imaging, for example, can detect cabling issues, combiner box issues, cell cracks, bypass diode failures, interruptions in the cell interconnection circuit and PID (potential induced degradation caused by high voltages) and LeTID (light and elevated temperature induced degradation).
Mobile PV test Centres, which are typically equipped with an integrated solar simulator, detect some of the same faults, but in tandem with the degradation those faults may cause in power outputs and resistive losses.
Image: International Energy Agency
Some of the most important best-practice procedures for drone-based monitoring says Parlevliet are to consider the proximity requirements for detecting defects of different module components, and consistently selecting good conditions for steady flight and clear, accurate image capture.
“The quality of images we get depends on the ambient conditions,” he tells pv magazine, adding, “You would usually try to monitor in dry, sunny, cloudless, low-wind conditions, to get the best data in the safest possible way.”

The welcoming building is capped with one of the best-looking solar systems around. Its 150 kW capacity array is integrated with the building’s wing-shaped roof; it provides around 85% of the facility’s electricity requirements — saving PAMS thousands each year in operating costs; and 13% of its output is allocated for community use.
“We were looking for design initiatives that create substantial change in environmental, economic and social outcomes,” said Andrea Elhers, a member of the Good Design judging panel.
The Australian Good Design Awards, which have been championing the importance of design to “creating a better, safer and more prosperous future” since 1958 are internationally recognised as Australia’s peak design endorsement and promotion program.

Located some 12,000 kilometres north of Perth, Newman has an average of only 30 rainy days a year,  but is still primarily powered by gas-fired and diesel generation, David Kaunitz told pv magazine Australia in August 2020, just after the building was opened.
He said the decision to power the medical clinic with Risen Energy High Performance Mono PERC 405w modules was made to extend the budget of the facility, to perhaps allow for another health practitioner, or additional services.
Since it opoened, the Newman Health Clinic has been attended by more than 15,000 patients who proudly and correctly claim the building’s design as their own work.
“This project shows outstanding leadership in the co-design process, which was manifested into the built environment, and its users have applauded that process,” said Elhers.
Kaunitz Yeung Architecture is renowned in the region, among Torres Strait Island and Pacific Island communities, for its collaborative design process.
Among it’s many accolades, the husband and wife team of David Kaunitz and Ka Wai Yeung has won coveted international awards for its work on two other remote PAMS clinics, Punmu and Parnngurr, each of which has a 15 kW array of flexible, glass-free solar panels, which were chosen for their resilience to transportation into the outback.
The $8 million Newman clinic was commissioned by PAMS, and Robby Chibawe, the organisation’s CEO, says, “The respectful and collaborative approach by Kaunitz Yeung Architecture with the Martu Elders and communities has created a deep sense of ownership and pride in this health centre among the local community.
PAMS is the first health centre dedicated to the region’s more than 10,000 indigenous residents, and provides a variety of allied health services including maternal and children’s health care, physio, dental care and dialysis. Previously, many patients and people supporting them had to travel to Perth for treatment at a cost of $5,000 per person.
“The centre combines best practice and culturally appropriate clinical care that is connected to people, country and culture,” said Kaunitz on receiving the award.

The building’s rammed-earth structure was made with earth from the site, and state of the art insulation minimises the need to use energy for air conditioning, even in 40 to 50 degree Celsius summer heat. Die-cut metal window screens that help to shade the interiors, and form the centre’s entry gates, were created with the designs of seven local artists representing the communities served by the health care hub. Endemic native plantings shade the facility’s serene oval-shaped central courtyard and a public park at the front and sides of the building.
Elhers noted that the centre and its design have also “brought health, well-being and social-cohesion outcomes” to the community it serves.
“This project is the culmination of all we have learned from working with Martu communities for the last four years, and the communities of the Western Australian Desert for the last decade. Their generosity and wisdom have taught us so much,” said Kaunitz.

Axial Structural, a racking systems manufacturer based in Spain, has announced the launch of the Agritracker, a solar tracker designed specifically for agrivoltaics installations. The product allows for easy optimisation of periods of light and shade to balance optimal growth for different crop types with maximum energy generation.
“The Agritracker adapts to the specific needs of each crop: it protects from inclement weather and optimises the periods of light and shade,” the company told pv magazine, adding that the tracker has been certified by TÜV Rheinland, and is already available for sale.
Axial’s agrivoltaics solution can adapt to sloping terrains, and accommodate crops with different light requirements being planted beneath one installation (grapevine, fruit trees and vegetables, for example). The system can adapt to very steep slopes and land dimensions. Modules can be installed at a height of up to 6.8 meters, allowing heavy farming machinery to pass underneath. The tracker supports up to 96 modules per motor, and independent rows of up to 32 modules, split into four groups of eight panels each.
“Thanks to the Agritracker Shadow Programming App, we can define the hours of tracking the sun or allowing light to pass through for the whole system, and guarantee minimal shading of the crop when sunlight is needed for agricultural purposes,” explained an Axial representative. “With the Dynamic Control system we can also control specific positions at specific times, or manage the position of individual trackers through ModBus Live Control”.
The company specifies that the mechanical elements comprising the Agritracker are subject to the same load calculations, wind tunnel testing and other standards used in all Axial Tracker products. “In this way it is possible to size and secure the products against climate conditions of any area or region,” the company adds.
Axial has already installed the tracker at a project spread across three hectares of farmland in the south of France, the first project in a 100 MW pipeline for the technology that is set to be implemented in the region over the next two years. “In addition to France, the Agritracker is generating serious interest in Italy, Spain and Israel. Our immediate goal is to implement the tracker in European markets,” the company representative told pv magazine. The company also offers the tracker as a turnkey system solution.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/18/strong-potential-for-inorganic-perovskites/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 18, 2021",Strong potential for inorganic perovskites,"From pv magazine Global
Most of the impressive achievements seen so far with perovskite solar cells have been made by scientists working with organic-inorganic perovskite materials – most often combining iodine and lead with organic molecules containing hydrogen and carbon (most often methylammonium and formamidinum).
The organic elements are thought to be essential in limiting formation of defects in the material, and in allowing for the simple, low-temperature manufacturing processes that make perovskites so attractive to the PV industry. These molecules also, however, are at the root of many of the challenges keeping perovskites from large-scale use, and can break up entirely resulting in serious performance loss.
And just as environmental concerns have led scientists to trial replacing lead with other materials, investigating alternatives to the organic molecules could be one way to solve the problem. Cesium has proven to have strong potential as a replacement, although a large part of the research community continues to focus on organic-inorganic perovskite materials.
Scientists led by the University of California Santa Barbara developed a method to compare the potential of different perovskite compositions, and found that all-inorganic materials have the potential for better solar cell performance than those using the organic material.
“To compare the materials, we performed comprehensive simulations of the recombination mechanisms,” explained UC Santa Barbara scientist Xie Zhang. “When light shines on a solar-cell material, the photo-generated carriers generate a current; recombination at defects destroys some of those carriers and hence lowers the efficiency. Defects thus act as efficiency killers.”
The group’s calculations are described in full in the paper All inorganic halide perovskites as candidates for efficient solar cells, published in Cell Reports Physical Science. They compared a cesium-based perovskite with one containing methylammonium, and concluded that the presence of organic materials actually increases the chance of defects appearing in the material, and introduces challenges that disappear when it is replaced with cesium. “We believe that the prospects of using CsPbI3 for efficient solar cells may have been significantly underrated; its optoelectronic performance actually surpasses that of the hybrid perovskites from a nonradiative recombination point of view.”
One of the reasons inorganic perovskites have so far taken a backseat is that actually fabricating them is more challenging. The UCSB scientists, however, note that other recent research suggests that this could be overcome, and with the knowledge that better efficiencies can be achieved this way, scientists could increase their efforts working on processes for all-inorganic perovskite fabrication.
“We hope our results will inspire further experimental work on developing effective strategies to stabilise CsPbI3 in the perovskite structure, thus enabling a new pathway to making highly efficient perovskite solar cells,” the group concludes.
