The increased approval rate, Plibersek said, comes down to an additional $117.1 million (USD 78 million) in the budget of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water – affording more resources for project assessment.
The pipeline of clean energy projects seeking approval has also jumped since the federal election, growing from a total of 64 to 95 today. 
Since coming to power last May, the Labor government has approved the 90 MW Lotus Creek Wind Farm, the 445 MW Aldoga Solar Farm, the 336 MW Specimen Hill Wind Farm, and the 372 Boulder Creek Wind Farm, all in Queensland. It has also approved the 90 MW Port Hedland Solar Project in Western Australia, the 152 MW Tilbuster Solar Farm in New South Wales (NSW) and, in South Australia, both the Goyder Wind Farm sections, totalling 414 MW.
Included in the list are three transmission projects: EnergyConnect and Snowy 2.0 transmission connection in NSW and Queensland’s Powerlink.
Federal Labor has been very loud about its renewable endeavours, but faces growing criticism for continuing to approve fossil fuel projects. 
While quicker approval turnarounds are undoubtedly welcome, the renewables industry is coming under increasing scrutiny over its project locations. Earlier this month, tech giant Apple pulled out of its deal with Windlab due to the controversy around habitat destruction from the company’s Upper Burdekin project.
Moreover, it was recently revealed one in five of the development proposals threatening koala habitat today are renewable projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/11/perth-company-with-uwa-hydrogen-technology-signs-deal-with-japan/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 11, 2023",Perth-company with UWA hydrogen technology signs deal with Japan,"Under the agreement, the trio will investigate setting up facility in Japan’s Chubu region with Hazer’s proprietary technology that uses methane feedstocks to produce hydrogen, capturing the process’ carbon in the form of solid graphite.
This technology was originally developed at the University of Western Australia and bought by Hazer Group, which is currently testing its technology in its Commercial Demonstration Plant in Munster, south of Perth. This demonstration plant is hoping to start producing hydrogen in the second half of this year.
Coming back to its Japan plans, Hazer’s non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Japanese energy company Chubu Electric Power Company and engineering firm Chiyoda Corporation will see the parties jointly prepare a ‘Project Development Plan’ for a production facility in central Japan. The facility’s aim would be to produce “clean” hydrogen and graphitic carbon.
The facility would ultimately be targeting between 50,000 and 100,000 tonnes of hydrogen production per annum, though the initial target would sit at just 2,500 and 10,000 tonnes per annum.
The parties have given themselves more than a year to deliver the project plan. If they decide the facility is viable, the initial start up would take place “in the late 2020s,” the companies say.
Earlier this month, the Japanese government announced plans to increase its hydrogen supply target to 12 million tonne per annum by 2040, a sixfold increase over the current target of 2 million tonne per annum.
Hazer described Japan as a key target market for its technology, also listing Singapore and South Korea.

The standalone 240 MW / 480 MWh Mornington Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) south of Melbourne will be the first cab off the proverbial rank, following the company’s pivot from solar to storage around 2021.
The Mornington project has secured both development and connection approvals, and GMR Energy’s CEO Morris Zhou says its partner, Victorian network AusNet, has now begun early works and is procuring long-lead items. To this end, Zhou noted supply chain disruptions have led to a “significant bottleneck in the availability of transformers and other materials required.”

AusNet will build the transmission infrastructure required for the Mornington project, which sits adjacent to AusNet’s existing Tyabb substation. 
GMR Energy says it is also in “final negotiations” with the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor to build the Mornington battery, though which company has won the contact has not been revealed.
The Mornington project will rely on energy arbitrage and supplying frequency and grid control services to generate revenue.
GMR Energy has another five projects in its pipeline, including the 225 MW/450 MWh Gould Creek BESS near Adelaide in South Australia, which also has development application (DA) approval. Alongside this, the company has lodged DAs for three battery projects in New South Wales, including a 150 MW project in Armidale, a 200 MW project in Tamworth and a 100 MW project in Lismore – all of which will have two hours storage duration. 
All of these projects will miss their originally forecast completion dates, which then-named Maoneng had slated for either this year or last. It is worth noting the company did seem rather ambitious in its initial timelines, frequently forecasting just a year between public announcements and completion.

In May 2022, the company also publicly announced its biggest project to date, the $1.6 billion Merriwa Energy Hub, which comprises of a 550 MW solar farm and a 400 MW/1,600 MWh battery energy storage system in the NSW Hunter region, about 180 kilometres north-west of Newcastle.
In October last year, Hong Kong real estate firm Gaw Capital Partners took a majority stake in the company, leading to its name change. Maoneng co-founder-cum-GMR CEO, Morris Zhou, said the investment would help the company realise its storage project pipeline, estimated to require upwards of $2 billion.
Finance has long been an issue for storage and battery projects since revenues, while often lucrative, cannot be guaranteed in the same way they can with other renewable projects, leading to hesitation from banks and other traditional lenders. 
Zhou told the Australian Financial Review in October: “As a developer, once a project is done it’s out the door because we need to get cash flow, we were at the mercy of the market.”
“Being a renewable developer backed by institutional shareholder [Gaw Capital Partners] means that not only will be able to fast track these projects, but also have holding power.”
In terms of the Mornington project, GMR Energy says the battery will be funded with equity and debt through the support of Gaw Capital Partners and its existing stable of institutional investors.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/11/battery-hydrogen-vs-battery-flywheel/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 11, 2023",Battery hydrogen vs. battery flywheel,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the University of Perugia in Italy have compared two different combinations of energy storage systems connected to photovoltaics: one based on reversible solid oxide cells (rSOC) and batteries, and one that relies on flywheel storage and batteries.
“Our analysis considered annual photovoltaic generation and electric load actual dataset,” researcher Linda Barelli told pv magazine. “We included a statistical analysis to obtain the most representative days, dynamic modelling of the storage systems, simulations to define components sizing and to extrapolate the evolution of annual battery state-of-charge, battery lifespan assessment through application of the rainflow cycle counting algorithm, and a detailed economic evaluation of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) and the levelised cost of storage (LCOS) including subsidies for self-consumption.”
The Italian group presented its findings in “Battery-hydrogen vs. flywheel-battery hybrid storage systems for renewable energy integration in mini-grid: A techno-economic comparison,” which was recently published in the Journal of Energy Storage The researchers said that the two storage system configurations are designed for applications in minigrids equipped with PV plants.
Their modelling was based on a minigrid with a 245 kW PV system connected to a common AC bus through an inverter, with the connection to the medium-voltage grid carried out through a transformer. They considered the following main parameters: the daily mean power, the daily power bandwidth, the ratio between the daily bandwidth and the mean power, and the the daily mean power ramp.
For the flywheel-battery scheme, the scientists considered a low–speed mechanical flywheel made of steel with ceramic bearings and an operating speed range is 3,500 rpm to 8,500 rpm. For the rSOC-battery configuration, they assumed a rSOC stack that can can achieve round trip efficiencies between 38% and 48%. For the battery–flywheel system, the battery had a size of 260 kWh and the flywheel had a capacity of 180 kW. For the rSOC-battery architecture, the battery had a capacity of 450 kWh and the rSOC featured a power of up to 80 kW.
The scientists assumed a cost of €970 ($1,586)/kW for the PV system and a cost of €411/kWh for the batteries. For the rSOC system and the flywheel technology, they considered initial costs of 2,930/kW and €162/kW.
“It is noteworthy to mention that, due to the current energy crisis, such an index has quickly risen from the last months of 2021,” the researcher said. “Therefore, LCOE estimation based on the short–term electricity price instability might lead to a fleeting outcome.”
The research group found that the system based on rSOC and batteries has an LCOE of €0.22480/kWh while that based on flywheel and batteries achieved an LCOE of €0.18/kWh.
“None of the systems proposed attains the market parity, and the results are rather far from the 2020 IRENA target for PV systems,” the said.
The rSOC+battery combination may potential reach grid parity when the market price is higher than €0.380/kWh and the flywheel-battery scheme may become competitive when market price exceeds €0.320/kWh.
“As main outcomes for this integrated methodology, it appears that self-consumption rewards let the flywheel/Li-ion battery storage system reach a LCOS agreeing with 2021 average market parity,” Barelli said. “I see good applications for this configuration in power smoothing and hybrid storage systems, in order to process the most fluctuating profiles by reducing the stress on other systems which can thus be dedicated to meet storage demand over longer timeframes, resulting in greater system efficiencies and durability.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/11/india-to-annually-tender-50-gw-of-renewables-over-next-five-years/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 11, 2023",India to annually tender 50 GW of renewables over next five years,"From pv magazine India
Indian Power Minister R.K. Singh says the government has decided to accept bids for 50 GW of renewable energy capacity per year from fiscal 2023-24 to fiscal 2027-28. The annual bids to set up renewable energy capacity for the inter-state transmission system will also include at least 10 GW of wind projects per year.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) finalised the plan at a recent meeting chaired by the power minister. The plan is in line with India’s target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel (renewable energy and nuclear) sources by 2030.
India had installed 168.96 GW of cumulative renewable energy capacity by Feb. 28, 2023. This includes 64.38 GW of solar power, 51.79 GW of hydro, 42.02 GW of wind, and 10.77 GW of bio power. About 82 GW is under various stages of implementation and about 41 GW is in the tendering stage. 
“The structured bidding trajectory will provide sufficient time to the RE developers to plan their finances, develop their business plans and manage the supply chain more efficiently,” said Singh.
The power ministry has also declared a quarterly bid plan for fiscal 2023-24. It will include bids for at least 15 GW of renewable energy capacity in each of the first and second quarters of the financial year, and at least 10 GW in each of the third and fourth quarters.
Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI), NTPC, and NHPC are the government-notified “renewable energy implementing agencies” (REIAs) that can accept bids. The ministry has also decided to allow SJVN, a public sector enterprise under the government of India, to serve as one. 
The targeted bid capacity for fiscal 2023-24 will be allocated among the four REIAs. The REIAs will be allowed to bring out bids for solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid capacity, and round-the-clock renewable power services with or without storage.
