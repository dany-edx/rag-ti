Among the many different routes pursued by researchers to improve on today’s battery energy storage technologies, solid-state batteries could be the most promising. And many in the industry are optimistic that the approach will eventually bring about a “step change” in battery technology, greatly improving the capacity, lifetime and safety of lithium-ion batteries.
Swapping out the current generation of liquid/gel electrolytes with a solid material could eliminate any fire risk from the battery, as well as improving energy-to-weight ratios and removing the additional “energy redundant” packaging materials required to hold a liquid, among several other advantages.
The key development though is that the solid electrolyte would allow for the use of a lithium-metal anode, with far higher energy density than the graphite that’s commonly used today. Though there is research into integrating lithium-metal with liquid or semisolid electrolytes, all-solid-state is viewed by many as the best approach.
But lithium metal’s tendency to form dendrites – branching structures that grow from the anode into the electrolyte and can cause short circuits and battery failure – is an issue for solid-state batteries as well. With ceramic-based solid electrolytes, dendrite formation can lead to cracks in the electrolyte and short-circuiting in the battery cell.
Given the solid nature of the battery and the tiny scale at which these mechanisms occur, observing and understanding how they progress is a difficult task. A group of scientists led by the UK-based Faraday Institution seeks to address this in new research, where they use sophisticated imaging techniques to observe the batteries in operation, building on earlier insights gained from imaging the batteries after operation.
“Ex-situ and destructive methods, involving sectioning the ceramic electrolyte and imaging the lithium metal within using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, have proved valuable in demonstrating the problem,” the group explains. “However, it is important to follow the development of cracks and the ingress of lithium metal into the ceramic during operation of the cell in order to understand the mechanism of dendrite penetration and cell failure.”
Using X-ray computed tomography – an imaging technique similar to the CAT scans used in medicine – the group followed the progression of cracking and lithium ingress into the electrolyte, in a battery comprising a solid argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) electrolyte sandwiched between two lithium metal electrodes. Their results are found in the paper Visualising plating-induced cracking in lithium-anode solid-electrolyte cells, published in Nature Materials.
Their observations confirmed that the cracks propagate through the electrolyte ahead of the lithium dendrite, proceeding along a path where the electrolyte porosity is above the material’s average. “Continued Li ingress widens the cracks and drives their propagation, but from the rear, not the crack tip,” the group explains. They note that even once a crack grows the whole way across the electrolyte, no short-circuiting occurs until later on when lithium has filled the crack completely.
“We show that cracks propagate through the electrolyte far ahead of the lithium dendrites, rather than the lithium metal driving the crack tip forward,” the group explains. By confirming that dendrites drive the crack formation from the base of the crack and that no lithium metal is present in the tip of the crack, the group is able to suggest better strategies to suppress both mechanisms. “Our findings suggest focussing more attention on blocking dry crack propagation to block dendrite propagation, for example by ceramic toughening and crack block-ing, including strategies such as fibre reinforcement and transformation toughening”, they conclude.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/29/smart-energy-council-reveals-list-of-partners-for-its-green-hydrogen-certification-scheme/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 29, 2021",Smart Energy Council reveals list of partners for its green hydrogen certification scheme,"On Thursday morning, Australia’s Smart Energy Council announced its initial global and domestic ‘Founding Partners’ for its hydrogen Zero Carbon Certification Scheme.
So far, the partners include:
The Smart Energy Council launched its plans to develop a green hydrogen certification in January of this year, stating it was a matter of urgency and prerequisite of Australia properly capitalising on its green hydrogen opportunity.
The Council also announced details on its first pilot certification project under the scheme, which will be ActewAGL’s hydrogen refuelling station in Canberra. The project, which opened in March, is expected to be certified under the Council’s scheme by the end of July 2021.
Australia currently has the largest hydrogen project pipeline of anywhere in the world, and the Smart Energy Council is steadfast in its belief that, based on discussions with international partners, the export market wants green hydrogen, ammonia and other derivative products only.
With Australian governments, namely the federal government, seeming willing to also back blue and grey hydrogen projects (that is, hydrogen made with fossil fuels), the Council says its crucial for Australia to be able to certify its hydrogen’s origins to make it attractive to the global market, in which many of the major players have increasingly advanced climate ambitions.
John Grimes, Chief Executive of the Smart Energy Council, said its Zero Carbon Certification Scheme has received strong interest both domestically and globally, adding he is pleased the Council has been able to attract such a strong list of initial partners.
“The list of Founding Partners shows there is extraordinary global interest in the Zero Carbon Certification Scheme,” he said.
Virtually from the outset, the German Energy Agency, dena, has been an adviser for the Council’s scheme. The German peak boy is also at the centre of a number of other global hydrogen alliances, affording it extremely useful oversight.
Likewise, global coalition the Green Hydrogen Catapult has been a partner initiative to the scheme – it seeks to to accelerate the scale and production of green hydrogen 50-fold in the next six years.
Australia’s green hydrogen ambitions have been ramping up in recent months, with companies like Scientific Star (one of the initial partners listed above), garnering global recognition for its pioneering hydrogen research. Province Resource’s hydrogen project in Western Australia recently grew from 1 GW to a massive 8 GW after receiving preliminary backing from French giant Total Eren.
Evidently, all of the partners listed above agree with the Council’s assertion that Australia should focus its attention on certifiably green practices in its burgeoning hydrogen industry.
“Certification is the essential building block for the export of new zero carbon products, including hydrogen, ammonia and steel. Our customers want to know how much carbon is embedded into the products they are buying and how and where they are produced,” Andrew Dickson, Senior Business Development Manager at CWP Global’s Asian Renewable Energy Hub said.

Scientists at Germany’s Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) claim to have achieved an efficiency of 18% for a perovskite solar module with an area of 4cm2 – a world record for a vacuum-processed perovskite panel.
The researchers explained they were able to scale up from the cell to the module level without any efficiency loss, which they described as the main challenge for the development of large-area perovskite PV modules.
The perovskite cells were connected in series to form large-area solar modules using the so-called monolithic series connection, with structuring lines being introduced during the deposition of a cell’s individual layers, which were all deposited through a vacuum process.
“The major advantages of vacuum deposition with regard to the production of efficient solar modules, are the ease with which the processes can be controlled, the low number of process parameters and, in particular, the independence of the deposition mechanism from the coating surface,” said KIT researcher Tobias Abzieher, noting that the process was used in combination with a laser technique for the monolithic series connection.
With the combination of vacuum processing and laser ablation, the scientists achieved an efficiency of up to 16.6% on a module surface of more than 50cm2 and 18% on a module with an area of 4cm2. “Despite the enlargement of the device’s area by a factor of over 500, almost no loss of efficiency can be observed,” said researcher David Ritzer.
With its approach, KIT claims to have succeeded in reducing the scaling losses in perovskite solar modules to values that are close to those of cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) modules.
In the future, the researchers will work on optimising the solar cell layer stack and on further reducing the dead areas. “If we fully exploit the potential of the technology, the production of perovskite solar modules with efficiencies of well over 20%, even on even larger areas, is an achievable goal in a timely manner,” said researcher Ulrich Paetzold.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/29/tesla-touts-the-market-strength-of-its-powerwall-energy-storage-product/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"APRIL 29, 2021",Tesla touts the market strength of its Powerwall energy storage product,"From pv magazine USA
Tesla reported that its energy storage deployments grew 71% year over year in the first quarter of 2021, driven largely by what it said was the popularity of its Powerwall product.
The company said that rooftop solar deployments reached 92 MW in the first quarter, its strongest quarter in 2.5 years. Solar roof deployments grew 9x compared to the same period last year. The growth curve slowed, however, from the fourth quarter of 2020 when the company installed 86 MW.
CEO Elon Musk told an earnings call that the company had made some “significant mistakes” with its solar roof project. Recent price volatility reflects a realisation that the complexity of roofs varies dramatically, he said. The company’s recent shift to sell rooftop solar and energy storage as a package is intended to streamline installation by ensuring that power goes to the battery system before reaching the electric circuit breaker.
Musk said that a software update for the Powerwall could enable as much as a 50% power increase over the 5 kW of real power currently specified. The company said that demand for Powerwall “continues to far exceed” its production rate. As a result, the company said it shifted Powerwall deliveries to solar customers only. As production rates increase, Tesla said it may make the energy storage system again available as a stand-alone product.
(Read “Making the numbers work for a residential energy storage system.”)
The company said that the February snowstorm in Texas and other blackout events continue to drive customers toward home energy storage. Even so, it said that energy storage deployments can “vary meaningfully quarter to quarter” depending on the timing of specific project milestones, which is the driver behind the company’s reported sequential decline in megawatt-hours.
The company deployed 260 MWh of storage in the first quarter of 2020 and 1,584 MWh in the fourth quarter. The pace sagged to 445 MWh in the first quarter of 2021.
Musk said that Powerwalls could be used to stabilise the grid and operate as a virtual power plant. He said the concept is likely to gain traction as electric vehicle adoption increases.
