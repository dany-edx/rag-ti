The proposed Merredin battery energy storage system is to be developed on a four-hectare site about 7.5 kilometres southwest of the town, about 260 kilometres east of Perth.
The site is adjacent to the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm, which was developed by Nomad and is now owned by Singapore-headquartered SUN Energy, and will be connected to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) at the adjacent Merredin terminal.
The developers said the proximity to Western Power’s Merredin terminal substation was a key consideration when the site was selected and will result in relatively minor works being required to connect the proposed facility to the grid.
Fremantle-based Nomad said the Shire of Merredin has backed the project, declaring it is consistent with council’s ambition to be a centre for renewable energy systems.
A report that accompanies the development application lauds the Merredin shire as the renewable energy centre for the Wheatbelt and Western Australia, having pioneered wind turbines and solar farms in the state.
“The next iteration is in the storage and redistribution of this energy via battery energy storage systems,” the report reads.
Nomad said the project, once approved and constructed will boost SWIS grid reliability in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields regions.
The final investment decision on the $220 million Merredin battery energy storage project is expected in the second half of this year.
The project is the first to be rolled out as part of Nomad’s collaboration with Sydney-based Atmos Renewables, the clean energy arm of investment manager Igneo Infrastructure Partners.
The parties last year announced they would work together to deliver more than 1 GW of utility-scale renewable projects before the end of the decade.
Atmos owns and operates 15 large-scale plants, generating 2.5 TWh of electricity across all regions of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Atmos currently holds generation assets with a combined capacity in excess of 1.7 GW while Nomad has developed more than 500 MW of renewable energy projects globally and entered the partnership with more than 1 GW of utility-scale of wind, solar and storage projects in the development pipeline.
The parties said they intend to jointly develop, construct, own and operate the assets they develop in collaboration.

The pilot 5 kW fuel cell with 8 kWh of hydrogen storage system has been installed at the Charles Darwin University’s (CDU) REMHART (Renewable Energy Microgrid Hub for Applied Research and Training) facility ub Darwin. There the system can convert power from the university’s specialised renewable energy grid testing facility into green hydrogen.
Professor Suresh Thennadil, director of CDU’s Energy and Resources Institute (ERI) which will operate the generator and hydrogen storage system for industry partners, students and researchers, said the system will play an important role in further developing a sustainable and efficient energy cycle for hydrogen production and utilisation.
“The installation of a containerised hydrogen electrolyser and fuel cell system significantly enhances our ability to study hydrogen production and its feasibility as an energy source for fuelling the grid,” he said.
“This will also enable us to better understand the challenges and intricacies associated with incorporating hydrogen as an additional energy source as well as the durability of electrolysers and other components under local climatic conditions.
“This upgrade provides a unique and flexible platform to study renewable energy systems, particularly small regional and remote grids, which are common throughout the NT.”
Pacific Energy Chief Executive Officer Jamie Cullen said the transportable containerised H2 SPS is an adaptation of the company’s solar-powered stand-alone power system, and comprises four electrolysers developed by Germany-based hydrogen specialist Enapter, a 5 kW fuel cell provided by Swedish company PowerCell Group, a battery and inverters.
The system’s electrolysers use electricity to split fresh water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The hydrogen component is stored in pressurised containment vessels until it is required to produce power. When power is required, the fuel cell combines the hydrogen gas with oxygen from the air, producing electricity that can then be fed into the grid.
Pacific said the system, which has already produced hydrogen and 5 kW of electrical output during testing, has the capability to supply 8.6 kW of three-phase power using its inverters and battery.
Cullen said he expects the system will play a critical role in developing the energy industry’s understanding of hydrogen as a renewable energy source, helping to “overcome some of the challenges we currently face when integrating hydrogen into the renewables mix.”
The company said the modular design of the system means it can be scaled with ease, using the same philosophies, concepts and safety system hardware used in CDU’s model.
The deployment of the Pacific Energy system follows the recent announcement from Boundary Power that it has developed a modular stand-alone power system that integrates solar with a hydrogen electrolyser and storage system.
Boundary Power said its system, developed in conjunction with energy storage system specialist Lavo and inverter manufacturer Selectronic Australia, utilises solar power and a renewable hydrogen hydride battery to store and generate electricity when required, , doing away with the traditional back-up diesel generator.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/29/ace-power-lands-connection-agreements-for-battery-pair/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-01-29,Ace Power lands connection agreements for battery pair,"Ace Power announced it has received the Generator Performance Standard 5.3.4 a/b from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for both the 103 MW Kerang and 200 MW Yabulu battery energy storage projects being developed in northern Victoria and far north Queensland respectively.
Shane Humphreys, senior development manager and battery energy storage systems lead at Ace, said the connection approvals are the first received by the company, and are among the earliest approvals nationwide for battery energy storage systems to operate in grid-forming mode from the date of commissioning.
“This outcome is the culmination of over 12 months work, and considerable engineering input from our respective consultants as we navigated an evolving landscape in respect of how grid-forming inverter technology is assessed by AEMO and the NSPs (network service providers),” he said.
Humphreys said the connection approvals “significantly” de-risk the projects, allowing Ace to focus on moving the projects into construction by Q2 2024, and ultimately unlocking the network and consumer benefits that come with the deployment of advanced BESS inverter capabilities.
Each battery, which will be connected into the transmission network directly via existing network substations at their respective locations, will be equipped with grid-forming inverter technology, allowing them to provide essential system stability services traditionally provided by synchronous generation such as coal, gas and hydro plants, and more recently also by synchronous condensers.
Humphreys said both projects operating in grid-forming mode will contribute positively to network stability on a 24/7 basis and this is expected to unlock further capacity for renewable connections in the surrounding areas.
Both projects are co-located with planned solar farms. The Yabulu project, being developed near Townsville in Queensland’s far north, includes the 200 MW/400 MWh battery and a 100 MW solar farm.
The 103 MW Kerang big battery will be built alongside a proposed 140 MW solar farm in Victoria’s far north, a region rich with renewables, but with a weak grid.
It is expected the battery’s advanced inverter technology will help ease hose problems.
The project will also contribute to Victoria’s drive to meet legislated energy storge targets of at least 2.6 GW of storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 GW by 2035, when it aims to reach 95% renewable share.
The awarding of the connection agreements comes just months after Ace announced it would partner with Osaka Gas Energy Oceania (OGEO), the clean energy arm of Japanese gas and power company Osaka Gas, to jointly develop a portfolio of Australian solar and battery projects with a total capacity of more than 500 MW.

More than 400 solar panels have been installed at the Tuncurry and Bulahdelah water treatment plant, Tea Gardens Sewer Pump Station 13 and the Coopernook and Manning Point sewage treatment plants.
Council said its water and sewer infrastructure accounts for 80% of its overall power use and the systems, which range from 37 kW to 8 kW and are capable of generating a combined 239 MWh of clean energy per annum, will reduce its operating costs by $60,000 per year.
MidCoast Council Executive Manager of Water and Systems, Marnie Coates, said installing solar systems at the sites is an environmental and financial investment in the future.
“Thanks to the reduced electricity costs at the sites, we expect the project to pay itself off within five years,” she said. “After that, the sites will continue to draw energy from the sun free of charge, which will result in ongoing savings.”
Coates said the five systems feature roof-mounted panels and grid-connected string inverters with analytics hardware from software provider Solar Analytics installed to monitor the performance of the systems.
“This hardware is great because it gives us real-time data on how much electricity we’re generating, how much we’re consuming, and how much we’re delivering back to the grid,” she said. “It also lets us know what we should be generating based on current weather conditions, so we can identify and resolve any issues if they arise.”
The five PV power systems installed at the water and sewer sites is part of the MidCoast Council’s broader clean energy strategy. Council has been powering all its small water and sewer sites with 100% renewable energy since the start of 2023 courtesy of an electricity purchasing agreement.
Coates said purchasing accredited renewable energy from an electricity provider was a sustainable way to power some of council’s smaller assets.
“Many of these sites don’t have a large enough physical footprint to generate their own energy,” she said. “Purchasing green energy allows us to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our water and sewer operations when solar power or other forms of onsite renewables aren’t an option.”
This article was amended on 31.1.2024 to reflect that the system sizes ranged from 37 kW to 8 kW in size, for total installed capacity of 126 kW.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/29/rystad-tips-australian-projects-to-help-propel-global-green-hydrogen-growth/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",ALEISHA HEY,2024-01-29,Rystad tips Australian projects to help propel global green hydrogen growth,"Activity in the clean hydrogen sector is “surging” globally, fuelled by maturing policies and early commercial-scale projects, including here in Australia, according to international energy consultancy Rystad Energy.
Artem Abramov, head of clean tech research at Rystad, said he expects hydrogen projects will take off in 2024 driven by large-scale projects in Australia as well as the Middle East and Africa, along with maturing policies in Europe and the United States.
“2024 promises more than just momentum, it’s a year of clarity,” he said, noting that several key feasibility studies are to be completed, which he expects will reveal promising new use cases for hydrogen consumption.
Abramov also said a series of global auctions and grants will be rolled out, providing essential insights into key aspects of the emerging clean hydrogen sector.
“These events will shed light on pricing dynamics, technological advancements and the eventual victors and contenders in this transformative landscape,” he said.
Rystad’s forecast comes just weeks after the International Energy Agency (IEA) delivered what it described as a reality check on green hydrogen development, noting that despite announcements on plenty of new projects, progress in realising them has been slow.
In the latest edition of its annual Renewables market report, the IEA said that more than 360 GW of renewable energy-powered electrolyser projects with start dates before 2030 had been announced but only 3% of these had reached financial close or started construction.
Rystad expects that there will be fewer clean hydrogen project announcements this year compared to previous years with most of the effort in 2024 to be focused on realising projects.
The consultancy said this marks the start of the learning-by-doing phase for the clean hydrogen economy.
Rystad said any announcements of new projects will be more conservative and of lower risks. This will continue the trend that was seen in 2023, where only 17.6 million tonnes of hydrogen were announced, following the 30 million tonnes announced in 2022.
Abramov’s positive outlook for green hydrogen is part of Rystad’s look at what’s in store for the energy sector in 2024.
Last year was a pivotal one for the energy world with the latest figures from the IEA indicating that global renewables capacity grew by 50%, reaching almost 510 GW, with PV accounting for three-quarters of the additions.
Rystad’s head of Renewables and Power Research, Carlos Torres Diaz, said the coming year will be another rollercoaster ride for the industry, with elections, supply chain issues and the maturation of nascent industries all on the cards.
“This year is expected to be another record breaker for the solar and wind markets, adding more than 510 GW of solar PV and wind capacity globally,” he said. “The resulting new generation from these sources, more than 900 TWh, will be enough to cover most of the growth in demand, helping limit the need for fossil-fuelled power generation. “
Diaz did caution that while capacity will continue to grow, governments need to put in place the right incentives for renewable energy projects to ensure the momentum continues.
