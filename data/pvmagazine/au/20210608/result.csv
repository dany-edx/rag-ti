Tarek Zohdi, a scientist from the University of California, Berkeley, has developed a computational framework to optimise solar power generation in agrivoltaic projects relying on bifacial modules, as well as other agrivoltaic systems.
The novel approach, which the researcher defines as a ‘digital-twin’ framework, is claimed to be flexible enough to simulate a wide variety of systems and to be able to rapidly compute the solar power flow in a multi-purpose agrivoltaic project with a reduced-order model of Maxwell’s equations. These equations are commonly used to describe how electric charges and electric currents create electric and magnetic fields. Model order reduction (MOR) is a method to reduce the computational complexity of a mathematical model in a numerical simulation.
The method considers the high-frequency decomposition of solar irradiance into multiple rays and analyses how these rays are propagated forward in time, to assess multiple reflections and absorption for various system configurations. It also takes into account panel inclination, panel refractive indices, sizes, shapes, heights, and albedo. “The method propagates energy through a hypothetical solar farm system configuration very quickly,” Zohdi told pv magazine. “It assesses how well the hypothetical solar farm system performs in achieving desired outcomes such as PV electricity produced and energy-to-agriculture.”
The researcher further explained that the computational module gives the configuration a “score” and then tests thousands of others in an hour. “The code constantly retains the best performers and eliminates the worst ones, seeking the absolute best ones using machine learning,” he stated.
“The method allows for a solar installation to be tested from multiple source directions quickly and uses a genomic-based machine learning algorithm to optimise the system,” the academic explained in the paper A digital-twin and machine-learning framework for the design of multiobjective agrophotovoltaic solar farms, published in Computational Mechanics. “By creating digital-twins of complex, symbiotic agrophotovoltaic (APV) systems, one can safely and efficiently manipulate, improve, and optimise agriculture, careful water use, and integrated solar energy in virtual settings, before deploying them in the physical world.”
Zohdi also explained that the decomposition of solar irradiance into multiple rays can also be assessed regarding crop yield. The discrete-ray approach assumes that the ambient medium acts as a vacuum and that there are no energetic losses as the rays move through the surrounding medium. The simulations, according to Zohdi, take a fraction of a second on a laptop and potential agrivoltaic systems could be tested from multiple source directions.
“A key goal of this work was to develop an easy simulation tool that is computationally inexpensive and accessible to a wide range of researchers involved in APV systems,” Zhodi concluded, noting that his further work will focus on adding remote sensing imagery and sensor data feeds to the developed computational framework.

Despite the troublesome and often high integration costs of connecting renewable projects in Australia, solar PV and wind continue to be the cheapest sources of new electricity generation capacity. The report also found the costs of storage from batteries is lower than previously thought.
Battery costs fell the most in 2020-21 when compared to any other generation and storage technologies, and are projected to continue to fall, the CSIRO found. Lower battery storage costs underpin the long-term competitiveness of renewables.
The report also included hydrogen electrolysers for the first time and found the technology is following a similar trajectory to more established renewables. “With increased interest in global deployment, and many demonstration projects worldwide, substantial cost reductions in hydrogen technologies are expected over the next decades,” the CSIRO said.
The CSIRO’s Chief Energy Economist, Paul Graham, said an early draft of the report had been released to stakeholders in December 2020 and was subsequently improved to reflect feedback about the impact of weather variability on driving up these integration costs. “The final report addresses this feedback: our analysis of renewable integration costs now includes greater recognition of this year to year weather variability and the impact it has on electricity demand and supply,” Graham said.

The 900-kilometre interconnector, which passes from South Australia to New South Wales (with a short spur into Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria) is forecast to unlock some 1,800 MW of renewable energy generation in its path, and create more than 2,600 jobs across the region.
South Australia’s investment of $457.4 million through ElectraNet will pool with the $1.83 billion being spent by New South Wales’ Transgrid. Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) will also spend almost $300 million on the project, its biggest investment to date.
“Project EnergyConnect is landmark project that will drive competition in the wholesale electricity market by connecting more, low-cost generation to the national electricity grid and support the ongoing transition to a lower carbon emissions future,” ElectraNet’s Chief Executive, Steve Masters, said in a statement.
“As the proponent of this project, ElectraNet has left no stone unturned to ensure that this project is a good investment for electricity customers in South Australia and New South Wales.
“We undertook a rigorous cost benefit analysis that has been repeatedly updated to demonstrate this remains the best option for customers as well as supporting the rapid pace of change across the NEM,” Masters added.
South Australian households can expect to receive an average saving of around $100 a year on their electricity bills after the interconnector comes online, while NSW residents can expect around $60 of savings.
Moreover, the transmission lines will enable renewables-leader South Australia (SA) to export more of its cleanly generated electrons into the National Electricity Market (NEM) to help meet increasing demand, and supplement the grid in the event of bad weather.
“By creating a second point of connection between SA and the NEM, [Project EnergyConnect] will significantly reduce the risk of the SA grid being “islanded” or disconnected from the NEM,” said the CEFC.
The CEFC added that having an alternate interconnector from SA to the rest of the NEM will enable critical maintenance to be performed at the existing nearby Heywood Interconnector — which will indirectly benefit Victoria’s industrial users such as the Alcoa Portland aluminium smelter, increasing reliability of electricity supply.

Borumba Dam has long been considered a prime location for a pumped hydro facility, with University of Queensland energy expert, Professor Simon Bartlett, identifying the site as ideal more than five years ago. Indeed, Premier Palaszczuk said her government is “prioritising” Borumba because of its existing dam infrastructure, land access and location within the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone.
In light of last month’s Callide power station fire and subsequent blackout, the project seems to have taken on new urgency. Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick de Brenni, said the May crisis “proved” the importance of having pumped hydro as part of a diversified energy mix. “We were able to ramp up the Wivenhoe Hydroelectric Station to provide critical generation support and stabilise the network,” de Brenni said.
At 1 GW, Borumba would have double the generation and triple the storage of Wivenhoe, he added. The minister believes that if Borumba moves ahead, the Commonwealth should contribute to the capital cost.
“We’re talking about nation building infrastructure,” de Brenni said. “Every other state has had energy projects built by the Commonwealth – Queenslanders deserve their share.”
Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said the funds slated for making business case at Borumba would include detailed engineering and design, hydrological modelling, geological testing, an assessment of environmental impacts and community consultation. “We’re investing $22 million to potentially unlock a multi-billion-dollar construction project that would leverage billions more in clean energy investment and support thousands of jobs,” the treasurer said.
State-owned electricity transmission company Powerlink has been tasked with undertaking the business case, “given its understanding of the electricity market and experience delivering very large infrastructure,” the Queensland government’s media release said.
The business case is expected to take up to 24 months, with a submission expected in the second half of 2023.

Queensland-based community group Solar Citizens has warmly welcomed the news, calling it a “forward-thinking energy storage announcement”.
“Diversifying Queensland’s energy assets is exactly what energy experts have been calling for in the wake of the Callide C coal-fired power station fire,” Ellen Roberts, Solar Citizens’ National Director, said.
“Queenslanders are world leaders in the uptake of rooftop solar. Renewable storage options like pumped hydro and big batteries are smart investments that soak up excess solar energy during the day, making the most of cheap solar energy and ensuring grid stability.”
In the coming months, Powerlink will begin engaging with a range of stakeholders as part of its initial works, including state-owned Seqwater, the Department of Environment and Science, local government, local community, environmental groups and Traditional Owners. 
“Conservation of national parks and protected areas will be prioritised and Powerlink will be actively working with First Nations and Conservation groups to explore all options and ensure appropriate environmental offsets are identified,” the Queensland government said.
In January, GE Renewable Energy announced it’s with Australian-based consortium BE Power to co-develop the 400 MW Big T pumped hydro storage project at Cressbrook Dam, about 200kms away near Toowoomba in southern Queensland.
Likewise, Genex Power’s 250 MW Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project in far north Queensland is also progressing.

The project will demonstrate two new technologies: RayGen’s patented PV Ultra and its electro-thermal storage technology, for which a patent is pending. The company says these two technologies combined “aim to disrupt the economics of solar-plus-storage while offering improved grid security and reliability.”
The RayGen Power Plant Carwarp has attracted funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), who have allocated $15 million to the project, as well as “strategic investments” from AGL, Photon Energy, Schlumberger, and Chevron.

How RayGen’s ‘solar hydro’ power plant works, ARENA explains, is basically that the concentrated PV technology generates heat as a by-product which is captured and used for thermal storage. The electro-thermal storage system consists of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine, industrial chillers and two insulated water-based thermal storage pits or reservoirs, each roughly the size of four Olympic size swimming pools. One of the reservoirs is kept at a temperature of 90 degrees and the other at close to 0 degrees, and the temperature difference is used to generate dispatchable electricity using ORC turbines.
RayGen has been operating this technology for more than two years in its 1 MW pilot project in Newbridge, Victoria – which also received funding from ARENA. It’s expected that with the larger scale of the Carwarp plant, RayGen will be able to provide the the Low Emissions Technology Statement stretch goal of providing firmed renewables for under $100 / MWh.
ARENA’s CEO Darren Miller said the innovative technology provides an exciting opportunity to address Australia’s emerging longer duration storage needs. “Much like combining pumped hydro and a traditional solar farm, RayGen’s technology can provide longer duration firming for renewable energy generation. We are particularly interested in the potential for RayGen’s technology to deliver firmed renewable energy at a very competitive cost,” Miller said.

Australia’s largest electricity generator, AGL, will be an offtaker for the project. It is also collaborating with RayGen on a feasibility study to assess whether the technology could be installed at AGL’s Liddell facility, a major coal-fired plant in New South Wales scheduled to begin decommissioning next year.
“RayGen’s technology has the potential to provide the same capabilities as other long duration storage technologies at lower cost and with fewer geographical constraints. We believe the technology can be just as successful in the Hunter region and a key feature of our plans to transition the Liddell site into an Energy Hub, alongside grid-scale batteries and a waste to energy facility,” AGL’s Managing Director and CEO, Graeme Hunt, said in a statement.
The project will be developed in Carwarp, just south of Mildura, at a site with existing approvals for a solar farm. The project requirements fit within the scope of those approvals, according to RayGen.
The project will export renewable electricity to the National Electricity Market (NEM) and will also participate in wholesale energy and Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets once operational.
Perhaps most importantly though, the plant will provide 17 hours of storage to the West Murray grid, which is notoriously congested causing numerous renewables projects in the region to be curtailed.
The Carwarp project will be wholly owned by RayGen and is expected to reach commercial operation date in 12 months, with an operational design life of 30 years.

The Victorian technology company, which today has 35 staff, received a world record for solar system efficiency in 2014 in partnership with the University of New South Wales. It began its first PV Ultra project in 2015, supplying power to farms near Bendigo.
RayGen says in addition to the Carwarp project, money from its $27 million capital raise will go towards expanding the capacity of its module manufacturing line from 25 MW to 125 MW per annum, and will enable project development on its 1 GWh plus pipeline to reach financial close.
Other hats in the ring
Similar to AGL, the other private companies which have invested in RayGen’s project are keen to see how they could integrate the technology into their own operations. Schlumberger New Energy, one of the other investors, has executed a Joint Development Agreement for works to enhance the RayGen’s system design and will complete pre-feasibility studies for large green hydrogen and ammonia export projects.
Photon Energy and RayGen are also developing projects in Australia and internationally.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/08/gev-to-construct-430t-hydrogen-cargo-ship-for-small-scale-grid-blending-market/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 8, 2021",GEV to construct 430t hydrogen cargo ship for small scale grid blending market,"Global Energy Ventures (GEV) announced to the ASX yesterday that it has commenced development of a pilot-scale C-H2 ship capable of carrying 430 tonnes of hydrogen by the mid-2020s. 
GEV believes that by the mid-2020s the scale, timeline, and downstream opportunities for green hydrogen projects in both the Asia Pacific and Europe will be so substantial as to take advantage not just of this prototype ship, but an operating fleet of C-H2s. 
To achieve this goal GEV is targeting American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Approval in Principle (AIP) in Q3 2021 and Full Class Approvals by late 2022. The 430 tonne vessel will be scaled version of the 2,000-tonne C-H2 ship which already received AIP in March.  
GEV’s managing director and CEO, Martin Carolan, said in a statement that GEV’s “design and development strategy for the 2,000-tonne ship proved that large commercial scale C-H2 ships are possible and paved the way for the H2 marine transportation industry and will ensure we establish ourselves in the marine transportation of green hydrogen.” 
GEV’s intention with the scaled down pilot model is to include green hydrogen customers who want to inject and blend such volumes of green hydrogen into their existing natural gas pipelines, and markets only in the early stages of green hydrogen adoption. 
Through extensive marketing, says Carolan, GEV believes that by the mid-late 2020s, a Handymax sized vessel or “pilot-scale ship will be complementary to partner discussions and GEVs target to develop a fully integrated green hydrogen supply chain from Northern Australia. This includes GEV’s own renewable energy project to produce green hydrogen based on a specific customer use case, delivered with our own C-H2 ships.” 
The 430t ship will be made up of two large 12m diameter tanks within the hull of the ship which will store hydrogen under 250 bars of pressure. These steel tanks are lined with stainless steel to help prevent embrittlement from the hydrogen molecules entering the steel’s molecular structure. 

“Blending is an attractive source of near-term demand for hydrogen at low blend volumes due to low incremental costs and aligns with C-H2s modular approach for production scale-up”, Carolan continued. “The scale of the 430t ship can alleviate the additional infrastructure requirements that a liquefaction or ammonia project will require to deliver a pure hydrogen gas to the end user. Regions with aspirations to develop a low-carbon hydrogen economy are likely to turn to grid injection as a means of cultivating a market and stimulating investment into supply.”

Green ammonia is produced from hydrogen via electrolysis. 
The two companies want to explore opportunities to use both green and blue ammonia fuel as a way of reducing shipping emissions. Indeed, Trafigura recently published a white paper calling for the International Maritime Organisation to install a global carbon levy for shipping fuels.  
“There is a growing consensus” argues Jose Maria Larocca, executive director and co-head of oil trading for Trafigura, “that hydrogen-based fuels will ultimately be the shipping fuels of the future, but clear and comprehensive regulation is essential.” 
The collaboration will see Yara supply clean ammonia to Trafigura Group companies, and both companies will jointly embark on R&D initiatives for the use of ammonia as a maritime fuel. 
Of course, to fuel an entire shipping industry also requires extensive infrastructure and companion markets, the value chain for which the two companies are hoping to establish together. “Demand and supply of clean ammonia need to be developed in tandem”, said Magnus Ankarstrand, president of Yara Clean Ammonia. 
The collaboration would help, continued Ankarstrand, “to develop and promote zero-emission fuel in the form of clean ammonia for the shipping industry. Building clean ammonia value chains is critical to facilitate the transition to zero emissions fuels by enabling the hydrogen economy – not least within trade a distribution where both Yara and Trafigura have leading capabilities.” 
In September 2020, Trafigura and Australian institutional investor IFM Investors announced the intention to have 2 GW of renewable projects at some stage of development by 2025.

Fraunhofer ISI, Fraunhofer ISE and Fraunhofer IEG have released a joint study on future potential hydrogen demand. The report, which covers demand for hydrogen and hydrogen synthesis products, was produced on behalf of Germany’s National Hydrogen Council.
The three Fraunhofer institutes evaluated current system studies, with a focus on demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based energy sources in Germany. They found that current annual hydrogen production in Germany stands at 57 TWh and is almost entirely based on fossil fuels. The first relevant demand increase for green hydrogen and derivatives is expected by 2030, at a likely annual maximum of 80 TWh. Annual demand is then expected to grow to between 100 TWh and 300 TWh in 2040 and up to 800 TWh by 2050.
The study identifies the greatest future need for hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthesis products in the industrial sector. Up to 500 TWh will be required here by 2050, especially in the iron and steel industry and the chemical industry. The transport sector will need between 150 TWh and 300 TWh by 2050. International air and maritime traffic is expected to require between 140 TWh and 200 TWh by the middle of the current century. According to recent studies, road traffic has the greatest potential for heavy goods traffic.
The study also identifies additional customers in the building sector, with up to 200 TWh by 2050. The development of demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthesis products will depend on a range of factors, including developments in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide field, as well as the amount of available and sustainable biomass capacity.
“Without the widespread use of hydrogen, we will not be able to achieve the more stringent climate targets,” said Katherina Reiche, chairwoman of the National Hydrogen Council.
The study concluded that demand in the industrial sector, as well as transport and heating, will be significantly higher than previously predicted by politicians. The rapid development of the hydrogen market, the ongoing expansion of renewable energy, and the rapid expansion and development of network infrastructure are now critical for future growth. However, the growth of the hydrogen economy and its international value chains will need to be considered within both a European and global context.

Insight is a robotic lander designed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and sent to Mars in 2018 to study the deep interior of The Red Planet. Since it started operating, at around 344 million kilometres from the Earth, the lander has accumulated dust on many of its parts, including the PV array that is crucial for repowering its batteries and keeping the machine functioning.
Although the panels are designed to provide enough power over a full Mars year even with significant dust accumulation, NASA is currently planning to hibernate the lander during the Martian winter and to shut down science instruments to keep its electronics warm.
Simultaneously, the agency has also begun to clean the panels of the array with a sort of handmade technique that is, somehow, producing interesting results. On May 22, which corresponds to the mission’s 884th Martian day, the lander’s robotic arm trickled sand near one solar panel, helping the wind to carry off some of the panel’s dust. The sand grains would strike dust on the panels by hopping off the solar panel surface and skipping through the air in the wind, with the larger grains being able to carry off the smaller dust particles in the wind.
“With winds blowing northwest at a maximum of 20 feet (6 meters) per second, the trickling of sand coincided with an instantaneous bump in the spacecraft’s overall power,” the agency explained. This operation was carried at noon, Mars time, which is the planet’s windiest time of day, and resulted in a gain of about 30 watt-hours of energy per ‘sol,’ or Martian day. “The power boost should delay the instruments being switched off by a few weeks, gaining precious time to collect additional science data,” NASA said in a statement, noting that a second attempt to clean the panels was also done on Saturday, June 5.
Despite the success of the operation, the agency said it is uncertain how much additional yield the cleaning will provide, although it gave additional helpful margin to Insight’s power reserves. At the end of the Earth summer, which corresponds to that of the Martian winter, the solar panels should be able to harvest more sunlight and turn the lander’s instruments back on.
A previous, unsuccessful attempt to remove dust from the modules was done almost a year earlier by pulsing the motor that opens and closes the solar array. The use of brushes or fans to clear off dust was excluded since the beginning, as these would have added weight and possible failure points.
