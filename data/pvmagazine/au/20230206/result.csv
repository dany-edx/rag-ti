The company said its Australian manufacturing plant will initially supply ground-mounted tracker systems for the Glenrowan project but will eventually provide trackers for other new solar projects in Australia.
Array Technologies Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hostetler said the manufacturing plant – the location and capacity of which has not yet been revealed – will bolster the company’s presence in the Australian marketplace and help spur economic growth in the region.
“This decision will help us meet the growing demand for renewable energy utilities, expedite project schedules, and have long-lasting economic benefits for Australia,” he said.
The Glenrowan Solar Farm, being developed on a 245-hectare site about two kilometres southwest of the township in Victoria’s northeast, is one of six large-scale energy generation and storage projects to have won supply contracts under the state’s second renewable energy target auction (VRET2). Together, the projects will deliver 623 MW of new generation and up to 365 MW/600 MWh of new energy storage.
Array Technologies said it is the first tracker supplier to be awarded a contract under the VRET scheme which is designed to grow renewable energy manufacturing capacity in the state and help the Victorian government meet its commitment to power all of its operations with renewable energy by 2025.
“We are proud to be the first company to provide a locally made tracker and support Australia’s domestic manufacturing base for future renewable energy projects,” Hostetler said. “We recognize the need to transition to a clean energy future and producing locally sourced components is an important step in that transition.”
The VRET2 scheme is part of the state government’s plan to drive significant investment in all six renewable energy zones located across Victoria. The Victorian government has estimated the scheme will support the creation of 920 direct jobs and attract $1.48 billion (USD 1.02 billion) in new renewable energy projects in the state.
“Generating new investment in renewable energy will have lasting benefits for Victoria’s economy, making energy delivery across the state more reliable and affordable,” Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said.
Construction of the Glenrowan Solar Farm has already begun with the project expected to commence operations by the end of 2023.
The solar farm will connect to the existing nearby Glenrowan Terminal Substation. It is expected to generate electricity equivalent to powering approximately 45,000 Australian homes.

Included in that portfolio is the recently completed 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm which is expected to generate approximately 440 GWh of clean energy annually.
Situated about 10 kilometres northeast of the town of Miles in Queensland’s Western Downs region, the facility is owned by South Korea-based investment manager Hana Financial Investment.
CS Energy has a long-term offtake agreement in place for 100% of the output of the asset, which is it is now on-selling to AMP Capital and other large commercial and industrial customers, including a trio of Queensland universities.
The deal with AMP Capital will allow the Sydney-based investment manager to satisfy the electricity demands of the property portfolio it manages in Queensland with 100% renewable energy.
The retail agreement includes the Indooroopilly Shopping Centre, the Gasworks Plaza and the Brickworks Marketplace, the Milton Green office complex, the Acacia Gate Industrial Park, along with other real estate assets managed by AMP Capital in Queensland. The deal also applies to Pacific Fair Shopping Centre, which is now managed by The GPT Group.
AMP Capital’s Senior Sustainability Manager Erik Moore said the deal with CS Energy marks a significant milestone in delivering on the company’s commitment to achieve long-term sustainable outcomes across the real estate assets it manages.
“The signing of this power purchase agreement, along with two others in NSW/ACT and Victoria which have all now come into effect, represents a huge step towards AMP Capital’s 2030 sustainability strategy target of net zero carbon with 20 assets supplied by 100% renewable electricity,” he said.
AMP Capital also has PPAs in place with energy retailers SmartestEnergy and Diamond Energy. The electricity procured through the SmartestEnergy contract is linked to a solar farm near Numurkah in Victoria, while the Diamond Energy deal is linked to solar farms in central NSW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/06/incentives-for-off-peak-charging-of-electric-vehicles-could-ease-stress-on-the-australian-grid/,"EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 6, 2023",Incentives for off-peak charging of electric vehicles could ease stress on the Australian grid,"The scenario is based on a high population and an EV penetration rate of 98% of total cars in Australia. Figure 1 displays the projected number of EVs by state and user type under these conditions.

The growing popularity of EVs presents a challenge for the electricity market as many EV owners prefer to charge their vehicles during evening peak hours, causing a surge in demand. To prevent overwhelming the grid, it is crucial that EV owners be encouraged to charge during hours of high renewable generation, such as mid-day or early morning.
A considerable share of the charging load for EVs by 2052 is expected to come from trucks, which drive an average of 79 thousand kilometres per year. Offering financial incentives for off-peak charging to fleets could alleviate the stress on the network, reduce the need for power grid upgrades and save truck drivers a significant amount of money.
Figure 2 uses New South Wales (NSW) as an example of what could happen if the scale of EV charging is not properly managed. Our data shows there will be an 8 GW total demand for EV peak charging by 2052. This is compared to the current 10 GW evening peak in NSW.
“The golden era of internal combustion engine cars is coming to an end, and we must start planning for the increased load on the grid from electric vehicles. To ensure the energy grid is not overwhelmed, it will be essential to encourage charging during non-peak hours,” Mojtaba Jabbari Ghadi, Energy consultant at Cornwall Insight Australia, said.
“With truck drivers accounting for 60% of demand by 2052, focusing on this smaller but high-impact group instead of a vast number of passenger car users is a potential solution to lower grid stress.
“Properly implemented financial incentives can offer a win-win for both the electricity grid and consumers by easing pressure on the system and potentially saving drivers thousands of dollars.”

Industry Minister Ed Husic formally launched consultations for the National Battery Strategy during a visit to Energy Renaissance’s lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility, at Tomago in the New South Wales Hunter Valley.
“Our general approach should be one where if we mine it here, we should make it here,” he said.
“Large-scale uptake and manufacture of batteries will be vital transitioning to net zero. New battery capacity will help support grid-scale capacity, power our homes, and electrify our transport sector.”
Global demand for battery energy storage systems is forecast to increase “nine to 10-fold over the next decade” Husic said, pointing to modelling by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
The United States-based analyst estimates that 387 GW of new energy storage will be added globally by 2030. In Australia, the energy market operator predicts that storage capacity will increase to 15 GW by 2030, ramping up to 61 GW by 2050.
“We know there is huge demand for energy storage to support the widespread uptake of solar generation by households, business and industry,” Husic said.
“That’s why it is important that we harness the opportunity to become a key player in battery manufacturing and export on the world stage.”
Australia has a strong position in the mining of battery raw materials, but the federal government has estimated the nation is only realising 0.5% of the value of global battery production, missing out on vital opportunities in refining and further downstream in the value chain.

Husic said expanding Australia’s battery manufacturing capability provides the country with a unique opportunity to be a world leader in an industry that will create jobs and attract investment.
Analysis delivered by professional services company Accenture shows there are an estimated 34,700 jobs and $7.4 billion (USD 5.12 billion) in value to be made in Australia from battery technology and industries.
“Australia has globally significant deposits of essential battery materials and strong local innovation and research capabilities. By drawing on these strengths, Australia can take its place in the profitable global battery supply chain,” Husic said.
The minister also suggested that developing domestic battery industries will offer opportunities for states and territories to secure their energy security on a local level without the need to rely on “costly and vulnerable” international supply chains.
The issues paper highlights the current reliance on a battery production supply chain that is geographically concentrated in China, warning that it is “complex and at high risk of disruption.”
“China currently holds the largest market share of battery production at most stages of the supply chain, particularly in the EV battery market,” the paper reads. “It accounts for about 75% of the world’s production capacity for battery cells, 70% of cathode capacity, and 85% of anode capacity.”
“The consultations around the strategy are designed to find ways to get our country manufacturing Aussie batteries,” Husic said. “A coherent, national approach to the development and uptake of emerging technologies won’t just deliver economic growth and jobs, but also help safeguard our national wellbeing.”
The federal government said it will now work closely with states and territories, and consult widely with industry, community and experts to shape the national battery strategy.
Husic said it will be “a tight consultation of about four weeks” with submissions to close on March 3, 2023.

ACEN is the listed energy platform of Philippines-based Ayala Group, which has approximately 4 GW of generation capacity in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Australia, an estimated 87% of which is from renewables.
The company announced itself in the Australian market through the acquisition in 2021 of a majority share of UPC\AC Renewables, a 50:50 JV between ACEN and Hong Kong-headquartered clean energy group UPC Renewables. ACEN’s majority share in the JV was increased from 50% to 80% in 2022.
The acquisition has now been finalised, formally transforming the UPC\AC Renewables Australia JV into ACEN Australia, the company’s first wholly owned development and operating platform outside of the Philippines.
“This milestone establishes Australia as a stronghold for ACEN’s renewables expansion in the region,” ACEN International Chief Executive Officer Patrick Clausse said.
“Our organic operations and development team at ACEN Australia continues to harness the country’s outstanding potential for clean energy through their aggressive renewables push to reach 20 GW by 2030.”
“With New England solar nearing completion, Stubbo solar’s construction in full swing, and more than 8,000 MW in the pipeline, our clean energy mix has never been more robust.”
Clausse said the ACEN Australia platform has a development pipeline of more than 8 GW of renewables including solar, wind, pump hydro, and energy storage projects spanning NSW, Tasmania, Victoria, and South Australia.
This includes the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project near Dunedoo in NSW, the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, and a share in the 250 MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300 MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia.

Enphase Energy, known for its microinverters, has announced a successful demonstration of its first bidirectional EV charger, which enables vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) use.
The charger will work in conjunction with the Enphase Energy System, which includes IQ microinverters, the IQ Gateway and system controller. These are all managed by the Enphase app, where homeowners can see the flow of energy and see the level of charge of the EV battery.
By leveraging the power of the microinverter to convert DC power of the car to AC  power of the home, the bidirectional charger connects to EV, and both charges and discharges the car battery. The IQ microinverter converts DC power of the car to AC power of the home.
The Enphase bidirectional charger can be used in three ways:
The bidirectional charger requires 240 V AC, and it can connect directly to the grid or through IQ System Controller. Enphase cautions, however, that when connected directly to the grid, some V2H features are disabled. The company says that its EV charger is expected to work with electric vehicles that support stands such as CCS (combined charging system) and the Japanese charging standard, CHAdeMO.  At present, separate demonstration prototypes are made for CCS and CHAdeMO. It supports 200 VDC to 1000 VDC for EV batteries.
Enphase is working with EV manufacturers to bring this revolutionary technology to market. A time frame for release has not been announced.

Honda has revealed plans to launch an all-new fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) based on the CR-V 5-seater SUV next year. The Japanese company said it will also sell its fuel cell systems in the open market to promote its hydrogen fuel cell systems, in cooperation with General Motors. This will allow it to reach economies of scale. Honda said fuel cell stack costs should become comparable with diesel engines by 2030, at about one-third to half of current costs. “We have identified four core domains we will focus on during the early phase of our hydrogen business: Honda FCEV models, commercial vehicles, stationary power stations and construction machinery,” said Arata Ichinose, head of business development at Honda. The company will also collaborate with original equipment manufacturers on commercial vehicles and construction machinery in Japan and China. 
Morocco “is well positioned” to become a regional leader in the green hydrogen economy, ranking alongside the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Chile as the five countries most likely to produce cost-competitive green hydrogen, wrote the Atlantic Council. North Africa has the potential to become the world’s foremost producer of green hydrogen, should Europe channel significant investments. “Algeria has the largest wind energy potential on the continent – approximately 7,700 GW if fully developed – and released plans to expand renewable energy production to 15 GW by 2035, with an annual growth rate of 1 GW. Mauritania’s combined solar and wind potential exceeds 500 GW if fully developed,” said the US think tank.
Air Liquide and TotalEnergies has decided to set up an equally owned joint venture to develop a network of hydrogen stations for heavy-duty vehicles on major European road corridors. “The partners aim to deploy more than 100 hydrogen stations on major European roads – in France, Benelux, and Germany – in the coming years,” said Air Liquide. The French groups said they will invest in the stations and produce hydrogen from the market. 
Alstom has announced a passenger service demonstration project for its Coradia iLint hydrogen-powered train in Canada, in partnership with the provincial government of Quebec, Chemin de fer Charlevoix, Train de Charlevoix, Harnois Énergies, and HTEC. “The province of Quebec will be the first jurisdiction in the Americas to run a train with zero direct emissions powered by green hydrogen,” said the French company. 
The French government has announced €126 million ($196 million) of aid for 14 territorial hydrogen ecosystems, within the call launched in 2020. A new call for projects will take place in 2023. “The objective is to continue the deployment of hydrogen ecosystems, particularly for industrial uses,” said the French government. The new call for projects will be launched after a consultation in February.
Plug Power and Johnson Matthey have announced a long-term strategic partnership to accelerate the green hydrogen economy. Johnson Matthey will become a strategic supplier of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) components, providing a portion of Plug Power’s demand for catalysts, membranes, and catalyst-coated membranes (CCM). “Plug and Johnson Matthey will co-invest in what is expected to be the largest (5 GW scaling to 10 GW over time) CCM manufacturing facility in the world,” said Plug Power. “The facility will be built in the United States and likely begin production in 2025.”
