QEM said the bidding process to deliver the 1 GW capacity project had generated strong interest and commercial negotiations with the shortlisted parties will commence later this month.
QEM Managing Director Gavin Loyden said the company had prioritised the design and development of the renewables project with the primary objective of obtaining low-cost power for its flagship Julia Creek project.
“Critical minerals like vanadium are vital for the global transition to clean energy,” he said. “The opportunity for QEM and the broader North West Minerals Province is to harness the region’s wind and solar resource above the ground to explore, develop and refine the critical minerals under it.”
The proposed wind and solar project would not only deliver energy to the proposed mine but also connect into the $5 billion CopperString transmission line that is to link Queensland’s isolated northwest to Australia’s national grid.
The transmission project, being delivered by Queensland government-owned network operator Powerlink, is expected to link an estimated 6 GW of renewable energy resources into the National Electricity Market while also opening up access to large deposits of minerals seen as key to the energy transition.
Colin Langton, director of operations of the CopperString project at Powerlink said the “scale of renewable generation at Julia Creek will be integral to the overall CopperString project.”
“With the high quality and enormous potential scale of renewables in the area, the north and northwest is well positioned to become the future powerhouse of Queensland,” he said.
QEM said it has been conducting wind and solar monitoring at the Julia Creek site for the past 12 months to de-risk the hybrid wind and solar project. Environmental assessments, topographic surveys, preliminary flood modelling and geotechnical studies have also been completed.
Loyden said the “highly encouraging” monitoring results would form a crucial component of the pre-feasibility study for the proposed renewables project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/03/green-gravity-links-with-miner-to-fast-track-gravity-energy-storage-tech/,"STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 3, 2023",Green Gravity links with miner to fast track gravity energy storage tech,"Green Gravity and Western Australia-headquartered mining contractor RUC have executed a Memorandum of Understanding which will see the parties collaborate on the technical opportunities, data insights and commercial arrangements associated with gravitational energy storage systems.
Green Gravity, based at Wollongong on the New South Wales South Coast, aims to use gravity to generate clean, dispatchable energy. Its technology relies on lifting and lowering ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts and in doing so, turning a turbine that creates electricity – essentially providing an alternative to pumped hydro or batteries without the need for water or chemicals.
Green Gravity founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Swinnerton said the company’s energy storage technology “represents a breakthrough in the search for economic long-duration storage of renewable energy.”
“Green Gravity is bringing new technology to an existing population of mineshafts,” he said. “By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low. By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”

Swinnerton said the partnership with RUC brings together the mining contractor’s capability in shaft sinking and mineshaft hoisting operations with Green Gravity’s technology, a combination which he believes “has the potential to significantly accelerate and to improve the deployment of gravitational energy storage systems into mineshafts.”
“With detailed design underway for our commercial-scale energy storage system, integrating the global scale and innovative thinking of RUC to areas like the vertical transit system and mine winder design will generate superior outcomes for the technology,” he said.
The signing of the MoU follows Green Gravity’s recent announcement that it would partner with BlueScope to build a 12-metre-tall prototype at the steel manufacturer’s Port Kembla Steelworks. The research and development facility will also include a digital twin that can be used to test new components or hypothesis before they are trialled in the physical world.
“The … lab will enable power generation capacity and efficiency to be validated in addition to data that will support Green Gravity technology to connect to the power grid at large-scale,” Swinnerton said. “This allows us to have great confidence in the mine site and convince the mining operators to say, ‘It’s working over here’, and that’s a way of building confidence.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/03/company-developing-neighbourhood-battery-portfolio-looks-to-reform-tariffs-connection-criteria/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 3, 2023","Company developing neighbourhood battery portfolio looks to reform tariffs, connection criteria","A relatively unknown developer ACEnergy is joining the influx of companies developing community or, more accurately, neighbourhood batteries. Its initial 50MW/100MWh distribution battery portfolio is currently undergoing planning studies, with 10 batteries in the “advanced stage” of development, and a further 10 units in early stages.
The company is also engaging network companies in an effort to reform connection processes on the medium voltage distribution network to which the portfolio will be connected. “The assessment criteria currently focus on battery charge demand occurring during times of network peak demand, which is highly unlikely to happen in practice, as batteries will typically charge when demand is low but generation is high,” the company said.
ACEnergy is not the first to point out battery technology can reduce the need for grid augmentation by offering network support as well as providing greater capacity for the flow of rooftop solar energy.
The company is preparing to apply for upcoming rounds of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) community battery funding. Under the program, ARENA has been allocated $171 million (USD 113 million) to deliver at least 342 neighbourhood batteries across Australia. The scheme has driven a surge in interest in the battery segment, with many companies announcing funded ‘community’ batteries in the last weeks.
ACEnergy told pv magazine Australia it has picked locations in Victoria and New South Wales where its batteries can “work in concert with local grid demand,” reducing network stresses and ultimately increasing network capacity. 
It says it is providing networks with copies of its internal modelling, demonstrating storage’s capability to operate in response to grid needs, thus not adding to peaks. “We are also collaborating with network companies to integrate the BESS [battery energy storage systems] with smart control systems such as operating envelopes, which once implemented, would provide networks with a degree of control over the BESS,” the company said.
ACEnergy is also hoping to inspire reforms around the tariff structure regarding charge and discharge periods for batteries. Distribution networks have recently introduced trial tariffs to incentivise distributed batteries to operate as “solar sponges” by charging during peak solar periods and discharging during evening peaks, according to the company. “However, these tariffs limit storage operations outside these specified times, discouraging charging during overnight off-peak periods for discharge within the morning peaks.”
“This limitation reduces the ability of storage systems to access a second daily cycle and prevents BESSs playing a more active role in the grid by reducing the magnitude of morning peak demand periods, and in turn lowering wholesale prices and pressure on network assets.”
Even though most power overnight comes from thermal generation at the moment, the company says such reforms would ultimately help decarbonisation as the availability of storage during morning peaks would lessen demand on network assets, enabling electrification and reducing wholesale prices. 
“By failing to enable the flattening of the morning peak, networks would be increasing reliance on fossil fuels to supply the morning peak,” it added, noting that as more wind farms connect to the network, the availability to renewable energy at night should increase.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/03/genex-lands-45-million-funding-package-for-pumped-hydro-and-solar-and-battery-projects/,"FINANCE,PUMPED HYDRO,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 3, 2023",Genex lands $45 million funding package for pumped hydro and solar and battery projects,"Genex said the $44.5 million (USD 29.63 million) structured funding package will be used to shore up financing for the company’s flagship 250 MW/2 GWh Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro project in northern Queensland and to develop its multi-stage Bulli Creek solar and battery project near Toowoomba.
J-Power, which is among Genex’s largest shareholders following a $25 million equity investment announced in 2019, has agreed to provide a corporate loan facility of $35 million as a standby source of funding for the 250 MW, eight-hour pumped hydro project.
Genex said the funding may not be needed but in the wake of a drilling incident late last year that set construction back, the replenishment of the project contingency is considered prudent to ensure the project remains on track for energisation in 2024.
It was estimated the incident, which resulted in water unexpectedly leaking into a tunnel, added $10 million to $15 million to the project’s cost.
“While the costs of the water ingress event at the Kidston pumped storage hydro project last year have been fully funded, we consider it prudent that additional funding is secured against any further unforeseen events during the balance of the construction program,” Genex Chief Executive Officer James Harding said in a statement. “The loan facility with J-Power gives us significant buffer to complete the construction of the project.”
On top of the loan facility, J-Power will also establish a joint development fund for Genex’s Bulli Creek solar and battery project which is expected to be developed in five stages. The first stage will entail the delivery of a 400 MW/1,600 MWh big battery. while the second proposed stage would deliver a 475 MW to 675 MW solar project.
The joint development agreement gives J-Power a 50% interest in the project courtesy of upfront acquisition funding of $2.5 million and a further $6 million in upfront funding for third party development costs. J-Power has also entered into a development funding agreement with Genex and will contribute $1 million to cover early costs of the project.
Once the initial funding has been utilised, ongoing third-party development costs for Bulli Creek will be funded by both companies on a 50:50 basis.
Harding said the agreement extends the strategic partnership initiated via co-development of the 258 MW Kidston Stage 3 wind project and reaffirms Genex’s relationship with J-Power as it continues to expand its portfolio of renewable energy generation and storage assets in Australia.
“This funding will be instrumental in fuelling the growth of our renewable energy portfolio in Australia,” he said. “In addition to the loan facility, the joint development agreement for the Bulli Creek Project will allow us to fast-track development activities at this exciting project, which represents the next phase in the company’s growth.”

The funding announcement comes just days after Genex completed the energisation of its first large-scale battery, the 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe project, near Rockhampton in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/03/totalenergies-gentari-to-co-develop-100-mw-queensland-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE,MALAYSIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 3, 2023","TotalEnergies, Gentari to co-develop 100 MW Queensland solar farm","TotalEnergies and Gentari Renewables have turned their immediate focus to Australia after inking a strategic collaboration agreement to develop renewable energy projects in the Asia Pacific region.
The first project to be developed as part of the collaborative arrangement will be the 100 MW Pleasant Hills solar project planned for near Roma in Queensland’s southwest.
Neither TotalEnergies or Gentari provided any details about the PV project itself, saying only that the facility will supply solar power to the gas production and processing facilities of the Santos-led Gladstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.
TotalEnergies and Petronas each hold a 27.5% stake in Gladstone LNG, South Korea’s Kogas holds 15%, while Australian oil and gas major Santos operates the project with a 30% stake.
The wider agreement is for the joint development of renewable energies in the Asia-Pacific region, potentially leaving the way open for more collaborative projects in the future. The companies already collaborate on upstream operations in eight markets around the world.
“Through this strategic collaboration agreement, we are paving the way for very concrete action plans ranging from implementing best practices to eliminate methane emissions, to energy efficiency and electrification with low carbon power,” said Julien Pouget, senior vice president Asia Pacific for exploration and production and renewables at TotalEnergies. “The 100 MW Pleasant Hills solar project, which will contribute to lowering the emissions of Gladstone LNG, is a first material implementation of this agreement.”
The clean energy collaboration is just the latest for TotalEnergies as part of its ambition to get to net zero by 2050.
The company said its gross renewable electricity generation installed capacity is now 18 GW and it is targeting 35 GW of gross production capacity from renewable sources and storage by 2025, before expanding to 100 GW by 2030.
Gentari Chief Executive Offcier Sushil Purohit said the partnership with TotalEnergies will “provide a new momentum” for the Malaysian company’s own net-zero efforts and will help “build the right ecosystem for growth in clean energy and net-zero solutions.”
“To achieve our joint decarbonisation goals, it is critical to harness all our capabilities, capacity and resources efficiently,” he said. “This includes optimising our existing partnerships and working to decarbonise our own business entities.”
Gentari announced its entry into the Australian market earlier this year with the purchase of Wirsol Energy and its Australian assets from Germany-based renewable energy group Wircon.
The portfolio included 422 MW of operational solar and storage projects and nearly double that in development.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/03/test-shows-higher-yield-lower-degradation-for-n-type-solar-modules/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 3, 2023","Test shows higher yield, lower degradation for n-type solar modules","The PV manufacturing industry’s shift to n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells is well underway, with the previous generation of p-type PERC now expected to disappear from the market over the next few years.
And as more of these n-type productions make their way into commercial PV installations around the world, the industry is keen to see how well they live up to the claims of higher efficiency, better performance, and lower degradation rates that have driven the rapid switch on the manufacturing side.
The National Photovoltaic Quality Inspection Center in China is the latest to publish results illustrating n-type module performance in the field. The center took 20 PV modules – 10 n-type TOPCon and 10 p-type PERC – from Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar and conducted a test to compare their performance under identical installation conditions.
The modules, all bifacial models consisting of 144 half cells, were first measured in the lab, and then installed on fixed-tilt mounting structures at a 40-degree angle, at a site in Yinchuan, north-western China.

The energy generation of the modules was monitored with a DC meter at 1-minute intervals from September 2022 up until March 2023. Using data from both the lab and outdoor measurements, the group calculated the energy yield per watt for each technology by dividing their cumulative power generation by the average test power times module quantity.
Image: CPVT
After seven months installed, the results showed that the n-type modules (Group 1 in the chart above) achieved a 3.69% gain in energy yield compared to the PERC products. The modules were also monitored for degradation, going through laboratory characterization tests before and after the seven-month installation period.
These calculations, based on dividing the initial power minus the post-installation power by the initial test power, showed an average annual degradation rate of 0.51% for the TOPCon products, compared with 1.38% for the PERC products.
