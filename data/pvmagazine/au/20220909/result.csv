https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/09/aemc-recommends-rule-changes-to-ready-gas-grid-for-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",AEMC recommends rule changes to ready gas grid for hydrogen,"The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has recommended to state and federal energy ministers that changes be made to the national gas and retail regulatory frameworks to allow for the eventual shipping of hydrogen and renewable gas through existing gas pipelines.
AEMC chair Anna Collyer said improvements to the regulatory framework will lay the foundations for the development of a decarbonised gas sector and keep Australia firmly at the forefront of reform in the hydrogen industry.
“From our perspective at the AEMC, hydrogen is fascinating because of the way it uniquely intersects with both gas and electricity markets. It’s a future source of renewable fuel, but it’s also set to become the largest industrial customer for electricity in the National Energy Market’s history,” she said.
“Hydrogen has the potential to deliver solutions we need for a net-zero future, and by extending the regulatory frameworks, we allow participants to develop their business and facilitate innovation.”
The recommendations come after the federal and state energy ministers last year tasked the AEMC with a review of the regulatory frameworks to ensure that Australia is in a position to leverage its potential as a producer, user and exporter of hydrogen.
In its final report published this week the AEMC said the proposed draft rules are “critical steps toward the development of a national hydrogen and renewable gas industry”.
Should the commission’s recommendations be endorsed by the energy ministers, rules would be established to allow hydrogen blends and renewable gases to be supplied through the existing distribution systems to appliances in homes and businesses.
While hydrogen has different properties to natural gas, research has found that blends of about 10% hydrogen could already be used in most existing appliances.

The capacity for hydrogen to be blended into the existing gas network is already being demonstrated with Australian Gas Network (AGN) injecting green hydrogen produced at its Hydrogen Park South Australia production facility into its gas distribution network in Adelaide.
The facility, which came online last year, is delivering a blend of approximately 5% renewable hydrogen and natural gas to 700 homes in the Adelaide suburb of Mitchell Park. AGN is aiming to supply an additional 3,000 homes by the end of 2022. AGN aims to deliver 10% blended renewable gas by 2030 and 100% renewable gas by 2040.
A similar project is also operating in New South Wales where energy infrastructure company Jemena has commenced injecting green hydrogen into the state’s gas network.
Jemena said an estimated 23,500 residential customers and more than 100 commercial and industrial customers are receiving green hydrogen produced at its Western Sydney Green Hydrogen Hub as part of their gas mix.
The AEMC said submissions on its recommended draft rules will be accepted until 13 October 2022 with the final initial rules due to be presented to energy ministers in November.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/09/envirostream-turns-up-volume-on-battery-recycling-deal-with-lg/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Envirostream turns up volume on battery recycling deal with LG,"ASX-listed Lithium Australia has announced its battery recycling unit has expanded its existing partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to recycle a minimum of 250 tonnes of lithium-ion batteries in the next 12 months, boosting its processing activities by an estimated 25% per annum.
Under the terms of the agreement, LGES will deliver spent lithium-ion batteries to Envirostream’s recycling facilities in the Melbourne suburb of Laverton for processing with the recovered materials to be repurposed into new energy storage solutions.
With supplies of critical battery minerals, including nickel, cobalt, manganese and particularly lithium, struggling to keep up with growing global demand, recycling of spent batteries allows for those metals to be reused.
Envirostream said its technology can recover more than 90% of the resources from end-of-life batteries. This includes steel, copper, aluminium and most significantly the critical battery metals which are amalgamated into a mixed metal dust (MMD). The company said the recovered MMD allows the active metals to be repurposed into new lithium-ion battery anode and cathode powders.
Envirostream general manager Andrew Mackenzie said the new agreement, which builds upon a deal signed in 2018 that allowed Envirostream to treat 85 tonnes of LGES-sourced batteries per annum, enables the company to receive additional LGES battery volumes and commence the recycling of these batteries with immediate effect.
“LG Energy shares our aspirations of an ethical and sustainable future for the global battery industry,” he said. “Making these batteries available to Envirostream for recycling demonstrates LG Energy’s commitment to our shared vision.”
The new agreement will cover an initial period that ends in August 2023. After that, the term would continue on a rolling six-month basis until terminated by either party.

Envirostream said it expects the revamped deal with LGES will significantly increase its collection and processing volumes over the coming year.
“These LGES volumes are in addition to current collection volumes and represent nearly 25% of Envirostream’s total collections during FY2022,” the company said.
Envirostream collected a total of 1,086 tonnes of spent batteries during the 2022 financial year but that rate has ramped up since the end of the financial year.
In May this year the company collected 90 tonnes of spent lithium-ion batteries, a month later 94 tonnes and in July it added 100 tonnes of end-of-life batteries to its stockpile.
As well as the agreement with LGES, Envirostream said it has also inked deals with retailers Bunnings, Officeworks and Battery World which are expected to increase collection rates even further.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/09/pv-powered-electrolysis-module-to-produce-hydrogen-from-moisture-in-air/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",PV-powered electrolysis module to produce hydrogen from moisture in air,"Researchers from the University of Melbourne and the University of Manchester in Britain have designed a direct air electrolysis (DAE) module to produce hydrogen for applications in remote areas.
The device uses moisture in the air to directly generate hydrogen via electrolysis, without any input of liquid water. The module consists of a water harvesting unit in the middle and electrodes on both sides paired with gas collectors. It can be paired with both photovoltaic and wind power generators, as well as with any generator relying on renewable energy sources.
The water harvesting unit also works as the reservoir to hold the electrolyte.
“Porous medium such as melamine sponge, sintered glass foam is soaked with deliquescent ionic substance to absorb moisture from the air via the exposed surfaces,” the scientists said. “The captured water in the liquid phase is transferred to the surfaces of the electrodes via diffusion and subsequently split into hydrogen and oxygen in situ which are collected separately as a pure gas, since both electrodes are isolated from air.”
The researchers said the reservoir between the endplate and the porous foam acts as an air barrier and a buffer for the ionic solution at the excessive fluctuation of the air humidity. They noted that it avoids the overflow of the electrolyte from the DAE module or the dry-up of the wetted foam.
“The foam filled with ionic solutions forms a physical barrier that effectively isolates hydrogen, oxygen, and air from any mixing,” they said.
The group built two prototypes relying on solar and wind power. They constructed the solar-driven free-standing hydrogen tower with a solar panel and five DAE modules stacked in parallel.
“The footprint of the tower is no more than the solar panel, meaning our DAE will not occupy extra land, which can be costly in some areas,” they said.
The proposed system configuration was tested for twelve days with an outdoor temperature varying from 20 C to 40 C and the relative humidity ranged from 20% to 40%. The device was able to produce around 1500 ml of hydrogen in a day and showed a Faradaic efficiency of around 95%. The Faradic efficiency is the measure of the efficiency with which the electrons participate in a given electrochemical transformation.
“After keeping the above DAE module unattended in air for eight months, the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen remains around 90%, without any maintenance,” the academics said. “The prototype achieved automated steady hydrogen production depending on the solar intensity under varying weather conditions.”
The scientists presented the novel tech in “Hydrogen production from the air,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
“Further improvement of the surface-to-volume ratio by engineering channels or increasing the aspect ratios of the sponge material will guarantee the rate of water uptake which is essential to the upscaling of the DAE units,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/09/australia-open-for-business-after-climate-bill-passes-parliament/,"LEGAL,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Australia ‘open for business’ after climate bill passes parliament,"The Labor Party’s climate change bill has officially passed parliament, paving the way for a 43% carbon emission reduction target by 2030 and goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 to become law.
The bill passed the Senate on Thursday afternoon, with amendments from independent senator David Pocock, before being passed by the House of Representatives hours later. It now only needs the signature of the Governor General to become law.
Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the passage of the bill provided certainty to investors and strengthened transparency and accountability for future governments.
“It’s the certainty that business and investors have been asking for,” he said. “It provides a message to renewable energy investors, storage investors and transmission investors right around the world that Australia is open for business.”
The legislation formalises Labor’s climate change agenda which includes a commitment to ensure Australia’s energy grid is comprised of 82% renewables by 2030.
It will update Australia’s climate obligations under the Paris Agreement, improving on the previous administration’s 26–28% target and committing to a 43% emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050.
It also includes increased accountability with the climate change minister to provide an annual update to parliament on the progress being made towards achieving the targets.
It also hands authority back to the Climate Change Authority to monitor Australia’s progress towards the targets, and advise on future climate goals, including the government’s 2035 emissions target. Agencies including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), Infrastructure Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility will embed amended targets in their objectives and functions.

“Legislating these targets gives certainty to investors and participants in the energy market and will help stabilise our energy system,” Bowen said. “It also strengthens transparency and accountability through the annual climate change statement and will ensure public debate informs government decisions.”
The move has been welcomed by several groups, including the Australian Energy Council, Business Council of Australia, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Management consultancy firm Partners in Performance (PiP) also welcomed the commitment to a more ambitious target for 2030 but warned the real work in transitioning to renewable sources of energy begins now.
In a nation where fossil fuels provided 67% of electricity in 2021, the faster pace to decarbonise will bring several challenges with it, said Rob Fowler, a partner in the Energy Transition practice at PiP.
“Australia is waking up to the challenges and the opportunities of rapidly reducing carbon emissions across the economy,” he said.
Fowler said the sentiment to decarbonise is there among investors, the technology is available, and Australia has the smarts to drive the transition faster and cheaper than we thought possible, but there is no time to waste.
“With just 87 months until 2030 begins, Australia has an enormous amount of work to do, and a huge dose of uncertainty to digest,” he said. “The sooner we get on with combining and deploying the finance, technology and smarts at our disposal, the sooner we will truly see the green mining, green metals and green basic chemicals that our net-zero future undoubtedly demands.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/09/queensland-expected-to-target-to-new-renewable-energy-mark/,"POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2022",Queensland expected to target to new renewable energy mark,"Queensland’s current renewable energy target is to meet half of the state’s domestic energy needs with renewables by 2030 but reports have emerged that despite having achieved less than half of its current objective, the government is considering setting a higher target.
The state’s existing target to reduce emissions by 50% by the end of the decade was set back in 2015 but electricity generation in Queensland continues to be dominated by coal.
Government data shows that in the 12 months to December 2021, renewables delivered just 20.4% of the state’s electricity generation. That share is about two-thirds of Australia’s average of 28% and is the lowest among Australian states and territories.
Despite that performance, News Corp publications have reported the government is now looking to create a more ambitious renewables goal as part of a 10-year energy strategy due for release within weeks.
The state government has issued no statement relating to the reports but has said the energy plan will help inform investors, communicate its overall vision for the transition to renewable energy and outline how the government will achieve its renewable energy target.
Queensland-based solar energy lobbyists Solar Citizens on Thursday welcomed the potential change to the renewables target, saying the state needs to go further and faster.
“At the moment Queensland is only getting about 20% of our energy from renewables, while other states are rushing ahead, like Tasmania that operates on almost 100% renewables and South Australia running at 66%,” Solar Citizens deputy director Stephanie Gray said.
“We really encourage the Queensland government to go beyond their 50% by 2030 renewable energy target to keep up to speed with the rest of the country and maximise opportunities in new clean export markets.”
Gray pointed to a recent report published by Accenture, saying it found Queensland could easily meet the existing 50% renewable energy target five years ahead of schedule. The report, commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation, Queensland Conservation Council and WWF-Australia, also concluded the state could reduce emissions by 60% below 2005 levels by 2030, and create more than 87,000 jobs through a package of policies focused on making the most of Queensland’s “abundance of clean energy sources”.

To achieve those targets, the report calls for the rapid rollout of an additional 25 GW of renewables by 2030, the deployment of 5 GW of both short and long-term duration storage and the gradual phasing out of coal power.
It also calls for the acceleration of rooftop solar and residential battery installations as well as electrification of gas connections. The report urges the government to fast track the development of a clean exports industry, to underwrite 6 GW of green hydrogen and establish a battery manufacturing fund.
The report suggests that if implement, the policies could support a workforce of ~87,000 people, including ~31,000 direct jobs in sustainable industries.
“Queensland’s current policies now cover many of the critical elements of a climate strategy, such as renewable energy and transport, and efforts have accelerated since 2017, but progress could be faster,” the report reads.
“Queensland has an opportunity to become a clean energy powerhouse,” the report reads, adding the state’s current policies cover many of the critical elements of a climate strategy, and efforts have accelerated since 2017, “but progress could be faster”.

Solar and wind power are expected to produce 40% of electricity by 2030, and the rising electrification of space heating and cooling will play a major role in those gains.
High-efficiency electric heat pumps will be the main technology driving reduced emissions from heating in the building sector, according to the agency’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario. New fossil fuel boilers are expected to be fully phased out by 2025.
Nordic European countries and France lead the market share of heat pumps, due to high end-user acceptance and awareness of their more competitive total life-cycle costs. In Sweden, 29% of heating demand from buildings is covered by heat pumps. In Finland, the corresponding figure is 15%.
In regions where heat pumps can meet demand for cooling as well as heating, like the United States and Japan, the technology also accounts for a large share of the heating market. In the United States, about 40% of new single-family homes are heated by heat pumps.
The European Commission’s REPowerEU plan suggests doubling the deployment rate of heat pumps to 10 million units within the next five years, in order to reduce the dependence on Russian natural gas.
In the United States, heat pumps have been identified as one of five key technologies in the Defence Production Act (DPA). The IEA recommends that taxes and subsidies should support the deployment of heat pumps, by shifting fees linked to higher saturation of renewable energy sources from electricity prices to fossil fuel prices, for example.
