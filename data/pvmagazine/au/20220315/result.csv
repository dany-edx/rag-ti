The Precinct would be Northern Australia’s first environmentally sustainable advanced manufacturing, technology and processing hub, the Townsville council says. The city council and the Queensland state government have both listed the development as a top priority. It is expected to create over 5,000 jobs in construction, a further 6,000 permanent ongoing jobs and 9,100 indirect jobs to follow once the precinct is in operation. 
“We need Australia to be a nation that makes things again,” federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese said.
With an election looming, Albanese pledged the funds in the hopes it might win hearts and minds in the state which swings conservative in federal elections. The additional funds would bring the total Commonwealth investment in the project to $34 million, Labor said.

Mayor of Townsville, Jenny Hill, welcomed the announcement. “This commitment from the alternative government of Australia to the people of Townsville will set our city up for sustained, long-term economic growth,” she said, calling on the current Coalition government to match the commitment.
In September, renewables developer Edify Energy became the first to be granted development approval to build and operate a green hydrogen production plant of up to 1 GW, as well as a behind-the-meter solar and battery storage facility within the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct. 

The Townsville City Council said two other companies have “signed up to establish themselves at the precinct.” The others include Queensland Pacific Minerals, which reportedly plans to produce battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulphate from a nickel-cobalt ore, and Imperium3 Townsville, which is seeking to develop an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facility, according to the council.
In January, research from the Victorian Hydrogen Hub found Northern Queensland (and Tasmania) would be the cheapest location to produce hydrogen.
“North Queensland has all the key ingredients to become a leader in renewable manufacturing and hydrogen production, including some of the country’s best solar and wind resources, critical mineral deposits in the North West Minerals Province and a skilled local workforce,” energy strategist for community group Solar Citizens said.

The award is the most recent in the string for the company, all for its Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser, or HERO technology. Last March, Star Scientific won a World Hydrogen Award, and in June its Chairman, Andrew Horvath, was selected by the global Sustainable Energy Council to be one of the eight leaders on its World Hydrogen Advisory Board.

The HERO technology works through a catalyst reaction which, upon contact with hydrogen and oxygen, goes from zero to over 700 degrees Celsius in three minutes. The promise of the technology, which is applied in the form of a coating substance, is as hydrogen demand activator. It makes the ‘future fuel’ easy and efficient to use as a heat source in existing spinning mass turbine systems.
“The Award is recognition of our ability to put renewable hydrogen into use with HERO today, to solve real energy challenges, and in particular the energy draw of the digital economy,” Horvath said. 
“The most logical, viable pathway to decarbonising our entire world is through technologies that address the heat and energy requirements across a products’ whole production process, and HERO does that.”
“We are absolutely thrilled that our HERO was selected as winner for these prestigious awards,” he added.
The South By Southwest (SXSW) are held annually in Texas and celebrate “the most innovative, creative, and inspirational work in their respective fields.” Past winners of the Innovation Awards include MasSpec Pen, Maestro: Empowering VR Storytelling Through Social Collaboration, Swarm AI, and Butterfly iQ.

While the project’s capacity has not been revealed, Octopus Australia LinkedIn post on the news  said the park “will be a multi-$billion project and will deploy various technologies at utility scale.”
The project is intended to help replace the capacity that will be lost when EnergyAustralia’s nearby Yallourn coal power station closes in 2028.

Hostplus, which today announced its commitment to net zero by 2050, will invest in the project’s development via an Octopus Australia-managed platform. The superfund, one of Australia’s largest with over $76 billion in funds under management, has not revealed how much it will put into the project, but its investment will sit alongside the government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s (CEFC) contribution of up to $8.5 million.
As pv magazine Australia reported in August last year, Octopus Australia and CEFC formed a joint venture with what seems to have a particular focus on renewable energy projects in the Gippsland region. Under the partnership, the pair bought the rights to develop projects from Melbourne-based management team Solis Renewable Energy, along with Gippsland-based Marathon Electrical and construction firm WK & MA Ferguson.

The two projects reported on at the time included the proposed 44MW Perry Bridge Solar Farm and the nearby 80MW Fulham Solar Farm. It is unclear whether the rights to the  Gippsland Renewable Energy Park were also purchased at the time or at a later date, but they are now definitively owned by Octopus and CFEC. 
The 3000-hectare (30 square kilometres) project site is in the heart of the proposed Gippsland Renewable Energy Zone, and will presumably seek to deploy utility-scale solar, wind and battery storage before exploring the possibility of generating green hydrogen.
Victoria’s Gippsland region has a rich history in energy generation, producing approximately 85% of Victoria’s electricity, though it is undergoing a transition with the decline of coal-based generation.

Octopus Australia, a subsidiary of the UK-based Octopus Group, appears to want to be at the forefront of that particular region’s transformation. Having entered the Australian market over four years ago, it currently manages more than $1 billion in assets under construction and operations on behalf of its investors. Octopus Group in total has invested more than $6 billion deployed across more than 300 projects. 
Octopus Australia estimates the construction and development of the Gippsland Renewable Energy Park will generate several hundred jobs in the region, which has been hit by bushfires and the decline of both the local timber and coal industries.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/15/paving-the-way-for-green-hydrogen-certification/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 15, 2022",Paving the way for green hydrogen certification,"From pv magazine Global
The decarbonising end-use sectors working group at the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has provided a set of key recommendations for the creation of green hydrogen certificates and standards.
In the document “Decarbonising End-use Sectors: Green Hydrogen Certification,” the group of experts stressed the importance of relying on independent third parties for the verification of all data on the green hydrogen tracking systems, as well as on objective and public disclosure standards.
Two main models were identified for the future certification scheme: a “book and claim” system that is mostly applied to renewable electricity, in which the claim on consuming renewable energy booked by an energy provider is separate from the physical flow; and a “mass balancing” system that is commonly utilised for biofuels, in which a physical link between the production and consumption of green energy must always be proved.
“By granting consumers fully reliable information on the hydrogen supplied to them, such a tracking system can incentivise companies to commit to using green hydrogen, create social interest, and promote consumer information, and therefore have the potential to accelerate the clean energy transition,” the report reads. “The standardisation of these certificates can also allow and support the development of green hydrogen trading and accelerate the emergence and establishment of an international market.”
The document also highlighted the difficulty of implementing common regulations on a global scale and the possibility that several communication issues may arise between the systems of different countries. “Transparency issues may come up if information on the production process and transport, particularly relating to links with non-renewables, is not clearly traced, documented, and stated,” the IRENA experts noted.
Four main requirements were outlined for the certification of hydrogen produced by renewable energy sources: A temporal correlation ensuring that the electricity used for the electrolysis is renewable; a geographical correlation, requiring some degree of physical link, for the hydrogen production; avoiding higher shares of fossil-generated electricity elsewhere in the electricity system; and specifications providing full transparency and information on the resources used.
Furthermore, carbon emissions should be considered for each kilogram of green hydrogen along the entire value chain, from production to transport. “Nevertheless, a degree of flexibility in regard to the geographical, temporal and additionality requirements should be taken into account in the short term to ensure that the nascent green hydrogen market can develop,” the document notes.

India added 3.17GW of solar power in the fourth quarter of 2021, and about 80% (2.5GW) of the total was utility-scale capacity. Around 16% (520MW) was rooftop solar, while just 4% (120MW) was off-grid PV capacity, according to Bridge To India’s latest quarterly report.
The nation’s cumulative installed PV capacity stood at 50.5GW by Dec. 31, 2021. This included 40.4GW of utility-scale, 8.57GW of rooftop solar, and 1.47GW of off-grid capacity. Total project capacity in pipeline (projects allocated to developers and at various stages of development) stood at 63.3GW.
Bridge To India analysts expect the first quarter of 2022 to see PV capacity additions surge to 3.7GW as developers rush their installations before PV module costs go up due to the imposition of a basic customs duty from April 1.
“Total EPC cost for utility-scale solar increased from INR 31.19/Wp to INR 33.14/Wp in Q4 2021 on account of increase in goods and services tax (GST) from 5% to 12%. Cost is expected to further shoot up in Q2 2022 due to imposition of 40% basic customs duty on modules,” according to the report.
“Prices for mono-PERC modules, currently at US$0.27/Wp, are likely to remain relatively firm over (the) next two quarters and fall gradually by end of the year due to strong global demand and persistent supply chain constraints in China,” added Bridge To India.
