YEC, a partnership between the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation and Philippines-based energy giant ACEN Corporation, said the immediate focus of the MOU is on “rapidly exploring” the potential development of a solar power generation facility for the supply of energy to Rio.
Initially, this is expected to involve the development of a PV project of between 75 MW and 150 MW near Karratha, in addition to approximately 300 MW of solar projects the miner is currently assessing.
Rio is seeking to develop about 600 MW to 700 MW of renewable generation to replace four gas-fired generators that power its Pilbara operations and generate about a third of its annual carbon output in Australia.
Simon Trott, chief executive of Rio’s iron ore division, said the company recognised it had a large carbon footprint in the Pilbara and was focused on repowering its operations with renewable energy through the end of the decade and beyond.
“The Pilbara is blessed with abundant year-round sunshine and strong winds at night, making it one of the most attractive places to harness solar and wind power for energy generation,” he said.

Rio said the collaboration opportunities currently being explored with YEC would, if progressed, be complementary to renewable energy developments on the company’s iron ore electricity grid.
YEC, which was launched in June to progress the development of major renewable energy projects on Yindjibarndi Ngurra (country) – an area covering approximately 13,000 square kilometres – plans to develop more than 3 GW of wind, solar and battery storage.
As part of the deal with ACEN, the Yindjibarndi people would get equity participation of 25% to 50% in all projects and give them approval rights for site selection. Yindjibarndi-owned businesses would be given preferred contractor status.
YEC’s initial plans include a first stage target of 750 MW of combined wind, solar, and battery storage with construction to commence within the next few years.

The corporation said the collaboration opportunities being considered by YEC and Rio relate to some of these Stage 1 projects.
ACEN International chief executive Patrice Clausse said in a statement that the agreement with Rio is a milestone towards the development of sustainable renewable energy development on Yindjibarndi Ngurra.
“It is the perfect blend of traditional significance and modern technology, designed to harness the limitless potential of the Pilbara’s sun and wind, while respecting the deep-rooted connection of the Yindjibarndi people with their land,” he said.
“Together, we are crafting an energy future that is not only renewable, but also renewing, by empowering local communities and contributing to a greener future.”
Rio aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 across its global operations, with approximately $11.87 billion (USD 7.5 billion) planned to be spent on decarbonisation projects. Australia’s largest iron ore exporter estimates it will need to ramp up its renewable generation to 1 GW in the Pilbara to help achieve the target.

The Everleigh Solar Park is planned for a 209-hectare site located about 20 kilometres south of Chinchilla in the state’s Western Downs region. The project is less than 10 km south of the recently commissioned 204 MW Edenvale Solar Park that was also developed by DPI Group before being purchased by oil giant Eneos Corporation in a joint venture with fellow company Sojitz Corporation.
Everleigh is to comprise approximately 215,000 solar panels mounted on a single-axis tracking system. The facility will connect to the grid via Queensland network operator Powerlink’s existing Orana substation and is expected to generate enough clean energy to power more than 40,000 homes.
No date for the start of construction has been provided but the proponents said they expect it will take 18 months to build the solar farm which the federal government said has been approved following assessment under Australia’s environment law, with strict conditions to protect koala habitat.
Everleigh is the third large-scale renewables project to be approved by the federal government this month.
Earlier in the month, Sydney-headquartered developer Edify Energy secured approval for its 600 MW Smoky Creek Solar Farm in central Queensland. Soon after, the Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub in Victoria and set to include one of the world’s largest batteries at 1.2 GW / 2.4 GWh and a 12.5 MW solar farm, was given the tick of approval.
Plibersek said the latest approval is another step towards building a renewables future and achieving the government’s clean energy ambitions, which include the target of 82% of renewable electricity generation in the national grid by 2030.
“Australians know we need to act now and they’re doing their part – more than three million households now have solar panels on their roofs. But they expect the government to do its part too,” she said.
“That’s why we’re boosting renewables and putting Australia back on track to become a renewable energy superpower.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/23/preferred-partners-named-for-593-million-hydrogen-project-in-whyalla/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 23, 2023",Preferred partners named for $593 million hydrogen project in Whyalla,"The South Australia (SA) government has named a consortium comprising the Australian arm of Canada’s ATCO and Britain-based industrial gas and engineering group BOC as preferred partners to build a 250 MW hydrogen production facility, 200 MW hydrogen power plant and a hydrogen storage facility at Whyalla in the Upper Spencer Gulf.
The state government said the ATCO Australia and BOC consortium has committed to an early contractor involvement (ECI) agreement which will see the proponent undertake detailed project and engineering design, procurement of critical equipment, finalise contracting arrangements, and cost estimations.
The state has also entered into an ECI agreement with Adelaide-headquartered energy infrastructure company Epic Energy to develop a hydrogen storage solution and transmission pipeline for the project, providing connections for production expansion and industrial offtake.
SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said the Whyalla project would help unlock pipelines of renewable energy developments and business opportunities while the clean hydrogen could be used to firm up the state’s electricity grid and.
“This is a world-leading opportunity for South Australia, that has the potential to rival Victoria’s gold rush, the coal boom in Queensland, or Western Australia’s development of iron ore and gas,” he said.
“We have all the things the world will need to decarbonise – abundant copper and magnetite, the world’s best coincident wind and solar resources, world-leading renewable energy penetration and soon, the ability to harness this abundant clean energy in the form of hydrogen.”
The state government said the ATCO and BOC consortium was chosen to deliver the hydrogen plant – set to commence operation in early 2026 – from 29 proposals received from companies worldwide.
“The ATCO and BOC consortium stood out as the preferred proponent, with an end-to-end solution encompassing design and build experience in electrolysers, generators, on-site storage as well as operational expertise,” it said.
ATCO Australia Chief Executive Officer John Ivulich said the Whyalla plant, which will be the first in the world to deploy 100% hydrogen-operated fast-startup turbines, will be the largest of its type in the world.
“This project will be transformational for the community, customers and the country,” he said.
The Whyalla plant is the centrepiece of the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub being developed in the Upper Spencer Gulf. The hub is expected to become a major green hydrogen export hub.
The SA and federal governments last month announced a $100 million commitment to develop common-user infrastructure at Port Bonython, about 16 kilometres from Whyalla, such as upgrades to the deep-sea terminal, pipelines, storage facilities and access roads as it looks to transform the site into a multi-user export-focused precinct for green hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/23/synchronous-condensers-to-form-heart-of-transmission-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,NEW SOUTH WALES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 23, 2023",Synchronous condensers to form heart of transmission project,"New South Wales (NSW) transmission network owner Transgrid said the synchronous condensers are a centrepiece of the 900-kilometre EnergyConnect project that will link the power grids across three states, supporting the development of new wind, solar and energy storage projects.
Transgrid, one of two transmission network operators delivering the EnergyConnect high-voltage interconnector, said the condensers will be installed at the Buronga substation which will act as the main hub for the connection between NSW, South Australia and Victoria.
Transgrid Executive General Manager of Major Projects Gordon Taylor said the condensers, which will rotate at a speed of 750 rpm and generate inertia of 7 MWs/MVA, will help maintain voltage on the transmission network and provide system resilience services such as inertia.
“These condensers will play a key role keeping the grid stable as we build the energy superhighway to make Australia’s transition to renewable energy possible,” he said.
The EnergyConnect project will link Robertstown, in South Australia’s mid-north to Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW via Buronga near Mildura in the state’s far west. An additional ‘spur’ link will connect Buronga to Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria. The interconnector will provide 800 MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions.
Transgrid’s Electrical Site Manager Jason Scott described the arrival of the condensers as “a huge milestone”, noting that transporting the condensers had been a major logistical effort with four prime movers needed to transport the two lower halves of the condensers which weigh 110 tonnes each and the rotor units which weigh 85 tonnes.
“Having them arrive on site and is a big step in the project moving forward,” he said. “The condensers will form the backbone for stability throughout the new substation.”
Transgrid said the machines, supplied by Austrian plant engineering group Andritz, will now undergo five months of commissioning and testing.
The progress on the NSW component of the EnergyConnect project follows South Australian transmission network operator ElectraNet’s announcement that it has successfully completed aerial stringing activities between 384 towers spanning 205km from Robertstown to Bundey and onto the NSW border.
ElectraNet said the South Australian side of the EnergyConnect project still has a few more milestones to reach before completion but indicated construction of the project will be finalised by the end of 2024 with the release of full transfer capability planned by mid-2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/23/tesla-solar-business-slips-48-year-over-year/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 23, 2023",Tesla solar business slips 48% year-over-year,"From pv magazine USA
Leading electric vehicle provider Tesla reported its Q3 earnings, delivering $23.35 billion in revenues and $0.66 per share. This fell short of Wall Street expectations of $24.26 billion and $0.73 per share. Share prices have dropped nearly 10% following the quarterly report.
While the electric vehicle division makes up most of Tesla’s earnings, it is also a major player in residential solar and energy storage. The company deployed 49 MW of solar in Q3, 2023, peeling back from 66 MW in the previous quarter, and falling 48% from last year’s Q3 total.
Tesla is not immune to the heavy headwinds of regulatory changes and increased interest rates that are dealing damage to the U.S. residential solar sector.
Despite the pullback in solar deployment, the company’s energy storage business sustained significant growth to make up for the dip in solar sales. Storage deployments increased 90% year-over-year in Q3 to 4 GWh. The company deploys both Powerwall home energy storage and Megapack grid-scale batteries and is increasingly becoming involved in lucrative battery aggregation and grid services businesses, including the rollout of virtual power plants (VPP) in emerging markets like Texas.
“And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit,” said chief executive officer Elon Musk on the earnings call.
The company debuted its Powerwall 3 battery in September, which is set to have its first commercial deployments in 2024. The unit will be DC-coupled with Tesla’s solar inverter, utilising the inverter for grid connectivity. The combined solar and battery inverter can deliver up to 11.5 kWac of power.
Looking ahead, Tesla sees a huge runway for growth for solar, including rooftop solar. Its Master Plan 3 report proposes a need for 3 TW of solar generation in the U.S., including 15 million rooftops. There are less than 3 million single-family rooftops with solar installed across the U.S. today.
In addition to generation resources, the Master Plan estimates a need for 6.5 TWh of 8-hour lithium-ion batteries, 6.9 TWh of industrial thermal storage, and 418 GW of electrolysers providing 107 TWh of hydrogen storage facilities in the United States. The plan also considers an additional 1.2 TWh of distributed stationary batteries as replacements for over 200 GW of existing backup generator capacity.
As for the macro financial environment, Musk issued warnings that heightened interest rates may lead to a bumpy road ahead. High rates have prevented Tesla from going “full tilt” on ramping up its new Mexico gigafactory.
“I’m not saying things will be bad. I’m just saying they might be,” said Musk. “And I think Tesla is an incredibly capable ship, but we need to make sure as — if the macroeconomic conditions are stormy, even if the best ship is still going to have tough times, the weaker ships will sink. We’re not going to sink. But even a great ship in a storm has challenges. Now that storm will apply to everyone, not just to us and not just to auto industry.”

The Hyflexpower consortium has successfully conducted the world’s first operational test of a gas turbine with 100% renewable hydrogen. The project involves producing and storing 100% renewable hydrogen using the gas turbine of Smurfit Kappa, a paper packaging company in Saillat-sur-Vienne, France.
The consortium includes Germany’s Siemens Energy, French energy giant Engie, UK gas turbine manufacturer Centrax, French consultancy Arttic, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), and four European universities.
According to Siemens Energy, hydrogen is produced on site with a 1 MW electrolyser, stored in a 1 ton tank to power a Siemens Energy SGT-400 industrial gas turbine.
Siemens Energy supplied the electrolyser for hydrogen production and developed the hydrogen gas turbine. Engie handled  production, storage, and the supply of hydrogen for the demonstrator, while Centrax updated the package for safe hydrogen fuel operation.
The project also secured contributions from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Universities of Lund, Duisburg-Essen, and University College London. They helped to develop the hydrogen turbine technology. Arttic supported the project’s operational management, and the National Polytechnic University of Athens conducted an economic, environmental, and social analysis of the concept.
Earlier this year, the successful test of an electricity generation demonstrator using a mixture of 30% hydrogen and 70% natural gas was announced. The project, originating in 2020, received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme.
