https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/05/tasmania-site-secured-for-240-mw-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 5, 2023",Tasmania site secured for 240 MW green hydrogen project,"Bell Bay Powerfuels, a partnership between Brisbane-based Abel Energy and Iberdrola Australia, announced it has signed a term sheet with Hydro Tasmania for the sale of the decommissioned Bell Bay Power Station in northern Tasmania.
Bell Bay Powerfuels plans to redevelop the mothballed power station that was shuttered in 2009, transforming the site into a large-scale, renewables-based hydrogen and green methanol facility targeting the existing market for the fuel in Australia and the emerging market in the shipping industry.
Abel said it will look to retain and repurpose existing infrastructure where possible and plans to use the existing deep-water berth for the transport of green methanol to meet the emerging export and domestic demand.
It is anticipated the project, to be backed by up to 700 MW of new renewable energy generation to be developed within the state, will be built in stages with the first stage to include a 140 MW electrolyser that will generate the green hydrogen that would then be converted into green methanol by adding carbon from forestry wood waste.
The initial stage will produce an estimated 200,000 tonnes of green methanol per year for both domestic and international customers. The project would eventually scale up to include a 240 MW electrolyser unit capable of delivering up to 300,000 tonnes of green methanol per year.

ABEL co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael van Baarle said the selection of the site would accelerate the project development, with front end engineering and design (FEED) due to start in a few months’ time. Commercial operation is scheduled to commence in 2027.
“This announcement is the start of a very unique period for Tasmanian renewable energy,” van Baarle said. “We are on the cusp of being a global leader in green methanol production, the future fuel of world shipping.”
Abel said the securing of a site comes after “significant progress” has already been made across other project components including sourcing water supply, engineering capability and securing green methanol offtake arrangements.
Iberdrola, which has established itself as a major player in Australia’s renewable energy market since its arrival in 2020 with more than 800 MW operating capacity, 453 MW under construction and a development pipeline of over 1 GW, is expected to develop the renewable energy assets that will power the electrolyser. The most likely source for the renewable power would be a new wind farm with firming capacity to come from Hydro Tasmania.
Iberdrola Australia Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ross Rolfe said the company’s support for the project is part of a broader commitment to deliver decarbonisation solutions for commercial and industrial customers in historically hard-to-abate sectors.
“In addition to our partnership with Bell Bay Powerfuels, Iberdrola is providing technical and commercial support for the project, enabling the development to benefit from our local market expertise and global capabilities in this emerging technology,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/05/vast-announces-key-contracts-for-288-mwh-solar-thermal-project/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 5, 2023",Vast announces key contracts for 288 MWh solar thermal project,"Australian solar thermal specialist Vast announced it has awarded Worley key engineering contracts for the proposed VS1 concentrated solar power (CSP) project being developed near Port Augusta in South Australia.
The $203 million (USD 134 million) project seeks to demonstrate the technical and operational performance of Vast’s modular CSP technology at utility scale, with the 30 MW plant to generate more than eight hours of thermal energy storage.
The Sydney-based developer said it has appointed Worley and its specialist consulting division, Advisian, to complete basic engineering of the project by July 2023, followed by front-end engineering design (FEED) in the balance of this year. Construction of VS1 is on track to begin in 2024.
Vast Chief Executive Officer Craig Wood said the decision to award Worley the contract for the project builds upon an existing relationship which will help expedite the project.
“Vast has a long-standing relationship with Worley and Advisian dating back to assistance with the engineering and commissioning of our 1.1 MW grid connected Jemalong demonstration plant,” he said. “Their skill in integrating our technology with major packages to be delivered by key equipment partners from around the world will allow VS1 to progress towards FID late this year.”
The VS1 project is set to be the first utility-scale plant to use Vast’s technology which utilises mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers during the day before generating heat and dispatchable power during the day or night.
Unlike traditional CSP technology which uses molten salt both as a heat transfer and for storage, Vast’s proprietary technology uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine. The company said its technology allows plants to be configured with 4-16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW.
The VS1 project has attracted significant support from the Australian government, most recently, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) approving up to $65 million in funding to support construction of the project.
That funding announcement came after Vast secured almost $40 million as part of the HyGate program, a collaboration between the Australian and German governments to establish a green hydrogen supply chain between the two nations.
That funding will support Vast, as part of the broader Solar Methanol Consortium, to develop a green methanol production plant which will be co-located with VS1.
The Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project entails the use of a 10 MW electrolyser for the manufacture of green hydrogen as an input to green methanol production. Electricity and heat generated by the VS1 project will be used to power the electrolyser. It is anticipated the facility will produce 7,500 tonnes of green methanol per annum for use as a sustainable shipping fuel.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/05/using-electric-water-heaters-to-store-renewable-energy-could-do-the-work-of-2-million-home-batteries/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 5, 2023",Using electric water heaters to store renewable energy could do the work of 2 million home batteries,"From The Conversation
About half of Australian households use electric water heaters, while the rest use gas. So what’s so great about electric water heaters?
Electric water heaters offer a cheap way to store large amounts of energy, in the form of hot water. A heater with a 300-litre tank can store about as much energy as a second-generation Tesla Powerwall – at a fraction of the cost.
Our research at the UTS Institute for Sustainable Futures has found Australians could use household electric water heaters to store as much energy as over 2 million home batteries of that kind. This could eventually save over $6 billion (USD 3.96 billion) a year on our energy bills while getting us closer to net-zero carbon emissions.
This means these heaters can soak up excess “off-peak” renewable energy, particularly from solar, and so help us solve two key problems at once. They can help reduce and eventually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. And they can make our electricity grid more stable by providing flexible demand that helps balance out the fluctuating supply from renewable sources.
There are three main types of electric water heater. A conventional “resistance” heater uses electricity to heat water directly. Solar water heaters use sunlight and electricity, but have become less popular as newer “heat pump” units emerged. These collect heat from the air and “pump” it into water. A heat pump uses three to four times less electricity than a resistance heater.
Back in 2010, a resistance electric water heater typically produced around four times more emissions than its gas equivalent. Heat pump emissions were about the same as for gas. That’s because electric water heaters use a lot of electricity, and most of it came from burning coal.
As we generate more electricity from renewables, this picture is changing dramatically. Australia’s energy market operator, AEMO, publishes regularly updated pathways to a clean-energy future. In the most likely outcome, the “step-change scenario”, gas will become the most greenhouse-intensive water-heating option by 2030.
By 2040, once the transition to a renewable electricity system is largely complete, emissions from resistance and heat pump water heaters will be much lower than for their gas counterparts.

Water heaters can last 15 years or more. So the stock of heaters in our homes for the next two decades depends on what we install today. Replacing gas heaters with electric heaters should therefore be an immediate priority in our energy transition.
Our work explored a range of scenarios, each with a different mix of water-heating technologies. One was a business-as-usual baseline where gas water heaters remain prevalent. In alternative scenarios gas is phased out over the next 10–20 years.
We found that replacing gas with electric water heating would not only help us get to net-zero emissions sooner, it would save us money.
Gas is expensive and unlikely to get much cheaper. Abundant renewables offer an excess of cheap electricity that water heaters can help soak up. Embracing this opportunity could save over $6 billion a year on our energy bills by 2040.

Solar and wind are now the cheapest technologies we’ve ever had for generating electricity. But to maintain a stable electricity system, we need to match demand with the fluctuating supply from renewable sources. Batteries offer a partial solution, but are still relatively costly.
Electric water heaters offer a much cheaper way to store large amounts of energy and provide the demand flexibility the grid needs.
Our research found that, compared to the business-as-usual baseline, a scenario that emphasises demand flexibility using smart electric water heaters could provide an extra 30GWh of daily flexible demand capacity. That’s the equivalent of over 2 million home batteries across the National Electricity Market, which supplies electricity to eastern and southern Australia.

Since the 1950s, “off-peak hot water” has seen Australian electricity providers turning household water heaters off during the day and on at night to better match demand and supply. In return, customers received heavily discounted prices.
In recent decades we’ve moved away from off-peak electric hot water, as incentives dwindled and more homes connected to natural gas.
As we electrify our hot water, which technology should we embrace: resistance or heat pump? The answer is both.
Our research explored the trade-off between highly flexible resistance water heaters versus highly efficient but less flexible heat pumps.
Heat pumps use less electricity and cost less to run. Where electricity prices are high or power flow is limited, using heat pumps makes sense. However, they have a higher upfront cost and are not suited to all homes. Many apartments, for example, lack access to suitable outdoor space.
And because they use less electricity, heat pumps offer less flexible demand. As renewables, particularly solar, increasingly power our grid, the ability of resistance electric heaters to soak up excess “off-peak” renewable energy is a big advantage.
With the right policies and market reforms, we will all benefit from a system that once again rewards customers with cheap off-peak electricity in exchange for network operators being able to switch our water heaters off and on as needed.

The proposed legislation will also enshrine 100% public ownership of Queensland’s power line transmission and distribution network, and “deep storage”, including from the planned 5 GW Pioneer-Burdekin and 2 GW Borumba pumped hydro projects. The state will also maintain a 50% or more share of generation.
The release of the draft bill came as the state government announced it will invest $500 million (USD 330 million) to accelerate the progress of renewable energy projects to be developed by publicly owned energy generator and retailer CleanCo. The investment is intended to support the development phase of up to 2.3 GW of large-scale solar and wind projects in central Queensland.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the funding commitment puts CleanCo on a path to supercharging its current portfolio of generation assets and will ensure Queenslanders continue to own the energy assets that will drive the state’s renewable future.
“This is about future-proofing central and regional Queensland,” she said. “This half-a- billion-dollar investment in new renewable wind and solar projects will propel our government’s commitment to delivering more cheaper, cleaner renewable energy.”
The Queensland government last year announced a $62 billion plan to deliver on new renewable energy targets with the conversion of state-owned coal-fired power plants into clean energy hubs predicted to create space in the market for an additional 22 GW of wind and solar by 2035.
The state government said the draft Energy (Renewable Transformation and Jobs) Bill 2023 to be brought to parliament by the end of the year will help make the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan a reality.

The draft Bill includes the regulatory frameworks required to build the Queensland SuperGrid – a massive fit out of solar, wind, battery and hydrogen generators connected through publicly-owned transmission assets – and deliver necessary infrastructure and investment.
The legislative package will also establish a new Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) delivery body to streamline and coordinate the connection of multiple projects in REZs across northern, central and southern Queensland.
The legislation also outlines the creation of a Queensland Energy System Advisory Board, an Energy Industry Council, and the Queensland Renewable Energy Jobs Advocate. It also includes a $150 million job security guarantee to support workers in publicly owned coal-fired power stations.
The Queensland government said the frameworks will unlock new opportunities and attract private sector investment with the energy transformation requiring “the biggest energy investment program in the history of the state.”
“This means substantial investment in generation, transmission, distribution, and storage,” it said. “This will require investment from both the public and private sectors. Like today, Queensland intends to have blended ownership in its generation sector. This means a mix of government ownership, government underpinning private sector investment through long-term offtake arrangements, and completely private players.”
Deputy Premier Steven Miles described the plan as the “most ambitious of any government in Australia.”
“Our plan is only possible because we have retained public ownership of our energy assets and this Bill helps protect that ownership,” he said.
“We’re putting Queensland on the map as a global leader in renewable energy and reducing energy system emissions by 96% by 2040.”
“We’re also building our local manufacturing capacity because we will need thousands of batteries, wind turbines, solar panels and kilometres of transmission lines – and we want that equipment built here in Queensland, so Queenslanders get the benefits.”
The government is now seeking feedback from stakeholders as it looks to refine the Bill, with definitions and methodology to be developed with unions, advocates, industry, and investors, with engagement already underway. The closing date for feedback is 23 June 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/05/australian-startup-reveals-20-layer-battery-cell-based-on-semi-solid-li-sulfur-technology/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 5, 2023",Australian startup reveals 20-layer battery cell based on semi-solid li-sulfur technology,"Compared to ubiquitous lithium-ion technology, lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to offer cheaper, lighter-weight energy storage, as well as cost and safety advantages. Yet the widespread use of these batteries faces hurdles that stem mainly from the limitations in the lifespan of lithium-sulfur cells.
In a bid to bring this technology closer to commercialisation, Australian listed company Li-S Energy has announced the development of its first 20-layer battery cells utilising third-generation (GEN3) semi-solid state lithium sulfur battery technology.
Li-S Energy has been working with Victoria’s Deakin University and PPK Group, among others, to develop the new battery cells, which eliminate the heavy metals like nickel, cobalt and manganese used in lithium-ion batteries.
Li-S Energy’s cell is said to offer volumetric energy density of 540 Wh/l, gravimetric energy density of more than 400 Wh/kg and enhanced safety with the use of a low flammability electrolyte.
The GEN3 battery cell has major advantages over the second-generation iteration, including a 45% increase in volumetric energy density thanks to the use of a lower-porosity cathode material.
Compared to current Li-ion cells, this performance is nearly double the gravimetric energy density and a comparable volumetric energy density. This means that Li-S Energy’s battery cells are now the same size as existing Li-ion batteries but half the weight, the company claims.
The 20-layer cells use Li-S Energy’s patented Li-nanomesh technology and incorporate boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) into the cell construction to reduce dendrite growth and improve safety and cycle life. Test cells have demonstrated sustained performance over 1,000 charge-and-discharge cycles while retaining a specific capacity almost three times that of a typical lithium-ion cell.
The new cells were produced in Li-S Energy’s Phase 2 facility in Geelong, Victoria, where test cell production is anticipated later this year, once the company’s Phase 3 facility is complete. Phase 3 is a 2 MWh production line, which will enable more automated production and include what is potentially the largest dry room in Australia.
“In the coming months we look forward to commencing the production of commercial samples for our partners,” says Li-S Energy CEO, Lee Finniear.
At this point, the Li-S Energy development team is working to develop the cell cycle testing and characterisation results to produce an industry standard datasheet on the new 20-layer cells.
Li-S Energy has identified electric aviation and drones as key sector where it has a competitive advantage due to the light weight of its batteries. In 2022, the battery start-up inked a deal with U.S.-based e-aviation company magniX, which will test the potential of the company’s technology for e-aviation applications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/05/first-attempt-to-repair-glass-damaged-solar-panels/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 5, 2023",First attempt to repair glass-damaged solar panels,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands have developed an experimental glass repair technique for glass-glass PV modules which they say provides good results in terms of both technical feasibility and effectiveness.
“Thus far, glass defects have been regarded as a failure beyond repair and no noticeable attempt has been made to develop reparation methods,” they stressed, noting that their technique is based on methodologies applied in the automotive industry, in which glass laminates reparation has a long track record. “Ultimately, this research aims to add to the scarce scientific knowledge on PV modules repair options, in particular glass-glass PV modules, and aspires to place defect PV modules in a new perspective: from waste to valuable products.”
The researchers explained that glass breakage in glass-glass solar panels may lead to the disruption of the insulation of the encapsulant layer, which would cause the penetration of water and humidity in the modules, or the creation of microcracks in the solar cells, which would be highly detrimental to their performance.
The proposed technique is based on a method for edge pit reparation of windshields from Germany-based Novus Automotive GmbH and advice provided by international glass expert Marcel Falk.
It is implemented in seven different steps: Determining freshness and the end of the fracture; cooling or heating the PV module to the required temperature of 5 C to 29 C; cleaning the module with window cleaner; inserting the repair resin into the fractures using small drops; applying drops of pit resin on top of the larger edge pits; placing an ultraviolet (UV) lamp at a distance of 20–30 cm and curing for a minimum of 20 minutes; and checking if all fractures are repaired.
“The materials required for the experimental reparation consists of repair resin and pit resin designated for windshields that aim to restore the strength and insulation of the glass layers,” the academics explained. “Furthermore, a UV lamp with an intensity of 108 W UVA is required for the strengthening of the resin, the resin can also be cured by natural UV light.”
They conducted accelerated lifetime damp heat simulations, as well as performance and reliability tests, to validate the effectiveness of the repairing process. They compared the performance of 30 glass-damaged panels with that of non-damaged modules, which were all coming from an operational PV installation operated by SolSolutions in the Netherlands. The array utilises 290 W panels provided by Chinese producer DMEGC.
Through this experiment, the research team ascertained that the proposed methodology doesn’t harm the repaired panels, which were found to perform “properly” after the repair and the tests. “The absence of water-instigated degradation indicates that repaired glass layers are insulating again,” it explained. “However, definite conclusions must be made with caution since the non-repaired PV modules did not show visual signs of water ingress either.”
The scientists introduced the new approach in the study “Experimental repair technique for glass defects of glass-glass photovoltaic modules – A techno-economic analysis,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells. “Overall, the first indicators for a technically feasible and effective repair technique are positive,” they concluded.
