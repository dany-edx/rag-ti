With an overall capacity of up to 700MW and a dispatch duration of four hours, the proposed Eraring big battery is Australia’s largest battery project to achieve planning approval to date.
Origin’s head of energy supply and operations Greg Jarvis said the battery energy storage system would help replace the coal-fired power station, which supplies about one quarter of NSW’s energy needs.
“Our proposed battery forms part of our plans to replace Eraring’s capacity and maintain reliable energy supply to customers as we plan for the potential accelerated closure of the coal-fired power station in August 2025,” he said.
“Eraring Power Station is well suited to battery storage and potentially other energy infrastructure over time, as there is extensive electricity connection infrastructure already in place nearby.”
Jarvis said Origin will now focus on finalising vendor and constructor negotiations and transmissions connection agreements so the project can progress towards a final investment decision.
The battery is one of at least two energy storage systems, including the state government’s proposed 700MW/1,400MWh Waratah Super Battery, set to replace the capacity of the Eraring power plant.

Origin announced in February it would bring forward the closure of the power station, submitting notice to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) that it would shut the facility in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
The company said the move is reflective of the “rapidly-changing conditions in the National Electricity Market, which are increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations and challenging their viability”.
“The reality is the economics of coal-fired power stations are being put under increasing, unsustainable pressure by cleaner and lower cost generation, including solar, wind and batteries,” the company said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the NSW government says it has received more than 30 proposals from local and international bidders to build its planned Waratah Super Battery.
NSW energy minister Matt Kean said on Thursday the state government had received strong interest from potential suppliers for the big battery system and will now prepare a formal tender process.
The proposed battery, set to be located on the NSW Central Coast, will have an overall capacity of 700MW and a dispatch duration of two hours. Kean said it will help to release grid capacity and secure the state’s energy future.
Among the possible locations being suggested for the new battery is the former Munmorah Power Station site adjacent to the 667MW gas-fired Colongra Power Station near Doyalson on the Central Coast. The former 1.4GW coal-fired power plant was closed in 2012.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/12/battery-manufacturer-builds-on-australian-supply-chain/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 12, 2022",Battery manufacturer builds on Australian supply chain,"Energy Renaissance is forging ahead with plans to manufacture Australian-made lithium-ion batteries, today announcing a trifecta of new supply agreements with Australian businesses to provide key components that will be used to build the company’s superStorage series of renewable energy storage systems.
Energy Renaissance plans to manufacture up to 5.3GW of semi-solid state lithium-ion batteries per annum at a 4,500sqm purpose-built manufacturing facility being developed near Tamago in the New South Wales Hunter Valley.
The $28 million facility, which is expected to commence commercial production by October this year, will have an initial battery production capacity of 66MWh per annum but Energy Renaissance expects to eventually scale the operation up to 5.3GWh annually to help meet growing demand.
Energy Renaissance, which is currently working out of a temporary production facility, said the Australian-made batteries will be used in stationary (grid and microgrid, renewables, community storage, mining electrification) and transport (buses, light commercial and industrial vehicles) applications. It is looking to supply both the local and export markets.
A key element of the company’s strategy is to source 100% of components used in the manufacturing of its batteries in Australia.
Energy Renaissance managing director Mark Chilcote said the approach was fundamental with the company seeking to not only boost the Australian manufacturing industry but also aiming to protect against the vagaries of the global supply chain.
“Energy Renaissance is dedicated to onshoring manufacturing in Australia so we can protect our customers against global supply chain constraints and unexpected price increases that come with increased freight costs,” he said.
“We started our business with a target to have 100% of our manufacturing completed in Australia. However, this target can only be achieved with a long-term partnership with local suppliers who will invest in business to grow in line with our production requirements.”

Energy Renaissance today announced long-term framework agreements and preferred supplier relationships with three Australian companies to provide key components for its batteries.
Penrith-based electronics manufacturer GPC Electronics will supply the printed circuit boards for the Battery Management Systems, Brisbane plastic moulding injection manufacturer B&C Plastics will supply the plastic components used in the packs and Newcastle-based Academy Sheetmetal will supply the steel cabinetry for the battery racks.
Energy Renaissance, which continues to import battery cells, said the new supply partnerships mean 92%, or 32 of the 35 components that make up the company’s superStorage series of batteries are produced by or sourced from Australian companies.
“Energy Renaissance is strengthening local manufacturing and, in the future, securing our supply chain for critical battery minerals when we commence the manufacturing of battery cells in Australia,” Chilcote said, adding working with Australian companies will in the longer term make it more cost competitive for components to be manufactured locally.
“While negotiating for supplier agreements, we found local manufacturers who are price competitive with similar components made with a higher quality standard than what we would have to import,” he said.
“This has challenged our views on sourcing for components globally and highlighted that we do have many local companies who share our passion of onshoring manufacturing.”
Chilcote said the company would continue to negotiate local supply agreements as it ramps up the production of its batteries.
The announcement by Energy Renaissance preceded Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese announcing he would tip $100 million in to kickstart battery manufacturing in Australia if he wins power at the federal election later this month.
Albanese on Thursday unveiled the Labor Party’s Australian Made Battery plan which he said has been designed to create more jobs and greater wealth for the nation by manufacturing batteries onshore, adding there are an estimated 34,700 jobs and $7.4 billion in value to be made in Australia from battery technology and industries.
Albanese said if he wins the federal election on 21 May, his government would partner with the Queensland government to create a battery manufacturing precinct, backed by a $100 million Commonwealth equity injection. A future Labor government would also develop a National Battery Strategy to bring government and business efforts together for the long-term good of the nation.
“The resources sector has been the backbone of the Australian economy for decades,” Albanese said. “Developing Australia’s battery manufacturing capability is a step towards the potential for domestic electric vehicle manufacture. Labor will create a future made in Australia. Australia should be a renewable energy powerhouse, not just a raw materials supermarket.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/12/no-end-to-solar-supply-demand-imbalance/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"MAY 12, 2022",No end to solar supply/demand imbalance,"From pv magazine 05/2022
PV InfoLink projects global PV module demand to reach 223 GW this year, with an optimistic forecast of 248 GW. Cumulative installed capacity is expected to reach 1 TW by year’s end.
China still dominates PV demand. The policy-driven 80 GW of module demand will beef up solar market development. In second place is the European market, which is working to accelerate renewables development to wean itself off Russian natural gas. Europe is expected to see 49 GW of module demand this year.
The third-largest market, the United States, has seen diversified supply and demand since last year. Disrupted by the Withhold Release Order (WRO), supply is unable to catch up with demand. Moreover, the investigation into anti-circumvention in Southeast Asia this year causes further uncertainty in cell and module supply for US orders and adds to the low utilization rates in Southeast Asia amid impacts of WRO.
As a result, supply to the US market will fall short of demand throughout this year; module demand will stay at last year’s 26 GW or even lower. The three largest markets together will contribute to around 70% of demand.

Demand in the first quarter of 2022 stayed at around 50 GW, despite persistently high prices. In China, projects deferred from last year were commenced. While ground-mounted projects were postponed due to high module prices over the short term, and demand from distributed-generation projects continued due to lower price sensitivity. In markets outside of China, India witnessed strong inventory draw prior to the introduction of basic custom duty (BCD) on April 1, with 4 GW to 5 GW of demand in the first quarter. Steady demand continued in the US, while Europe saw stronger-than-expected demand with robust order requests and signings. The EU’s market acceptance for higher prices also increased.

Overall, demand in the second quarter may be spurred by distributed generation and some utility-scale projects in China, while Europe’s strong module inventory draws amid the accelerated energy transition, and steady demand from the Asia-Pacific region. The US and India, on the other hand, is expected to see dwindling demad, owing respectively to anti-circumvention investigation and lofty BCD rates. Yet, demand from all regions together amass 52 GW, slightly higher than in the first quarter.
Under current pricing levels, China’s guaranteed installed capacity will drive inventory draws from utility-scale projects in the third and fourth quarter, while distributed generation projects will continue. Against this backdrop, the Chinese market will continue to consume large volumes of modules.
The outlook for the US market will remain obscured until results of the anti-circumvention investigation are unveiled at the end of August. Europe continues to see bullish demand, with no evident high or low seasons throughout the year.
Overall, demand in the second half of the year will surpass that in the first half. PV Infolink predicts a gradual increase over time, reaching a peak in the fourth quarter.
As shown in the graph (left), polysilicon supply has improved from last year and is likely to meet end-user demand. Yet, InfoLink predicts that polysilicon supply will remain short due to the following factors: Firstly, it will take about six months for new production lines to reach full capacity, meaning production is limited. Secondly, the time taken for new capacity to come online varies among manufacturers, with capacity growing slowly during first and second quarter, and then increasing markedly in the third and fourth quarter. Lastly, despite continued polysilicon production, Covid-19’s resurgence in China has disrupted supply, leaving it unable to meet demand from the wafer segment, which holds huge capacity.
Raw material and BOM price trends decide whether module prices will stay on the rise. Like polysilicon, it seems that EVA particle production volume can satisfy demand from the module sector this year, but equipment maintenance and the pandemic will lead to an imbalanced supply-demand relationship in the short term.
Supply chain prices are expected to stay elevated and will not decline until the end of the year, when new polysilicon production capacities come fully online. Next year, the entire supply chain may hopefully recover to a healthy state, allowing the long-stressed module makers and system suppliers to take a deep breath. Unfortunately, striking a balance between high prices and robust demand continues to be major topic of discussion throughout 2022.

The Federal Government said this week it will contribute $50 million over four years as part of its Trailblazer Universities Program to leverage more than $220 million of co-investment from the universities and their industry partners. The UNSW and UoN will contribute $50 million in cash and $47 million of in-kind investments to the initiative. The universities said more than 20 industry partners have already expressed support for the initiative and have committed more than $130 million in cash and in-kind contributions.
UNSW deputy vice-chancellor Nicholas Fisk said the Australian Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program is targeting the commercialisation of at least 63 new products.
Development and commercialisation efforts will be in four priority areas: electrification, energy systems and storage; sustainable fuels and chemicals manufacturing with a special focus on Power-to-X (P2X) based production methods for hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels; next generation solar PV and systems; and recycling and MICROfactories.
“Our projects, partnerships and investment under this initiative will accelerate a decade’s worth of change in just four years and create a legacy in industry-university collaboration,” Fisk said. “It is truly national, with projects in metropolitan and regional areas, and in all Australian states and territories, and beyond.”

The initiative has attracted 27 industry partners, including 23 small businesses. They will work with the universities to develop and research commercialisation initiatives for clean energy solutions and systems including developing ultra-low-cost solar with cutting-edge engineering and building the first at-scale printed solar manufacturing plant, providing the step-change needed to vault the technology to full commercialisation.
The program will also look to develop and commercialise lightweight hydrogen storage that can deliver for transport and fuel replacement needs, and also look to extend the success of green steel technology to other metals such as aluminium.
UoN vice-chancellor Professor Alex Zelinsky said the program would deliver real-world outcomes and “accelerate Australia’s clean energy and recycling industries and bring more, greener technologies to Australians”.
“This program will transform the way technology readiness, commercialisation and industry-led research are prioritised, taught and rewarded in our universities with targeted opportunities for university staff and students to succeed,” he said
The collaboration builds on the NSW state government’s announcement that a $15 million Decarbonisation Innovation Hub would be based at UNSW Sydney.
The Hub is a key part of the state government’s Net Zero Industry and Innovation Program and will bring together government, industry, and researchers to fast-track technologies to decarbonise NSW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/12/korea-minerals-giant-seals-deal-for-9gw-australian-renewables-portfolio/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 12, 2022",Korea minerals giant seals deal for 9GW Australian renewables portfolio,"Korea Zinc’s Australian subsidiary Ark Energy has completed its purchase of Sydney-based renewable energy developer Epuron Holdings in a deal that gives it access to a potential 9GW pipeline of utility scale wind and solar PV projects.
Ark Energy said the acquisition includes ~4.2GW of early-stage utility-scale wind and solar development projects located across the National Electricity Market (NEM) jurisdictions with a focus on Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania. It will also acquire ~4.8GW of projects in the investigation stage and a 50% stake in renewables monitoring and forecasting technology company Fulcrum3D.
The deal also includes the acquisition of Epuron’s ~7MW portfolio of fully contracted off-grid solar assets in the Northern Territory.
Ark Energy founder and chairman and Korea Zinc vice chairman Yun Choi said the purchase, which was first announced in December, will support its ambition to become a major domestic supplier and exporter of green hydrogen and fast track the parent company’s vision to become one of the world’s largest producers of green zinc.
“The acquisition of Epuron is an important milestone for Ark Energy to become a world-class green independent power producer and green hydrogen business,” he said.
Korea Zinc subsidiary Sun Metals has already announced plans to build a green hydrogen production facility at its zinc refinery in Townsville. The facility will be collocated with the zinc refiner’s operating 125MW solar farm.
 
Ark Energy vice chairwoman Kathy Danaher said the acquisition of Epuron’s holdings will accelerate the company’s energy transition and deliver low-carbon futures for Korea Zinc and other third-party commercial and industrial customers.
Ark Energy’s development team will continue to operate under the Epuron brand for the time being. It will be led by head of development Paul Stangroom who will work alongside Ark Energy’s head of commercial, strategy and operations Dan Hamel as the group’s business model expands from a project developer to one that also builds, owns and operates renewable energy projects long-term.
Epuron co-founders Martin Poole and Andrew Durran will serve on an advisory panel to Ark Energy for an initial period of six months post completion. Poole said the sale gives Epuron the ideal opportunity to build on its legacy.
“Ark Energy is a great new home for the Epuron team. We’re moving forward in good hands and with an opportunity to play a bigger role in Australia’s energy transition,” he said.
The acquisition follows Korea Zinc’s recent decision to invest $50 million in Energy Vault, a Switzerland-based gravity storage specialist, in order to use its tech to decarbonise its refining and smelting operations in Australia.
The new strategic partnership supports Korea Zinc’s strategy to decarbonise its refining and smelting operations at its Sun Metals zinc refinery near Townsville in north Queensland. The companies expect to begin project deployment of Energy Vault’s proprietary energy storage and energy management software technology later this year. The size and cost of the project have not been disclosed.
