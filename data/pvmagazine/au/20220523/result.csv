But it’s not yet clear if Labor can form a majority in the lower house, or will rely on support from the teal independents and Greens MPs – all of whom campaigned heavily for stronger climate action.
Independent Monique Ryan, a pro-climate teal MP projected to win Kooyong, on Sunday declared she would work with a minority Labor government if it went further on climate policy – including ramping up its 2030 emissions target. Other crossbenchers are likely to take a similar stance.
Labor’s climate and energy policies provide an important foundation for progress. But there are some sectors of the economy that still need far more focus. So what might the next parliament bring on climate action?

Saturday’s federal poll was the first where Australia had a national commitment to net-zero emissions. Whoever won government faced the task of normalising the target within government and across the economy, and accelerating rapid real-world emissions cuts.
Under the Morrison government, Australia pledged to reach net-zero by 2050. But our research, conducted with the CSIRO, has shown Australia could get there by 2035.
Such a target would be consistent with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5℃. It would also unlock our competitive advantage in a net-zero world – one where we can be a major player in exporting green energy and other low-emissions commodities.
Labor’s Powering Australia plan would reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, based on 2005 levels.
Analysis shows Labor’s proposed target, while far more ambitious than the previous government’s, is consistent with 2℃ of global warming. This is not yet in line with the Paris Agreement goal for “well below” 2℃ warming.
In minority government, Labor would come under pressure from the crossbench to adopt a stronger 2030 goal. Incumbent Warringah independent Zali Steggall, for example, is calling for at least 60% emissions reduction by 2030, and the Greens want even more.
Greens and teal independents are aligned with Labor on legislating Australia’s net-zero emissions target and reinvigorating institutions such as the Climate Change Authority.
A climate change bill, which Steggall and others championed in the last parliament, is more comprehensive. It would provide legislated timeframes for action on climate change, and implement a process ensuring targets are in line with the science.
The teals are likely to support Labor’s plans to standardise company reporting on matters such as climate risk and emissions. The move brings Australia in line with international best practice and will bring substantial benefits.

So too will Labor’s commitment to net-zero emissions in the federal public service by 2030, which will stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services.
A gap to be addressed by the Labor government is creating roadmaps to net-zero for sectors and key regions. These could be integrated into Labor’s proposed National Reconstruction Fund, and should be devised in collaboration with the states and industry, as well as communities and workers affected by the global shift to net-zero.
The electricity sector produces about one-third of Australia’s emissions. The teals and Labor both went to the election aiming for renewable energy to comprise 80% of the electricity mix by 2030, which is about the pace of change needed.
Two major new Labor policies will be the basis for this:
Yet more must be done – for example, more planning and new energy market rules. These should ensure the future energy system is no bigger than it needs to be, and that zero-emissions energy by 2035 is produced at least cost.
The Greens and teals want to halve emissions from Australia’s industrial sector by 2030. Labor’s current plans for industry aren’t that specific – and a crossbench with the balance of power is likely to pressure Labor in this area.
Labor’s policies on industry emissions comprise two main building blocks:
Australia’s energy-intensive industries are already planning their response to shifting global markets. Labor must help these industries manage the change at the scale and pace required.
In transport, Labor has proposed removing taxes and duties on lower-cost electric vehicles – making them cheaper – and adopting Australia’s first electric vehicle strategy.
The party has already committed to 75% of all new Commonwealth fleet cars being low- or no-emissions by 2025. The teals want 76% of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. The Greens would also push for a far stronger electric vehicle policy.
Labor will also take steps to establish high-speed rail on Australia’s east coast. But its transport policy essentially ends there. It could do more on public and active transport, as well as decarbonising freight and aviation.
A broader transport strategy – especially involving infrastructure planning and investment – would help the transport sector move towards net-zero.

Labor’s Housing Australia Future Fund is rightly focused on building new social and affordable housing, but is silent on net-zero. All governments have agreed to a zero-carbon buildings trajectory – now it’s time the federal government worked proactively with the states to achieve this.
The forthcoming review of the National Construction Code is a chance to bring in higher energy performance standards for new buildings.
But existing homes and business premises also need attention. A package of funds and regulations to drive electrification and energy performance gains there would bring lower energy bills and better health outcomes to many Australians.
Labor policies will support innovation in agriculture, including reducing methane emissions from livestock and other carbon farming opportunities. There will also be crossbench support for increased tree planting and soil carbon storage, as well as more spending on low-carbon agriculture practices and technologies.
Under Australia’s carbon credit scheme, landholders are granted carbon credits for activities such as retaining and growing vegetation. Serious questions have been raised over the integrity of the scheme, and dealing with these issues should be a priority for the new government.
Many of Australia’s natural systems, such as rivers and other ecosystems, are stressed or near failure. The land sector both contributes to this alarming trend and can be part of the solution, and will be badly affected if the problems are not addressed.
Many farmers have shifted their practices in response to climate and environmental threats. But the new government should create a roadmap to place the land sector in a wider environmental context. This would ensure the sector seizes investment opportunities and plays its part in a sustainable future.
Such a plan would also help Australian agriculture shore up its share of global food exports in a world increasingly demanding low-emissions products.

The new Labor government has three years to steer Australia in a world that expects – and badly needs – every nation to take rapid climate action across the economy.
Australians have voted for a parliament with a stronger climate action agenda. More will be needed beyond the headline measures.
The onus is on all Australians help shape and implement these changes and ensure the nation not just survives, but thrives in a warmer world.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/23/albanese-vows-to-transform-australia-into-clean-energy-superpower/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 23, 2022",Albanese vows to transform Australia into clean energy ‘superpower’,"Labor leader Anthony Albanese, who will be sworn in today as Australia’s 31st prime minister, has pledged to “end the climate wars” in the country and boost the share of renewables in the National Electricity Market (NEM) as part of the party’s pledge to combat global warming.
With nearly 71% of the vote counted on Sunday night, the Australian Electoral Commission had Labor ahead in 75 seats, just one short of the 76 needed to secure a majority in the 151-member lower house of parliament. The counting of postal and pre-poll votes over the coming days will determine the final numbers but Labor appears likely to form a slim majority government, providing an opportunity for the party to turn its climate policy platform into reality.
Albanese, who is due to fly to Tokyo today for a summit with the leaders of Japan, India and the United States, used his victory speech in Sydney on Saturday night to reinforce Labor’s commitment to a renewable energy future, saying he would lead a government “worthy of the people of Australia”.
“We are the greatest country on earth. But we can have an even better future if we seize the opportunities that are right there in front of us. The opportunity to shape change, rather than be shaped by it,” he said.
“Together we can end the climate wars. Together we can take advantage of the opportunity for Australia to be a renewable energy superpower.”
Federal Labor has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 43% by 2030 based on 2005 emissions levels, boost renewables, boost demand for electric vehicles (EVs) through tax breaks and help build community-owned solar power and battery projects.

Labor’s Powering Australia Plan would see renewable capacity grow to 26GW, or 82% of all NEM generation by 2030. The plan also assumes that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up 89% of new car sales in Australia by the end of the decade.
Labor’s approach centres on a $20 billion government intervention to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy. The policy is designed to bring forward the construction of high-voltage infrastructure by lowering financial and planning barriers to unlock the commercial development of large-scale renewable energy resources.
The party’s Powering Australia Plan also includes $200 million to install 400 community batteries, $100 million for the development of shared ‘solar banks’, and a commitment to reduce the emissions of the Australian Public Service to net-zero by 2030.
It also intends to tighten the country’s emissions “safeguard mechanism”, to gradually tighten limits on pollution by the biggest industrial emitters. That mechanism sets a baseline of allowable emissions for the 215 big mining, energy and materials companies that emit more than 100,000 tonnes a year of carbon dioxide equivalent.
While Labor’s promise to cut carbon emissions by 43% by the end of the decade has been backed by business groups, independent candidate Monique Ryan, who appears likely to win the Victorian seat of Kooyong from Liberal Josh Frydenberg, is calling for stronger climate action. The Greens, who are on track to win three seats in Brisbane, and independent candidates who picked up key seats in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, say the emissions reduction target should be in the realm of 60 to 75%.

Ryan is among a group of independents who picked up key seats in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth the weekend. They, along with the Greens, who are on track to win three seats in Brisbane, are likely to lobby Albanese for more ambitious goals if Labor fails to secure a majority.
Ryan said Labor would need to commit to a larger reduction, such as proposed by independent Zali Steggall’s climate change bill, in order to win her support on confidence and supply in a hung parliament.
“That’s what I would be working towards, an absolute minimum of a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, and hoping for more than that,” she said.
“I think we need to put in place a legislative framework to ensure that no future government can wriggle out of that action on climate change.
“We have to have immediate action on climate change, we can’t wait for the Labor Party’s current target that they’ve taken to the election, it’s manifestly inadequate.”
Despite Ryan’s criticism of Labor’s climate target, the party’s federal election victory has been welcomed by many, including mining billionaire Andrew Forrest.
Forrest, who made his billions in the iron ore industry but is now betting big on renewable energy, said the election result shows “the majority of Australians are unhappy with Australia’s approach to climate change”.
“For a long time, Australia has been a climate laggard. Frankly, it has been embarrassing,” the executive chairman of Fortescue Metals said in a statement. “We now hope to see a more forward-leaning climate change policy from Australia.”
That viewpoint was shared by Atlassian co-founder and climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes, who is attempting to block the demerger of AGL Energy.
“After bushfires & bullshit, floods & fables… comes hope,” he tweeted on Sunday.

The IEA’s Snapshot of Global PV Markets 2022 report, released on Monday, shows Australia also leads the way for solar PV penetration with 15.5%, edging out Spain (14.2%) and Greece (11.6%). The IEA said the trio of nations, along with Honduras, the Netherlands, Chile and Germany now have enough PV capacity to theoretically produce more than 10% of their annual electricity demand with solar.
Professor Renate Egan, from the University of New South Wales’ Digital Grid Futures Institute, said Australia continued to embrace both grid-scale and rooftop solar.
“Last year Australia moved ahead of Germany for the most solar installed per capita. With a strong year in 2021, we have increased our lead with solar now contributing over 13% of all electricity demand, a figure that has doubled in less than three years,” she said.

Australia also remains in the top 10 for both new installs and total market, as it has done for more than 20 years. The IEA said Australia installed 4.6GW of solar in 2021, taking the cumulative capacity to 25.4GW installed.
Egan, who contributed to the IEA report, said Australia had in 2021 installed more solar PV per day than it did in the whole of 1992.
“The APVI has been tracking solar PV installs in Australia since 1992, when 7MW was installed, with only 1.6MW on grid,” she said. “With at least 4.6GW installed in 2021, we are now installing twice as much every day as we did in an entire year in 1992.”
The report, which analyses the 2021 preliminary reported PV market data, found that despite a second year of pandemic-related disruptions, the global PV market grew significantly. More than 175GW of solar PV was installed and commissioned globally with China in the top spot for annual installed and total cumulative PV capacity.
China installed 54.9GW of solar in 2021, up from 48.2GW in 2020 and 30.1GW in 2019. China also remains the leader in terms of cumulative capacity with 308.5GW installed, almost one third of the global PV installed capacity.
The total cumulative installed capacity at the end of 2021 globally amounted to at least 942GW with the European Union (178.7GW), the United States (122.9 GW), Japan (78,2 GW) and India (60,4 GW) among the top five contributors.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/23/outback-town-teams-cdu-to-research-renewable-energy-future/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 23, 2022",Outback town teams with CDU to research renewable energy future,"Researchers from the Northern Territory’s Charles Darwin University (CDU) will use a microgrid simulator to investigate how the Central Australian town of Alice Springs can integrate increasing amounts of renewable energy, including solar PV and battery energy storage, into its iso­lat­ed grid.
CDU has announced it will partner with the Alice Springs Future Grid project – a whole-of-sys­tems project con­sid­er­ing how the remote community can achieve 50% renew­able ener­gy by 2030 – to help iden­ti­fy and over­come bar­ri­ers to fur­ther renew­able ener­gy pen­e­tra­tion in the Alice Springs elec­tric­i­ty system.
Future Grid will investigate how distributed energy resources, including  household batteries and rooftop solar, and existing infrastructure can work together to create a clean, reliable and affordable energy supply.
CDU researchers will test individual components, including solar PV, hybrid and battery inverters for their suitability for real-world application at the university’s Renewable Energy Microgrid Hub for Applied Research and Training (REMHART) in Darwin.
CDU’s Energy and Resources Institute director Professor Suresh Thennadil said it was exactly why the microgrid simulator was constructed, allowing scenario testing without transporting potentially unsuitable equipment to remote locations.
“In the coming years, not decades, we will need a revolution in power generation and distribution that has not been seen since the initial rollout of a national power grid,” he said.
“The testing facility is a vital tool in making this power revolution happen in the NT, with research and testing of new renewable systems, and training provided to build industry capacity.”

Individual solar, hybrid and battery inverters have now been installed at the microgrid hub and will be tested for Essential System Services response characteristics including delay time, ramp time and maximum charge and discharge power outputs under different load and generation scenarios.
“This is a great opportunity for our researchers to apply their skills to challenges relevant to industry and our communities while, at same time, developing their connections with our Future Grid partners,” Thennadil said.
“The inverter testing, via the Future Grid project, will demonstrate REMHART’s ability to bring together industry and academic researchers. Additionally, we expect the results from this study to inform our future research direction.”
Alice Springs already has about 10% renewable energy generation but faces unique challenges in overcoming system strength issues to serve approximately 30,000 people, with communities as far as 130 kilometres from the town.
The Future Grid project will cul­mi­nate in the devel­op­ment of a roadmap iden­ti­fy­ing how the Alice Springs electricity grid could operate with 50% renewables by the end of the decade. The goal aligns with the Territory government’s target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
Future Grid project director Lyndon Frearson, from Alice Springs engineering firm Ekistica, said CDU’s ability to facilitate the testing underscored how new opportunities, trials and partnerships can be developed in the Northern Territory.
“The people involved with the facility at CDU have been working alongside the Alice Springs Future Grid project since its inception,” he said.
“This partnership demonstrates how research and industry can collaborate, drive innovation, and build local capacity.”

IGO managing director and chief executive officer Peter Bradford said the JV has successfully and consistently produced battery grade lithium hydroxide at the Kwinana refinery using spodumene sourced directly from the Greenbushes mine about 250 kilometres southwest of Kwinana.
Bradford said onsite laboratory tests had confirmed that battery-grade specification had been met on 10 tonne of lithium hydroxide, produced consistently over several days. Samples have been sent for independent verification.
“We are delighted to announce this important achievement and we congratulate the joint venture team for their focus and professionalism through the progressive commissioning and trial production of Train 1 at Kwinana and the delivery of this important milestone,” he said.
“Vertical integration into downstream processing is a key plank in IGO’s strategy and we are proud to be involved in the first production of lithium hydroxide in commercial quantities in Australia. The joint venture’s interest in both the upstream mining asset at Greenbushes and the downstream refinery at Kwinana is emerging as a globally significant, integrated lithium business.”
Bradford said once the product samples have been independently verified, the product qualification process with offtake customers will commence.
The production of battery grade lithium is seen as a significant milestone for Australian mining and manufacturing as the sector expands to meet rapidly growing demand for rechargeable batteries, primarily from the EVs and energy storage system industries.

Tianqi Lithium Kwinana chief operating officer Raj Surendran said the success at its Kwinana refinery shows that “Australia can value add to its minerals onshore as it enhances its reputation as a critical contributor to the production of batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage, which are absolutely vital for the decarbonisation of the world’s economy”.
“Today’s milestone proves Australia has the capability and expertise to transition from a ‘dig it and ship it’ minerals supplier to a downstream supplier of value-added product,” he said. “However, we also remain acutely aware that there is more work to do to establish the Kwinana plant as a reliable, significant producer of battery-grade lithium, starting with customer acceptance.”
Surendran said the first train at TLEA’s Kwinana refinery will now continue to ramp up towards its nameplate capacity of 24,000 tonnes of battery grade lithium hydroxide per annum. The next step in the plant’s ramp-up process is customer qualification, which is to be completed over the next four to eight months.
TLEA expects lithium hydroxide produced at the Kwinana plant will be containerised and exported from the nearby Port of Fremantle.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said in a statement that TLEA’s success paves the way for further investments in Western Australia’s battery and critical minerals value chain, including in advanced manufacturing of cathode-active materials.
“This is not only a significant milestone for the joint venture, but also for Western Australia, and it is proof of the battery-grade materials we can produce locally,” he said. “Tianqi’s first-of-its-kind lithium hydroxide plant demonstrates Western Australia’s capacity for downstream processing in the battery value chain.
“As demand continues to increase for renewable energy storage and electric car batteries the government is committed to making sure Western Australia capitalises on its potential to be a world-leading producer of battery-grade materials.”

The Indian state of Madhya Pradesh will host a 1.4 GW solar plant near the Behrara Mata Temple in Morena district. About 70% of the land required for the solar plant has already been allotted. The PV plant will be ready within a year, and will generate 1.4 GW of electricity per day, said Girraj Dandotia, the chairman of Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd.  
At present, the state’s largest single-site solar power plant is in Rewa district, generating 750 MW of power. The solar plant in Morena district will be twice as big as the Rewa plant. It will be built under the solar park scheme.
“The district administration has so far allotted 2,000 hectares of land in the hills of Behara Mata Temple between Kailaras-Pahargarh road. The allotment process for the remaining 800 hectares of land is in progress,” Dandotia said. “(About) 70% of its power will go to Madhya Pradesh, and 30% of the electricity can be voluntarily supplied to anyone by the company setting up a solar power plant.”

The European Commission is taking its “mission to become independent from Russian fossil fuels as quickly as possible” to “another level,” EC President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press conference for the REPowerEU plan.
The commission is proposing a solar rooftop requirement for commercial and public buildings from 2027, and for new residential buildings from 2029. “I know this is ambitious, but it is realistic, we can do it,” said von der Leyen, noting that investment in renewables is the bloc’s “biggest task.”
The commission also said that it is increasing its renewable energy target for 2030 from 40% to 45%. Faster permits for renewables will play a key role in achieving the higher target, she said. It also wants member states to set “renewables go-to-areas” for swift permitting. “There the permitting process is down to one year,” a substantial improvement on the current average of six to nine years, said von der Leyen.
The strategy also sets a 592 GWac (740 GWdc) target for solar in the European Union by 2030. “This target is higher than SolarPower Europe Global Market Outlook business-as-usual projections of 672 GWdc by the end of the decade,” trade body SolarPower Europe said in a statement released.
Applications for renewable energy systems in go-to areas would be entitled to decisions within 14 days, according to a leaked document that pv magazine has seen. Repowered sites in such areas would need to be permitted within six to nine months. The same would apply to systems with generation capacities of less than 150 kW. Other proposals announced include an increase of the EU energy efficiency target for 2030, from 9% to 13%.
“Today the European Commission recognises the immense potential of rooftop solar – as well as the need for a solar workforce to roll out both rooftop and utility solar across Europe,” said Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe. “We foresee up to 1.1 million solar jobs in Europe by 2030, and the EU Solar Skills Partnership will help deliver the workers on the ground.”
