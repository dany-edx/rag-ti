“We are delighted to announce that the Australia team of Trina ISBU successfully received the S5.3.4A approval letter for a 37.64 MW(dc) solar project from AusNet and AEMO in Victoria, Australia,” the company announced in a post on LinkedIn.
The Maffra Solar Farm, which Trina acquired from Sydney-based ARP Australian Solar as an early-stage development in 2020, is to be built on a 63-hectare site near Maffra, about 180 kilometres east of Melbourne in the middle of the declared Gippsland renewable energy zone.
With a capacity of 29.9 MW, the project will comprise about 125,000 solar panels and generate enough renewable energy to support approximately 7,200 households.
The Australian team of Trina’s International System Business Unit (Trina ISBU), which is responsible for the development and EPC management of the Maffra project, said construction is expected to commence in the coming months and the project will be fully operational before the end of next year.
“We anticipate financial close by Q2 2023 and to achieve full generation by Q4 2024,” Trina said.

The Maffra Solar Farm is the company’s first large-scale project to move to construction in Australia but Trina ISBU expects it will be the first of many, having identified the market as a point of focus for its development strategy in the Asia Pacific region.
Trina said it already has a combined 300 MWp in the pipeline in Australia and aims to reach 1 GW by the end of 2023, expanding that to 6.5 GW by 2027.
While the Maffra Solar Farm is the most advanced project in its portfolio, Trina said it is also pushing ahead with the development of an unidentified solar farm in New South Wales, aiming to achieve ready-to-build status with DA and CA approvals by Q3 2023.
“We have a five-year strategy to develop more than 6.5 GW utility scale projects in Australia, that includes solar, standalone battery energy storage systems and hybrid projects,” the company told pv magazine. “This has been mandated since Q3 2022.”
Trina said it is flexible with its development strategy and would look at a combination of co-development, M&A and greenfield developments to achieve its targets. It also said it will look beyond solar and storage and potentially include off-grid and green hydrogen in its Australia-wide portfolio of renewable projects.
Trina ISBU said it is active in more than 15 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Spain and Germany, and has connected more than 5.5 GW of solar projects to the grid worldwide.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/24/newcastle-airport-continues-journey-towards-100-renewables/,"MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",Newcastle Airport continues journey towards 100% renewables,"Under the agreement Melbourne-based Flow Power will prepare an energy plan that will see the Newcastle Airport hit its 100% renewable energy target seven years ahead of schedule, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.
Newcastle Airport Chief Executive Officer Dr Peter Cock said the agreement, which took effect last month and will support the airport’s operations for the next eight years, is a major step forward in the facility’s sustainability journey.
“Sustainability is key to everything we do,” he said. “We’re delighted to partner with Flow Power. By offsetting grid consumption with green generation certificates, they’ll help us significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and help us achieve our 100% renewable energy strategy well ahead of our 2030 target.”
Newcastle Airport Executive General Manager of Aviation Shane de Wit said the airport has committed to achieving net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by no later than 2030 and the partnership with Flow Power will support it in achieving those goals.
“The new agreement provides us with the ability to develop local renewable energy and offset any remaining demand with green generation certificates from off-site renewable energy sources,” he said.
The agreement is the latest of several renewable energy initiatives rolled out by the airport.
In 2021, 99 kWh of solar was installed which provided 3.9% of the airport’s energy demands and reduced its carbon footprint by more than 75 tonnes. A new covered carpark being developed at the airport will feature 1,212 solar panels which will generate enough clean energy to meet about 30% of the airport’s energy needs.
“We’re committed to continuous improvement and will continue to explore opportunities to reduce our environmental impact and support the transition to a low-carbon future,” de Wit said.

Flow Power General Manager of Energy Solutions, Jacob Mahoney, said he is excited to be partnering with Newcastle Airport and assisting them in their transition to renewable energy.
“Our mission is to create a clean energy future with our customers, and we are thrilled to be working with Newcastle Airport and supporting them to reach their sustainability goals,” he said.
The agreement is the latest for Flow Power which has established a renewable energy portfolio of more than 440 MW across the national electricity market (NEM).
Flow Power, which first introduced corporate renewable PPAs in 2017, said it provided 632 GWh of renewable energy to Australia’s grid in 2022. This included output from three owned and operated solar farms in Shoalhaven in NSW, and Streaky Bay and Coonalpyn in South Australia totalling 13.3 MW of generation capacity. The retailer also has 11 agreements for contracted energy generation from wind and solar farms totalling 410 MW of renewable generation capacity and has four renewable energy projects currently in construction across three states with the anticipated generation capacity of 17.4 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/24/key-contract-awarded-with-bathurst-island-to-boost-renewables/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",Key contract awarded with Bathurst Island to boost renewables,"Sydney-headquartered Circular Solutions has been awarded the design and construct tender to install a 1.1 MW solar farm coupled with a 3 MWh battery energy storage system that will boost the renewable energy supply for the small town of Wurrumiyanga on Bathurst Island, part of the Tiwi Islands about 80 kilometres northwest of Darwin.
The $6.1 million Wurrumiyanga Solar Infill and Energy Storage Pilot Project is part of the broader Renewable Remote Power Program which will see the Northern Territory (NT) government invest $8.6 million over four years to advance the delivery of clean electricity to remote communities across the territory.
The NT government said Wurrumiyanga’s new off-grid power plant will displace some of the town’s current diesel generated power supply with renewables, with works expected to be completed by April 2024.
NT Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said Wurrumiyanga is already home to an existing PV array but the new installation will “significantly increase” the energy generated by solar with renewables expected to provide almost 50% of the community’s electricity needs.
“The community is already operating some solar technology but we want to do more,” she said. “We’re going to replace some of the current diesel generated power supply with renewable tech.”
“In simple terms, it means the percentage of renewable energy in the community will increase by almost 50%.”

Fyles said the Wurrumiyanga project will not only benefit the local community but will also help the Territory achieve its net zero targets with the lessons learned during the delivery of the pilot project to be extended to other remote communities.
“The project is an important part of our plan to hit 50% renewables by 2030, including a 70% target in all remote communities supplied by IES (Indigenous Essential Services),” she said.
Fyles said the government will invest $2 million over the next two years to roll out renewable energy solutions in remote communities, with solar systems, batteries and green hydrogen set to replace diesel generators in 73 communities supplied by IES.
The NT government said the commitment has already resulted in a framework to deliver renewable energy systems, including solar systems, batteries and green hydrogen to replace diesel generators in 73 communities supplied by IES.
The government said work is progressing on the detailed analysis of each IES community to map the optimal renewables development pathway, considering, among other things, the design and configuration of existing energy assets, electricity demand profiles and forecast growth.

The company, which is commercialising graphene aluminium-ion battery technology developed in collaboration with the University of Queensland, has until now been working under R&D-level regulatory approvals to make battery cell prototypes.
GMG Chief Executive Officer Craig Nicol said the approvals announced this week will allow the company to further develop, engineer, design and test components to enable the manufacture of the prototypes in a semi or fully automated process.
“This is another milestone in the maturation of the company,” Nicol said. “This allows GMG to take its battery development roadmap further with reassurance that government approvals have been granted to build and operate a plant at our existing location.”
GMG said its technology, which sees an aluminium-ion battery paired with graphene electrodes, offers significant benefits over the lithium-ion technology that currently dominates the global energy storage market.

The company said laboratory testing and experiments have shown the graphene aluminium-ion battery has high energy densities and higher power densities compared to current lithium-ion technology.
GMG said testing showed its technology had a battery life of up to three times that of current leading lithium-ion batteries, and higher power density meant they charged up to 70 times faster and can be reused thousands of times.
“It’s not like a lithium battery, which typically takes 500 cycles, and then it has to be replaced,” Nicol said. “Ours is effectively like a hybrid supercapacitor battery, which can be charged thousands of times.”
GMG, which produces graphene and hydrogen by ‘cracking’ methane instead of mining graphite, has already made graphene aluminium-ion batteries in coin and pouch cell format and believes the potential is there to build batteries for grid-scale applications and electric vehicles (EVs).
The company said it will now look to further the development of its battery production systems. It will also look to establish necessary supply agreements and work towards securing battery sales agreements.

Trina Solar has unveiled a new Vertex S+ solar module series based on n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPcon) technology at the Genera trade show in Madrid, Spain.
“The new modules series is suitable for both residential and C&I applications,” company spokesperson Michael Katz told pv magazine. “The novelty of the new product consists of combining double-glass design with n-type technology.”
The company is offering the panel in two versions – a monofacial module with a white backseet and a bifacial product with a transparent backsheet.
“The monofacial NEG9R.28 comes with a white rear encapsulant for maximum output power, boasting up to 445Wp and reaching 22.3% efficiency,” the manufacturer said. “In contrast, the transparent NEG9RC.27 is the preferred option for high-end aesthetic applications, for example on residential rooftops where the array would all but disappear optically. This bifacial module features a front side power of 435Wp, at 21.8% efficiency.”
Trina Solar is offering five versions of the NEG9R.28 products, with a power output spanning from 425 W to 445 W and power conversion efficiencies ranging from 21.3% to 22,3%. Their open-circuit voltage ranges from 50.9 V to 52.6 V and the short-circuit current is between 10.56 A and 10.71 A. The panels measure 1,762 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 21.1 kg.
The NEG9RC.27 modules are available in five versions with output between 415 W and 435 W and efficiency ranging from 20.8% to 21.8%. Their open-circuit voltage ranges from 50.1 V to 51.8 V and the short-circuit current is between 10.50 A and 10.64 A. They measure 1,762 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weigh in at 21.1 kg.
The products can be used with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and are built with IP 68 enclosures. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per C and an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The panels come with a 25-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“Both types feature a surface area of just under two square meters and a black aluminum frame,” the manufacturer said.
“When it comes to installation, Vertex S+ is highly compatible with other BOS components,” Trina Solar explained.
It offers a range of mounting methods, including short side and long side clamping, crossed beam, shared rail, and slide-in mounting. Due to its short circuit current of 10.7A, it is also compatible with more than 99% of mainstream inverters in the market, as verified by a comprehensive compatibility analysis.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/24/impact-of-single-axis-agrivoltaics-systems-on-non-irrigated-grassland/,"RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"FEBRUARY 24, 2023",Impact of single-axis agrivoltaics systems on non-irrigated grassland,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at Colorado State University are investigating how the redistribution of rainfall and light caused by agrivoltaic systems mounted on single-axis trackers can affect the growth of non-irrigated grassland. The study is part of the Sustainably Colocating Agricultural and Photovoltaic Electricity System (SCAPES) project, funded by the US Department of Agriculture.
“What we found is that on the drip edges of modules, depending on whether you’re tilting to the east or the west when there is a rainfall, you can get somewhere between two to five times the amount of precipitation dumped in one spot,” PhD student Matthew Sturchio told pv magazine. “If you want to quantify that for Colorado, it’s about changing the annual precipitation from 350 mm to 1,200 mm of rain. When you do that, you can really improve the amount of soil moisture that stays throughout the season, instead of letting it evaporate.”
Sturchio and his team are conducting research on Jack’s Solar Garden, a 1.2 MW community solar garden in Boulder, Colorado. The project was installed in 2020 and features more than 3,200 380 W monocrystalline PV modules from Vietnam-based solar manufacturer Boviet Solar. The panels are mounted on single-axis trackers, one-third of them at 2.4 meters height, and the other two-thirds at 1.8 meters.
Colorado has a semi-arid climate, with stronger rainfalls and temperatures around 35 C in the afternoons. Temperatures in the morning are around 22 C. The trackers tilt to the east in the morning, and to the west in the afternoon, following the sun. When it rains, this movement simulates the conditions of large rainfalls on either edge, with more water falling on the west edge due to the higher rainfall volumes in the afternoon.
Consequently, the research team originally expected the west drip edge to show increased grassland productivity. Instead, they found that the east edge, with lower soil moisture, has higher grassland growth.
They placed moisture sensors on the land and found that there is a 40 cm to 60 cm wide strip that benefits from the increased soil moisture from the drip edges. Experiments showed that air temperature and dryness also impact grassland productivity within and outside that strip.
The temperature optimum for the grassland growing at Jack’s Solar Garden is a lot closer to 30 C than it is to the 35 C registered in the afternoons, according to Sturchio. “If you exceed 30 degrees, you are reducing the amount of photosynthesis that can happen for that plant,” he said.
The team found that the lower air temperatures and reduced air dryness in the morning compensate for lower soil moisture, leading to increased productivity in the east edge.
 

The shading provided by the solar arrays also proved to increase productivity.
“Typically, you’d imagine that grassland is adapted to deal with really high light for the entire day,” said Sturchio. “But we found that if you shade for half of the day with the solar array, it improves photosynthetic efficiency. You have higher rates of photosynthesis when the sun is available because you have a shorter photoperiod,” he explained.
Moreover, shorter photoperiod results in less evapotranspiration from the leaves, reducing the amount of water loss. This could prove crucial in keeping grassland productivity during periods of drought, according to Sturchio. The team hopes to test the hypothesis if Colorado experiences a drought period in the future.
The installation at Jack’s Solar Garden is designed to maximise electricity production, without much space between panel rows. The team found that the soil outside the east or west edge strip behaves more like the space between panel rows, and the conditions between the two strips are more similar to the conditions directly underneath the solar arrays.
They also observed that the leaves of plants under the solar arrays are 4 C cooler. “There are a lot of plants that can benefit from this lower temperature in the middle of summer in Colorado,” said Sturchio.
Overall, the present design leads to 9% less grass production, mainly attributed to the space directly under the solar array. The economic gains from electricity production vastly compensate for the slightly lower crop production, according to Sturchio.
“But if we space the solar arrays out to 15 meters apart, then you get a 6% increase in productivity in a wet year,” he claimed.
Going forward, the SCAPES project aims to develop agrivoltaics in degraded agro-ecosystems.
The team believes that their understanding of the effects of single-axis agrivoltaic systems on rainfall and light redistribution and consequent impacts on crop productivity can help to restore land degraded by overgrazing, agriculture practice, and water scarcity.
