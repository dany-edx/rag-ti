AEMO said the average variable renewable energy (VRE) generation increased by 457 MW in Q2 2021, with wind and grid-scale solar contributing 254 MW and 203 MW respectively due to new capacity that has connected to the grid in the past year.
The recent addition of new large-scale wind and solar projects, including the 275 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm in New South Wales and the 200 MW Kiamal Solar Farm in Victoria, saw the average output of grid-scale VRE reach a record 7,368 MW in the June quarter, 483 MW higher than the previous record set in Q1 2021.
Renewables, including grid-scale wind and solar, hydro, biomass and rooftop PV, also achieved a record share of operational demand in the NEM, reaching a record high 57% of total demand between 11am and 11.30am on April 11, up from the previous record of 56% set on October 3, 2020.
The penetration of wind energy also reached a reached high, rising to 5,587 MW at 9pm on May 25, 389 MW higher than the previous record set in Q3 2020, while hydro generation ramped up by 130 MW during the quarter despite dry conditions in some NEM regions.
Grid-scale solar output increased by 203 MW on average, with the largest rise compared to Q2 2020 occurring in New South Wales (NSW) which saw a 139 MW increase. This was driven by a ramping up of recently installed capacity, with the three largest solar farms in the region – Darlington Point, Limondale and Sunraysia solar farms – accounting for 52% of the increase.

Victoria’s output increased by 61 MW on the same period in 2020, driven by continued ramp up of recently installed capacity including the Kiamal and Glenrowan solar farms.
Despite continued ramp up of recently installed capacity, the average Queensland output decreased by 19 MW, mainly due to increased self-curtailment resulting from negative spot prices and high frequency control ancillary service (FCAS) prices.
The figures highlight the importance of AEMO chief Dan Westerman’s recent declaration that the market operator wants to have the conditions in place for 100% of the generating capacity to be supplied from renewables by 2025.
Speaking in Melbourne earlier this month at an event hosted by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Westerman upped the operator’s ambitions for renewable penetrations in the grid,
“Right now, we are seeing everyday our control rooms grapple with very high and very low periods of instantaneous renewables penetration,” he said.
“Our job is to operate a safe, secure, reliable and affordable energy system, so we need to be in a position where we can manage 100% instantaneous penetration of renewables.
“This must be our goal, not because of personal ambition or politics or ideology, but because we know this is where we’re headed.”

AEMO said the continuing growth in VRE output and a reduction in coal-fired generation led to a record decline in emissions, despite increased demand.
The increase in renewable production saw NEM emissions drop to the lowest Q2 total on record at 32.1 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, 1% lower than Q2 2020.
The quarter also saw a dramatic turnaround in wholesale electricity prices following what AEMO said was “an exceptionally low Q1”.
Mainland wholesale electricity prices rebounded strongly after a year in decline, averaging $95/MWh compared to $37/MWh in Q1 2021.
“This represents the highest quarterly average in almost two years, occurring in what is typically a lower-priced quarter,” AEMO said in the report.
Queensland recorded its highest Q2 average on record at $128/MWh, while NSW also increased significantly to $111/MWh, with significant price volatility in both regions, triggered in part by a series of coal-fired generator outages.
While wind and grid-scale solar penetration in the NEM continued to rise, black coal-fired output was comparable to Q2 2020, down 26 MW to 11,164 MW.
Brown coal-fired generation decreased by 182 MW while gas-powered generation was similar to Q2 2020, with increased output during the high-priced peak evening period almost offsetting reductions during other times.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/23/tesla-deal-tipped-to-help-drive-bhps-net-zero-ambitions/,"EV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 23, 2021",Tesla deal tipped to help drive BHP’s net zero ambitions,"The new agreement will see BHP supply Tesla with nickel from its Nickel West plant in Western Australia, with the key metal to be used by the carmaker to manufacture electric vehicle (EV) batteries.
The two companies will also work together on finding new ways to make the battery supply chain more sustainable, and also to identify opportunities to lower carbon emissions through the increased use of renewable energy.
“Demand for nickel in batteries is estimated to grow by over 500% over the next decade, in large part to support the world’s rising demand for electric vehicles,” BHP chief commercial officer Vandita Pant said.
“We are delighted to sign this agreement with Tesla, and to collaborate with them on ways to make the battery supply chain more sustainable through our shared focus on technology and innovation.”
BHP said the terms of the agreement, including how much nickel it would supply Tesla were confidential.
Tesla already sources more than one third of its nickel from Australia and chairwoman Robyn Denholm only last month said she expects the company to ramp up its intake of battery raw materials from Australia.
“Australia has the minerals to power the renewable energy age throughout the world in the coming years.” Denholm said during a Minerals Council of Australia event.
“We expect our spend on Australian minerals to increase to more than $1 billion per annum for the next few years,” she said.

In addition to the supply agreement, BHP and Tesla will collaborate on ways to make the battery supply chain more sustainable, with a focus on end-to-end raw material traceability using blockchain; technical exchange for battery raw materials production; and promotion of the importance of sustainability in the resources sector.
BHP Minerals Australia president Edgar Basto said the company will also work with Tesla on energy storage solutions to identify opportunities to lower carbon emissions in their respective operations through increased use of renewable energy paired with battery storage.
“BHP produces some of the lowest carbon intensity nickel in the world, and we are on the pathway to net zero at our operations,” Basto said.
“Sustainable, reliable production of quality nickel will be essential to meeting demand from sustainable energy producers like Tesla.
“The investments we have made in our assets and our pursuit of commodities like nickel will help support global decarbonisation and position us to generate long-term value for our business.”
The announcement of the deal comes as reports indicate BHP is reviewing its petroleum business and considering options including a trade sale as it looks to move away from both thermal coal and petroleum.
The deliberations are said to be still at an early stage and no final decision has been made.
BHP has been in oil and gas since the 1960s and has assets in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Australia. It produced 102.8 million barrels of oil equivalent in the year ending June 30.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/23/new-zealand-reveals-plans-to-join-global-green-hydrogen-race/,"HYDROGEN,NEW ZEALAND,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 23, 2021",New Zealand reveals plans to join global green hydrogen race,"New Zealand electricity generation companies Meridian Energy and Contact Energy are testing the waters with plans to establish a large-scale green hydrogen production and export facility in the Southland region using renewable energy supplied by the existing 800 MW Manapouri hydroelectric power station.
While details about the size of the proposed Southern Green Hydrogen project are scarce, Contact and Meridian are now seeking registrations of interest from potential large consumers, producers and associated service providers as they look to progress plans to develop the project near the bottom of the nation’s South Island.
The proposed project, which has reached the feasibility stage, has already overcome a major stumbling block with an energy supply already in place with the developers indicating the facility will utilise soon-to-be-surplus renewable energy produced by the Manapouri power station.
The largest hydroelectric generator in New Zealand, Manapouri currently supplies the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, which consumes about 12% of New Zealand’s electricity. That supply agreement is set to expire in December 2024.
The exit of the smelter, majority-owned by Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, will free up an estimated 438 GWh of renewable energy per year and Meridian and Contact are looking to repurpose that renewable electricity into the emerging green hydrogen industry.
“Our renewable energy gives us a valuable head start and competitive edge as markets for green hydrogen develop,” Meridian Energy chief executive Neal Barclay said.
“Early, large-scale production will allow us to build a domestic hydrogen supply chain and kickstart demand around the country.”

A study completed by global consultancy McKinsey & Co into the viability of the Southern Green Hydrogen project said the project would allow New Zealand to capitalise on a growing green hydrogen market.
“The market for green hydrogen is gathering strong momentum globally. In March 2021 there were 50 GW of announced green hydrogen electrolyser projects through to 2030, up from 3 GW in June 2019 for the same period,” the report says.
“The global demand for green hydrogen is expected to reach significant scale by 2040 and could be as high as 553 million tonnes by 2050.
“Reflecting this demand increase, supply projects are ramping up around the globe, with more than NZ$462 billion (AU$436bn) of hydrogen-related investments already announced through to 2030.”
McKinsey & Co said New Zealand has the potential to become the world’s first large-scale producer of green hydrogen with the country’s existing renewable generation likely to underpin a long-term cost advantage.
“New Zealand has a key competitive advantage, as the renewable electricity available from 1 January 2025 could produce green hydrogen at an internationally competitive price point,” the report says.
Barclay said the Southern Green Hydrogen project has the potential to earn hundreds of millions in export revenue and deliver major benefits for New Zealand.
“Developing a hydrogen economy based on large-scale production in Southland could deliver significant decarbonisation, economic and energy independence benefits for New Zealand,” he said.

Modelling done on 600 MW of electrolyser capacity indicates the project could deliver significant economic benefits to New Zealand, including a one-off addition of up to AU$756 million to the nation’s GDP and ongoing benefits of up to AU$425 million per annum.
Contact Energy CEO Mike Fuge said green hydrogen production will also support New Zealand’s transition to a 100% renewable electricity generation system.
“This can be achieved by reducing hydrogen production when the country’s hydro lakes are running low, allowing electricity to flow back into the national grid to support local homes and businesses.
“In this mode of operation, green hydrogen could solve up to 40% of New Zealand’s ‘dry year’ problem. This flexibility would see hydro generation replace coal and gas-fired generation and reduce carbon emissions.
Given the low lake levels over the past six months, if this plant had been available this year it could have been used to avoid up to one million tonnes of carbon emissions.”
The Southern Green Hydrogen feasibility study is ongoing, with another two reports expected to be produced later this year.
The registration of interest process will run through to October.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/23/japan-revises-2030-targets-plans-to-double-renewables-and-cut-fossil-fuels/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN",BLAKE MATICH,"JULY 23, 2021","Japan revises 2030 targets, plans to double renewables and cut fossil fuels","The unprecedented Tokyo Olympic Games mean the world’s attention is focused on Japan, and The Land of the Rising Sun’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has taken the opportunity to revise its draft energy plan for 2030. The new plan sees an ambitious doubling of renewables and significant cuts to coal and gas. What is more, the draft plan also proposes the building of a hydrogen supply chain. 
The move comes in response to pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden, the upcoming Glasgow climate change conference in November, and the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) “Japan 2021 Energy Policy Review”, published earlier this year, in which IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol described the challenge ahead of Japan as “considerable”, and warned that even if Japan met its 2030 climate goals (pre-revision) “a very significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions post-2030 will be necessary if Japan is to realise its ambition of achieving carbon-neutrality by 2050.” 
The new draft plan looks to cut Japan’s emissions by 46% (from 2013 levels) up from the original goal of 26%. To achieve that the world’s third largest economy needs renewables to account for 36-38% of its energy generation mix by 2030, a significant increase from the previous target of 22-24%. 
On top of that, the coal target has been revised down from 26% to 19%, and gas, upon which Japan relies heavily, is to be reduced from 56% to 41%. Amongst all this change, Japan’s nuclear target has remained unchanged at 20-22%. 
Interestingly, Japan has included new fuels like hydrogen and ammonia in its new draft plan, which it says will contribute 1% of the energy mix by 2030. However, the plan did not specify these new fuels had to be green.

Japanese Prime Minister Suga originally announced the revised 46% reduction in emissions at the April Leaders Summit on Climate, hosted by the US President Biden. At the Summit, Suga said the reduction “would mean that Japan will raise our current target by over 70%, and it will certainly not be an easy task. However, by defining a top-level ambitious target befitting to a next growth strategy of the nation which underpins manufacturing in the world, Japan is ready to demonstrate its leadership for world-wide decarbonisation.” 
What is not clear is just how Japan can increase its renewable generation so significantly over the course of the decade. The country is already so short on useable land that it is ripping up golf-courses and replacing them with solar farms, utilising floating PV on lakes and reservoirs, and looking to invest strongly in wind. However, much of the waters around Japan are too deep for traditional wind turbines and floating wind turbines are still technologically nascent. 
Impact on Australia’s export future 
Considering Japan is the largest buyer of Australian coal and thermal coal, and the world’s largest importer of LNG (buying $15 billion worth of Australia’s LNG exports in 2020), there is no doubt that Japan’s revised ambitions will have an impact on Australia, and perhaps particularly on the Morrison’s government’s controversial “gas-led recovery”, toward which it has already committed to funding private industry to the tune of $224 million for the development of onshore gas fields in the Northern Territory’s (NT) Beetaloo Basin. 
Indeed, on the same day one of Australia’s biggest export partners demonstrated clear intentions of reducing their dependency on Australia’s fossil fuel exports, Australia’s Minister for Resources and Water, Keith Pitt, reiterated that “the Coalition Government’s Gas-Fired Recovery is the right policy for Australia.” 
In a statement about a new seven-year deal signed between QLD gas company Senex Energy and South Australian cement manufacturer Adbri Limited to supply up to 11 petajoules of gas from 2023. “We can’t be following the examples of NSW and Victoria where the answer is to bow to activist pressure and just lock up our gas resources,” said Pitt. 
Meanwhile, back in reality, the Climate Council’s Madeline Taylor pointed out that “Japan is one of Australia’s biggest export markets for LNG…This development could undermine the Federal government’s support for new gas earmarked for export…This creates economic risks for Australian LNG exports, which represent up to 82% of Australia’s gas production.”
“The government has allocated tens of millions of dollars into opening up new gas basins like the Beetaloo basin in the NT and the Bowen and Galilee basins in Queensland (QLD), but it’s not clear this spending is necessary, given the growing uncertainty around having buyers for this gas.” 
In contrast to Japan, continued Taylor, “Australia has not adopted a binding net zero emissions target, nor has it raised the ambition of its 2030 target, which is well below scientific recommendations…As one of the sunniest and windiest countries on earth, Australia could be generating and exporting renewable energy to meet rising global demand. The government must accelerate progress towards a renewables-powered economy instead.” 
The Australian Conservation Foundation’s Elizabeth Sullivan agree, noting that “Australian coal burned in Japan generates roughly as much climate pollution as all Australia’s carbon emissions every year…This revised draft energy plan suggests Japan is moving quickly to replace its fossil fuel energy with renewable energy, including hydrogen and ammonia, which could be made and shipped from here, using Australia’s abundant renewable resources.” 
The revised draft plan must first be opened to public comment and then approved by cabinet before it becomes policy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/23/the-sunlight-that-powers-solar-panels-also-damages-them-gallium-doping-is-providing-a-solution/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 23, 2021",The sunlight that powers solar panels also damages them. ‘Gallium doping’ is providing a solution,"From The Conversation 
In Australia, more than two million rooftops have solar panels (the most per capita in the world). The main material used in panels is silicon. Silicon makes up most of an individual solar cell’s components required to convert sunlight into power. But some other elements are also required.
Research from our group at the University of New South Wales’s School of Photovoltaics and Renewable Energy Engineering shows that adding gallium to the cell’s silicon can lead to very stable solar panels which are much less susceptible to degrading over their lifetime.
This is the long-term goal for the next generation of solar panels: for them to produce more power over their lifespan, which means the electricity produced by the system will be cheaper in the long run.
As gallium is used more and more to achieve this, our findings provide robust data that could allow manufacturers to make decisions that will ultimately have a global impact.
The process of ‘doping’ solar cells
A solar cell converts sunlight into electricity by using the energy from sunlight to “break away” negative charges, or electrons, in the silicon. The electrons are then collected as electricity.
However, shining light on a plain piece of silicon doesn’t generate electricity, as the electrons that are released from the light do not all flow in the same direction. To make the electricity flow in one direction, we need to create an electric field.
In silicon solar cells — the kind currently producing power for millions of Australian homes — this is done by adding different impurity atoms to the silicon, to create a region that has more negative charges than normal silicon (n-type silicon) and a region that has fewer negative charges (p-type silicon).
When we put the two parts of silicon together, we form what is called a “p-n junction”. This allows the solar cell to operate. And the adding of impurity atoms into silicon is called “doping”.
An unfortunate side effect of sunlight
The most commonly used atom to form the p-type part of the silicon, with less negative charge than plain silicon, is boron.
Boron is a great atom to use as it has the exact number of electrons needed for the task. It can also be distributed very uniformly through the silicon during the production of the high-purity crystals required for solar cells.
But in a cruel twist, shining light on boron-filled silicon can make the quality of the silicon degrade. This is often referred to as “light-induced degradation” and has been a hot topic in solar research over the past decade.
The reason for this degradation is relatively well understood: when we make the pure silicon material, we have to purposefully add some impurities such as boron to generate the electric field that drives the electricity. However, other unwanted atoms are also incorporated into the silicon as a result.
One of these atoms is oxygen, which is incorporated into the silicon from the crucible — the big hot pot in which the silicon is refined.
When light shines on silicon that contains both boron and oxygen, they bond together, causing a defect that can trap electricity and reduce the amount of power generated by the solar panel.
Unfortunately, this means the sunlight that powers solar panels also damages them over their lifetime. An element called gallium looks like it could be the solution to this problem.
A smarter approach
Boron isn’t the only element we can use to make p-type silicon. A quick perusal of the periodic table shows a whole column of elements that have one less negative charge than silicon.
Adding one of these atoms to silicon upsets the balance between the negative and positive charge, which is needed to make our electric field. Of these atoms, the most suitable is gallium.
Gallium is a very suitable element to make p-type silicon. In fact, multiple studies have shown it doesn’t bond together with oxygen to cause degradation. So, you may be wondering, why we haven’t been using gallium all along?
Well, the reason we have been stuck using boron instead of gallium over the past 20 years is that the process of doping silicon with gallium was locked under a patent. This prevented manufacturers using this approach.
But these patents finally expired in May 2020. Since then, the industry has rapidly shifted from boron to gallium to make p-type silicon.
In fact, at the start of 2021, leading photovoltaic manufacturer Hanwha Q Cells estimated about 80% of all solar panels manufactured in 2021 used gallium doping rather than boron — a massive transition in such a short time!
Does gallium really boost solar panel stability?
We investigated whether solar cells made with gallium-doped silicon really are more stable than solar cells made with boron-doped silicon.
To find out, we made solar cells using a “silicon heterojunction” design, which is the approach that has led to the highest efficiency silicon solar cells to date. This work was done in collaboration with Hevel Solar in Russia.
We measured the voltage of both boron-doped and gallium-doped solar cells during a light-soaking test for 300,000 seconds. The boron-doped solar cell underwent significant degradation due to the boron bonding with oxygen.
Meanwhile, the gallium-doped solar cell had a much higher voltage. Our result also demonstrated that p-type silicon made using gallium is very stable and could help unlock savings for this type of solar cell.
To think it might be possible for manufacturers to work at scale with gallium, producing solar cells that are both more stable and potentially cheaper, is a hugely exciting prospect.
The best part is our findings could have a direct impact on industry. And cheaper solar electricity for our homes means a brighter future for our planet, too.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/23/polysilicon-shortage-will-continue-through-2021/,"COVID-19,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JULY 23, 2021",‘Polysilicon shortage will continue through 2021’,"From pv magazine Global 
Despite describing the polysilicon shortage which has driven up solar module prices in recent months, and other material constraints, as “brief incidences that are already being resolved,” in a upbeat conclusion to a new report, trade body SolarPower Europe has said it expects the scarcity of the solar module raw material to remain this year.
That was one of many predictions made by the European solar industry body – many of them more upbeat – in its flagship Global Market Outlook For Solar Power 2021-2025 report, published yesterday.
While conceding the poly squeeze is unlikely to ease this year, SolarPower Europe said the upward pressure on prices appears to have peaked, according to last month’s factory-gate numbers. The trade body says that is because of the rising volume of corporate-driven solar projects worldwide. If the price of panels becomes too expensive, unsubsidised solar parks planned by private businesses will simply not be built, and the world’s solar manufacturers are aware of the fact, according to the authors of the market report.
The tone of the document was mostly upbeat, with the organisation happily reporting the negative predictions made in last year’s iteration of the outlook – written during the worst period to date of Europe’s Covid-19 crisis – have mostly been revised upwards after solar weathered the public health storm much better than had been anticipated.
Rising Covid-19 vaccination rates and, pertinently on the polysilicon issue, plans to ramp up silicon production capacity have prompted the organisation to make a slew of positive predictions, with SolarPower Europe predicting the world will add 163 GW of solar generation capacity this year, to reach 773 GW.
The world will break the 200 GW barrier for new solar next year – two years earlier than predicted by the lobby group a year ago – by adding 203 GW, and a further 225 GW will come online in 2023; 239 GW the following year; and 266 GW in 2025. That would add up to a global solar generation fleet of 1.8 TW by the middle of the decade, with the terawatt mark passed at some point next year. And that, SolarPower Europe added, is based on its medium-scenario expectations; in its most optimistic forecast, the world could have 2.15 TW of solar by the end of 2025, especially if mooted green hydrogen generation plants begin to take shape during that period.
Solar superpower China is expected to add up to 71 GW of capacity this year and SolarPower Europe predicted it will bring a further 76 GW online next year and then 85 GW, 91 GW and 102 GW, to 2025.
The changing of the guard in Washington could see the U.S. add 24.1 GW this year and peak at 28 GW of new solar in 2023, driven by an extended Investment Tax Credit for solar. After that, the U.S. will level off at around 25.5-26 GW per year, according to the report’s authors.
With Germany set to add 6.2 GW this year; Denmark and Greece to join the gigawatt-market club and Turkey to regain admission, SolarPower Europe has predicted its home market will bring 37.4 GW online next year, rising to 45 GW in 2024, and 51 GW in 2025.
There was wide variance in the figures expected from India, after it’s Covid-related solar slump last year, with the outlook guesstimating 5.6-10 GW could be added this year, depending on which of its scenarios is considered. That could leap to 18-22 GW next year, said the trade body, but with a solar fleet of 41 GW at the time of publication, the 100 GW solar target set by prime minister Narendra Modi for next year is more likely to be achieved in 2024, after around 19 GW of plants comes online in each of 2023 and 2024.
SolarPower Europe said enthusiasm for rooftop solar would ensure Mexico adds 2.3 GW this year, despite the fossil fuel-focused policies of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador but noted solar installation volumes are expected to retreat in Japan, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as in Ukraine, after the government’s retroactive reduction of feed-in tariffs (FITs).
The annual report also offered an interesting insight into the best performing nations in terms of the volume of solar capacity installed per citizen, with Australia topping the ranking with 826 W of solar for every resident. Germany boasted 652 W per capita, followed by the Netherlands (603 W), Japan (563 W), Belgium (540 W), Switzerland (354 W), Italy (350 W), Greece (315 W), Spain (303 W) and Israel (301 W).
The membership body behind the report noted new, vaccination-resistant variants of Covid-19 might pose a significant threat to the solar success story. The allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang, China which have prompted the Biden administration in the U.S. to announce an intent to boycott such goods could also prove a fly in the ointment, especially if other nations follow America’s lead, SolarPower Europe noted, while considering either roadblock unlikely.
With the outlook including reports from solar associations in each of the world’s gigawatt solar markets, perusal of the national round-ups revealed Ghana‘s off-grid commercial and industrial PV segment is being hindered by unspecified domestic content rules; Australia’s solar industry could explode to more than 120 GW if vast green hydrogen and green ammonia facilities come to fruition; Mexico’s political troubles mean it will add less than a gigawatt of big solar parks annually for the foreseeable future; and 5,000 people left Ukraine’s solar industry last year, in the wake of FIT cuts and an ongoing suspension of planned renewables auctions which were set to start, under new rules, in December 2019.
