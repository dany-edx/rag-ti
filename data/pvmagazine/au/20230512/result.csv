The $368 billion (USD 250 billion) AUKUS deal has had some critics arguing that Australia’s money would be better spent fighting climate change. 
While it’s true that switching to clean energy is a national security imperative much in the same way that defence is, looking at the AUKUS deal as simply consuming capital that could go towards climate-related industries is rather blinkered. Likewise, to view the Quad simply as a strategic defence cooperation partnership underestimates its potential. 
Minister Bowen, in his speech to the Smart Energy Conference in May, noted that supply chain logistics is now a key focus of discussions in the Quad. It is not a matter of every member manufacturing everything, but ensuring that every member can contribute to a diversified supply chain and ensuring that we have secure supply chains amongst our friends. 
AUKUS and the submarine procurement is, at its core, a massive example of ‘friendshoring’ – the act of focussing supply chain networks on countries regarded as political and economic allies. Given the challenges Australia is currently facing in achieving its ambitious climate goals, wouldn’t it make sense to apply a similar approach to our climate challenges?
Say what you like about the defence industry, but there’s no denying it has always driven innovation and cooperation between allies. Imagine if we could channel the same collaboration and innovation to bring an end to climate change.
Climate change and national security are intrinsically linked. The Ukraine war, for example, has resulted in a massive acceleration in the uptake of renewable energy globally, as countries wake up to the realities of relying on unsavoury regimes for oil and gas. 
Australia’s increasing overreliance on China for renewables is a similarly worrying development, highlighting the urgent need to diversify our global partners. As things stand, Australia is 90% dependent on Chinese supply chains for renewable energy, presenting a sovereign risk. The lack of cybersecurity measures present in these products poses a huge risk for Australia, as they could be hacked, leading to widespread energy outages. 
Compare our situation to that of the US, where stimulation as part of the Inflation Reduction Act will localise production of the large swathes of the renewable energy and hydrogen production supply chain. Thanks to the subsidies, it’s possible that US panels will actually become cheaper than Chinese panels. The IRA will stimulate massive investment in the US.
The problem is, even if Australia had the money for a similar stimulus package, the size of our market simply isn’t big enough for to support the complete localisation of the renewable energy supply chain. 
In the same way that Australia is not a big enough player to survive without like-minded allies from a defence perspective, we’re in the same position with our renewable energy transition. So, we’ve come to a crossroads. We either remain at the behest of people who aren’t our allies, or we work together with our allies to shore up our (and their) supply chains. 
With the UK and US’s massive economic stimulus packages underway, Australia is at serious risk of missing out on supply support or being forced to rely on its global opponents to supply. We must use our own incentives to support the growth of the renewable energy industry, but we should also draw on the support of our allies by ensuring Australia is a key player within their own incentives.
The emergence of new overseas competitors is a direct result of Australia’s inability to satisfy the demand for energy products – a problem that could be remedied by strengthening Australia’s climate allies.
Through a wider network of treaties and trade deals, we could turn Australian-made renewables into an incredibly attractive proposition to the global market. Take battery cells for solar PV systems, for example. Most battery cells are still currently coming out of China, posing an unnecessary risk. A lot of the minerals required for the battery cells are available here in Australia, presenting a huge opportunity for Australia around critical minerals and critical mineral processing, to produce battery cells for both local use and to sell to our overseas ‘friends’. 
Existing partnerships, such as the German-Australian Hydrogen Alliance, give us an insight into what the future could look like if climate friendshoring was implemented on a larger scale. The bilateral alliance on hydrogen production and trade was signed on June 2021,  helping Australia strengthen its renewable energies export infrastructure, while allowing Germany to meet its growing energy needs via cleaner sources. Imagine what the future might hold if we would create an ongoing network of similar partnerships, formed with allies from around the globe. 
A ‘climate AUKUS’ or clean energy Quad has the potential to secure manufacturing, onshore our processes, secure the availability of equipment, and make Australia’s abundance of critical minerals available both locally and to our allies to facilitate the renewables transition. 
So, rather than looking at the money that AUKUS takes away from climate change, or the Quad as simply a strategic defence cooperation, let’s look at how we can build a partnership like that with our global friends to tackle this huge multi-generational issue together, from a technology and a supply-side perspective.
In order to get there, Australia must apply the same rigour to its ‘climate allies’ as it has its security allies. It’s time we started pushing for a climate AUKUS and a green Quad.

The NT government said the hub, planned for a 1,500-hectare site at Middle Arm, will support its renewable energy target of 50% by 2030 “by investing in large-scale renewable solar farms to deliver clean and affordable power to Territorians.”
NT Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said the proposed hub is part of the Darwin-Katherine electricity system plan which has been developed to assist in the transformation of the Territory’s power system.
“We want Territorians to have access to the latest and best technology as we build a stronger and more resilient power system for Territory households and businesses,” she said. “In Budget 2023 the NT government will continue to implement plans and strategies to support the achievement of the renewable energy target and improve the delivery of electricity services to consumers.”
Fyles said under the Darwin-Katherine electricity system plan, more large- and small-scale solar, increased battery energy storage use and new “hydrogen-compatible” gas generators will help lift the proportion of renewable energy in the NT’s largest power grid with the target of 50% renewable energy by the end of the decade, and towards zero net emissions by 2050.
The plan also includes the development of the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct near the existing transmission infrastructure at Channel Island in Darwin Harbour.
Middle Arm is already home to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export hub, and the Territory government is pushing ahead with construction of a 35 MW/35 MWh battery at the site. The Darwin-Katherine Battery Energy Storage System is expected to be operational later this year.

It is envisaged the new precinct will centralise the Territory’s export and energy industries with a focus on low-emissions manufacturing and related eco systems including renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, minerals processing, and green hydrogen production.
“The industrial precinct will be largely powered by renewables, master-planned to achieve a circular economy approach of sustainable and responsible production and will use technology to achieve low-to-zero emissions,” the government said. “This is a sustainable future project that is based on renewable energy into the future.”
The funding injection for the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct is part of a $26.4 million renewable energy package outlined by Fyles when she released the budget earlier this week.
Other energy initiatives include $5.4 million earmarked to progress electricity market reforms and achieve the government’s renewables target while $1.7 million has been allocated in the budget to collect wind resource data.
The Territory’s $7.3 million Remote Power Program will continue with the government to advance the delivery of renewable energy solutions in remote communities, with solar systems, batteries and green hydrogen set to replace diesel generators in communities across the territory.
The NT government said the commitment has already resulted in a framework to deliver renewable energy systems, including solar systems, batteries and green hydrogen to replace diesel generators in 73 communities.
The budget also includes funding to ensure the government’s Home and Business Battery Scheme will continue in 2023-24.
The scheme offers grants of $6,000 to homeowners, businesses and not-for-profit organisations to buy and install solar systems with an eligible battery and inverter or complement an existing solar system with a battery and inverter. The scheme was launched in 2020 with a modest target to support 133 battery installations, but to date has resulted in more than 1,600 batteries being installed across the Territory.
The government has also allocated funding for government-owned electricity retailer Jacana Energy to implement a trial of rooftop solar on 30 public housing tenancies in Darwin, Palmerston and Tennant Creek.

Malaysia’s Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change and Ministry of Economy are working together to establish plans and determine new renewable energy initiatives and programs to drive the development of the country’s renewable energy industry.
The ministries earlier this month presented their proposals to the cabinet, which approved a number of measures:
“With this development, the renewable energy capacity in the electricity supply system is anticipated to reach approximately 70% by 2050,” said Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, minister of natural resources, environment and climate change. “The expansion of renewable energy capacity will enable surplus renewable energy generation capacity to be exchanged across borders with regional neighbours based on a mechanism that will be determined by the government, thus advancing the realisation of the ASEAN Power Grid.”
The projected increase in renewable energy capacity is in line with government-backed studies on a low-carbon energy system pathway and will be incorporated into the National Power Development Plan (PDP), he added.
Efforts to increase renewable energy capacity in Malaysia’s electricity supply system are expected to require investments of some MYR 637 billion ($211 billion) through 2050. That funding would finance renewable energy generation sources and strengthen grid infrastructure, including transmission lines enhancement, energy storage system integration and operation costs of grid system networks.
The natural resources and environment ministry will examine the details of the costs and investment values involved as well as the affect on tariffs for electricity consumers.
Malaysia currently has 2,165 MW of total installed solar capacity, according to data from Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum.
It aims to add an additional 1,098 MW by 2025, and another 2,414 MW by 2035. The country has raised its renewable energy targets to 31% by 2025, equaling 8.53 GW of total renewable generation capacity, and to 40% by 2025, or 10.94 GW.

Australia announced a budget of $4 billion for the renewable energy sector, with half of the investment to target hydrogen. “Hydrogen Headstart will bridge the commercial gap for early‑stage projects, and position Australia to be a world leading hydrogen producer and exporter,” said the Australian government in its Budget 2023-24 report. Hydrogen Headstart will provide a credit per kilogram on the production price, mostly for large-scale projects. The executive body is also providing $38.2 million to establish a Guarantee of Origin scheme to underpin markets for green energy, including hydrogen. “This is a substantial downpayment on Australia’s response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, ensuring Australia remains in the race to become a global clean energy superpower,” said Australia’s Clean Energy Council. The country also wants to expand onshore and offshore wind and solar production.
Iveco Group and Nikola Corp. have agreed to split their operations in Europe and North America, respectively. Italy-based Iveco Group will assume full ownership of the joint venture in Ulm, Germany. The transport vehicle manufacturer said the venture will be licensed to freely access and develop vehicle control software for jointly developed battery electric vehicles (BEV) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV). Nikola will secure the IVECO S-Way technology license for North America and related components supplies from Iveco Group, and will take ownership of the intellectual property for Generation 1 eAxles. Iveco Group will acquire the items partly in cash and partly in 20 million of Nikola shares.
HRS and Gaia Future Energy have signed a memorandum of understanding to provide global green hydrogen distribution solutions for mobility, combining the green hydrogen produced by Gaia Future Energy in Morocco and the hydrogen refueling station manufactured by HRS. The two companies will also collaborate to accelerate the development of green hydrogen infrastructure, particularly in European markets.
Austria, Germany, and Italy have signed a joint letter of political support to develop a “southern hydrogen corridor” in the European Union, with the respective infrastructure projects to obtain Project of Common Interest (PCI) status. “Snam Italy’s gas infrastructure operator, Trans Austria Gasleitung (TAG) and Gas Connect Austria (GCA) in Austria and Bayernets in Germany welcome this political support,” said Snam. The SoutH2 southern hydrogen corridor would be a 3 300-km dedicated hydrogen-ready pipeline corridor connecting North Africa, Italy, Austria, and Germany. It could purportedly deliver 40% of the REPowerEU import target. According to the German government, it will have to import 70% of its own green hydrogen needs.
ABB, Lhyfe, and Skyborn have also agreed to collaborate on SoutH2Port. The hydrogen project will be located near Skyborns’ 1 GW Storgrundet offshore wind farm in Söderhamn, Sweden. “Fully operational, SoutH2port is expected to produce about 240 tons of hydrogen per day, with an installed capacity of 600 MW, making it one of the largest suppliers of renewable hydrogen in Europe,” said Lhyfe. ABB will optimise hydrogen and electricity production integration across the entire ecosystem. The new plant will support the decarbonisation of the Swedish energy system, either directly with hydrogen supplies or through further downstream production of refined fuels such as methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, or ammonia.
