https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/19/wa-councils-to-partner-for-australian-first-renewable-energy-ppa/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 19, 2021",WA councils to partner for ‘Australian-first’ renewable energy PPA,"More than 50 Western Australian (WA) local governments are poised to commit to an Australian-first renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) which will allow them to satisfy their electricity demands with 100% renewable energy while providing a path for participants to reduce their overall emissions.
Negotiated by the WA Local Government Association (WALGA), the new aggregated PPA has the potential to deliver 100% renewable power to 51 councils.
WALGA said upon completion, the joint energy purchasing initiative has the potential to be Australia’s largest local government collaboration to purchase clean energy. It is also the first renewables and carbon offset aggregation project to be granted authorisation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
WALGA president Tracey Roberts, mayor of the City of Wanneroo in the northern suburbs of Perth, said the agreement would deliver both the option for 100% renewable energy for the sector’s contestable supply and savings of up to $5 million.
The joint energy purchasing initiative enables the group to purchase energy from WA’s main south-western grid, large- and small-scale generation certificates and Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs).
Under the arrangement, members will pool their demand for energy and jointly purchase it, jointly negotiate terms of supply and jointly manage contracts.
Local governments have until November 18 to formalise their participation in the project.
“The enthusiasm for this project in the sector and the terms that have been achieved for the community are outstanding,” Roberts said.
“There is a genuine appetite in the local government sector to lead the way on zero emissions and the shift to renewable energy is a giant step in the right direction.”
WALGA said the renewable energy will be sourced from the 222 MW Collgar Wind Farm in the state’s southeast as well as the 35.4 MW Albany and 79 MW Emu Downs wind farms.
“Sourcing renewable energy from WA providers was a strong requirement of the sector and further supports the direct benefit to the community in supporting local industry,” Roberts said.
The ACCC has granted authorisation for the purchasing arrangement until 2036.
The WA initiative comes after 46 Victorian councils signed up to a similar deal earlier this year.
The Climate Council’s Cities Power Partnership director Portia Odell said the deals show the enormous potential of cities and regions to pool resources and invest in clean energy.
“In July, we saw a staggering 46 Victorian councils partner up to pool their electricity contracts and switch to renewable energy,” she said.
“Forty-five per cent of all Victorian council electricity is now powered by renewable wind energy, and now we’ll see this incredible example of collaboration topped by councils in Western Australia.”
Local governments in New South Wales (NSW) have also committed to partner on a renewable purchasing agreement with Procurement Australia revealing on Tuesday it is progressing a PPA which will see the councils using 100% renewable energy from 2023.
Procurement Australia chief executive Joe Arena said councils already signed to the PPA includes those in the Albury, Wollongong and Bega Valley regions.
“As an organisation, we’re delighted to have such a diverse range of council members join us as part of this first phase of the state-wide PPA,” he said.
“We are committed to providing all NSW participants with a path to achieve their long-term renewable targets.”
Procurement Australia said it will now progress to an industry consultation and product build stage. This will be followed by a request for tender stage in the first quarter of 2022 to secure an energy supplier to meet the specific renewable energy requirements of each council.
The NSW PPA will deliver participants 100% renewable energy via a phased and flexible commencement date commencing in January 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/19/state-owned-utility-reveals-desire-to-disconnect-rural-town-from-grid/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 19, 2021",State-owned utility reveals desire to disconnect rural town from grid,"Western Australian government-owned utility Western Power is seeking registrations of interest to understand the capacity of the market to develop a disconnected microgrid (DMS) in either the Mid West, Wheatbelt or Great Southern areas as it transitions to a modular, autonomous grid utilising microgrids and standalone power systems (SPS).
It is expected that at least 90% of energy generation of the proposed DMG, which will operate independently from the rest of the grid, will be via renewable sources, likely solar PV. The renewable generation will be supported by battery energy storage and diesel generator back-up. Western Power said a DMG is similar to a SPS but services more than five customers.
Western Power said the DMG project will initially focus on just one town but there is the potential to provide similar services to other towns in the state’s remote and regional areas.
“We’re disconnecting from our grid,” the state-owned utility said.
“We’re seeking registrations of interest to understand the capability of the market to develop a disconnected microgrid, a small, isolated network operating independently from the rest of the grid.
“It’s another step in our move towards a future modular network.”
Western Power is responsible for building, maintaining and operating the electricity network within the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) which connects more than 1.1 million customers to traditional and renewable energy sources. The state’s primary electricity system, the SWIS has a network of more than 7,800 kilometres of transmission lines.
The network operator has acknowledged that its aging distribution network is approaching end of life in many areas, with replacement costs presenting a significant challenge, particularly in remote locations.

Western Power said for rural towns near the edge of the grid, the sustainability issue in replacing the network can be compounded by poor reliability, with customers experiencing frequent power interruptions due to stretches of bare overhead conductor sometimes hundreds of kilometres long.
“Our choice is whether to spend many dollars replacing it to keep the network and power supply safe, or where possible, do something different that provides a better outcome and is more cost efficient,” the company has said.
Western Power, which is also progressing the Kalbarri microgrid, said preliminary feasibility assessments indicated that in some cases the rebuilding of the network presents significantly higher costs than providing a supply to the same load via a DMG.
“Microgrids are a very exciting solution to some of the issues we have in powering our regional areas. Combined with new technology such as batteries, they offer a robust solution to some of the issues we forecast on the network,” the company said.
“They’re of particular benefit for our rural WA customers, where the distances between the closest substation to the load that needs supply can be vast. This means the load on the end of sometimes thousands of kilometres of line is subject to any outages that may occur upstream such as lightning strikes, vegetation impacts and storms.”
Western Power said the proposed DMG would need to be capable of supplying a town with a peak load in the order of 200 kW. However, future DMGs are likely to be up to 600 kW peak. The expected daily average kWh is likely to be in the order of 350 kWh with an estimated seasonal peak of about 1 MWh per day.
Registrations of interest in the proposed project will be accepted until January 7, 2022 with the DMG to be delivered by June 2023.

WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston welcomed the DMG initiative, saying the state government is committed to exploring technological innovations to ensure a reliable and cost-effective power supply.
“Disconnected microgrids could play a crucial role in improving reliability for regional businesses and homeowners,” he said.
“Stand-alone power systems and microgrids remove the risk of outages caused by power supplies travelling long distances, which are exposed to plant and animal impacts, lightning, high winds, and bushfires.
“Disconnected microgrids can provide low-carbon emission benefits and will help reach our target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”
Meanwhile, Western Power has revealed that commissioning of the Kalbarri microgrid has been delayed.
A company spokesperson said in August that the microgrid, which will utilise wind and solar PV power, battery energy storage and the grid to improve the reliability of electricity supply to the community on the state’s mid-west coast was to be launched in November.
Since then, the company has revealed the microgrid is still undergoing final on-grid commissioning with the final handover to Western Power of the system anticipated for late December.

Woodside said the commercial-scale facility will utilise advanced computer vision software that precisely aligns an array of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a single target on the top of a solar tower, thereby enabling storage in the form of high-temperature thermal energy.
Heliogen claims its baseline system will provide industrial-grade heat capable of replacing fossil fuels in industrial processes including the production of cement, steel, and petrochemicals, while it can enable power generation through the addition of thermal energy storage systems, a turbine for power generation, and electrolysers for green hydrogen production.
Heliogen chief executive and founder Bill Gross said the company’s concentrated solar technology had the potential to transform heavy industry by “turning sunlight into a zero-carbon source of heat, power and hydrogen that is nearly always available”.
“Although costs of large-scale solar are falling, conventional solar technologies are not yet cost-competitive with fossil fuels in most energy markets due to their intermittent availability,” he said.
“Heliogen’s technology aims to close this gap through the use of AI, software and thermal storage. As the energy sector is ripe for applications of green hydrogen fuels and decarbonisation strategies, Woodside is an ideal collaborator for our breakthrough solar technology, which will support the operational characteristics of heavy industry.”

Woodside’s decision to issue the limited notice to proceed follows a six-month feasibility study by the two companies and a front-end engineering and design contract that started earlier this year. A final commitment to construction of the 5 MW facility is expected in 2022.
The two companies also intend to jointly market Heliogen’s technology in Australia and the U.S.
Under the proposed joint marketing arrangement, the companies will look to establish a framework to develop additional potential renewable energy projects, including replicating and scaling Heliogen’s modular, AI-enabled concentrated solar facility to support Woodside’s forecasted power requirements at its global locations.
Woodside chief executive officer Meg O’Neill said the collaboration with Heliogen would help Woodside meet customer requirements for low-cost, lower-carbon energy and support the miner’s decarbonisation strategy as it targets net zero emissions by 2050.
“This is a significant step toward the development of our first facility with Heliogen, which we hope will be just the start of our ongoing collaboration,” she said.
“Heliogen’s innovative technology could play a key supporting role in development of Woodside’s zero-carbon hydrogen and ammonia business, which would rely on access to abundant and reliable renewable power.
“We are also excited about the marketing rights for Heliogen’s technology in Australia, where our abundant solar energy resources support application of this technology in remote power generation and other industrial processes.”

Woodside, which earlier this year revealed plans to develop a 100 MW solar PV plant alongside its Pluto liquefied natural gas facility in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, is also exploring solar thermal technology opportunities in Australia.
Woodside last week announced it would provide Adelaide-based 1414 Degrees with funding to support the further development of its SiBox thermal energy storage technology which stores intermittent renewable energy using silicon to produce clean, high-temperature heat, replacing the need to burn coal or gas.
Under the deal, Woodside will contribute up to $2 million for the further development of the 1 MWh SiBox demonstration module. Woodside will then have the opportunity to notify 1414 Degrees, which is developing the Aurora concentrated solar power project in South Australia, if they wish to proceed to jointly develop and commercialise the SiBox technology.
1414 Degrees chief executive Matt Squire said the company’s technology has the potential to be “a major component of future renewable energy projects due to its flexibility and capability in delivering high temperature heat.”
“This is positive news for 1414 Degrees,” he said. “This partnership with Woodside is a vote of confidence in our SiBox renewable energy storage and the continued advancement of our technology that utilises the latent heat properties of silicon.”

Insight Australia 2021 was charged with high-profile guests and experts including Western Australian Energy Minister Bill Johnston, Newcastle University (UK) world lithium-ion expert Prof Paul Christensen, renewables guru Auke Hoekstra and a host of leading Australian minds, such as Deakin University’s Mega Kar, UNSW’s Alison Lennon and Green Energy Market’s Tristan Edis. 
The insights came from across the spectrum of the energy storage industry, from the insurers behind big batteries to the science guiding the sector toward a circular economy. No topic was left untouched, from a case study on the fire at the Victorian Big Battery to the novel chemistries in store that may just have the density, abundance and durability to change the game and spread the storage load of the energy transition.
pv magazine’s  Jonathan Gifford and Bella Peacock did a splendid job moderating a range of discussions that evolved live, all of which proved insightful.

CDI Energy CEO and Founder, Darryl Bower, told pv magazine Australia “RSM is up to 30% cheaper than traditional fixed axis PV or solar tracking” competitors, though this doesn’t include fellow Aussie modular maverick 5B. However, “unlike 5B and the peg system,” Bower says, RSM is 100% Australian made”, and its “partially pre-fabricated” design which is then assembled on site reduces costs. 
Modular solutions are proving increasingly popular, especially as a solution for remote sites like mining operations which want to reduce their diesel consumption and reduce their emissions. 
“RSM modules have been designed for use across a range of industries including mining,” Bower continued. “They have a smaller footprint than competitors and lower capital outlay – making it more cost effective for mining companies to go green.” 
Mining is on the move 
For at least the next few decades, mining is going to fuel the energy transition, and renewables like solar are, in turn, going to fuel mining. According to the “State of Play: Electrification” report – recently released by Virtual Consulting International and sponsored by the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre – 89% of the world’s leading mining executives expect mine sites around the globe to electrify within the next two decades. And 61% of the mining industry respondents said they believe the first and most important step in the process of electrification is the development of renewable energy generation capacity.
The crucial element in decarbonizing the entire industry is finding solutions that fit mining companies’ requirements, said Thomas Hillig, managing director of THEnergy, a German management consultancy specializing in cleantech innovations. “One such solution is needed for remote, offgrid, and short-life mines,” explained Hillig.
Of course, a particular appeal of modular systems for mining companies is not just the easy scalability of modular solutions, but that they can be easily packed up and re-deployed to a new site. 

In the last year CDI has installed more than 1 MW of RSM at sites in the Pilbara, Kimberley and Goldfields, with another 4 MW of planned projects in the pipeline. 
“Our clean energy options are designed to instantly reduce operating expenses,” said Bower. “We also have rental options for clients so we can build, own and operate the energy asset to there is no upfront capital required.” 
This allows customers “who would have once rented a diesel generator – the ability to now rent a solar system for their short to medium term projects.” 
According to Bower, the RSM requires only 5,500m2 per MW compared to 18,000-22,000m2 (approximately five acres) required by traditional fixed axis or solar tracking setups.

Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), owned by UAE based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy, has announced the sale of a 49% in its Australian arm FRV Australia Group to Canadian fund Omers Infrastructure.
Under the terms of the transaction, Omers will acquire a 49% stake in FRV’s Australian renewable energy business, which includes 637 MW (DC) of PV projects already operational or under construction with offtakers and green certification already in place, as well as a pipeline comprising 2.7 GW of PV projects and 1.3 GWh of battery storage in earlier phases of development.
FRV has been present in the Australian renewables market since 2010, and the new alliance with Omers follows a fundraising process begun earlier this year to enable it to achieve new growth targets in the region.
Omers Infrastructure holdings in renewable energy include U.S. company Leeward Renewable Energy, which owns and operates a portfolio of 22 renewable energy facilities amounting 2GW of installed capacity across nine U.S. states. Omers also holds a stake of approximately 19.4% in India-based IPP Azure Power Limited, which has around 2 GW of operational renewables capacity and another 5 GW awarded or under construction.
The FRV transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2021, after going through customary regulatory approvals and reaching financial close. “in line with our long-term strategy, Omers looks forward to partnering with FRV to develop a multi-technology renewables platform in Australia,” stated Christopher Curtain, senior managing director for Asia Pacific at Omers.
