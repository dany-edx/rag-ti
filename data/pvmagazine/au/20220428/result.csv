The next phase of development to deliver more powerful and efficient cells will require new kinds of devices. After performing an in-depth review of a process known as “singlet fission,” we believe a singlet fission approach to photovoltaics should not be overlooked. We have undertaken a comprehensive literature review, to be published next week in Chemical Physics Reviews, and would like to share our insights with you. 
Let’s first set the scene: Today silicon technologies dominate the photovoltaic market, representing 90% of all deployed PV. There are excellent reasons for this phenomenon: silicon technologies are mature and reliable, benefitting from seven decades of silicon semiconductor research. However, silicon PV does not, and cannot, exploit the full solar spectrum.
Silicon solar cells are thermodynamically limited to converting only 30% of incident sunlight into useful electricity. This is due to two main loss mechanisms: the transmission of photons with energy less than the band gap (1.1eV) and the generation of heat from photons with energy in excess of the band gap. As a result of excellent R&D work, several companies are approaching the 30% limit of current solar cells. As a result, further development of these established technologies will not result in significant boosts in energy conversion efficiency (though cost reductions are still possible, which remains a significant net positive). 
The best path forward for step increases in solar cell efficiency is to piggyback on the success of silicon. That is, to develop a ‘something-on-silicon’ tandem device. The question is, what material should that something be? The assumption of the field appears to be to use higher band gap absorbers in a subcell, which can be either electronically (2- or 3-terminal tandem) or mechanically (4-terminal tandem) coupled on top of a silicon cell. Promising materials include organometallic halide perovskites, III-V inorganic semiconductors, and chalcogenides. There are good reasons to develop these technologies, and promising outcomes are being achieved. 
However, materials that undergo singlet fission provide a different pathway for enhancing the utilisation of the solar spectrum. Usually, the photovoltaic effect is a one-for-one process. One photon in gives you (at most) one electron out. We call this an “external quantum efficiency”, or EQE, of 100%. When singlet fission is exploited, we can extract two electrons for each photon absorbed – that is we can have EQEs of 200%. Indeed, an EQE in excess of 100% has already been achieved!
Interestingly, this has the advantageous side-effect of reducing operating temperatures, and thereby extending cell lifespans by an estimated 3.7 years. Since singlet fission utilises high energy photons efficiently, less heat is generated than in current technologies, which has a consequent cooling effect on the underlying silicon module. This cooling effect will be present in all something-on-silicon devices but is most significant in singlet fission devices, with an estimated temperature reduction of 2°C (under the IEC61212 standard). 
Like tandem cells, the best path forward for singlet fission is to use it as a top layer on a silicon base cell. Unlike other tandem concepts, it is possible to do this with minimal changes to the silicon architecture, reducing both complexity and cost. Moreover, in some singlet fission architectures, we avoid the issue of optimising the conductivity of a new material, by outsourcing all of the electrical transport to the silicon base cell. This removes the need for considering voltage/current matching between the singlet fission and silicon layers. 
Finally, the materials used for the singlet fission process are typically small organic molecules or polymers, similar to those already developed in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Therefore, production of singlet fission materials at scale will be able to take advantage of existing chemical synthesis infrastructure. 
This means that the efficiency benefits of singlet fission/silicon approach are likely achievable without significantly increasing PV module costs. The two main molecule classes under investigation include polyaromatic hydrocarbons — including light-stable paint pigments — and donor-acceptor polymers which have found utility in existing organic photovoltaic technologies.
There are some drawbacks to singlet fission. As alluded to earlier, the singlet fission approach is in a much earlier stage of development than perovskites, III-V tandems and chalcogenides. So, while proof-of-principle devices have generated much excitement in the field, there is still much work and investment required in both material development and device optimisation. 
Considering all the pros and cons, our view is that singlet fission photovoltaics excitingly warrant further research and development. 
It is not the aim of this article to disparage any competing technology. Rather, we point out that, as in any financial investment, diversification is key to mitigating risk. This is true for private corporations as well as public research expenditure. 
While we are still in the relative infancy of the ‘something-on-silicon’ phase of photovoltaic technology development, we encourage funding agencies and industry to engage with the potential of singlet fission photovoltaics in order to uncover the true potential of these emerging solar technologies.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/28/solar-panel-glut-causing-messy-false-economy/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 28, 2022",Solar panel glut causing messy ‘false economy’,"Much like Australia’s climatic patterns, its solar industry seems to have gone from drought to deluge with industry reporting the panel market has been flooded with stock. “It’s created a bit of a false economy in the market because people are buying stock at prices that they’re not really supposed to, but because of where things are at people are desperate to clear stock,” Kosta Bourandanis, sales manager at solar wholesaler Supply Partners told pv magazine Australia.
“That’s a worry because if people are selling something for cheaper than it’s actually worth, they’re making no money,” Bourandanis said, noting this ultimately impacts the whole industry.
The second half of last year saw China, the source of 80% of Australia’s solar equipment, rocked by an energy crisis at exactly the moment manufacturers were scrambling to secure critical materials and freight costs were skyrocketing. The volatility led to some manufacturers pricing their products afresh daily, causing widespread uncertainty. 
“As a wholesaler, manufacturer or even retailer, trying to procure stock when you don’t really know what it’s going to cost makes it bloody hard to plan,” Bourandanis said. “Everyone loaded up last year in the fear they couldn’t access stock and now all the stocks they have ordered in the past are starting to land and its much more than the market needs.”
The unpredictability led to excess orders– or rather, orders in anticipation of what is typically the industry’s strongest period, the fourth quarter, which simply didn’t eventuate.

“[There was] a fear of having no stock so [companies] shipped lots of stock here and also they planned for a big Q4, so that’s why the oversupply happened,” One Stop Warehouse’s head of product procurement and marketing, Andy Cheng, told pv magazine. 
Both Supply Partners and One Stop reported a panel glut starting around December, January when the extra orders began to roll in from China.
Typically the beginning of summer sees an influx of solar orders, but the final months of 2021 did not see interest spike as much as normal. In fact, according to analysis by Sunwiz, October was the lowest point of a year which concluded in a significantly weaker position than 2020. 
The first quarter of 2022, which tends to also be strong once the country has returned from Christmas holidays, held little relief. The market started off the slowest it’s been since 2019. “January was probably 40 to 50% down as a market compared to what people expected it to be,” Bourandanis said. 
Of course, this meant the excess stock which was starting to flood the market simply couldn’t find homes.

This oversupply sat uneasily next to the reality of panel pricing which had indeed gone up between 20% – 25%. More expensive panels meant systems were retail for more, which Cheng noted was likely a contributing factor to the slowing residential market, since Australians in 2022 were typically paying $1000 more for the same system than their neighbour had the year before.
Compounding that was the fact that much of the country’s east coast was plagued by heavy rain and flooding from December on, making installs difficult to impossible.
As Cheng noted, in this same period prices for panels in Europe and the US were high and had freight costs been cheaper, these markets could have held offtake opportunities. But no such luck came our way, and Australia was forced to grappled with the oversupply internally. “We have to consume everything within Australia,” Cheng said.
Which brings us to where we are today – in a “messy” and somewhat unhealthy pricing position where more expensive stock needs to be cleared, leaving reduced prices as the primary mechanism, according to Bourandanis.
“Prices of panels have theoretically gone up, but because there’s an oversupply it hasn’t been felt by the market yet,” Bourandanis said. “It was a sellers market and now it’s a buyers market.”
“It was surprising that it happened like it did,” he added. “I’ve been in the industry for 10 years and it’s never been like this.”
Solar Cutters
Cheng also noted this disparity, saying on the ground the Australian panel market hasn’t actually seen the prices hikes imposed by China.
In terms of supply, both Bourandanis and Cheng noted the situation is vastly different when it comes to batteries and inverters.
With home storage systems competing with (and often losing out to) the growing demand for electric vehicles for supplies critical battery materials, the storage market in Australia is plagued with long wait times. 
Moreover, Tesla, LG and, according to Cheng, “everyone basically” hiked product prices considerably in the last months. For example, Tesla’s home battery system prices increased just shy of $1000 in 2022.

With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, energy independence is front of mind in Europe which is driving demand for storage as well as solar there. Obviously manufacturers tend to prefer markets where they can fetch higher prices and have guaranteed sales, leading Cheng to the conclusion that growth there might also be influencing the lack of batteries reaching Australian shores.
Bourandanis said Supply Partners is also grappling with the issue, with lead times between three to six months, meaning companies are forced to order for a market they really have no idea about.
In terms of inverters, shortages prevail there too – though this time for microchips. This isn’t a new issue and has been floating around since the beginning of 2021. Cheng said it is however impacting supplies of inverters and pushing out leads times, especially for European brands like Australia’s favourite, Fronius, by many months.
And as Solarquotes reported today, where the bloody hell are Australia’s IQ8 Enphase microinverters?! Cheng believes the product’s delayed launch may be linked to chip shortages, which could also impact the rollout of Italian brand Fimer’s new products here too.
Image: Mode Electrical
Cheng said the current lead times for key inverters are sitting around 12 to 20 weeks, but are significantly more for European brands.
When asked if the uncertainty around batteries and inverters could again cause a glut, Cheng said it seems unlikely. “People now are probably more mature about the current situation and with the overall market dropping, they will probably be more cautious about how many products they bring into this country.”
The panel oversupply crisis is already easing, Cheng said, as fewer panels were imported in the first quarter eating up excess. “We believe the price will stabilise, the supply will stabilise in that there won’t be too much stock coming to Australia because other regions need panels,” he said.
“The other side of that is Australia is not a huge market, so filling Australian demand is not that hard.”
He does, however, think global events might continue to put a strain on the outlook in Australia. The US is currently looking into solar panel imports from Chinese companies working in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, which has caused alarm in the industry there.
This could boost the popularity of premium panel brands like those made in Germany, Korea and Singapore. Panels are already fetching better prices in the US market, with Cheng estimating they’re between 50% – 80% higher. “Definitely the real premium will go to US,” he said, which could see Australian struggle to secure supplies and further our dependence on China.
The overall market in Australia is also looking fairly bleak, with consumer confidence slumping. While this isn’t specifically a solar issue, it suggests the market might not rebound with consumers unlikely to make big investments. 
Moreover, the federal election is just around the corner which Bourandanis believes will again depress demand as people “wait and watch” to see what happens with the country’s contentious environmental policies.

The Salt River Project, a 10 MW energy storage project that uses lithium-ion batteries, was dealt a blow last week when a fire broke out. Firefighters were alerted to a fire at the facility last Monday. During a press conference on Thursday, a spokesperson for the Chandler Fire Department confirmed that there was a battery on fire in the building but that sprinkler systems had been able to control it.
Three years ago firefighters in Peoria, Arizona, learned the hazards of battery fires first-hand when a fire at a battery facility left four firefighters injured. Because the Salt River Project facility had been smouldering for days, the firefighters used an abundance of caution before entering the building.
Keith Welch, battalion chief at Chandler Fire Department said, “We took a defensive strategy and for us that means we’re not going to open the door and go in without personnel to take a look because we know some of the potential hazards of the battery degradation and the off-gassing and the different hazards that can cause.”
Due to potentially hazardous gases leaking from the building, businesses in the area were asked to evacuate Thursday night as the robot opened the doors and entered the facility, allowing the gases to dissipate. The next day the robots were sent back in to measure gases before firefighters could enter.
The Salt River Project was announced in 2018 in conjunction with AES Corporation and with the storage solution supplied by Fluence. The plan for the project was to provide power to Salt River Project customers during high peak demand periods, and the project would also serve as an initiative to learn more about grid-scale battery storage. Salt River Project customers have had no interruption in service as a result of the fire.
An AES spokesperson said it’s too early to speculate on the cause.

Dutch start-up AquaBattery has been awarded €2.5 million (AU$3.7 million) in funding from the European Innovation Council’s (EIC) Accelerator to develop its long-duration energy storage technology based on saltwater.
The company’s patented storage technology uses just saltwater as the storage medium and is described as a flow battery that is able to independently amend power (kW) and energy (kWh) capacity. The proposed solution is also said to be low-cost, highly scalable and sustainable, as it uses only water and table salt, with its storage capacity being expandable by just adding water reservoirs or using larger tanks.
The battery system utilises three storage tanks, one with fresh water, one with concentrated salt water and one with diluted salt water, and also relies on membrane stacks. During the charging phase, the diluted salt water is split into concentrated salt water and fresh water in the membrane stack and stored separately. The separation is achieved through electrodialysis (ED), which is a separation process in which charged membranes and electrical potential differences are used to separate ionic species from an aqueous solution and other uncharged components.
In the discharging phase, the two streams are combined and the resulting energy is converted to electricity with the help of the membrane stack through reverse electrodialysis (RED), which is a technology to generate electricity from the salinity difference between two solutions, for example, seawater and river water.
“AquaBattery’s solution could provide virtually unlimited storage capacity from eight hours up to days, weeks or even seasonally,” reads a statement from the Imperial College London, with which the Dutch start-up is cooperating.
“The fund will provide around €2.5 million (AU$3.7 million) in grant funding to AquaBattery, with options for direct equity investment of up to €15 million (AU$22 million) depending on their needs. The grant will enable the team to speed up R&D and product development and bring forward commercialisation of AquaBattery to 2025 or earlier.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/28/pv-in-the-circular-economy-modelling-tool-helps-predict-flow-of-solar-materials/,"MARKETS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"APRIL 28, 2022",PV in the circular economy: modelling tool helps predict flow of solar materials,"From pv magazine USA
Exponential growth of PV installations continues in the US and so will the growth in PV panel waste streams. According to the Solar Futures Study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), solar could account for as much as 40% of the nation’s electricity supply by 2035 and 45% by 2050.
To reach these levels, solar deployment will need to grow by an average of 30 GW each year between now and 2025 and then double that between 2025 and 2030—four times its current deployment rate—to total 1,000 GW of solar deployed by 2035. That’s a lot of solar panels that would start being retired from service even before 2050. Needless to say, a lot of people–including 7-year old Neil— are concerned about what will happen to solar modules at the end of their life. That concern is real and growing, and is the subject of many studies around the world.

To begin this work, however, researchers need end-of-life data for solar modules. For example, they need to know how many solar modules will be retired this year, what will happen to them when they are retired, how their retirement affects the flow of PV materials, and at what rate will solar modules be retired in the future.
To this end, The NREL researchers have developed the PV in the Circular Economy (PV ICE) modelling tool, which attempts to model the flow of PV materials over the next several decades. It also addresses the question of whether it is better to build more durable modules that last longer before needing replacement, or shorter-lived, fully recyclable modules. And it looks at how the evolution of PV technology, like thinner panels or new materials, may play into a more circular economy.
“There is much interest in making PV, an already clean energy source, fully sustainable economically and environmentally,” said Silvana Ovaitt, an NREL PV reliability researcher. “People jump to recycling as the solution, but for a product that is supposed to last more than 30 years—something more like a roof than a cell phone—that puts a big delay into the stream of recycled material. This gives us time to proactively plan for effective collection and recycling of modules. But it also points to the importance of alternate pathways of circularity for PV materials.”
PV ICE uses the latest data from the PV industry to model the flow of PV materials over the next several decades, helping predict the effects of different market trends, technological developments, and government policies.
Modelling today’s modules
Developed by a small team in NREL’s PV Reliability Group, the open-source tool consists of two main pieces. The first piece is a set of data files that collect the key properties of today’s solar modules. And it makes predictions on future modules, including types and quantities of materials, expected lifetimes, and power conversion efficiencies, among others.
PV technology has evolved rapidly and continues to do so. So this ‘average’ silicon module also needs to evolve to accurately capture the materials going into and coming out of the field. I started by looking at market share over time for different types of cell and module designs and created averages of what a silicon module looks like from 1995 through 2030. I drew component material and module data from a number of different sources—industry and literature—to track cell and module changes. This technique could also be applied to a single manufacturer’s bill of materials, though the PV module industry hasn’t offered this type of materials transparency to date, said Heather Mirletz, a Ph.D. student at Colorado School of Mines who helped develop PV ICE.
Modelling future modules and flow of materials
The second piece of PV ICE is modelling how these modules and the materials they contain will move through the PV life cycle. This includes projections of how many solar modules will be installed in future years and assumptions about key processes, such as manufacturing efficiencies or yields and rates of failure. It also models the decisions of stakeholders and how these decisions might modify the flow of materials.
By varying process efficiencies and stakeholder decisions, PV ICE enables researchers to explore how improved reliability or different circular pathways—such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing, or recycling—could affect how much retired module material is landfilled and how much can be recaptured to help deploy more PV modules. The result is a detailed model of how materials enter, move through, and potentially exit a circular PV economy.
“This tool is unique because it brings the PV and the sustainability communities together in an interdisciplinary approach; we capture real-life industry practices like bifaciality, merchant tail, project lifetime, and degradation. It goes beyond a first-approximation approach of simple material-flow analysis,” said Silvana Ovaitt, a member of the PV ICE development team.
For example, the PV ICE team found that several previous predictions had overestimated the rate at which today’s modules will fail and require replacement. Field data and longer-term contracts suggest modules are lasting longer. Updating this assumption in the PV ICE tool revealed that the volume of PV module waste will grow more slowly and arrive later than previously predicted.
“Our sensitivity analyses show that pre-2050 life cycle wastes are most sensitive to module lifetime and reliability,” Mirletz said. “Virgin material demands are most sensitive to manufacturing yields. Circular economy pathways—’reduce, reuse, recycle’—are in order of impact, and our sensitivity results reflect and reinforce this ranking.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/28/green-ammonia-low-hanging-fruit-for-indias-hydrogen-economy/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 28, 2022",Green ammonia low-hanging fruit for India’s hydrogen economy,"From pv magazine India
A shift to green ammonia would significantly reduce the Indian government’s massive fertiliser subsidy burden and boost energy self-reliance by cutting dependence on imports of expensive liquified natural gas (LNG) for fertiliser manufacturing, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). 
Fertiliser subsidy in India is budgeted at INR 1.05 trillion (US$14.2 billion) for 2022-23, exceeding one trillion rupees for the third year in a row. The subsidy will likely have to be increased drastically with fertiliser prices pushed to record levels due to high and volatile global gas prices, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. 
Gas prices increased from US$10.75/MMBtu (metric million British thermal units) in January 2021 to US$33 in January 2022. Global urea prices soared to record highs of US$690-794/ton (INR 51.4-60.4/kg) between October 2021 to March 2022. However, urea for the Indian agriculture sector remained at a subsidised retail price of INR 5.3/kg (US$71/tonne), reflecting the heavy subsidy of more than 90% on the global benchmark price of urea.  
“Demand for fertiliser in India is expected to grow, and this will increase the need for further subsidies and LNG imports unless we switch to a cleaner and domestically produced feedstock,” says report author Kashish Shah, energy finance analyst at IEEFA.
“Green hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water powered by renewable energy sources and can replace grey hydrogen, which is generated from natural gas, or methane, as a feedstock for ammonia production.”
Shah expects the demand for hydrogen in the Indian fertiliser industry to rise from about 3MT per year today to 7.5MT by 2050.
The International Energy Agency estimates that 8 MT of green hydrogen to green ammonia production capacity is planned worldwide. 
The IEEFA report looks at leading green hydrogen to green ammonia projects worldwide and reviews the cost competitiveness of producing green ammonia using various electricity inputs: grid electricity, round-the-clock renewable power, and solar power plus batteries. 
The cost of green hydrogen production is currently at about US$5.5 per kg, or US$3 per kg in countries with good solar resources and is projected to continue to decline steeply this decade. For it to compete with grey hydrogen at $2 per kg, the costs of two critical inputs – electrolysers and renewable energy – must fall further. 
“While the gap between the cost of producing green hydrogen and hydrogen from fossil fuels is narrowing, there is still further to go,” says Shah. 
Electrolysers must fall below US$250 per kilowatt from US$700-1,000 and renewable energy to US$20 per megawatt-hour from US$30-35, according to the report.
Making electrolysers in India, in tandem with the growing solar PV manufacturing base, would cut the cost of producing green hydrogen for green ammonia, says Shah.
The government’s new green hydrogen policy offers a range of incentives to green hydrogen and green ammonia manufacturers, including land allocation in renewable energy parks, interstate transmission charges waiver for 25 years, and banking of renewable power for up to 30 days.
“These incentives mainly focus on the supply side,” says Shah. “In addition, developers and investors would need a strong offtake pipeline for their product to make the projects bankable. This could be done by implementing a green hydrogen consumption obligation (GHCO) mechanism for fertiliser production and petroleum refining, similar to Renewable Purchase Obligations.”
The report says the next phase of policy incentives could include production-linked incentives (PLI) similar to those provided for solar modules and battery manufacturing. This could bridge the viability gap for interested manufacturers ready to risk capital for green hydrogen and green ammonia projects. 
The international green bonds market will be a key funding avenue for projects as developers look to derive value from the synergy of renewables and green hydrogen, the report says.
