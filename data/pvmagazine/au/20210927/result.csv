But a new research paper — a data-driven, number crunching exposé — from scientists at the University of New South Wales’ renowned School of Photovoltaic Renewable Energy and Engineering (SPREE) shows that to meet projected solar generation requirements of some 70 terawatts of solar PV by 2050, the industry must urgently steer towards technologies that use less silver, bismuth and indium, if they don’t want to overwhelm the earth’s supply of these materials and be left high, dry — and unexpectedly expensive.
Industry expert, Adjunct Professor Pierre Verlinden, has been sounding the siren of material scarcity in PV for years; Associate Professor Brett Hallam, a brilliant SPREE researcher working on how to increase the efficiency of solar cells was becoming worried about the sustainability of upcoming solutions to boosting efficiency;  and Yuchao Zhang had begun his PhD research around the metallisation and screen printing used in solar cells when Verlinden and Hallam suggested he look at sustainability first.
“We did some quick calculations that showed, OK, there is definitely a problem for the future consumption of silver, bismuth and indium,” Zhang tells pv magazine Australia.
A team of five co-authors formed to look into global reserves of these resources, and they drew on the combined expertise of SPREE to calculate how much of each material is currently being used in dominant and emerging technologies, and how much will be required for future PV production. 
“Then, from a more technical perspective, we looked at the impact on cell performance of reducing the use of these substances, and how far we could reduce the usage in different solar cell technologies,” says Zhang, without sacrificing hard-earned efficiency gains made over the past decade.
The upshot of the paper — Design Considerations for Multi-terawatt Scale Manufacturing of Existing and Future Photovoltaic Technologies: Challenges and Opportunities Related to Silver, Indium and Bismuth Consumption — published today in the journal Energy & Environmental Science, is that the industry and academics must temporarily put aside the pursuit of greater solar cell efficiency and instead focus their abilities on primarily reducing the use of silver in PV.
Possible efficiency gains from new technologies cannot yet neutralise the draining of silver, bismuth and indium reserves as manufacturers ramp up PV capacity to respond to demand for clean energy at a scale that will significantly impact climate change.
The Design Considerations paper takes as its basis that PV module production must increase from 135 GW in 2020 to 3 TW by 2030.
It assumes an upper material consumption limit of 20% of 2019 global supply of the three most constrained materials, given that other industries also have a claim to those reserves. 
As such, its authors calculate that the present industrial implementation of passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) has a sustainable manufacturing capacity of 377 GW (limited by silver supply), tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) has a capacity of 227 GW (limited by silver supply) and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) has a capacity of 37 GW (limited by indium supply).
To cut the finite cake a different way, the paper says, that to enable a 3 TW market, silver consumption alone must be reduced to less than 2 milligrams per watt (mg/W) of generation. 
The current consumption of silver for industrial PERC solar cells is approximately 15.4 mg/W, while that for TOPCon and SHJ solar cells is approximately double at 25.6 mg/W and 33.9 mg/W, respectively, due to the reliance on silver on both the front and rear contacts,” the researchers reveal.
Despite the fact that the International Technology Roadmap for PV (ITRPV) predicts a 50-60% reduction in silver used for each of these mainstream technologies over the coming decade, it still calculates expected consumption in 2031 of 8.5 mg/W for PERC, 13.8 mg/W for TOPCon and 14.3 mg/W for SHJ.
In an exclusive interview, Hallam told pv magazine Australia that assuming PERC has an efficiency ceiling of 24-25%; and TOPCon and SHJ offer only a tiny gain to 25-26%, it would make more sense to continue scaling PERC production in anticipation of then switching to tandem solar cell production, because tandem cells have the known potential for 30% efficiency, which will itself allow reduced use of critical materials for the same required generation capacity.
But the UNSW team is concerned that manufacturers are investing heavily in SHJ cell production, which will suck up the most silver for not much additional benefit. 
Hallam estimates that manufacturers are investing in some 40-50 GW of heterojunction manufacturing, which he calculates, would also “potentially use up to 60% of global indium supply”. 
Indium is produced exclusively as a byproduct of processing other metal ores such as zinc, and more than 70% of supply is directed toward production of indium tin oxide (ITO), which is much in demand for its conductive yet transparent properties when applied as a film in touchscreens, flat-screen displays, glass windows, and PV cells.
Using less ITO in PV cells — films of, say, 20 nanometre thickness compared to 100 nanometre thickness, combined with an indium-free layer — would only enable around 200 GW of SHJ manufacturing, but would not support production at terawatt scale.

“One of the really exciting opportunities for tandems if they’re two-terminal,” says Hallam, “is that the current is halved and the voltage is tripled compared to PERC; and the reduced series resistance losses mean we can potentially reduce silver consumption by a factor of six.”
Hallam says reviewers of the paper before its publication were shocked by the numbers obtained for tandem use, and at least one had gone back over the calculations to verify them. “They came back to confirm we were completely right,” he says. 
The discovery “means we can maintain the multi-busbar technology and silver fingers as we use them now, while massively reducing the requirement for silver”, he says.
The Design Considerations paper also urges researchers and manufacturers to accelerate innovation in screen printing technologies for PERC, TOPCon and SHJ solar cells, to reduce silver consumption beyond the expectations of the ITRPV, or to move widespread adoption of proven copper plating technologies (see Pierre Verlinden Q&A for more on the changing constraints on copper plating).
Bismuth, the least abundant of the three materials identified by UNSW as “endangered” by PV production, is currently the go-to material used in alloys for cool soldering of heat-sensitive SHJ cells. But it is also considered a promising low-temperature alternative to lead-based solders used in PERC and TOPCon technologies.
The paper identifies that 20% of 2019 global bismuth supply would enable less than 300 GW of production with today’s bismuth-based interconnection technologies — so there’s an urgent case for “investigating the use of tin-bismuth coatings with substantially lower bismuth contents, or alternatively the use of electrically conductive adhesives”.
The SPREE team looked briefly at the potential for harvesting the three scarce materials from recycled solar cells, but the 25-year lifetime of solar infrastructure means that supplies of recovered materials will not reach levels to support terawatt scale production for decades — and that’s assuming that recycling technologies can be developed to efficiently recover not only glass and aluminium from solar panels, but access the potential riches of silver in particular.
The rising value of ever more scarce silver, indium and bismuth may accelerate development of such processes.
The research carried out by UNSW might be considered a blow to proponents of some PV technologies, but on the whole it should help focus industry development and investment in manufacturing towards sustainable options.
For example, says Hallam, it shows that “If we stick to the path of screen printing with silver fingers, then we should be manufacturing PERC until we switch to tandem. We can only consider TOPCon and heterojunction if they offer lower silver consumption, and don’t introduce new critical challenges like indium and bismuth”, a finding that encourages development of plating.
Hallam concedes that he was worried about the reception the paper might receive, but in fact he says it’s received “the most positive reviews I’ve ever had on a publication and probably ever will have”.
He says reviewers have generally highlighted the importance of the UNSW paper for the industry.
Zhang adds it’s vital that manufacturers look to the future: “With something like a tenfold increase in annual production capacity, material consumption is definitely going to be a concern.”
He says companies may already have spent millions or billions of dollars on building their production lines, “and this kind of risk is not something they will be happy to see, but I would expect this paper to at least raise some awareness in the industry and give them the incentive to look into more efficient ways to use these materials”.

As the cheapest form of electricity generation, solar PV, combined with wind generation and storage technologies, holds the greatest promise for mitigating climate change. The challenge is to pursue technological developments that will maintain the low cost of generation, using less (if any) of already scarce materials such as silver, bismuth and indium, while scaling production to meet our future 70 TW needs in 2050.
Pierre Verlinden is renowned for his technical contributions to the photovoltaic industry over the past 40 years. Having spent several years in China as Chief Scientist for Trina Solar (a role he maintains on a part-time basis), he is also a director of Oxford PV and contributes to the commercialisation of the new solar-related technologies of companies such as BTimaging, RayGen and SunDrive. 
As Adjunct Professor at the University of New South Wales’ School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE), Verlinden has co-authored a paper released today: Design Considerations for Multi-terawatt Scale Manufacturing of Existing and Future Photovoltaic Technologies: Challenges and Opportunities Related to Silver, Indium and Bismuth Consumption.
pv magazine: Why has sustainability of the materials needed for solar cell manufacture become critically important? 
Pierre Verlinden: PV growth has always been an exponential function, but it’s becoming apparent that it will be much bigger very soon. So what’s different now is that for the past 40 or 50 years the problem has always been to reduce cost and increase efficiency. But now the industry is at a very important juncture where we are approaching a terawatt of annual production. At the moment we have around 115 gigawatts, which is about a factor of six below the terawatt level. But because of the exponential growth in manufacturing, a factor of six is only a few years away. We cannot invest in technologies that are not sustainable. I’ve been saying it for many years — my first paper warning about sustainability was in 2013 — and the industry is just starting to realise that, yes, we need to do something. We have to make sure that the technology we use to meet the COP21 Paris agreement is sustainable,
So what surprised you about the research and conclusions arrived at in this paper?
I was not surprised at all. The current silicon technology represents more than 95% of annual solar cell production worldwide and three materials are critical: silver, indium and bismuth. If you look at just the PERC technology, which represents the bulk of production today, only silver is an issue. We need to reduce silver use in PERC production by a factor of four, maybe even seven if you really want to be sure, but we need to go from about 16 milligrams per watt to less than 5 million grams per watt. And that’s assuming that 50% of future world production of silver will be used for photovoltaics, which is huge. If we can’t access those 50%, then we have to reduce to about two milligrams per watt, or to nothing. 
But in the case of other technologies … heterojunctions, for example, use two or three times more silver than PERC, plus they consume quite a bit of indium, and for the low-temperature assembly of cells into modules we use bismuth. All three — silver, indium and bismuth — are critical materials and they’re not sustainable at the required expansion rate of PV. 
So with this paper we’re sending a big, alarming signal: if we stay with PERC, we need to reduce silver use by a factor of at least four; if we move to more efficient technologies like heterojunction we need to do it without indium and bismuth. 
TOPCon uses more silver than PERC, but my assumption is that all the technology we develop to reduce the amount of silver required in PERC, we will be able to apply to TOPCon also, so I’m not too worried about that. 
But I’m very worried about the industry moving to heterojunction and then realising we don’t have the material to make the technology sustainable. It’s expensive to start high-volume production and then realise later on that we cannot grow that technology. To meet the transition to net zero CO2 emissions, we need to install about 70 terawatts of photovoltaics by 2050, and to do that we need to grow the production level to three or four terawatts per annum and stabilise at that level. 
So, this paper really confirms what you have been considering for some time, and puts  the numbers out in a clearly understandable form, is that right?
Yes. My co-authors have done a very good job to put that in a manuscript that is scientific with good data, and that everyone can read quite easily.
The data suggests that after PERC, tandem technology could emerge as the best candidate for next generation cells, what makes it the most promising?
Well, there’s a very interesting thing with tandem technology when you put two junctions on top of each other, the voltage increases because they’re in series, but the current that each junction generates is half of the original single-junction current. So if you take a single junction silicon, it will have 40 to 42 milliamps per square centimetre If you put a perovskite on top of a silicon tandem junction, for the moment the current is about 17 milliamps per square centimetre, but it could go up to 20. Okay, so when you reduce the current by half, it means that you could increase the specific series resistance by a factor of four. You have the same power loss because the power loss is I-squared-R — you take the square of the current multiplied by the series resistance. So if you divide the current by two, you could increase the resistance by a factor of four, and get the same power loss. And if you do that, theoretically, you can reduce the amount of silver by a factor of four. 
That’s interesting because it makes the structure more sustainable, in terms of silver. That doesn’t mean that we don’t still have to make some effort to reduce the silver. 
And there’s another problem. We have to make sure that perovskite silicon tandem cells don’t use any indium, and don’t use bismuth. Unfortunately, perovskites are very sensitive to temperature, so you cannot use high temperature soldering, which means that you have to use bismuth for soldering the cells, or use silver-loaded epoxy, conductive adhesive, for example. So that’s another problem.
What do you think the PV industry will actually do, presented with the outcomes of this paper?
Well, I’ve been working with Trina Solar for a long time and I’ve been in contact with many of the Chinese PV companies. Copper plating could be a solution to completely solve the silver problems. A few years ago, the manufacturers were telling me they weren’t ready to move to copper plating, because silver represented a small part of the manufacturing costs and there wasn’t much saving to be had. But now the problem is different; not only has silver increased significantly in price over the past 12 months, but people are starting to see that in a few years there won’t be enough silver in the world. If we don’t change anything, at the one-terawatt level we will be using 100% of the silver production worldwide. That is absolutely not acceptable. So manufacturers are anticipating speculation and a major cost increase and everybody is starting to consider copper plating as an option. It’s a big change compared to just three years ago,
And copper plating is just as efficient as current technologies?
Yes, it’s probably even more efficient, because you could make the finger lines narrower than what you can do with screen printing silver paste. So for the moment with silver paste you could get 30 to 40 micron width in fingers by screen printing, which is extraordinarily small compared to what we were able to do 40 years ago. But with copper plating, because you define the fingers with a different technique — either by laser ablation, or by patterning — you could go down to about 10 to 15 microns. And if you can do that, we could reduce the shading on the cells dramatically and so you could also improve the efficiency. Even if copper is a little bit less conductive than silver, the copper plating is extremely good in terms of conductivity and the narrow fingers could give you a better efficiency. 
SunDrive recently demonstrated that replacing screen printed silver with copper plating on heterojunction cells gives greater efficiency than the same cell with silver screen printing.
So why hasn’t the industry turned to copper plating before? 
There have been several attempts to do copper plating on solar cells over the past 20 years. BP Solar developed a buried-contact solar cell using copper plating, but that cell didn’t have enough efficiency, and was supplemented by PERC. Suntech tried all sorts of copper plating about 10 years ago with its Pluto technology; and that technology suffered from not so good reliability.  Now, the technology has significantly improved, but the latest obstacle is obtaining permits in China to do plating.
It sounds a little bit surprising, but it is very, very difficult in China, particularly in the region where most of the PV manufacturers are — in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou — to obtain permits for a copper plating line, mostly because of pollution. Those companies are very close to Taihu Lake, which has been severely polluted over the years due to industrialisation. So in this region around Taihu Lake, it’s almost impossible to get a copper plating license.
Does it still look impossible? Would manufacturers have to set up somewhere else?
 It’s no longer impossible for a number of reasons. I think the PV industry is very important for China, and pretty much all the PV manufacturers in China are looking at copper plating. Another reason is that people who are developing tools for copper plating are proposing solutions that produce no waste. Zero-waste copper plating would be a very interesting value proposition for this industry, and would greatly facilitate the permitting process of plating in China,

Scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), have developed a novel technology that they claim is able to prevent internal short-circuits in lithium-ion batteries.
These short-circuits still represent a major hurdle to overcome for battery makers, as lithium-ion devices can catch fire if they are damaged or not properly manufactured. What causes these short-circuits, the research team explained, is the formation of dendrites, which are needle-like projections that can grow inside a battery and cause a number of undesirable effects, including, in a worst-case scenario, complete battery failure and even fires. The dendrites cross the separator between the positive cathode and negative anode electrodes of a lithium-ion battery during charging.
In order to prevent the dendrites from reaching the cathode, the academics placed what they called an “anti-short layer” on the separator itself. “Instead of preventing the formation of dendrites, we decided to make use of their intrinsic properties by coating an additional layer of conductive material on the separator for these dendrites to connect with,” said NTU researcher Jason Xu. “Once the dendrites make the connection, [they] will not be able to continue their growth further, thus preventing them from ever reaching the other side.”
The additional layer works as an interface on behalf of the negative electrode to exchange lithium-ions with the positive electrode. It was tested on more than 50 cells with different li-ion battery architectures and, according to the scientists, no short-circuits arose during the charging phase, even with the battery cells that exceeded their expected lifecycle. “The anti-short layer is a common material used in battery manufacturing and can be easily integrated into the current separator manufacturing process, making it easy for companies to adopt and scale up,” the Singaporean group stated, noting that it would increase lithium battery production costs by around 5%.
NTU University’s spin-off NTUitive is planning to bring this novel technology to commercial production and is currently in the process of securing a patent.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/27/the-worlds-largest-solar-parks/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2021",The world’s largest solar parks,"From pv magazine Global
The concept of the solar park was first developed in India and China a decade ago. Regional energy agencies in states such as Gujarat, Qinghai, and Gansu identified suitable locations where several solar power plants could be sited together. The coordinators provided for high-capacity grid connections and often procured or provided the land.
Probably the most notable early example is the Charanka Solar Park in India’s Patan district. When this was first opened in 2012 by Gujarat’s then chief minister, Narendra Modi, it had a combined capacity of 224 MWP from 19 individual solar power plants, of which the largest were 25P MW each. It has since been expanded to 500 MW of overall capacity.
The largest solar parks now house up to 80 individual solar power plants, achieving higher capacities than single plants. The concept has subsequently been adopted elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. A similar approach was implemented by the Bureau of Land Management in the USA, when it designated several ‘Solar Energy Zones’, such as that at Dry Lake in Nevada.
The following list selects the solar parks which are thought to have at least 1 GWAC of current operational capacity (typically equivalent to 1.25 GWP). The position each held in the 2019 lists are shown in brackets. The list is still dominated by China and India, joined by single entries in Egypt and the UAE, and a likely future entrant in the USA.
Located in the desert to the East of Golmud in Qinghai Province in China this solar park now houses about 80 solar power plants with a combined capacity of over 2.8 GWAC – up by a gigawatt since the last list – and includes a 200 MW ‘power tower’ CSP plant. It also houses a 200 MWP PV plant by Huanghe – the largest individual solar power plant in the world, when it was first built in 2011.
It is not known what the final capacity will be, but the overall area would be sufficient for an eventual 4 to 5 GW.
The Bhadla Solar Park, covering about 160 km2 at Bhadlachuhron Ki in the north of India’s Rajasthan state, has also expanded by around 1 GW since 2019, with several new plants, the largest of which is 300 MW. It will eventually accommodate nearly 30 solar plants with a total capacity of 3.5 GWAC.
 
This group of solar plants located beside the Longyangxia Reservoir in Eastern Qinghai, China, delivers its power in conjunction with a nearby hydro-electricity plant. It has been progressively expanded since the first phase in 2013 and now stands at an estimated 2.4 GW.
United Photovoltaics’ smaller Tara Beach Solar Park is visible to the north and the 50 MW Gonghe CSP power tower to the East.
Originally developed by China Power Investment – now State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) – this was previously listed as an individual plant (where it ranked #3).
This compact solar park scraped into the last list before it was officially commissioned. It is now largely complete with 27 blocks mostly of a nominal 50 MW, though there is space for around a further 400 MW.
The solar park covers 37 sq.km. in the desert in Egypt’s Aswan governorate and is the only solar park outside Asia on this list.
 
Also known as Anantapur Ultra Mega Solar Park, this solar park covers some 90 km2 in the Nambula Pulakunta district of Andhra Pradesh, India.
Promoted by Andhra Pradesh Solar Power Corporation, it is scheduled for a total capacity of 1.5 GW, of which about 1.2 GW is currently believed to be operational, though the site has been dogged by various delays.

The fourth and fifth phases are now under construction to the north-east and south of this solar park in the south of the UAE emirate of Dubai. Phase IV includes CSP plants using both parabolic trough and power tower technologies.
One of only two listed parks outside China and India, the eventual capacity of this complex is scheduled to be 5 GW, which may make it the largest in the world, covering up to 200 km2.
Jinchuan in China’s Gansu province is almost surrounded by solar power plants. The solar park covers almost 90 km2 of semi-desert to the north west of the city, while a further cluster of projects is to the south.
The solar park has now been increased to 15 plants with a combined capacity just over 1 GW. Jinchuan’s largest plant has a capacity over 200 MW.

A new entry at #8, covering 92 km2 of semi-desert in the Mori Kazakh district of Changji Hui prefecture of China’s Xinjiang Province is this solar park to the north of the town of Danangouxiang.
The current capacity of its 13 plants is just over 1 GW, and it has sufficient space to at least double in size in future years.
Located on some 80 km2 of low grade agricultural land in Karnataka state in India, to the north-east of the city of Pavagada, this solar park is now largely complete with its 19 plants giving a combined capacity of 1 GWAC.
The solar park was sponsored by Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited (KREDL) and the off-taker for most of its output is India’s National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).

Delingha Solar Park is located in the Haixi Prefecture, and is the third on this list in Qinghai Province. It houses about 40 projects with a combined capacity of over 1 GW. This includes 3 CSP plants together delivering about 200 MW (edged in red on this aerial view).
Plants now in construction will take the capacity over 1 GW, while Delingha Solar Park has enough site area for an eventual capacity of at least 2 GW.
The highest U.S. solar park on the list, the Dry Lake Solar Enterprize zone, is at #20. Way below even that, Westlands currently has only one small plant in service. However, most of its 10 plants are now in construction, and it will reach 1.5 GW when they are all complete.
The Westlands Zone covers 120 km2 of mainly agricultural land in the San Joacquin Valley, south of Fresno, California. There are also several existing solar power plants in the vicinity.
 
The term “solar plant” is used for an individual project that has been developed by a single developer or consortium. The largest of these were listed previously. Where, as described in this article, multiple plants are co-located in a discrete area under the coordination of an identified agency, this is called a “solar park”. The  word “cluster” is used where multiple solar farms are co-located in an area without formal coordination.
For consistency, all capacities are quoted in MWAC to allow direct comparison between PV and CSP plants (and other forms of generation). Readers will be aware that the DC peak capacity of PV plants is typically ~25% higher than the rated AC capacity, quoted here.
The final article in the series will identify the world’s biggest solar clusters.
