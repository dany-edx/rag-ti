This holds true for Australia. At the end of 2020, 165 countries had sectoral renewables targets in place. Australia was not one of them.
Just five of the G20 countries had targets which covered all sectors. Of those five, Italy, Germany  and the EU just managed to scrape through to meet their targets while France and United Kingdom missed theirs entirely.

“We are waking up to the bitter reality that the climate policy promises over the past ten years have mostly been empty words. The share of fossil fuels in final energy consumption has not moved by an inch,” Rana Adib, REN21’s Executive Director, said. “Phasing them out and making renewables the new norm are the strongest actions we can take.”
While renewable capacity was added at record rates, with 256 GW installed in 2020, and generation in the global electricity mix reached new heights at an estimated 29%, it wasn’t enough.
“Despite these advances, renewable electricity continued to face challenges in achieving a larger share of global electricity generation, due in part to persistent investment in fossil fuel (and nuclear) power capacity,” the report reads.
In 2011, fossil fuels accounted for 80.3% of the total electricity generation mix. Today, the number stands at 80.2%.

“Australia’s primary support mechanism to support renewable energy development, the Large-Scale Renewable Energy Target, was met in 2019 ahead of schedule with no extension announced,” industry peak body the Clean Energy Council said in response to the report.
“States and territories are currently doing the heavy lifting on emissions reduction.”
The Council went on to say the Gen21 report shows “Australia is not doing enough to decarbonise its economy and that urgent action is required within the next decade to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.”
At the end of 2020, Australia ranked 14th in total renewable power capacity at 50 GW.
The report found renewable energy made up around 10% of Australia’s total final energy consumption, ranking us 12th of G20 countries, behind Brazil, Canada, Turkey, the US, Argentina and India.
Australia was ranked in fifth position for renewable power capacity per capita (not including hydropower), but that ranking remains unchanged from last year.

With a specific focus on emissions abatement in industry, the program’s funding will be made available to companies and organisations in the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, gas supply, water supply, waste services and data centre sectors. Under the program, applicants can seek $100,000 to $500,000 for feasibility studies or $250,000 to $5 million for engineering studies looking into industrial solutions to improve energy efficiency or greenhouse gas emissions.
The first round of the program will see up to $25 million of grant funding being made available to support these studies and establish the business case for replicable projects that demonstrate energy efficiency and decarbonisation technology solutions for industry, ARENA said in its statement.
The program is part of the federal government’s Low Emissions Technology Statement which drew criticism when it was released last year because of its support for controversial technologies. In the Low Emissions Technology Statement, Commonwealth Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, named CCS as one of five priorities that would receive taxpayer support as part of the government’s “technology, not taxes” approach. Also included in the strategy was “clean” hydrogen. Not to be confused with green hydrogen, also called renewable hydrogen, the federal government’s conception of “clean” hydrogen includes hydrogen made with fossil fuels which claim to “capture” its emissions.
Off the back of today’s announcement, industry peak body the Clean Energy Council issued a statement again voicing its objections to the government’s proposed mandate changes which would allow the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to fund ‘low-emission technologies’ like CCS and gas projects.
“There is no such thing as clean coal, and gas is not a low-emissions technology,” the Council’s Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said.
“Any watering down of the ARENA or CEFC’s investment mandate, allowing them to support higher emissions generation, exposes Australia’s taxpayers to unacceptable risk at a time when an unequivocal message is being sent around the world to back away from publicly-funded fossil fuel projects,” he added.
On Friday, Monash University published new analysis in conjunction with the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics and Political Science showing Australia to be a “green laggard.”
The analysis found Australia’s green competitiveness has fallen significantly over the past 20 years. It is now rated 96th of the 231 countries the universities analysed.
“Of the countries considered, Australia appears to be in the least favourable starting position to competitively export products with environmental benefits. Australia is cited to have just 12 ‘green strengths’ compared to 59 in Canada and 153 in China,” the report ‘Navigating the green transition: insights for the G7’ said.
Australia’s straggler status is becoming increasingly glaring as climate action has recently risen to the top of international agendas following net-zero commitments from superpowers the United States and China.
Which is why the proposed changes to funding rules for both ARENA and CEFC have stirred such panic, diluting the goals of the few institutions the country has specifically for green energy.
Applications for the initial round of ARENA’s Industrial Energy Transformation Studies Program will open on July 6, 2021.

The units have an initial production target of 1 tonne of hydrogen per day, though production is expected to scale up in the next three years.
The two units were purchased by Port Anthony Renewables Limited, which is planning to develop a 20-tonne-per-day hydrogen production facility at Port Anthony, about 200km southeast of Melbourne. Port Anthony has long been a hub for offshore oil and gas exploration and production and Port Anthony Renewables executive chairman Ben Anthony said the shift towards hydrogen would ensure it remains a cornerstone of Australia’s energy sector.
Patriot Hydrogen, the company supplying the hydrogen production units, was partially acquired by Western Australia-based oil and gas company Prominence Energy earlier this month. Prominence have bought a 20% stake in the hydrogen company, which hopes its P2H units will build into a solid revenue stream.
The two P2H units will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021, though the $5.8 million dollar sale is subject to Port Anthony Renewables securing its funding and undertaking a 30-day period of due diligence.

Specifically, the 120 MW concentrated solar plant portfolio is made up of a 20 MW Gemasolar tower plant, the first solar plant in the world which can operate 24 hours a day, and two 50 MW parabolic trough solar parks.
Located in Andalusia, the southmost region in Spain, the portfolio has been in operation since 2011, with Macquarie describing its owner, Q-Energy, as having an established track record operating solar farms, CSP plants and wind parks across Western Europe.
Macquarie Asset Management added its investment was made “on behalf of its institutional clients via a bespoke, long-dated, subordinated debt financing.”
The project marks the fourth financing contract between Macquarie and Spain’s Q-Energy. Since 2012, Macquarie Asset Management has invested approximately €2.6 billion (AU$4 billion) across more than 35 renewable energy projects, with a total installed capacity of approximately 13.7 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/15/agrivoltaics-can-certainly-be-a-viable-and-meaningful-alternative-to-large-scale-solar/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 15, 2021",‘Agrivoltaics can certainly be a viable and meaningful alternative to large-scale solar’,"From pv magazine Global
Agrivoltaics are raising big expectations inside and outside the solar sector. The combination of solar power generation and grazing livestock or growing vegetable crops began to be considered a viable option to develop ground-mounted PV facilities on agricultural land over the past two years and is seen by many as a possible alternative to conventional solar parks. However, the business models and technologies that are currently being developed across several countries have not yet ensured the required viability for the deployment of huge volumes of solar capacity, which are strongly needed for the world’s decarbonisation and energy transition.
According to Alexis Pascaris, a researcher in environmental and energy policy at the Michigan Technological University (MTU), agrivoltaics are a very practical and advantageous alternative to large-scale solar, specifically in places where there are land-use constraints or needs for rural economic development. “Each system is going to be unique and reflect the context of the community in which it is built, which differentiates agrivoltaics from the conventional approach to large-scale development,” she stated in a conversation with pv magazine. “Agrivoltaics takes conventional solar one step further – it entails partnerships between key sectors and thoughtful, long-term planning about managing our key resources.”
Agrivoltaics are reinvigorating the solar industry by providing a means to make tangible contributions to agriculturalists and host communities, all while increasing the world’s solar generating capacity, she added. “Where appropriate, agrivoltaics can certainly be a viable and meaningful alternative to large-scale solar.”
Considering the right proportion between agricultural and energy business and whether agriculture should be preponderant, Pascaris said that a 50/50 balance between both enterprises should be pursued. “I am personally inclined towards prioritising the agricultural component of the system,” she explained. “The idea here is not to advance solar development at the expense of farmland.” In her view, there are many other surfaces upon which solar panels can be placed, but there are also many valuable benefits of superpositioning them above crops and livestock, including water retention and protection from heat stress, to name a few. “The idea is to create a symbiotic relationship between the agricultural activity and the solar array, as both benefit from the co-location.”
A clear definition of what agrivoltaics are is still missing, despite recent efforts to create guidelines, best practices and standards, and sometimes projects are described as pertaining to this new domain just because a couple of cows or sheep are grazing around the panels, or a few beehives are built close to the array. “The definition of agrivoltaics varies depending on who you ask,” Pascaris said. “Some use the term to be inclusive of all forms of co-location, while some are more particular about the distinctions between the different forms.”
Agrivoltaic systems intentionally strike a balance and harness synergies between agriculture and solar energy production and, in its truest sense, refers to the coexistence of crops or livestock with solar photovoltaics, she explains. “A robust agrivoltaic system wouldn’t just feature a couple of grazing cows or scattered plants, but would actively accommodate farming activity and be designed for maximum dual output of both electricity and agriculture.”
Comparing the costs between agrivoltaics and the conventional utility-scale solar business, Pascaris said that both economic models and existent applications tend to show an increase in hardware costs for agrivoltaic systems in comparison to a conventional ground-mounted array.
“The difference in cost can typically be attributed to the raised racking system or additional fencing, in instances where those infrastructure modifications are necessary,” she emphasised. “But these upfront investments in specialised hardware are eventually recovered as the agrivoltaic system produces a dual-revenue stream.”
The opportunities and barriers for agrivoltaics in the United States are described in the paper “Integrating solar energy with agriculture: Industry perspectives on the market, community, and socio-political dimensions of agrivoltaics,” recently published in Energy Research & Social Science and written by Pascaris and other researchers from the MTU and the US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories.
“This study found that solar industry professionals perceive the potential for an agrivoltaic project to retain agricultural interests and consequently increase local support for development as the most significant opportunity of dual use solar,” the group of scientists point out. “This indicates that solar developers can play an active role in cultivating social acceptance of agrivoltaics through public engagement.”
According to their findings, solar developers and agricultural industry professionals are thinking about very different issues regarding the opportunities and barriers associated with agrivoltaics. “The different opportunities and barriers raised by these two different groups of actors highlight the potential for complex interactions in agrivoltaics decision making,” the paper notes. “If actors come to the table with divergence in their motivations, their concerns, and what they view as the opportunities and barriers, it may be more difficult for them to work together and ensure that each group has their needs and priorities addressed.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/15/photovoltaics-and-geothermal-heat-pumps-for-domestic-hot-water-heating/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,FINLAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 15, 2021",Photovoltaics and geothermal heat pumps for domestic hot water heating,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) have outlined a series of control methods for domestic hot water (DHW) heating produced by a ground source heat pump (GSHP), in combination with a rooftop PV system, in Nordic climates.
GSHPs, which are also known as geothermal heat pumps, utilise shallow-ground energy to achieve space heating and cooling and are able to transfer heat to or from the ground.
The four methods were tested on two system configurations located in Finland. One system is based on an F1255-12 R EM heat pump with a capacity of 12 kW provided by U.K.-based provider Nibe Energy Systems Limited, and an east-south-west-oriented 21 kW rooftop PV system. The second system relies on the same kind of heat pump and a 5 kW south-oriented solar array.
Both systems include a hot water storage tank with a capacity of 500 litres and, for both configurations, solar power is first used to meet the requirements of the baseload demand of the household and then is made available for DHW heating. Space heating is not provided by the proposed solution and the heat pump is used exclusively to heat the hot water tank storage.
“Energy consumption of DHW is calculated by assuming that the house is a typical four-person household with a DHW consumption of 200l per day,” the researchers specified. “The cold inlet water temperature is assumed to be 10 degrees Celsius, while the hot outlet water temperature is 60 degrees Celsius.” Based on these data, the electricity demand for DHW was found to be 11.64 kWh per day. Heating is performed between 8.00 a.m. and 8.00 p.m.
With the first of the four methods, which the Finnish group defined as a “base case,” the water tank is heated from 45 to 55 degrees Celsius twice a day and the highest consumption peaks occur in the morning and in the evening. As for the second method, which the scientists called “clock control,” the tank is heated once a day from 45 to 65 degrees Celsius, and heating is carried out mostly at noon hours when PV power generation is higher.
The third method, which was labeled as “energy-optimal,” is aimed at optimising the coefficient of performance (COP) value of the heat pump. The COP defines the ratio between the useful heat transfer for heating or cooling and the required drive energy. This approach is said to reduce electricity consumption in water heating by maintaining the storage tank temperature at 45 degrees Celsius. “The low chosen-temperature limit can be justified by the fact that it is just enough to guarantee the comforts provided by hot water,” the academics explained.
The fourth method, dubbed as “cost-optimal,” is intended at minimising heating costs and using cheap grid electricity together with solar power. Under this configuration, water is heated once a day, from 45 to 64 degrees Celsius, and heating duration is established based on the COP curve, DHW demand, PV generation forecasts, and expected spot market prices.
“The results in the period between June and September 2020 show that the developed cost-optimal control reduces DHW heating costs compared with the other three control cases, even with the use of an actual PV output forecast,” the research team stated. “Considering the share of PV production in DHW heating, the cost-optimal control with the 5 kWp PV system shows a greater PV production share than the other three control methods, even though the imperfect PV forecast is used.”
With the 21 kW array, the share of solar power is higher in the clock control than in the cost-optimal approach and, if PV forecasts are accurate, DHW heating costs are lower. “The simulation results also indicate that as the size of the PV system increases, the accuracy of the PV production forecast loses its significance,” it further explained. “In the case of the 21.1 kWp PV system, the heating cost increased by 9% when the actual PV forecast was applied, instead of the perfect forecast while, in the 5 kWp case, the heating cost increased by 11%.”
The four approaches are described in the paper Ground source heat pump control methods for solar photovoltaic-assisted domestic hot water heating, published in Renewable Energy.
