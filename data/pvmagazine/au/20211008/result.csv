Marinus Link general manager Bess Clark said submissions for project assessment have been made under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the Victorian Environmental Effects Act.
Federal environment minister Sussan Ley and Victoria’s planning minister Richard Wynne will now review the applications and decide if further environmental assessments are required before the project can go ahead.
“Marinus Link is committed to sustainable development, and is following robust environmental, land-use planning and cultural heritage assessment standards to minimise impacts that the project may create,” Clark said.
“We understand the importance of preserving the natural environment and protecting other values that communities have.”
While the submissions have been lodged with the federal and Victorian governments, the process for assessing Tasmanian environmental and planning matters is yet to be determined.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the federal government have declared Marinus Link a national priority project with reports revealing it would provide benefits across the entire National Electricity Market (NEM) through grid stability and downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices.
Set to be the second energy interconnector between Tasmania and the Australian mainland, the project includes about 255 kilometres of undersea high voltage direct current (HVDC) cable and approximately 90km of underground HVDC cable. It will also include converter stations in Tasmania and Victoria and approximately 220km of high voltage alternating current (HVAC) transmission network developments in north west Tasmania.
Clark said the project will help provide secure, reliable and affordable power to consumers well beyond the borders of Tasmania and Victoria.
“Marinus Link will unlock Tasmania’s abundant, low-cost wind resources, existing hydro and new pumped hydro storage facilities to provide low-cost, reliable and on-demand clean energy to Australian homes and businesses across the NEM,” she said.
“From Cairns to Hobart, millions of Australian households and businesses will be better off with a future energy grid with Marinus Link, compared to a future grid without it.
“Along with downward pressure on prices and a more reliable grid, Marinus Link will cut emissions, deliver 2,800 direct and indirect jobs in both Tasmania and Victoria, and unlock a pipeline of future renewable energy development, with thousands more jobs.”
The current target date for commissioning and commercial operation of the first 750 MW stage of the project is 2027-28, with the commissioning and commercial operation of the second 750 MW stage currently scheduled for 2029-30.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/08/australian-miner-triples-solar-capacity-at-wa-operation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 8, 2021",Australian miner triples solar capacity at WA operation,"Perth-based power provider Nomadic Energy has boosted the capacity of the solar farm at Northern Star Resources’ Carosue Dam mine site in Western Australia’s (WA) goldfields region, adding a 3.3 MW re-deployable array to the existing 1 MW system.
Northern Star, which acquired the Carosue Dam operations in 2020 after a merger with Saracen Mineral Holdings, said the new solar farm was completed in August with Nomadic Energy confirming commissioning of the new off-grid installation has now been completed.
“We are delighted with the success of the rollout of the project and are looking forward to the further expansion in the new year,” Nomadic technical director Simon James said.
The new solar array, which features prefabricated, pre-wired Maverick solar modules designed by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B, complements the existing 1 MW solar farm which was commissioned in January 2020.
Nomadic said the expanded solar farm will produce a combined 7.2 GWh of renewable energy each year, offset 4,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually and will provide power 40% cheaper than previous means of generation.
Carosue Dam general manager Rob Williamson said the solar PV power was a boost to the operation’s financial and environmental credentials.
“It saves us money on our bottom line and helps us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, so it’s a win-win for the company,” he said.

Nomadic, which earlier this year was awarded $1 million as part of the WA government’s Clean Energy Future Fund to help finance the installation of 5 MW of modular, re-deployable solar panels at the mine site, is scheduled to install another 2 MW of solar PV at Carosue Dam by early 2022.
The works will bring the total on-site solar capacity to 6.3 MW as part of a six-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Nomadic and Northern Star.
Nomadic commercial director Alex Blott previously described the Carosue Mine project as unique, saying the flexibility to redeploy the solar panels removes a key barrier to using green energy at mine sites, where a mine may cease operating before the cost of the solar panels has been recovered.
“We have taken a different approach to a conventional solar offering in that we are offering a short-term offtake agreement, where the client only pays for the power that is used or generated rather than asking the miner to buy the system upfront,” he said.
“If they want to move that to an alternative site or another area within Carosue Dam, then they are able to do that.”

Toowoomba Region Mayor Paul Antonio said this week the tender process was progressing well and the latest endorsement would allow council to continue taking steps towards using its land and water assets to generate energy.
“If the project proceeds to delivery, council will provide access to land and water assets and BE Power will develop the project, including providing necessary infrastructure,” he said.
The Melbourne-based BE Power is developing the pumped hydro storage project in conjunction with renewable energy heavyweight GE Renewable Energy, a division of France-based General Electric.
BE Power managing director Scott Walkem said the project partners welcomed council’s latest approval as they progressed work to meet their objectives with construction scheduled to commence in 2023 ahead of commissioning in early 2026.
“Having now secured the private land required to deliver the project, we look forward to our continued engagement with the TRC, the state of Queensland, and the federal government’s Underwriting New Generation (UNGI) team as we to work together to deliver the project,” he said.
Walkem said the project would provide long-duration, high-capacity storage, helping to facilitate new wind and solar projects and provide valuable system strength and inertia at a critical point in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“In an increasingly dynamic power system, long-duration storage (such as pumped hydro) is vital,” he said.
“Not only does it help match wind and solar output with actual consumer demand, but it also provides many different grid services required to keep the system stable.
“With significant investment in renewable wind and solar forecast for the Queensland Southern Renewable Energy Zone (QREZ), this project is strategically placed to help unlock the Southern QREZ and ensure it delivers power, jobs and social and economic benefits, not just for locals, but for all Queenslanders.”
When generating, the project is expected to provide power equivalent to the demand of about 200,000 typical households.

Antonio said as part of TRC’s latest endorsement for the project, BE Power would now need to demonstrate its alignment with council requirements around water security, community and stakeholders, plus regulatory approvals.
“Water is one of our most precious resources and the proposed project must not adversely affect council’s water security,” he said.
“BE Power must also provide a Communication and Stakeholder Engagement Plan before starting community consultation and project approvals must progress through the relevant regulatory bodies.”
The Big T proposal is one of a number of pumped hydro projects in the pipeline in Australia, including the 250 MW Kidston Pumped Hydro Project being developed by Genex Power in far north Queensland.
The Queensland government is has also called for tenders for the proposed 1 GW Borumba Dam pumped hydro energy storage project being developed near Gympie in the state’s south-east.
Further south, the New South Wales and federal governments are pushing ahead with the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro storage project. The pumped-hydro expansion of the existing Snowy Scheme will provide 2 GW of on-demand generation and 350,000 MWh of large-scale energy storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/08/new-matrix-layout-for-shingled-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 8, 2021",New ‘matrix’ layout for shingled solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
Promising better module efficiencies, aesthetic appearance, flexibility in terms of device shape and size, as well as eliminating soldering and therefore lead from PV production, shingled solar module layouts have been around for a while, and are gaining ground commercially particularly in rooftop and BIPV markets.
Now, scientists at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have worked with equipment supplier M10 Industries AG to demonstrate a new type of shingled layout for modules, and its applicability at industrial scale. The approach, which the two companies have dubbed ‘Matrix Shingle Technology’ (MST), places cell shingles offset from each other, similar to how bricks are laid in a wall. The creators claim this approach allows better occupation of the entire module area, leading to improved efficiency and shading tolerance, and an aesthetically pleasing homogenous appearance – according to Fraunhofer ISE, the matrix shingled technology will produce that perform between 2% and 6% better than a conventionally connected half cut cell module layout.
In work presented at last month’s EU PVSEC conference, the group found that its MST approach also leads to much better tolerance of partial shading, since current can flow around the shaded areas of the module. This could make the modules particularly suitable for building, or even vehicle, integrated solar. “Matrix shingle modules are predestined for integrated applications, especially in building façades,” says Achim Kraft, head of group Interconnection and Encapsulation at Fraunhofer ISE. “Particularly in building integration, maximum area utilisation, shading tolerance and appealing aesthetics are important.”
Straight to scale
Having proven the potential of MST modules in various applications, Fraunhofer ISE worked with equipment supplier M10 Industries to demonstrate how the modules could be produced at scale. “The matrix approach has enabled us to implement a completely new machine concept. Our system has a much higher throughput than classic shingle stringers and is in no way inferior to conventional stringers in terms of megawatt output,” explained Phillipp Zahn, CEO of M10 Industries AG.
The prototype, set to be demonstrated at the Intersolar Europe Restart beginning tomorrow in Munich, can process 12,000 cell shingles per hour, and can be integrated into conventional module lines. Fraunhofer says it took only seven months to develop the tool, and that it has a prototype machine in up and running in Freiburg, and available for further testing.
