Such things have long been on the mind of Dr Bjorn Sturmberg, Research Leader in the Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program at the Australian National University (ANU). 
In a jargon-heavy industry like energy, communications can often obscure rather than clarify things for general audiences – but even for those in the ‘industry know,’ there exists a tendency to latch onto technical details rather than face more foundational issues posed by the bigger picture, Dr Sturmberg says. The kinds of questions raised in industry circles, and the kinds which are not, are for him uniquely telling.

“Everyone talks about ‘Australia can be the Saudi Arabia of future energy.’ And it’s like hang on, what part of Saudi Arabia do we want to be? Has anyone had pause to think about this?” Dr Sturmberg tells pv magazine Australia.
“Do we want to be an energy exporting superpower because we tell ourselves we don’t have the creativity or intellectual capacity to do anything other than export raw materials? Or do we want to be more like a Costa Rica, an ecological tourism superpower, where people come to the Northern Territory to wonder at the desert, not to look at tens of thousands of hectares of solar panels? We should ask ourselves that question.”
“And that question should be put to everyone, not just a few key decision makers.”
Which is really what his book Amy’s Balancing Act is about: translating Australia’s energy situation so new demographics can make sense of the change.
There’s something powerful in having normatively loaded things be widely understood, Dr Sturmberg says.

The other side of making a complicated electricity system legible is that it disarms the politicians who would prefer to put the transition in the ‘too hard’ basket – a particularly insidious trait in 2018 when Dr Sturmberg started working on the book.
“If you can make something intuitive to a primary school audience, then there are very few adults that claim they don’t understand it.”
While Australia’s heated climate wars are thankfully receding, the conversations about what it means to change, and in which directions Australia should change, are just beginning. 
“There’s more emotion to that than is generally talked about in the open,” Dr Sturmberg says. 
“We’ve been doing the energy system in a particular way for 50 odd years,” he adds. “The people inside the sector, its traditionally been quite conservative, slow moving industry.”
“My feeling is you went into power engineering because you wanted to manage infrastructure over the space of decades rather than going into software engineer or something that is more disruptive and rapid changing. I think it’s historically attracted a certain type of person.”
Somewhat ironically, this slow moving industry is now “at the forefront of the biggest disruption yet,” Dr Sturmberg says. But the disruption of the energy transition tends to be viewed by the energy industry as primarily a technological change, rather than a more fundamental systematic change that requires major shifts in mindset both within and without.

In his book, heroine Amy, whose role mirrors that of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), must retire her loyal helper Clyde the horse, who in the story represents coal generation. One of the more subtle layers of meaning here is the implication of the horse metaphor for the industry itself – that is, part of the transition will involving a relinquishing of the reins of control. Fossil generation has always been at human’s behest, renewable generation is not. 
The loss of coal and fossil generation isn’t just confronting for the workers and communities, it is also a fundamental change in how the people in energy approach their jobs. Moreover, the technologies it will need to deploy may not always come with the risk levels, or lack thereof, the industry has been accustomed to.
Which brings us to one of the core lessons in Dr Sturmberg’s book: diversity. Yes, this refers to energy generation and technology diversity, Dr Sturmberg says, but the power of diversity must also be viewed as a “general guiding principle.”

Becoming comfortable with diversity and with questions not only on ‘how’ but also ‘why’ we’re building the way we are, is something Dr Sturmberg hopes his book can inspire.
“I think having a way that we can all from within the industry talk to our kids and to the general audience about why it is that we want to transition and what it generally involves before going into the nitty gritty about how we need this sort of network tariff reform or regulate the network in this way – whatever technical, jargony things we need to do – to frame that in a broader, simpler narrative will hopefully be useful,” he says.
Amy’s Balancing Act launched in Parliament house in November, with praise from energy minister Chris Bowen and Australian National University Vice-Chancellor Professor Brian Schmidt, among many others.

Before August 2022, regulations made it extremely difficult to deploy standalone power systems (SAPS) in the National Electricity Market (NEM), Australia’s main grid which runs along its east. Those regulations have now been amended, with Boundary Power director Rod Henderson saying demand is steadily growing.
SAPS, which typically include solar panels, batteries, inverters and a back-up diesel generator, are proving highly successful in Western Australia, which is not part of Australia’s national grid.
West Australia has deployed many SAPS already and plans to deploy thousands more, with its rollout establishing the technology is capable of improving reliability and reducing both maintenance costs for networks and emissions.
To that end, Western Australia’s government-owned utility Horizon Power and electrical engineering company Ampcontrol in 2021 joined forces to created Boundary Power – a new company focusing on accelerating SAPS rollout not only in WA but across the now-ready nation.
While West Australia’s grid is particularly tricky, Australia is home to many tenuous grid connections and remote customers, making it a ripe landscape for such a solution.
In this particular instance, Boundary Power deployed its Solar Qube SAPS product, which was assembled in its workshop, with all electrical testing and commissioning completed before being transported to the remote site.
Boundary Power director, Rod Henderson, described himself as elated at seeing the east coast market embrace the technology. “To have Boundary Power’s very first Solar Qube deployed into New South Wales, a market that is seeing significant growth, is exciting for the team who designed the product here in the Hunter Valley.”
“We look forward to seeing the increase in demand from the east coast as they follow in Western Australia’s footsteps and embrace off-grid renewable SAPS to deliver energy into remote communities.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/13/melbourne-researchers-use-sound-waves-to-boost-green-hydrogen-production-14-fold/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",Melbourne researchers use sound waves to boost green hydrogen production 14-fold,"Melbourne researchers have discovered sound waves can be used to “divide and conquer” water molecules during electrolysis, a process where electricity runs between two electrodes to split H2O molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gases which appear as bubbles.
“The electrical output of the electrolysis with sound waves was about 14 times greater than electrolysis without them, for a given input voltage. This was equivalent to the amount of hydrogen produced,” RMIT engineering PhD researcher Yemima Ehrnst said.
The research, published in journal Advanced Energy Materials, is also consequential for bringing down green hydrogen’s production costs.
“One of the main challenges of electrolysis is the high cost of electrode materials used, such as platinum or iridium,” RMIT Associate Professor and research lead Amgad Rezk said. By using sound waves to unlock more hydrogen, Rezk says it “eliminates” the need for expensive and corrosive materials like platinum or iridium.
“As water is not a corrosive electrolyte, we can use much cheaper electrode materials such as silver.”
The use of sound waves also prevented the build-up of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles on the electrodes, Ehrnst said, which greatly improved conductivity and stability.
RMIT Professor Leslie Yeo, a lead senior researcher on the project, said the discovery opens the door to using this new acoustic platform for other applications, especially where bubble build-up on the electrodes was a challenge.
“Our ability to suppress bubble build-up on the electrodes and rapidly remove them through high-frequency vibrations represents a major advance for electrode conductivity and stability,” Professor Yeo said.
“With our method, we can potentially improve the conversion efficiency leading to a net-positive energy saving of 27%.”
A provisional patent application has already been filed for the technology, though the team notes they still need to overcome challenges around integrating the sound wave innovation with existing electrolysers to scale up the work.
“We are keen to collaborate with industry partners to boost and complement their existing electrolyser technology and integrate into existing processes and systems,” Professor Yeo said.
Authors of the research include Yemima Ehrnst, Amgad Rezk and Leslie Yeo from RMIT and Peter Sherrell from the University of Melbourne.

Hithium and Sun Valley say they intend to explore “various forms of cooperation” on eight solar farms either in the construction or planning stages, with the announcement referring to a total capacity of 200 MW / 400 MWh under construction and 400 MW / 800 MWh in planning. It isn’t entirely clear if the projects under construction were always going to be hybrid (solar plus storage) projects or whether the MWh capacity here refers to the intention of Hithium agreement and will involve retrofitting.
No further information on the eight projects, including their locations, was included in the announcement.
The announcement does refer to “leveraging” Hithium products so Sun Valley can deliver safer storage projects, while the partnership marks an “in” for Hithium into the Australian storage market.
Hithium, founded in 2019 and specialises in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry. The company launched a new series of batteries in September of this year, and says it is targeting 135 GWh of annual battery production capacity by 2025. It currently has a manufacturing facility in Xiamen City, Fujian Province and says another plant in Chongqing will be ready in the “near future.”
Sun Valley HK Group is a solar farm developer, although there is limited information on the company online, and it doesn’t appear to have a website. According to business databases, the company was registered in 2015, but only registered for GST in July.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/13/more-cfos-will-soon-oversee-supply-chain-management-to-prevent-cost-blowouts/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",More CFOs will soon oversee supply chain management to prevent cost blowouts,"The Australian mining, manufacturing, construction and services industries consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.6% from June 2021 to June 2022. This is the biggest increase since 2008 off the back of the global financial crisis. Supply constraints for building materials and metals, a decrease in global crude oil supplies, high freight costs and labour shortages are all contributing to uncertainty with the planning and delivery of megaprojects.
As a result, I believe CFOs will, through necessity, become more involved in supply chain management in the current volatile market of inflated costs. When calculating the value of a project, CFOs have traditionally provided a fixed capital cost to the market. However, they must start normalising the concept of communicating a variable cost on projects to stakeholders – and will need to manage cost expectations ongoing by overseeing supply chain management.
Decarbonisation will be another driving influence on the CFO role. With sustainability and net zero targets at the forefront of the mining and minerals sector’s key priorities, CFOs are becoming more actively involved across their supply chains to also gain greater control over manufacturing processes and materials. 
Australia’s export revenue of lithium concentrates increased by 1,189% in the year to June 2022. These astronomic price increases are seeing CFOs becoming more directly involved with their suppliers and customers. For example, Elon Musk recently announced the possibility of Tesla becoming directly involved in lithium mining and refining business because the cost of metal – a key component in manufacturing batteries – has become so high. Similarly, Liontown Resources, an emerging battery minerals producer in WA, recently signed agreements to supply lithium concentrate to Tesla and Ford Motor Co.
A long-term trend I foresee is CFOs involving themselves across the entire project value chain. This will include procurement and supply chain policies. This will be a strategic advantage for organisations, to ensure costs expectations are met and the entire supply chain is green or carbon neutral.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/13/customisable-sticker-to-turn-solar-panels-into-advertising-billboards/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 13, 2022",Customisable sticker to turn solar panels into advertising billboards,"From pv magazine Global
Italian startup Sunspeker has developed a customisable, fully recyclable sticker to wrap photovoltaic panels.
The company recently secured €115,000 ($180,000) in funding from Italian state-run investment bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) to bring its new technology to market.
“Our new product is intended at creating an all-in-one digital screen powered by photovoltaics,” CEO Fabrizio Chiara told pv magazine. “Every solar panel is potentially an advertising space with Sunspeker’s sticker.”
The company says the stickers can replicate high-definition images while remaining permeable to light. This reportedly ensures that the modules retain between 80% and 90% of their efficiency.
“The loss in power yield can be compensated by the gains coming from ad campaigns,” Chiara said. “Ads of this kind may also be sold at a higher price given the sustainability of the billboards.”
The images processed using Sunspeker’s patented process reportedly maintain a high rate of transparency.
“However, as a matter of aesthetic impact, in some cases, the energy efficiency is reduced to 80% so that the solar panel can be more integrated into the environment,” Chiara said. “Currently, we are working to create standard conditions to allow us to scale with some different aesthetic solutions to cover the majority of the cases.”
The adhesive film for the aesthetic covers is a thermoplastic that was developed for outdoor applications. The company said that in the R&D process it focused on sustainability. It sought a solution that was fully recyclable, in line with circular economic principles.
The solar screen technology is still under development and has a “level-six technology readiness level” (TRL 6). The TRL measures the maturity of technology components in a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing the most mature technologies for full commercial application.
The company manufactured the final product and is now ready to commercialise it in Canavese, near Turin, northern Italy. It hopes to raise another €450,000 ($703,000) via new funding rounds. It said it is currently implementing the first pilot projects.
“In the Veneto region, at the end of November, we installed the first residential pilot project of the solar rooftop with a ’tile’ texture in partnership with Energy Saving, an energy company based in Treviso that believed in the Sunspeker mission and technology,” said Chiara.

Growatt has unveiled its new SPF 6000 ES Plus inverters for residential off-grid solar power systems.
“The inverter’s string input current reaches up to 16A, making it compatible with 500W+ large power PV modules,” the manufacturer said. “The inverter includes dual MPP trackers for houses with multiple rooftop areas, supporting panel installation at different orientations and higher energy generation.”
The 6 kW inverters have an efficiency rating of 93% and 12,000 VA of surge power. They also feature input voltage of up to 500 V and 8 kW of PV input power.
The inverters are housed in IP20 enclosures and measure 460 mm x 395 mm x 132 mm. They weigh 15.5 kg. Their operating ambient temperature ranges from 0 C to 50 C, with an integrated automatic transfer switch (ATS) and two AC terminals for power input.
“In terms of performance and reliability, the new product has a power factor of 1.0 that allows the system to draw a power output of 6kW for the loads and 2kW for charging the battery when solar energy is sufficient,” said the Chinese inverter maker. “Also, by adding the dust-proof design, it prevents faults caused by excessive dust and improves product reliability, making maintenance easier while extending its operational lifespan.”
