The program is the result of a ‘Shark Tank’-style competition which the CSIRO ran internally to gather ideas from its own researchers on how to reach its target of net zero emissions across its national property portfolio by 2030.

The winning idea, which is now being developed using internal funding, will see researchers test solar films over the next 18 months at glasshouses at the University of Queensland St Lucia site in Brisbane. The project is expected to conclude in early 2024.
The first solar films at St Lucia greenhouses have now been installed, the CSIRO said, and from  now until October, researchers in the CSIRO’s Agriculture and Food team will be working with the Manufacturing team to monitor plant growth and solar cell performance. The solar films use the CSIRO’s existing solar cell technology.

The teams want to assess the hypothesis that the solar films could enhance growth conditions through the manipulation of transmitted light waves.
This is not a new concept to the CSIRO, which has been involved in a joint project between itself, the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and Australian solar manufacturer, Tindo Solar. Launched in 2022, that project is seeking to develop specific semi-transparent agrivoltaic modules to be used in crop farming and greenhouses.
At the time, the project lead and UNSW Associate Professor, Ziv Hameiri, told pv magazine Australia the CSIRO’s Agriculture department had long been investigating the light conditions required by certain crops to grow the best produce.
Coming back to the internal CSIRO program, it said the findings from the St Lucia installation will be used to develop solar cells which are “optimised for plant growth,” with further testing in the field to follow.
A final report will look at plant growth and solar cell performance and calculate the potential emissions reduction if the technology were to be deployed in glasshouses across CSIRO, it said.

The team includes researchers Anthony Chesman, Mei Gao and Doojin Vak from the CSIRO’s Manufacturing division and Cathryn O’Sullivan from Agriculture and Food.
A number of solar projects in Australia and the rest of the world have deployed traditional solar modules on animal grazing farms. Outcomes from the projects have proven promising, with the CSIRO classing the practice “well established.”
“However, the use of PV technologies on closed cropping areas, such as glasshouses, is less well developed,” the CSIRO noted. “Meanwhile, the effect of shading on different crop species is yet to be fully understood.”
Understanding the relationship, the CSIRO says, is pivotal as the globe’s changing climate will see droughts and heatwaves become more frequent. Closed cropping areas like green- or glasshouses shield crops from tumultuous weather by controlling temperature, humidity and light levels, with the CSIRO concluding their use will become evermore important.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/20/flywheel-mechanical-battery-with-32-kwh-of-storage-installed-in-wa-property/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 20, 2023",Flywheel mechanical battery with 32 kWh of storage installed in WA property,"New South Wales startup Key Energy has installed a 8 kW / 32 kWh three-phase flywheel mechanical energy storage system at a property in the Sawyers Valley, just east of the Western Australian capital, Perth.
The installation involved a single flywheel, which stores energy mechanically meaning it has no fire risks, can run around 11,000 cycles without capacity degradation and boasts a 20 to 30 year lifespan. While these systems have low energy density, they are substantially more durable than lithium-ion based chemical batteries.

This was a major drawcard for the owner of the Sawyers Valley property, who wanted a system that did not pose a fire risk, could power their three-phase loads and provide energy security as blackouts frequently affect the area.
The project marks Key Energy’s fourth installation, with another two expected to be commissioned this year. In total, the company has installed around 16 flywheel systems with over 300 kWh of capacity, including at a boarding school and at gas company APA Group’s commercial off-grid device stations.
From Key Energy website 2023
Key Energy says it aims to leverage this residential flywheel installation, as well as future projects, to qualify its technology for WA’s Stand Alone Power System (SAPS) program, run by state-owned utilities Western Power and Horizon Power. The program is part of the state’s broad strategy to replace its stringy regional network of poles and wires with renewable standalone alternatives, which usually include a solar array, battery and last-resort diesel generator. These systems have been found by the state to be far cheaper and significantly reduce carbon emissions.
Flywheel battery systems are usually installed underground – a lengthy and costly process. Key Energy previously worked with the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) to develop an above-ground enclosure for its storage systems. Key Energy says this has allowed it to shorten install times from one to two weeks with underground systems to just two days in the Sawyers Valley project.

Key Energy says it is also developing additional functionality for the flywheel, paving the way for Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) which it believes could capitalise on the flywheel system’s robust cycling characteristics and long lifespan.
Key energy, founded in 2018, is based in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale and has a test site in nearby Alexandria. Since launching, it has attracted funding from the NSW government, City of Sydney and Energy Lab.
Key Energy’s flywheels are sourced from US-headquartered company Amber Kinetics, though the rest of the battery system is believed to be manufactured in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/20/neoen-wins-was-collie-big-battery-tender-moves-into-long-duration-storage-market/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LEGAL,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 20, 2023","Neoen wins WA’s Collie big battery tender, moves into long-duration storage market","After recently being granted development approval for a 1 GW / 4 GWh big battery in Collie in Western Australia’s southwest, Neoen has today announced its contract with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide almost all of the project’s Stage 1 capacity to help smooth the state’s solar duck curve.
While the Collie battery will likely grow, the project will start out with 219 MW / 877 MWh of capacity. Of this, 197 MW of storage capacity for 4 hours will be contracted to AEMO, with the agreement seemingly mandating the battery charge during the day when solar generation is at its highest, and discharge during the evening peak demand.
With this contract under its belt, Neoen has now given the green light to technology partner Tesla and construction contractor UGL, owned by CIMIC Group, to start construction for Stage 1. Neoen has said Stage 1 is expected to be operational in Q4, 2024, but given the AEMO contract kicks into effect from October 1, 2024, this would appear to be a hard deadline.
A spokesperson for Neoen told pv magazine Australia it opted to size the battery with more capacity, 22 MW over the contracted 197 MW, to provide “reasonable buffer” to ensure the contracted power will be delivered at the point of connection.

The Collie battery is Neoen’s first long-duration (4-hour) battery anywhere in the world, and the company has flagged it is now actively looking to cater to this market. It is Neoen’s sixth big battery in Australia and will consist of 224 Tesla Megapack 2XL units.
The Collie battery will connect to Western Australia’s islanded grid, known as the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), providing system security as the state aims to close its coal-fired power stations before 2030.
Hailed as another ‘first’ in terms of achieving an innovative battery storage agreement, Neoen was awarded the contact in a competitive tender initiated by the Western Australian Coordinator of Energy.
Neoen originated the Collie big battery project in 2021, however, receiving development approval for a total of 1 GW / 4 GWh in December 2022.

Titled a Non-Co-optimised Essential System Services (NCESS) contract, Neoen’s agreement with AEMO will run for a period of two years, until October 1, 2026. It is not clear if the contract includes an extension clause.
It seems the contract hinges on charge and discharge times, basically mandating the battery act as a giant solar sponge for the WA grid – which has incredibly high penetrations of rooftop solar. The battery then becomes an antidote to the state’s growing solar duck curve, while also preparing it to wean off coal.
No financial details of the contract have been made public, but in a separate release Neoen upped its expected earnings in 2025 from €600 million ($962 million) to €700 million ($1.12 billion), citing the Collie battery contract as the reason.
Collie, approximately 200km south of Perth, has been powering WA with its two coal mines and power stations since the 1880s. Last year, however, the state government announced it would close these two plants before 2030, with the 854 MW Muja plant slated for retirement by October 2029, and the 340 MW Collie plant in October 2027.

Following the closure of these two power stations, the only remaining coal-fired power plant in WA will be the privately owned Bluewaters generator, also near Collie.
Collie has become a focal point for governments in WA as they seek to provide the historic energy hub with a just transition. Funding has poured into the district, including the state government’s $662 million (USD 450 million) funding boost to entice new and emerging industry into the district. A number of renewable energy and technology companies have taken up the offer.
According to people familiar with the situation, community acceptance for Collie’s energy transition program remains mixed, especially among former coal workers. Jobs in renewables are not permanent, pay less and require greater skillsets than jobs in coal mining and power stations. 
The Collie big battery, for instance, will produce 120 jobs during construction. The number of ongoing jobs will be a tiny fraction of that.
Neoen noted the project will co-design its annual community benefit-sharing program with the local community.
The battery is to be built on a 31-hectare site about 12 kilometres northeast of Collie and will connect into the transmission network via the nearby Shotts Terminal substation.

Neon has previously said the project will be constructed in 200 MW / 800 MWh stages “to meet the progressive increase in demand for energy storage.”
It seems the company is proceeding with a slight variation on this, with Stage 1 constructing slightly more at 219 MW / 877 MWh of capacity.
Western Australia’s Energy Minister Bill Johnston welcomed the news saying: “While the WA government is replacing its coal-fired energy capacity with renewable infrastructure through Synergy, it is also critical for the private sector to take up the opportunity of participating and benefitting from the state’s energy transition.”
“It [the Collie big battery] will complement Synergy’s new battery at Kwinana and the $2.3 billion investment announced in the recent State Budget for further battery storage capacity in the SWIS.”
The Collie project brings Neoen’s total Australian storage assets to over 1.1 GW in operation or under construction. Neoen is far and away Australia’s largest battery developer and operator. Given the company’s total global storage portfolio sits at 1.3 GW, Australia is clearly the company’s key battery market.
Neoen owns and operates the 300 MW / 450 MWh Victorian Big Battery in Geelong and the 150 MW / 193.5 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia (SA). Its 100 MW / 200 MWh Capital Battery in the ACT, 200 MW / 400 MWh Blyth Battery in SA, and the 200 MW / 400 MWh Western Downs Battery in Queensland are all currently under construction.

Recent studies have proposed using solar-plus-storage microgrids to minimise public safety concerns from power shutoffs (PSPS) during the wildfire season for communities located in wildland-urban interfaces, such as California and much of the US west coast.
A comprehensive assessment of microgrids had not been performed to evaluate the potential to enhance resilience for up to 46 million Americans living next to forests, or a wildland-urban interface, where wildfire risk is acute.
To address this research gap, a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory looked at a novel modelling framework and assessed the potential of solar and batteries for districts where power can be turned off based on wildfire warnings.
LBNL’s modelling framework consists of:
LBNL defines a microgrid as a controllable and localized energy grid that could be disconnected from the regional grid and operate independently.
An optimization tool was introduced to model microgrids in forest-bordering regions, and subsequently, an assessment was performed focusing on seven localities in California with different climate conditions.

China-based module manufacturer Canadian Solar is presenting its 700 W bifacial TOPCon solar modules this week at Intersolar Europe in Munich, Germany.
The TOPBiHiKu7 panels feature 210 mm cells and are available in six versions, with nominal power ranging from 675 W to 700 W, and a power conversion efficiency of 21.7% to 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage ranges from 46.9 V to 47.9 V and the short-circuit current is 18.24 A to 18.49 A. They have an efficiency range of 26.1% to 27.0%, with a bifacial gain of 20%.
“Canadian Solar’s TOPCon modules will increase the energy yield of PV systems and deliver one of the most competitive balance of system (BOS) cost savings and levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar power plants, compared to PERC modules,” said the company.
The double-glass panels measure 2,384 x 1,303 x 33 mm and weigh 37.8 kg. They feature 2.0 mm heat-strengthened glass, with anti-reflective coating and another 2.0 mm glass layer at the back. The modules have IP68 junction boxes and anodized aluminium alloy frames. They can operate with a system voltage of 1,500 V and in temperatures ranging between -40 C and 85 C.
The temperature coefficient is -0.29% per degree Celsius. Canadian Solar claims that this ensures “better performance under hot environments compared to the mainstream products in the market.”
The PV panels come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. Annual linear degradation over 30 years is 0.4%, while degradation over the first year is capped at 1.0%.
In December 2022, Canadian Solar said that it would begin mass production of TOPCon solar modules by the first quarter of 2023.
