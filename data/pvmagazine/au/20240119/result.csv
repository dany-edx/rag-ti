Energy Policy WA’s Coordinator of Energy has recently adopted a four-hour BESS as the reference technology for benchmark reserve capacity (BRCP), a change from the previous reference technology of an open-cycle gas turbine.
The government said a 200 MW / 800 MWh battery, with a 330 kV connection was selected as the new benchmark technology, allowing for a four-hour battery to receive 100% of the reserve capacity payments (RCP).
The reserve capacity mechanism is designed to ensure that there is adequate generation capacity available in WA’s Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) to meet forecast peak electricity demand. The mechanism is unique to WA.
Frontier said the RCPs for an 80 MW four-hour capacity battery are forecast to generate approximately $24 million (USD 15.73 million) in revenue in 2026/27.
The Perth-based company said combining solar with battery energy storage provided the strongest financial returns with the lowest capital commitment, while also offering a lower technical risk compared to alternatives.
“Integrating battery capacity enhances the project’s returns, compared to solar alone, through increased revenue from reserve capacity payments (RCPs), energy storage arbitrage, and reducing curtailment,” the company said.
Frontier Chief Executive Officer Adam Kiley said including the battery in the first stage of the Waroona project, being developed near the town of the same name about 120 kilometres south of state capital Perth, makes financial sense.
“Batteries have always been considered by the company, as it is logical to store solar energy generated during low-priced periods for dispatch during higher priced periods,” he said.
“Including this at the project now makes financial sense, given changes to BRCP payments, whilst capital costs and efficiency of batteries have also improved significantly.”
Kiley said including the battery would mean only minimal delay in the release of the definitive feasibility study (DFS) which is expected to be announced in February. Frontier is working towards a final investment decision (FID) and construction during 2024.
The Waroona project, which has approvals in place for 241 MW of solar, is being developed adjacent to Frontier’s Energy’s Bristol Springs project which has development approvals for 355 MW of solar generation.
The development of a solar plant is a key element of the company’s long-term strategy to build a renewable energy hub that also includes green hydrogen production, as well as green hydrogen consumption in a hydrogen-fuelled peaking power plant.
Frontier’s plans have however received a set back with the project not advancing to the next stage of the federal government’s Hydrogen Headstart program which is provides $2 billion in funding to support large-scale renewable hydrogen production projects.
Kiley said it was disappointing to not advance to the next stage of the program, but the company remains “committed to this sector in the long term and will continue to assess future opportunities to add further renewable energy capability to the project.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/19/tasmanian-hydrogen-hub-locks-in-70-million-federal-funding-boost/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 19, 2024",Tasmanian hydrogen hub locks in $70 million federal funding boost,"The federal government has struck an agreement with the Tasmanian government to invest $70 million to develop a green hydrogen production hub capable of delivering up to 45,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen a year at Bell Bay. The total investment in the hub will be at least $300 million with the state government committing $230 million.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the investment, first announced in 2022, will support renewable hydrogen production which is vital to Australia’s future as a green energy exporter and green manufacturing nation.
“Investing in an Australian renewable hydrogen industry is investing in Australia’s future to become a renewable energy superpower,” he said. “This hub will provide jobs, support new manufacturing and spur investment in regional Australia as the world decarbonises.”
Tasmanian Energy Minister Nick Duigan said the funding will kick-start the project by financing shared-use infrastructure needed to support hydrogen production and exports at scale such as port facilities, water supply and the electricity network.
“Developing common infrastructure is a key step in bringing on one or more proponents to build the production facilities required to move Tasmania into the green hydrogen and future fuels economy,” he said.
“Bell Bay’s advantages in water, wind and infrastructure mean we are in the box seat to become one of Australia’s first major green hydrogen and future fuel producers.”
Duigan said the next stage will include speaking with proponents in a bid to secure “anchor tenants” for the hub.
Energy majors Fortescue, Woodside and Origin are among the companies that have targeted Bell Bay for projects involving green hydrogen or ammonia. Other Bell Bay aspirants include Countrywide Hydrogen, Line Hydrogen and Australian firm Abel Energy which is working in partnership with Spanish energy giant Iberdrola.
The funding for the Bell Bay Hydrogen Hub is part of more than $500 million in Commonwealth funding for hydrogen hubs in regional centres like Kwinana and the Pilbara in Western Australia, Gladstone and Townsville in Queensland, Port Bonython in South Australia and the Hunter region in New South Wales (NSW).
In addition to the hydrogen hub funding, Bowen also announced a like-for-like investment with the Tasmanian government of $8.3 million each toward energy upgrades for social housing.
The announcement follows a NSW state and federal energy upgrade commitment earlier this week of $206 million for social housing in that state.
More than 1,600 Tasmanian social housing residents are to receive energy upgrades through the Homes Tasmania Energy Efficiency Program.
The rollout of funds is part of the federal government’s $1.7 billion Energy Savings Package, $300 million of which is helping to fund upgrades for up to 60,000 social housing properties across the country.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/19/brisbane-airport-approaching-completion-of-1-2-mw-rooftop-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",ALEISHA HEY,"JANUARY 19, 2024",Brisbane Airport approaching completion of 1.2 MW rooftop system,"Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) said the rooftop solar system being fitted to logistics and delivery company Aramex Australia’s new 26,120sqm warehouse is nearing completion with the last of the 3,890 PV panels to be installed by the end of next month.
BAC said a 26-person installation team has already deployed 2,300 solar panels across a 13,000sqm section of the Aramex warehouse roof in the new Airport Industrial Park. Due to height restrictions associated with flight paths, the team has had to walk the individual panels to the installation area but the last of the panels is expected to be installed by the end of February. The project also includes approximately 28 kilometres of cable.
Once operational, the system is expected to generate more than 5 MWh of clean energy per day,
BAC, which operates its own electricity distribution network across Brisbane Airport, supplying more than 500 businesses with power, said the system will add to its sustainability credentials, with approximately 6,000 PV panels already fitted to the rooftops of six recent major developments. This is in addition to a further 18,000 solar panels already in operation across the airport with more on the way.
BAC is already producing solar energy from a 5.7 MW solar system that was installed in 2019. The existing system generates close to 18% of the company’s annual energy consumption.
BAC has also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland government-owned energy generator Stanwell for the supply of up to 185 GWh of renewable energy a year to help power the airport’s operations.
The corporation said the six-year PPA has allowed BAC to accelerate its sustainability goal of net zero by 2025, by 25 years.

Lithium metal batteries could offer far better energy density and much lower weight than lithium-ion technology thanks to the replacement of heavier graphite with lithium metal as anode. However, one of the biggest challenges in the design of these batteries is the formation of dendrites on the anode’s surface, causing the battery to rapidly degrade, short, and even catch fire.
Researchers at Boston’s Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a new lithium metal battery that they say can withstand at least 6,000 charging cycles and can be recharged in a matter of minutes.
Their research not only describes a new way to make solid state batteries with a lithium metal anode but also offers new understanding into the interface reaction between lithium and materials at the anode in these type of batteries.
“Lithium metal anode batteries are considered the holy grail of batteries because they have ten times the capacity of commercial graphite anodes and could drastically increase the driving distance of electric vehicles,” said Xin Li, Associate Professor of Materials Science at SEAS and senior author of the paper. “Our research is an important step toward more practical solid-state batteries for industrial and commercial applications.”
In 2021, Li and his team offered one way to deal with dendrites by designing a multilayer battery that sandwiched different materials of varying stabilities between the anode and cathode. This multilayer, multi-material design prevented the penetration of lithium dendrites not by stopping them altogether, but rather by controlling and containing them.
In the new research, Li and his team stop dendrites from forming by using micron-sized silicon particles in the anode to constrict the lithiation reaction and facilitate homogeneous plating of a thick layer of lithium metal.
In this design, when lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode during charging, the lithiation reaction is constricted at the shallow surface and the ions attach to the surface of the silicon particle but do not penetrate further.
“In our design, lithium metal gets wrapped around the silicon particle, like a hard chocolate shell around a hazelnut core in a chocolate truffle,” said Li.
These coated particles create a homogenous surface across which the current density is evenly distributed, preventing the growth of dendrites. And, because plating and stripping can happen quickly on an even surface, the battery can recharge in only about 10 minutes.
The researchers built a postage stamp-sized pouch cell version of the battery, which is 10 to 20 times larger than the coin cell made in most university labs. The battery retained 80% of its capacity after 6,000 cycles, outperforming other pouch cell batteries on the market today, the reserchers reported in Fast cycling of lithium metal in solid-state batteries by constriction-susceptible anode materials published in nature materials.
The technology has been licensed through Harvard Office of Technology Development to Adden Energy, a Harvard spinoff company cofounded by Li and three Harvard alumni. The company has scaled up the technology to build a smart phone-sized pouch cell battery.
Li and his team also characterised the properties that allow silicon to constrict the diffusion of lithium to facilitate the dynamic process favoring homogeneous plating of thick lithium. They then defined a unique property descriptor to describe such a process and computed it for all known inorganic materials. In doing so, the team revealed dozens of other materials that could potentially yield similar performance.
“Previous research had found that other materials, including silver, could serve as good materials at the anode for solid state batteries,” said Li. “Our research explains one possible underlying mechanism of the process and provides a pathway to identify new materials for battery design.”
