Federal Labor’s Powering Australia Plan would see renewable capacity grow to 26 GW, or 82% of all National Electricity Market (NEM) generation by 2030. The plan also assumes that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up 89% of new car sales in Australia by the end of the decade.
Albanese officially announced the party’s climate goal after the shadow cabinet approved the policy on Friday morning, describing the plan as having the “most comprehensive modelling ever done for any policy by any opposition in Australia’s history since Federation”.
“For nearly a decade the Coalition has failed on energy policy, certainty, and Australia’s jobs opportunity,” he said.
“Less than a month after the biggest climate conference in world history Australia has been asked to try again when it comes to climate policy, after being ranked last in the world.
“The Morrison government is unable and unwilling to rise to this challenge. Labor will, and as we do, we will create jobs, economic opportunities across Regional Australia and cheap power.”

The plan is forecast to create 604,000 extra jobs by 2030, with 80% of them in regional Australia.
Labor said the plan will spur $76 billion of investment and cut power bills for families and businesses by $275 a year for homes by 2025, compared to today.
“Australian business is leading. It is time that the Australian government caught up,” Albanese said.
“What we have done here and we are announcing today is good policy consistent with (net) zero (emissions) by 2050.”
Labor’s 43% by 2030 emissions reduction target is weaker than the 45% cut the Opposition took to the 2019 poll and what the Business Council of Australia has called for but exceeds the forecasted 35% reduction put forward by Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the Glasgow summit last month.
Australian Conservation Foundation’s chief executive officer Kelly O’Shanassy said Labor’s plan has laid the groundwork for a solid climate policy, but it needs to go further.
“It envisages an Australia powered by renewable energy where transport does not pollute – and it sets out ways to drive the change that’s needed to get us to this future,” she said.
O’Shanassy said the plan is “strong on renewables” but the emissions reduction target “should be stronger, because all the science says action to cut emissions this decade is crucial”.
Greenpeace Australia Pacific program director Kate Smolski was also critical of the plan, saying it was a missed opportunity to effectively tackle the climate crisis.
“In the midst of a climate crisis, with Australians across the country crying out for stronger climate leadership, the Federal Labor party has produced a timid emissions reduction policy that falls far short of what this country needs to avoid climate catastrophe,” she said.
“The test for Labor is not whether they can promise something a bit better than one of the worst performing governments on climate action in the world. The test for Labor is whether they can meet the urgent need to secure the future of the Australian nation and act fast to reduce the sources of pollution that are driving global warming.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/03/commercial-returns-on-vpps-proven-as-expanded-program-adds-more-sophisticated-features/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",Commercial returns on VPPs ‘proven’ as expanded program adds more sophisticated features,"Simply Energy, the retail branch of French energy giant Engie, will be expanding its Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program from late January next year to customers in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. It will also now include batteries and solar inverters from AlphaESS, Eguana, SolarEdge, SolaX, sonnen, and Varta, while continuing to support Tesla. Additional customers in South Australia will also be invited to join the VPP after numbers there had previously been capped.
VPPs essentially aggregate fleets of residential batteries, combining their capacity so they are able to meaningfully trade on energy spot markets and the frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) market. In doing so, they provide greater returns to households with batteries, with Ryan Wavish, Simply Energy’s General Manager, describing VPPs as making “a significant dent in the affordability of [battery and other renewable] technology.”
Simply Energy’s VPP expansion follows a successful pilot run by the company in South Australia from 2018, which was supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and was built using New South Wales Energy management software company SwitchDin’s Stormcloud platform.
The expanded VPP offer will continue to use this technology, with SwitchDin’s CEO and founder, Andrew Mears, telling pv magazine Australia it will soon integrate forecasting capabilities into program after identifying export constraints and battery capacity as issues affecting the optimisation of VPP technology.
Alongside its Stormcloud platform, SwitchDin coordinates Simply Energy’s VPP with its gateway Droplet device which communicates directly with the household’s battery and inverter, allowing it to “provide optimising control of the assets in order to prove the way it works,” Mears said.
Using SwitchDin’s technology, the VPP will soon begin tracking household’s solar pv system output and forecasting a day ahead how much solar to expect. It will also provide a forward estimate of the household’s consumption as well as market pricing. These new features, which are just coming into the platform now, seek to smooth out issues around the “firmness” of the battery fleets’ response, which the companies became aware of during the pilot. 
“So you can actually anticipate in advance the sort of situation… and make the best choice on what’s going to deliver the most value,” Mears said. Unlike Discover Energy, which also runs a VPP program across the east and soon west of Australia, Simply Energy has not come up against significant connectivity issues, showing the diversity of hiccups the different platforms are coming up against.
While Wavish said Simply Energy’s South Australian pilot, which received $7 million in financial support from ARENA and cost a total of $24 million, “proved” the  unsubsidised commercial return on VPP services, the technology is indeed still maturing.
Earlier this week, the Western Australian government launched its $35 million VPP program, illustrating that while these platforms already make financial sense for industry, there is still work to be done to ensure VPP activity with network capacity coordinate in ways which are helpful to both. 
This, Wavish says, is the reasoning behind this concurrent push into VPPs from both an industry and governmental position, with the GM noting that what government’s are currently investing in goes far beyond the VPP platform and into the realm of advanced coordination. “Things like dynamic operating envelopes and other more sophisticated layers of management are coming into these trials now,” he said.
“The trials now are sort of looking to make sure by the time these VPPs have grown and they’re at a significant scale, that the technology is available to ensure they interact with the grid in the most optimal way.”
In South Australia, Simply Energy’s VPP pilot drew in 1350 customers and boasted a capacity of just over 6 MW. It is hoping in 2022 each of its three new locations will be able to command 1 MW of capacity before the year’s end, enabling it to trade on the all important FCAS service market, which has proven the most lucrative.
Simply Energy is also planning to integrate community batteries into their residential VPP fleet. The company has two publicly announced community battery projects in Victoria, one with United Energy involving 42 pole mounted batteries and the other with PowerCor. This will grow the company’s fleet significantly as community batteries tend to be many times the capacity of those installed in private households. “So it grows our fleet, but it also services customers that don’t necessarily have their own battery,” Wavish said.
This new development, however, is really just the first step, according to SwitchDin founder Andrew Mears. “There’s more to come – electric vehicles are going to be key in this picture,” he said. “Bringing these together into a VPP offer is really a great way of stacking different value and bringing economies of scale into the delivery of residential energy services.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/03/australian-solar-module-manufacturer-commits-to-recycling-strategy/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",Australian solar module manufacturer commits to recycling strategy,"Australian solar panel manufacturer Tindo Solar has committed to a recycling strategy for decommissioned panels, teaming with Reclaim PV in a bid to combat the growing number of used modules which are going to landfill.
Australia has one of the highest uptakes of rooftop solar in the world, with more than 3 million homes now using solar panel power but an increasing number of modules are entering the waste stream as they reach their end of life while others are being discarded prematurely as technological advances increase efficiency and reduce costs of new modules.
Researchers from the University of South Australia have estimated that more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter the waste stream by 2035 and currently almost all expired or discarded solar panels in Australia go into landfill.
Tindo chief executive officer Shayne Jaenisch said it is imperative the industry address the issue, revealing the group’s installation business is removing hundreds of end-of-life panels  each month, replacing them with the company’s own panels.
Jaenisch said the number of faulty, non-performing and end-of-life solar panels coming off rooftops presented the company with an opportunity to direct the old panels to the recycling sector.
“We recognise that a fully sustainable energy system requires a solution for its waste product, which in our industry is disused panels,” he said.
“Reclaim PV’s processes allow for a whole-life cycle approach to solar panels, meaning they needn’t become landfill. It’s a really important development in the energy transition.”
Tindo’s commitment follows Environment Minister Sussan Ley’s announcement earlier this year that the solar manufacturing industry must produce a “clear timeline” for establishing an industry wide recycling strategy for end-of-life technology with the government determined to avoid what she labelled a looming “landfill nightmare”.

The minister said the solar industry needs to design and present a finalised industry-led product stewardship scheme by June 2022 with the nationwide scheme to be operational by June 2023.
Reclaim PV director and founder Clive Fleming said Australia already has a solar panel disposal challenge on its hands and there is a need to accelerate the end-to-end recovery and recycling of solar panels.
“The establishment of a national recovery and recycling network is an absolute necessity for the PV industry,” he said.
Reclaim PV has developed recycling facilities in Adelaide and Brisbane and is establishing a national network of collection locations for solar modules to be recycled at its plants.
The company’s recycling system comprises a three-stage process of manual separation, thermal separation, followed by a chemical process that sees about an estimated 98% of the solar panel recycled. The recovered aluminium, silicon, copper, silver and glass – as well as recovered glue constituents – are then re-used in the manufacture of new products.
The junction box accounts for the 2% of the panel that isn’t currently being recycled but Reclaim PV is working with researchers to develop a solution.
“Waste is never waste. It is a resource, and we just need to treat it as such,” Fleming said. “This is the key concept of the circular economy, that nothing is wasted, and everything is re-used as part of a continuous cycle. But this doesn’t work unless we’re all playing our part.”

Chinese manufacturer Jolywood has announced the start of operations at a utility scale PV project in Oman it has described as the “largest TOPCon solar plant in the world.”
Some 490 MW of the total 607 MW generation capacity of the Ibri II project consists of TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contact) bifacial solar panels supplied by Jolywood, the company said on Thursday.
Oman’s largest solar project, near Ibri, the capital of Dhahirah governorate, covers around 1,154 acres, cost US$400 million (AU$564 million) and began generating last month, according to Jolywood. It was developed by a consortium of Saudi Arabian, 50% state-owned developer ACWA Power, which will own half of the project; the Gulf Investment Corp owned by the governments of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi and the UAE, which will hold 40%; and clean energy developer Alternative Energy Projects Co (AEPC), in which the ruling family of Kuwait is the majority shareholder. The AEPC has a 10% stake. ACWA Power, on its website, describes the Ibri II project as costing US$395 million (AU$557 million) and having a generation capacity of 500 MWac and Jolywood, in May last year, described the facility as having a total capacity of 575 MW. In January, the company told pv magazine the project would have a total capacity of 500 MW.
The 1.3 TWh the facility is expected to generate annually will be bought by state entity the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company and should be able to power up to 33,000 homes in the sultanate.
Jolywood said it had been chosen to supply panels to the project because of its products’ ability to operate in harsh conditions including windy sand which can cause wind erosion, and huge temperature differences in desert areas.
The manufacturer said its J-TOPCon 2.0 Niwa solar module offers bifaciality of more than 80% and added, a third party which tested its equipment had certified the modules offered a 16% power output gain versus rival products operating in desert environments.
With a low temperature coefficient of -0.32%/W, Jolywood said its Niwa bifacial panels reduce degradation and risk caused by high operating temperatures so the module can operate normally at 70 degrees Celsius.
The Chinese business said it had worked with German brand Munich Re to offer a 12-year warranty for materials and workmanship and a 30-year linear performance guarantee.
Jolywood VP Liu Zhifeng said: “Although the construction schedule of the project was seriously affected by Covid-19, [the] Jolywood team [overcame] many difficulties and completed the delivery of customer products as [per] the agreement, and [provided] professional technical services and support for the project, so that the project was successfully put into operation [on] schedule.”
The solar manufacturer claims to have delivered more than 5 GW of TOPCon cells and modules, with 1 GW of them shipped to the Middle East.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/03/nera-gives-gegional-hydrogen-clusters-green-light/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",NERA gives gegional hydrogen ‘clusters’ green light,"Hydrogen ‘clusters’ in the north Queensland city of Townsville and the Gascoyne and Midwest regions of Western Australia (WA) will be supported under an initiative of the National Energy Resources Australia (NERA) network which aims to bring together local players to build skills and advance commercialisation opportunities in the nascent hydrogen industry.
The three new clusters will operate under the Hydrogen Technology Cluster Australia (H2TCA) program, an initiative of NERA, an industry-led not-for-profit organisation set up in 2015 as part of the federal government’s Industry Growth Centre initiative
The new hydrogen clusters, in Townsville in Queensland and in Carnarvon and Geraldton in WA, will join an existing network of 15 clusters across Australia.
NERA is seeking to turn H2TCA into a global identity and recognised brand for Australian hydrogen technology and expertise, providing seed-funding in partnership with governments and industry to pursue opportunities in the emerging hydrogen industry.
NERA chief executive officer Miranda Taylor said the addition of the three new clusters to the network is an important step in creating a globally competitive hydrogen industry.
“Today’s announcement is a crucial step for Australia in building the skills, capacities, technologies and commercialisation opportunities necessary to unlock Australia’s enormous potential to create a globally competitive hydrogen industry that could create thousands of jobs across regional Australia,” she said.
The cluster network is intended to reduce duplication and identify gaps in the development, deployment, and commercialisation of new hydrogen-focussed technologies.

Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the clusters would encourage innovation and the production of affordable clean hydrogen for use both in Australia and to export.
“These new clusters … will help accelerate hydrogen industry development by enabling vital connection, collaboration, and alignment of action across Australia,” he said.
“Encouraging innovation, and building capabilities, particularly in regional Australia, will help make Australian hydrogen supply chains the most attractive in the world.”
Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill welcomed the designation of the north Queensland city as a hydrogen cluster, but said federal funding is still required to get local proposed projects off the ground.
“Green hydrogen will be an energy of the future and Townsville and North Queensland is uniquely placed to be able to supply green hydrogen to both domestic and export markets,” she said.
“We have substantial suitable land and renewable energy capacity. We already have a number of proponents looking to develop hydrogen production facilities in the city including Ark Energy, Origin Energy and Edify Energy.
“Now … I hope the Australian Government will back this developing industry with the financial and other support it needs to achieve its full potential.”
The green hydrogen industry is expected to directly support 16,000 jobs by 2050, plus 13,000 jobs from the construction of related renewable energy infrastructure.
It is estimated Australian hydrogen production for export and domestic use could generate more than $50 billion in additional GDP by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/03/2-4-billion-battery-minerals-complex-granted-major-project-status/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 3, 2021",$2.4 billion battery minerals complex granted major project status,"Melbourne-based Sunrise Energy Metals has been granted Major Project Status for its $2.4 billion Sunrise Battery Materials Complex project, a nickel, cobalt and scandium project and battery materials processing and recycling facility being developed near Condobolin in Central West region of New South Wales (NSW).
The Sunrise project, near Fifield about 50 kilometres northeast of Condobolin, will produce high quality, battery grade nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphate, critical materials for the rapidly expanding lithium-ion battery market. The project will also produce scandium, a key ingredient in the next generation of lightweight aluminium alloys.
According to the company, the project has the potential to meet a significant portion of global demand for the raw materials needed in the lithium-ion battery industry.
Sunrise said the global lithium-ion battery market has grown at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years and even the most conservative estimates predict rapid growth over the next 10 years.
“The complex … is ideally placed to become a major supplier of raw materials to the lithium-ion battery market in the near future,” Sunrise said on its website.
“The market is experiencing significant growth as the electrification of vehicle drivetrains become increasingly practical and cost-effective, particularly compared with conventional fossil fuel powered vehicles.”
The awarding of Major Project Status will provide Sunrise with access to extra support, coordination, and information services from the Major Projects Facilitation Agency which acts as a single-entry point into the Australian Government regulatory approvals pathway.
Resources Minister Keith Pitt said the Sunrise project will help Australia take full advantage of our rich reserves of these key resources.
“Growth in the battery sector has fuelled demand for Australian nickel,” he said.
“Australia’s nickel exports are expected to grow more than 25% next year – from around 200,000 tonnes in 2020-21 to 256,000 tonnes in 2022-23 – on the back of global battery manufacturers looking to secure stable supplies of critical minerals.”

Located on the doorstep of the Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), the project is expected to be powered entirely by renewable energy, including large-scale solar.
Sunrise Energy Metals, formerly known as Clean TeQ, said it has completed a study which confirmed the availability and cost of renewable energy to supply the external power requirements for the project.
Sunrise said the majority of the project’s energy demand will likely be generated on-site with options including a behind the meter on-site solar array, and potentially battery energy storage, as well as renewable electricity sourced directly from the grid.
Sunrise said the use of renewables would eliminate about one third of the project’s total carbon emissions and would position the company as one of the world’s largest battery metals producers designed to run on 100% renewable power.
Over the first 25 years of operation, the approach is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 4.6 million tonnes.
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the Sunrise Battery Materials Complex project is expected to support more than 1,700 full-time jobs over the three-year engineering and construction phase and a further 380 jobs each year over the anticipated 50-year life of the project.
