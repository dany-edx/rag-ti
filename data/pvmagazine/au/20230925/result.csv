In a joint statement, the companies said the consolidation of the two adjoining projects across the Gabanintha orebody near Meekatharra provides a “unique” opportunity to realise operational and corporate synergies by creating a single integrated project.
AVL Chief Executive Officer Graham Arvidson said if successful, the transaction will “create a world-class asset of scale located in a tier-one mining jurisdiction.”
“The combination of Australian Vanadium and Technology Metals Australia is transformational for both companies and marks a significant milestone in both management teams’ efforts to develop their respective projects,” he said.
“The logical consolidation of two adjoining projects on the same orebody will unlock material synergies for both sets of shareholders.”
Arvidson said the transaction will “leverage the best of both organisations, including best-in-class technical work, assets and people, and will result in AVL becoming the leading force in the Australian vanadium sector.”

AVL said both of the mining projects are “significantly advanced” and will form part of its “pit to battery” strategy with the company aiming to turn the mined product into commercial vanadium battery electrolyte, catering to the rapidly expanding flow battery market.
The merger comes just weeks after AVL signed a new option agreement to purchase land for vanadium processing plant being developed at Tenindewa, near the port city of Geraldton.
TMA Managing Director Ian Prentice said the merger provides increased scale and scalability, with significant opportunities for expansion with the Gabanintha vanadium ore body “arguably one of the best undeveloped vanadium resources in the world.”
“This all comes at a pivotal time for the global vanadium industry as vanadium flow batteries are established as a critical player in the long-duration energy storage market, a key requirement for the world’s transition to net zero,” he said.
The scheme has been unanimously recommended by the Technology Metals board and the largest shareholder, Resource Capital Fund, has confirmed its intention to vote in favour.
AVL said it would also raise $15 million from a placement of new shares to support integration, ongoing project and corporate initiatives and general working capital and transaction costs.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/25/bze-backs-shared-infrastructure-to-slash-cost-of-clean-energy-shift/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023",BZE backs shared infrastructure to slash cost of clean energy shift,"A new report published by Beyond Zero Emissions (BZE) calls for the federal government to establish a national clean industry hub program to coordinate and accelerate investment in key renewable energy infrastructure to existing industrial regions.
BZE said regions such as Kwinana in Western Australia and Gladstone in Queensland already have clusters of industry keen to shift to using renewable energy and new modelling shows that building shared transmission lines and green hydrogen pipelines to service those industrial hubs would slash costs, substantially reduce transmission requirements and speed up regional decarbonisation.
BZE Chief Executive Officer Heidi Lee said the Melbourne-headquartered organisation has long advocated for government investment in 14 clean industry hubs around existing high-emitting industrial regions as an efficient investment of taxpayer money.
Industry in four of the proposed hubs – Gladstone, Kwinana, Hunter and Bell Bay – create nearly 25% of the total emissions under Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism that covers 215 of the country’s largest industrial operations.
“Government can coordinate investment into transmission, green hydrogen pipelines and other shared infrastructure in these regions, which will help high-emitting facilities switch to clean energy supply sooner,” she said.
“Hundreds of regional jobs, billions in economic output and hundreds of millions in government revenue can be created.”
The modelling, prepared by Acil Allen, shows that replacing five transmission lines of 100 MW capacity with one 500 MW capacity line can reduce cost by almost three-quarters or $798 million (USD 512.4 million) for a distance of 100 kilometres.
The report also investigates the cost savings associated with replacing five green hydrogen pipelines of 50 terajoules per day (TJ/day) capacity with one 250 TJ/day capacity pipeline, showing that capital costs can be reduced by almost 50%, or $1.2 billion over a 100 km distance.
BZE said building shared energy infrastructure in Gladstone could create an extra 200 jobs per year, an extra $2.4 billion in real economic output by 2050 and create an extra $600 million in government revenue by 2050.
A similar approach in Kwinana could create an extra 460 jobs per year, an extra $5 billion in real economic output by 2050, and an extra $850 million in government revenue.
Lee said coordinated investment into shared infrastructure can also incentivise industry to coordinate their energy demand and emission reduction plans efficiently.
“The modelling showed that funding clusters of facilities in Gladstone and Kwinana alone could deliver an additional 50 Mt reduction in emissions,” she said.

The $10 million grants program, unveiled earlier this year, has been designed to streamline the solar rebate process with home builders, developers and other companies that deploy solar products in a minimum of 50 new or existing homes as part of a single scheme, project, or development eligible to apply. The expressions of interest process will remain open until 24 November 2023.
It is anticipated the program will cover the installation of more than 8,300 solar systems and energy efficient hot water systems.
The state government said homeowners will receive the rebates as a cash saving through the installer which will be required to show evidence of completed installations to Solar Victoria before funds are allocated.
Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the program removes the need for installers to apply for individual rebates, making it easier than ever for Victorians to install solar products.
“This program is helping to accelerating the household transition to all-electric homes on a scale not yet seen in Australia,” she said.
The Residential Electrification Grants program is part of the state’s push towards all-electric homes, which also includes a ban on gas connections in new builds from 2024.

The proposed Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub includes a 250 MW hydrogen electrolyser facility, a 200 MW green hydrogen-fueled power station and storage capacity capable of holding 3,600 tonnes of hydrogen.
The South Australian government has previously said the initiative, which it expects will help unlock a $20 billion pipeline of renewable energy projects in the state, will be operational by December 2025.
The new grant agreement will be used to develop common-user infrastructure at Port Bonython such as upgrades to the deep-sea terminal, pipelines, storage facilities and access roads as it looks to transform the site into a multi-user export-focused precinct for green hydrogen.
South Australia Premier Peter Malinauskas said along with private sector funding, the redeveloped Port Bonython is expected to host projects worth about $13 billion and could generate up to 1.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.
“Our state is blessed with the key ingredients the world needs to decarbonise international economies – abundant coincident wind and solar resources, critical minerals, strong renewable energy penetration, and well-developed industrial hubs,” he said.
“We’re working closely with industry to maximise this opportunity to grow a new industry, which has potential to create thousands of jobs and improve the standard of living for South Australians for generations to come.”
The federal government has projected that by 2050 Australia’s hydrogen industry could generate $50 billion in additional GDP and create more than 16,000 jobs in regional Australia. The industry is also expected to create an additional 13,000 jobs from the construction of renewable energy infrastructure to power the hydrogen production.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this new funding commitment is all about making Australia a global leader in green hydrogen, as competition for clean energy investment accelerates around the world.
“The global shift to clean energy and decarbonised economies is a huge economic opportunity for Australia,” he said. “We are determined to grasp this opportunity.”

CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, has identified hydrogen seeps in PEL 691, an exploration permit awarded to H2EX in June 2022 in South Australia. “We now focus our attention to mapping the subsurface to identify commercial accumulations of natural hydrogen,” said H2EX CEO Mark Hanna. H2EX will deploy Space Technologies’ passive seismic sensors, with a survey scheduled for the fourth quarter.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that low-emission hydrogen represents less than 1% of global production and use, with ongoing low capacity and volumes due to developers awaiting government support amid rising costs. The IEA’s latest report warns of rising expenses threatening project profitability, due to global energy crises, high inflation, and supply chain disruptions. “This confluence of factors is particularly detrimental for an industry that faces high upfront costs related to equipment manufacturing, construction, and installation,” it said. China leads in hydrogen investments, with electrolyser capacity set to triple to 2GW by the end of 2023, with China contributing half.
Verdagy, an electrolyser company, has announced the opening of a new factory in Newark, California. It is set to manufacture advanced water electrolysers at scale in the United States starting in the first quarter of 2024. The company aims to achieve the US Department of Energy’s goal of USD 2/kg of levelised cost of hydrogen by 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/25/china-solar-cell-prices-hit-record-lows/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023",China solar cell prices hit record lows,"From pv magazine Global
Solar cell prices in China fell to their lowest values ever according to OPIS data. Mono M10 and Mono G12 cells both dipped more than 3% to USD 0.0865/W and USD 0.0856/W respectively, while TOPCon M10 cells notched 0.41% downwards to USD 0.0965/W.
The weak module market is largely to blame for cell price decreases, according to one source. Module plants without their own cell capacity have applied “many strategies to reduce production,” the source said. Mono PERC and TOPCon module prices are also at record lows, according to OPIS data.

Given that cell prices have fallen significantly, discussions are raging about whether cell makers will cut production. Some small makers are planning to halt operations over China’s Golden Week holiday at the start of October, reflecting a dim outlook for the cell market and marking a decline in cell output, an insider explained.
Others disagreed. If cell production is to fall, there should only be a slight decrease, a different source argued. “The overproduction of cells is not as bad relative to the entire supply chain,” the source said, referring to overproduction in the polysilicon, wafer and module segments.
For another source, lowering prices is the strategy by which cell makers maintain 100% operating rates. Whether the cell segment will cut output is strongly influenced by the rate at which wafer supply is growing and the manufacturing strategy of module manufacturers, he said.
“The decrease in module production may unavoidably compel a decrease in cell production by the end of October and the beginning of November,” the source also said, adding that end-users will reduce module purchasing orders because they have already arranged enough supply to support year-end solar installations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/25/goodwes-new-lightweight-pv-modules-now-on-rooftops/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",TRISTAN RAYNER,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2023",GoodWe’s new lightweight PV modules now on rooftops,"GoodWe is continuing to expand its product line successfully, with a 100kW lightweight solar rooftop project completed for Alspec, a NSW-based aluminium processing company.
Alspec, like many businesses, faces steep electricity price hikes, with the most recent 30% increase making it difficult for a company relying on aluminium alloy processing, cutting, welding, and coating, as it makes windows, doorframes, and more, in all types.
The rooftop for Alspec needed special products due to a new low-load bearing rooftop, meaning traditional solar panels couldn’t be installed. GoodWe’s Galaxy Series modules, rated at 315W and 2,116 mm × 777 mm × 4 mm and weigh 9 kg, or 5.6 kg per m2, which is around 50-60% lighter than a conventional panel. The project was coupled with GoodWe’s HT 100kW string inverters, with the system projected to cover 80% of Alspec’s electricity needs for production and operations.
The modules use an ultra-thin glass at 1.6mm thick to save on weight, with GoodWe saying it has strong hail and wind resistance, for durability and safety to buildings with all-weather protection. Depending on the installation, panels are glued or air welded to the roof, and in special cases, a bracket is also available that can be used. According to GoodWe’s warranty documents, the Galaxy Series has a 12-year warranty on product defects, and extends a 30-year power output guarantee based on the panel producing is no less than 82.05% of the nominal power output. The company has also expanded its product line to include specialised carport panels.
Apollo Chai, head of GoodWe Australian BIPV Marketing, stated, “We’re pleased to provide this smart BIPV solution for Alspec. GoodWe is committed to expanding our commercial and industrial solution portfolio, offering customised solutions tailored to our customers’ energy needs. We anticipate partnering with more business owners to reduce energy expenses and achieve energy savings and emission reductions.”
BIPV opportunities
Lightweight solar panels are becoming increasingly popular both in new builds and retrofits. The latter is especially the case with commercial and industrial applications, where existing roofs that cannot support the weight of traditional solar panels, such as older roofs, roofs with low load-bearing capacity, and roofs with complex shapes, are regularly found.
