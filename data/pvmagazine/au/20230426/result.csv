The Gladstone facility was initially meant to be producing polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers based on Plug Power’s technology, but the US company walked away from its FFI deal in January saying the economics didn’t stack up.
Despite the collapsed technology partnership, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has unveiled its first PEM electrolyser prototype. During an analysts briefing on Monday, April 24, CEO Mark Hutchinson revealed few details about the prototype and the technology it has been developed with, other than to say it was developed ‘in house.’ He added the company is “on track” to produce its own brand of electrolysers from the production line in the new Gladstone facility this year.
The Gladstone factory is still aiming to produce 2 GW of electrolyser capacity annually, though Hutchinson noted that ramping up to this capacity will take “a couple of years.”
The Gladstone factory’s automated production line and testing facilities are currently being fitted, FFI said.
Hutchinson also pointed out the prototype did not mean FFI would not be purchasing electrolysers from other companies. “Our need is going to be enormous globally,” he said. “So we have retained great relationships with all the suppliers around the world actually and we’ll be dealing with with different suppliers in different different situations around the world.”
The company is hoping to bring five green hydrogen-based projects to final investment decision (FID) this year. Those include:
Of these five projects, the Gibson Island plan is the most developed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/26/the-economics-are-outstanding-wa-battery-component-hopeful-buoyed-by-scoping-study/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 26, 2023",‘The economics are outstanding’: WA battery component hopeful buoyed by scoping study,"Graphite is a key component in battery anode material, which is ultimately responsible for holding and distributing charge in lithium-ion batteries. The overwhelming majority of processed graphite today comes from China – a situation some Australian companies are trying to shift.
And shift it they might, with a recent scoping study finding International Graphite’s proposed processing plant in the West Australian town of Collie could provide initial returns of between 41% to 48%.
As it stands, International Graphite is proposing to build its Collie Graphite Battery Anode Material (BAM) Facility in a modular fashion so that it can be completed in stages. The current flowsheet will see the company micronising, spheroidising and chemically purifying graphite to first produce  uncoated spheroidised purified graphite (USPG). This first USPG facility would then be expanded to involve carbon coating, ultimately producing coated spheroidised purified graphite (CSPG). 

The company forecasts the total capital cost to realise the USPG plant is approximately USD 87 million ($131 million) while its operations are forecast to deliver a pre-tax net present value of approximately USD 290 million ($440 million). This equates to an internal rate of return of 48%, the company said.
The total capital cost to realise the later stage coating plant is approximately USD 222 million ($336 million) and its operations are forecast to deliver a net present value of approximately USD 626 million ($947 million), for a return of approximately 41%.
“The economics are outstanding and there are many opportunities to improve the cost structure with further testwork,” CEO  Worland said.
This scoping study was based on International Graphite purchasing graphite concentrates from third party sources. In 2022, however, the company finalised its acquisition of the Springdale Graphite Project, a natural graphite mine roughly 450km from Collie. 

The company is ultimately planning to vertically integrate its business and use the output from the Springdale Graphite Project as the feedstock for the Collie downstream processing plant. “When we have advanced Springdale to a sufficient level of detail to allow forecasts to be published, we will be able to update the Scoping Study accordingly,” International Graphite’s Managing Director and CEO Andrew Worland said.
Buoyed by the promising results, International Graphite said: “We are working with a number of stakeholders in Collie to agree on site selection for the Collie Graphite BAM Facility to accommodate the initial graphite concentrate processing capacity of up to 40kt/y and potential further expansions.”

Collie is home to Western Australia’s soon-to-be retiring coal plants and the state government is pouring money into the region to help reposition it to become a clean energy centre. Former CEO of International Graphite, Neil Rinaldi, previously told pv magazine Australia it had chosen Collie for its processing plant on the promise of extremely cheap, green power.
International Graphite aims to have a definitive feasibility study for the Collie Graphite BAM Facility in the third quarter of 2024. “A final investment decision would be undertaken at the point at which the company considers it is suitably funded,” the company added.
International Graphite is not the only Australian company looking to become a BAM producer outside of China – South Australian company Renascor Resources is rapidly progressing its plans. It too is pursuing a vertically integrated business model, developing both a graphite mine and manufacturing facility in South Australia.
On Wednesday, it announced it is in the advanced stages of an updated and optimised Battery Anode Material Study to assess increasing the ambition and acceleration of its proposed Siviour Battery Anode Material Project. The move comes after Renascor received environmental approval from the government of South Australia for the project late last year.

Mytilineos says its investment will support the commencement of Stage 1 of the project to build a hydrogen generation facility exclusively powered by solar and targeting long haul trucks crossing one of the Australia’s busiest highways, the Hume Highway corridor.
Clara Energy’s final project plan for Rosedale is to develop a 800 MW solar farm and 560 MW hydrogen plant near Gundagai, which sits between Melbourne and Sydney on the Hume Highway.
The proposed facility aims to be able to produce enough green hydrogen to fuel 800 trucks each day, though a precise figure in tonnes has not been provided.
At Stage 1, the targeted solar capacity of the project is 250 MW while the hydrogen generation facility, Mytilineos said, “will produce enough hydrogen to be used by 200 trucks.”

It isn’t clear why the project is named the ‘Rosedale’ Green Hydrogen project since Clara Energy has previously been citing the town of Tarcutta for its project, with Mytilineos referring to Gundagai. Both Tarcutta and Gundagai are close to one another, but neither are close to Rosedales in New South Wales or Victoria. There is a Rosedale road in Gundagai however, which may be on the proposed site.
Mytilineos’ Australian portfolio of mostly solar assets now totals 400 MW, according to the company, which has repeated described Australia as a “key market” for its global strategy. Mytilineos said in January that its worldwide pipeline of solar and energy storage projects at various stages of development exceeds 4 GW.
The Rosedale Green Hydrogen project appears to be Mytilineos’ first foray into green hydrogen in Australia. Mytilineos’ Chief Executive Director of its energy branch, Ioannis Kalafatas, said of the Rosedale project: “We hope that this project in Australia will not be the only one and that we will soon have new projects.”
The project is seeking to cater to heavy haulage trucks – a sector which has recently seen some traction when it comes to hydrogen. Pepsi recently started trialling a hydrogen truck at one of its Brisbane manufacturing facilities. The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria, RACV, has also formed a partnership with a hydrogen truck maker and plans to soon bring a number of hydrogen fuel cell trucks into operations.

While hydrogen-powered vehicles look somewhat unlikely to break into the passenger car market – which is already dominated by electric vehicles – heavy haulage industries appear to have more promise. Hydrogen can offer these sectors rapid refuelling times and longer driving ranges.
The Rosedale Green Hydrogen project is being developed by Clara Energy. Clara in 2022 announced a partnership with Hydrogen Fuels Australia to build a green hydrogen distribution network along the Hume Highway corridor, worth $600 million (USD 396 million).
Under that agreement, Clara Energy is set to develop the green hydrogen production capacity, while Hydrogen Fuels Australia acts as distributor and station operator.
While it isn’t precisely said in the recent Mytilineos announcement, it appears the Rosedale Green Hydrogen project falls into the production side of this broader plan.
“We know the Hume is the busiest truck route in Australia and once the major logistics companies know there will be guaranteed supply of hydrogen at a commercially viable price, it will provide even greater confidence to accelerate the transition of their fleets,” Clara CEO Nick Cleary said at the time.
Clara is aiming to open the first hydrogen refuelling station around the Sydney–Melbourne midpoint in 2025, it said at the time. Under the partnership with Hydrogen Fuels Australia, it plans to develop another four hydrogen refuelling stations between Victoria and Sydney.

Fire crews were called at 12.36pm and attended site within 20 minutes, managing to bring the fire under control by 4.30pm, a Beryl Solar Farm spokesperson said.
The root cause of the fire is currently being investigated.
The damage assessment at the solar farm remains underway, a spokesperson for the project confirmed to pv magazine Australia. “But for the areas that we are confident are unaffected we are bring them back online today,” they added.

Ground conditions in central NSW have been impacted by the extended period of wet weather which, together with the recent high temperatures, resulted in the extension of the bushfire season to 30th April 2023, a Beryl Solar Farm (BSF) spokesperson said.
“BSF continuously monitors and maintains vegetation levels in line with NSW Rural Fire Service guidelines to mitigate fire risk.”
“This is the first incident of its kind at BSF and a thorough investigation is underway to investigate the root cause, while all the equipment remains isolated for safety reasons.”
“All plant personnel are safe and accounted for, the site has been secured, and there were no injuries,” the spokesperson added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/26/solis-unveils-hybrid-inverters-for-rooftop-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 26, 2023",Solis unveils hybrid inverters for rooftop applications,"From pv magazine Global
Solis has developed new hybrid inverters for residential PV and commercial and industrial (C&I) applications. The Chinese inverter supplier says the S6 series features added generator connections and control functions, making them particularly suited for markets that experience frequent power outages, such as South Africa.
“Solis has launched a new S6 Advanced Power Hybrid Inverter which combines solar generator and battery connectivity to liberate power-starved households and businesses in South Africa from the unpredictability of daily electrical outages,” said James Frank, Solis country manager for South Africa. “In particular, peak shaving control in both self-use and generator modes allow users to prioritise backup power for their most mission-critical loads more flexibly and cost-effectively.”
The inverters are available in five versions, with power outputs of 3 kW, 3.6 kW, 5 kW, 6 kW, and 8 kW. The first four versions measure 440 mm x 598 mm x 205 mm and weight 24 kg. The 8 kW inverter measures 437 mm x 675 mm x 215 mm and weighs 27 kg.
The new products have an efficiency rating of 97.5% and a European efficiency rating of 96.2%. They feature two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) points, with MPPT voltage range between 90 V to 500 V for the 3 kW and 3.6 kW versions, and up to 520 V for the more powerful versions.
The maximum input voltage is 600 V and the recommended maximum PV power ranges from 4.8 kW to 12.8 kW. Solis says the inverters support both single-phase and three-phase connections of up to 36 kW in parallel for the smaller devices and of up to 48 kW for the 8 kW inverter. The S6 series is compatible with lithium-ion or lead-acid batteries with battery voltage ranges of 40 V to 60 V.
The 8 kW device has a maximum charging and discharging current of 190A, to allow for incorporation of generators with multiple input methods and automatic on/off control.
“This flexibility avoids over-specifying higher capacity inverters, PV arrays, generators and batteries than necessarily required, with considerable capex and opex savings over our competition,” said Frank. “Thanks to an automatic UPS switching function and a 10-second, 200% surge overload capability, users can be confident of a seamless supply during grid interruptions, even for the most sensitive electronic equipment.”
The inverters have an operating temperature range of -40 C to 60 C and are IP66 rated.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/26/catl-launches-500-wh-kg-condensed-matter-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"APRIL 26, 2023",CATL launches 500 Wh/kg condensed matter battery,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese battery giant CATL on Wednesday unveiled a new ultra-high energy battery technology initially slated for aviation, and with an automotive cell under development.
The so-called “condensed matter” battery, a type of semi-solid state product with condensed electrolyte and new anode and separator materials, will have an energy density of up to 500 Wh/kg.
At the launch ceremony at the Shanghai auto show, Wu Kai, CATL’s chief scientist, said the company was working with unspecified partners to ensure the battery is qualified for aviation use in terms of safety and quality. CATL will also be able to start mass production of the condensed matter battery for electric vehicle uses later this year, Wu added.
The new battery leverages highly conductive biomimetic condensed state electrolytes to improve the conductive performance of the cells and in turn the efficiency of lithium-ion transport, while also boosting the stability of the microstructure.
The condensed matter battery is said to integrate “a range of innovative technologies, including the ultra-high energy density cathode materials, innovative anode materials, separators, and manufacturing processes, offering excellent charge and discharge performance as well as good safety performance,” CATL said.
However, no information has been revealed about the cost of the new cells, or the materials required to make them. A few other specifications, such as charging efficiency, charge/discharge rate, safety ranges, and life cycles, were also missing.
The Chinese battery manufacturer, which produced 37% of the world’s electric-vehicle batteries and 43.4% of energy storage batteries in 2022 for a grand total of 289 GWh, has made groundbreaking product announcements in recent years.
In 2021, CATL rolled out its first generation sodium-ion battery with an energy density of 160 Wh/kg and promised an increase to 200 Wh/kg for the next generation. Earlier this week, it confirmed that Chinese Chery will become the first automaker to use its sodium-ion battery tech.
In 2022, CATL unveiled Qilin battery, the third generation of its cell-to-pack technology, claiming the highest integration level to date. With a record-breaking volume utilisation efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg, Qilin is capable of delivering a range of over 1,000 km and equating to a five-minute hot start and ten minutes of charging to get from 10-80% state of charge.
The series production of Qilin started in March this year. These batteries have already been used in multiple electric vehicles from ZEEKR, AITO, Li Auto, and Geely.
On Tuesday, CATL also announced its targets to achieve carbon neutrality with all its battery manufacturing plants by 2025, and across its battery value chain by 2035.
To achieve this, the company will focus on reducing CO2 emissions in five key areas: mining, raw materials, battery materials, battery manufacturing and battery systems. “For CATL, achieving carbon neutrality is our responsibility, demonstrates our capability, and opens up more opportunities,” said CATL Board Secretary Jiang Li.
