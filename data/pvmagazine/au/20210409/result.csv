Solar Citizens energy strategist Stephanie Gray welcomed the news, saying the State Government needs to keep pace with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and ensure there’s enough clean energy storage coming online.
“It’s been almost four years since the Queensland Government promised to undertake research on possible pumped hydro locations across the state and we’re still waiting to see the results,” she said.
“It’s great to finally see evidence that this work is progressing.
“Queenslanders are world leaders in the uptake of rooftop solar. Now we need to get serious about adding more storage, like batteries and pumped hydro, so we can utilise this abundant and cheap solar energy around the clock.”
Gray said the government would need to implement a 2 GW by 2025 storage target to provide valuable system strength and inertia to the grid, safeguarding security and reliability as it pushes towards its target of 50% renewables by 2030.
It was reported in the Brisbane Times on Friday that Borumba Dam was one of two sites identified by Seqwater as a potential location for a pumped hydro facility. The other is in north Queensland, but the report indicated the site that stacked up best for the south-east from a feasibility perspective was Borumba Dam.
The dam has long been considered a likely site for a pumped hydro facility. University of Queensland energy expert Professor Simon Bartlett identified it as a suitable site for a 1000 MW pumped hydro site more than five years ago, suggesting such a facility could power 400,000 homes.
Bartlett said the state government had obtained land near Borumba Dam, upstream on Yabba Creek, and near Mount Byron, west of Somerset Dam, for potential pumped hydro dam sites in 1985.
“I have no hesitation is stating that these schemes are not only feasible, but are the best sites available in Australia, to my knowledge,” Bartlett told the Brisbane Times.

Bartlett said both sites were “eminently capable” of being developed as large pumped hydro sites, describing them as more suitable than the Snowy 2.0 scheme in New South Wales’ Snowy Mountains.
Snowy 2.0, which will provide 2 GW of fast-start, dispatchable energy and provide 350 GWh of large-scale storage – enough to power the equivalent of 500,000 homes for over a week during peak demand – involves linking the Tantangara and Talbingo dams via 27 kilometres of tunnels.
“They are actually a lot better than the Snowy 2.0 scheme – mainly it is a much shorter distance from the upper reservoir and the lower reservoir,” Bartlett said.
“It is less than two kilometres, whereas (Snowy 2.0) is 27 kilometres, so there is a lot less tunnelling and a lot more efficient schemes.”
Bartlett said Borumba Dam is also close to the main north-south electricity transmission line, meaning it would be relatively cheap to connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The Borumba Dam report comes after GE Renewable Energy announced in January it had signed an agreement with Australian-based consortium BE Power to co-develop the 400 MW Big T pumped hydro storage project at Cressbrook Dam, about 200kms away near Toowoomba.
Upon completion, the Big T pumped hydro power plant is expected to produce enough electricity to meet the consumption of about 200,000 local homes. When pumping, it will provide long-duration, high-capacity storage to absorb excess wind and solar output.
Elsewhere in the state, Genex Power is expected to start construction in the coming weeks on the massive 250 MW Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project in far north Queensland.
The developer announced late last month it was on target to deliver the final funding required for the project, which will be located alongside the existing 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm, to proceed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/09/council-coffs-up-for-free-solar-pv-advice-service/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 9, 2021",Council ‘coffs up’ for free solar PV advice service,"Residents in Coffs Harbour on the NSW north coast are now able to access free advice on solar PV and energy efficiency, and also have the opportunity to purchase solar and battery storage systems through selected suppliers after the council signed an agreement with the not-for-profit Australian Energy Foundation.
Coffs Harbour Mayor Denise Knight said council had recognised that many residents are interested in solar PV, battery storage and energy efficiency but may be deterred by the complexity of finding quality products and trusted installers.
“This service will guide residents to find the most suitable solar and battery system for them, helping us as a community respond to the climate change,” she said.
“Over 30% of homes in Coffs Harbour have rooftop solar so we are pleased to be expanding our services.”
The council’s concerns are not without foundation. A survey commissioned by Brisbane-based solar storage manufacturer Redback Technologies found that a lack of understanding was a barrier to the adoption of integrated solar and battery systems for more than one third of Australians.
In a 2019 survey of more than 1,000 Australian residents, 36% said a lack of understanding about how combined solar and battery systems work was a distinct barrier to their adoption while 35% of people said not knowing how to purchase one had effected their decision to install solar.
“Our survey shows there’s a lot of confusion and misunderstanding among consumers. As a result, people tend to wait and not make a purchase because they’re finding it hard to get good advice. That, naturally, is a problem for us as an industry,” Redback Technologies CEO  Patrick Matweew said at the time.
Australian Energy Foundation, formerly known as the Moreland Energy Foundation, works with homes, businesses and all levels of government in a bid to accelerate the transition to renewable energy.
In a statement, the organisation said it had supported 27,000 households with energy advice and abated 372,000 tonnes of emissions since its launch in 2013.
The free energy advice service will be available throughout Autumn with Coffs Harbour City residents able to access advice online or by phone.
Council said it is a great opportunity for residents looking to get advice on choosing or switching energy retailers, managing their electricity bills or looking for advice on buying new energy efficient appliances.
Homeowners looking to adopt renewable energy at their home are also encouraged to make use of the service.
Knight said the new partnership will support Coffs Harbour City Council in achieving its sustainability goals, including sourcing all electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/09/solar-professionals-take-rooftop-tally-over-8-mw-with-new-contract/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 9, 2021",Solar Professionals take rooftop tally over 8 MW with new contract,"Solar Professionals will this month commence the installation of 2.76 MW of rooftop PV systems on more than 800 public housing properties after securing its fifth contract with the government-funded AHO.
Solar Professionals managing director Dan Kimber said the new contract will increase the Wagga Wagga-based company’s total installs for the AHO to more than 8.1 MW of solar PV spread across more than 2,500 homes since 2017.
“The project will focus on up to 5 kW installs on homes in the South Coast and Western Sydney regions of NSW over the next nine months, with handover expected throughout the calendar year,” he said.
“We’re incredibly proud to have partnered the AHO in this important work in previous solar programs over the past four years, especially given our regional base.”
The latest solar round follows a similar AHO program completed last year, which targeted homes in Northern NSW and the Central West and Murray-Riverina areas.
Those homes are among more than 6,000 regional social housing homes which have been retrofitted with solar PV systems as part of State Government-funded programs, delivering household savings of up to $1,000 each year on energy bills.

“As partners since 2017, we’ve installed thousands of solar systems on public housing and seen the outcomes firsthand,” Kimber said. “The solar program provides real economic benefits.”
The Solar Professional announcement comes just weeks after SolarJuice, a subsidiary of SPI Energy, announced it had entered into a contract with the AHO to supply solar PV systems to up to 2,600 homes across NSW.
SolarJuice’s contract calls for approximately 8.5 MW of solar PV to be deployed over a 12-month period across homes under the AHO umbrella.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/09/panel-pushes-for-changes-to-accelerate-ev-rollout/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 9, 2021",Panel pushes for changes to accelerate EV rollout,"Putting the brakes on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030 is among a suite of recommendations compiled by the community panel which was commissioned by Infrastructure Victoria as it searched for ways to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and other low and zero emission vehicles, including battery-electric and hydrogen vehicles.
The community panel, comprising 211 members, this week presented Victoria’s independent infrastructure advisory body with 21 recommendations to consider, including advocating for government fleets to use electric vehicles (EVs) which could create a second-hand market with lower prices.
The panel also recommended the integration of energy capture through solar PV modules and battery storage across all types of buildings to reduce the reliance on the electricity transmission network powered by fossil fuels to create a closed loop system for charging EVs.
Infrastructure Victoria chief executive Michel Masson said tackling transport emissions will be key if the state is to meet its climate emission reduction target of net zero emissions by 2050 and community insight was critical in informing infrastructure needs and priorities.
“Victoria will not reach its emissions reduction targets unless more people shift away from petrol and diesel vehicles, but this transition needs to be planned, fair and equitable,” Masson said.
“Transitioning to zero emissions vehicles is likely to have the single most significant impact on reducing Victoria’s transport emissions, and while other countries have experienced the benefits of this, the technology is still relatively new in Australia.”
Data released late last month by the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) shows Australia is way behind in its EV adoption as other markets around the world are hitting the accelerator hard.
There were 6,900 EVs sold in Australia in 2020, a 2.7% increase from the 6,718 sold in 2019. The 2020 EV sales figure accounts for just 0.7% of total Australian car sales.
By comparison, EVs in the EU increased their market share to 10.2% in 2020 while in the UK it climbed to 10.7%. In California, EV market share climbed to 8.1% while in Norway it rose from 56% in 2019 to 75% in 2020.

EVC chief executive Behyad Jafari said Australia had failed to keep pace with the rest of the world, citing the unattractive policy environment for EVs at both state and federal levels as a major hinderance.
“There’s simply no sugar coating it at this point, Australia has marked itself out as a uniquely hostile market to electric vehicles,” he said.
“We have no targets, no significant incentives, no fuel efficiency standards, and in Victoria we even have a new tax on non-emitting vehicles.”
From July 1, EV and hydrogen vehicle owners in Victoria will be charged 2.5 cents for each kilometre they drive, and plug-in hybrid-electric vehicle owners will pay 2 cents per kilometre driven.
South Australia had also aimed to introduce an EV road user charge in 2021 but the scheduled introduction date had since been pushed out to July 2022.
The road user charge has come in for plenty of criticism with EV advocates calling for increased incentives to speed up the transition but Masson said the community panel had delivered some surprising recommendations.
“This process revealed that reducing or off-setting purchase costs is important but there are many more opportunities, in fact the panel’s top five recommendations explored ideas beyond financial incentives to encourage a greater uptake of low and zero emissions vehicles,” he said.

Among the recommendations outlined by the community panel was a call for the installation of EV charging points to be supported through the state’s Solar Homes Program and subsidies to reduce the cost of installing home charging infrastructure.
The panel also recommended the rollout of a network of charging infrastructure across Victoria, the introduction of planning controls that require new developments to install charging infrastructure and the provision of EV charging stations at activity and town centres.
Other recommendations included providing financial incentives to individuals to support the initial transition to low or zero emissions vehicles and the creation of a trade-in scheme for internal combustion engine vehicles which would incentivise community members to transition to EVs sooner.
Infrastructure Victoria will now prepare a report based on the recommendations and it will form part of the update to state’s 30-year Infrastructure Strategy to be released mid-2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/09/solar-powers-novel-green-hydrogen-fuel-technology/,"EV,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 9, 2021",Solar powers novel green hydrogen fuel technology,"A partnership between the University of Newcastle (UON) and Southern Green Gas (SGG) has managed to develop a state-of-the-art green hydrogen fuel which was yesterday demonstrated in Hyundai’s Nexo Hydrogen fuel cell SUV. 
The technology extracts pure water from air, and then uses green energy generated from solar PV and split into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis, before said hydrogen gas can be used to fuel the car. 
“We’ve worked with Southern Green Gas to develop the ability to manufacture green hydrogen at a lab scale, the results of which we’re seeing demonstrated here today in the Hyundai hydrogen vehicle,” said Behdad Moghtaderi of UON. “Seeing this fuel hit the roads is a proud moment for my team, who have worked to perfect it over several years. We’re now looking forward to scaling this technology, working with Southern Green Gas toward commercial rollout and a wide range of possible applications.” 
What is more, the partners are not limiting themselves to hydrogen. Their remit, with the help of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the NSW Government, is the creation of carbon-neutral energy from Australian research and development and renewable resources, and in addition to hydrogen fuel they’re also developing manufacturing capability across other green fuels, such as green methane produced by combining the hydrogen with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
The managing director of Southern Green Gas, Rohan Gillespie, said “Renewable methane has enormous potential to decarbonise the global mobility sector. We believe this technology represents an important pathway in achieving zero emissions driving worldwide and we are excited to work with our technology partners to make this vision a reality.” 
This vision, according to Gillespie, is to use this homegrown technology to deliver green methane, ‘clean natural gas’, to the world. The ‘carbon-neutral methane’ displaces fossil fuel based natural gas. “So what we do” continues Gillespie, is use the “carbon dioxide we extract from the atmosphere” to offset the carbon that is released when the methane is used. “So our methane can be used in existing gas fired power stations, just like natural gas, but when it emits CO2 it’s offset by the CO2 we’ve already extracted by the atmosphere, so it’s carbon neutral.” 
Of course, this green methane can also be turned back into hydrogen, should the end-user want it that way.

Interestingly, SGG’s speciality gas supplier is Coregas, the largest Australian-owned gases company, and a company which only last month received funding from the New South Wales Government to develop a hydrogen refuelling station at the Port Kembla site of BlueScope Steelworks. The station will work to support the introduction of zero emission hydrogen fleet vehicles in the region and greater New South Wales.
Coregas’s executive general manager, Alan Watkins, said the company was delighted to provide equipment and gas testing “of hydrogen generated by the technology, which passed with flying colours. We see an important future for clean gases powering the world’s electric vehicles, be they battery or hydrogen fuel cell.” 
The demonstration took place at Hyundai Australia’s hydrogen refuelling station in Bennelong, Sydney.

Taiwan’s largest cement company, Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC), is planning to invest NT$10 billion (US$352 million) in the construction of a battery factory in Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan.
“The planned capacity is 1.8 GW, equivalent to the volume of long-distance batteries needed for the annual production of 24,000 electric vehicles,” the company stated, adding that the factory will be operated by its storage unit, E-Moli, which already has a storage system factory in Tainan with a capacity of 1.5 GW.
The new facility will produce high-charge-discharge nickel lithium-ion ternary batteries, which the manufacturer described as “super batteries.” “With the development of the super battery, in the future, there might be a chance to break through these conventional connectivity solutions to create infinite possibilities,” affirmed TCC chairman Nelson Chang.
No more details were provided on the battery technology.
Several gigafactory projects are currently under way in Europe. Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt is planning to build two manufacturing facilities in Sweden and Poland. The company is also planning a 50-50 joint venture with Volkswagen to establish another 16 GWh battery cell factory, in the German state of Lower Saxony. Furthermore, Italian start-up Italvolt wants to build a €4 billion (US$4.75 billion) EV battery manufacturing facility in Italy. The site for the project is currently being identified; the factory’s initial capacity is expected to reach 45 GWh.
Another gigafactory is under construction by U.S. electric car maker Tesla near Berlin, Germany, and another is planned by French battery cell producer Verkor in Rodez, about 150km northeast of Toulouse. Furthermore, SEAT and Iberdrola are planning to build an EV battery manufacturing facility in Barcelona with the support of the Spanish government.

Vattenfall, Sweden-based steel company SSAB, and Swedish state-owned miner LKAB have started building a rock cavern storage facility for green hydrogen near Luleå, in northern Sweden.
The three companies will jointly invest SEK 250 million ($29 million) in the project, which has the support of the Swedish Energy Agency. The 100-cubic-meter “Hybrit” facility will be built approximately 30 meters below ground. It is expected to begin operations in 2022 and will reach full capacity in 2024.
The cavern is being built via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC) approach, which involves covering the walls of the cavern with a selected material as a sealing layer.
“LKAB will need to become Sweden’s and perhaps Europe’s biggest hydrogen producer in the future, and this pilot project provides additional valuable knowledge for the continued work in creating the world’s first fossil-free value chain for the iron and steel industry,” said Lars Ydreskog, director of strategic projects at LKAB.
A recent study by the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) showed that salt caverns offer a flexible, efficient option for hydrogen storage. The research group estimates that Europe has the technical potential to store 84.8 PWh of hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes.
The IEK-3 researchers said the proximity of the caverns to the coast will be helpful, as brine disposal remains economical up to 50 km from sea.
