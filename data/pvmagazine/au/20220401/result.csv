Energy Minister Angus Taylor says the government strongly backs natural gas and accused the opposition of being “willing to risk Australia’s energy security and investment in regional Australia to appease gas activists.”
However, the development of new fossil fuel projects is completely inconsistent with the broader goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 – and will not improve energy security.
Gas is a fossil fuel and a greenhouse gas. Emissions from the extraction, processing and export of gas contribute significantly to Australia’s carbon emissions.
Globally, there is growing recognition the energy sector must change. An International Energy Agency report last year made clear there can be no new oil, gas or coal development if the world is to have any chance of reaching net zero by 2050.
The methane found in natural gas is 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.
Funding new gas projects undermines Australia’s efforts to achieve an already unambitious climate target of 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Failing our climate target would breach the global goals of the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2℃ above pre-industrial levels.
The consequences of global warming are catastrophic. Australia has had recent and profound experience of extreme climate events in the form of devastating bushfires and floods.

The European Commission is phasing down two-thirds of Russian gas exports by the end of the year, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This will create a gas shortfall.
Russia supplies nearly 40% of the EU’s gas consumption via a fixed pipeline infrastructure.
To phase this supply out, the EU will this year require 500 terrawatt hours of additional imports of liquified natural gas (LNG).

This will be difficult. Global markets are tight and LNG tends to be sold on long-term contracts. Alleviating the EU shortfall will require record imports of LNG over the European spring and summer period and a rapid upgrade of gas infrastructure.
In a recent pact between Europe and the US, the EU will receive an additional 11 million tons of LNG by the end of 2022.
It’s unclear where this LNG will come from. Much may be sourced from non-contracted stock destined for Asia.
However it’s acquired, the price of LNG exports will continue to rise. Indeed, the delivered price for LNG in Northwest Europe rose 29% in a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his special military operation. And spot prices for LNG in Asia are trading at near record levels.
Australia is one of the world’s largest exporters of LNG, with most going to China, Japan and South Korea.
Given the lock-in contracts, Australia has little existing capacity to assist the EU. Australian gas producers are, however, benefiting from the higher global prices for LNG exports caused by the EU shortfall.
Woodside, Santos and Oil Search have all registering significant gains in their share prices.
Taylor says spending $50.3 million of public money for new gas projects will: “accelerate priority projects and ensure Australia does not experience the devastating impacts of a gas supply shortfall as seen in Europe”.
This is complete nonsense.
Australia will never face a shortfall like Europe because it’s not import-dependent. We have plenty of gas.
The issue for Australia is regulating the export of gas to ensure a sufficient domestic supply.
If the federal government wanted to improve Australia’s energy security, it would force gas producers in the east coast market to reserve a percentage for domestic consumption.
And it would actually use the Australian Domestic Gas Security mechanism. The measure was introduced to ensure gas supplies meet forecast energy needs, but has never been triggered.

Funding seven gas priority projects is also inconsistent with the conclusions of the 2022 Gas Statement of Opportunities, recently released by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
This statement argues the future path for the gas sector in Australia is uncertain because the pace and impact of a transforming energy sector upon the gas system remains unclear.
In the short term, this statement suggests funding new infrastructure will not alleviate domestic supply concerns because it won’t be running in time.
In the longer term, the statement forecasts a gradual decline in domestic gas demand as consumers inevitably shift from gas to electricity or zero-emission fuels.
Funding seven new fossil fuel projects is fundamentally contrary to Australia’s climate targets.
These projects will not improve Australia’s energy security or assist the EU with its supply difficulties. Nor do they cohere with AEMO’s longer term conclusions about the future of the gas sector.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has argued gas projects are needed to generate new dispatchable electricity which can be ramped up quickly when needed, making new gas projects integral to a national pandemic recovery plan.
But Kerry Schott, the former head of the Energy Security Board, disagrees. She’s made it clear there is an abundance of cheaper, cleaner alternatives.
Schott is right. This is where public money should be directed – to projects that represent the future, not the polluting past.

India-headquartered Sterling and Wilson is one of the biggest EPC contractors in the world with a global portfolio of more than 11GWp. Its Australian EPC order book includes five major solar PV projects with a cumulative total of more than 1.1GW, including Neoen’s 400MW Western Downs Green Power Hub in Queensland and the 174MW Wellington Solar Farm being developed by Lightsource BP in New South Wales.
It is also constructing the 162MW Columboola and 120MW Gangarri solar farms in Queensland, and the 150MW solar component of the Port Augusta renewable energy park in South Australia for Iberdrola.
Sterling and Wilson Solar Australia chief executive Philip Sheridan said the labour shortage is one of the key challenges confronting the industry and it is putting the development of new large-scale solar farms under strain.
“Securing skilled labour is certainly an area which is proving challenging,” he said. “The issue is not unique to the renewable sector but we are struggling to find the resources to service the projects and not it’s just the blue-collar workforce but white collar as well. And to be brutally honest it is only going to get worse.”
Independent advisory group Infrastructure Australia has described the growing skills shortages as “a public infrastructure workforce crisis”.
In its first Infrastructure Market Capacity report, the group project managers will struggle to recruit skilled workers for one in three industry jobs by 2023, the equivalent of 105,000 positions. Of particular concern for the clean energy industry is a shortage of engineers, electrical line workers, electricians and skilled wind power technicians.
Sheridan said the skilled labour shortage has been an issue in Australia for many years and the pandemic has exacerbated the problem, with both state and international border closures preventing the arrival of much-needed expertise at some renewable energy projects.

Sheridan also said the surge in the size and scope of proposed large-scale solar projects has added an extra element to the equation.
“The pipeline of opportunities that we are aware of today with the targets that are being talked about for 2025 and 2030 and the types of projects we’re seeing in the longer term, these are GW projects … the numbers are huge,” he said.
“The numbers that are being bandied about, 10GW, 15GW … these are big set-ups. On paper it looks very good in terms of opportunities but it’s not just the project but how it’s going to be serviced.
“The industry really has to change and evolve from where we have traditionally been to ensure they can be executed.”
Sheridan said it is incumbent upon the industry to adapt to circumstances, pointing to opportunities to develop modular construction techniques and increase off-site building to potentially reduce the on-site labour component.
“We need to be developing smarter ways to deliver these projects,” he said. “One of the things that we are looking at Sterling and Wilson, as are others I’m sure, is the type of products that we are choosing.
“Some of the products are in all honesty very labour intensive … Meccano sets that need lots of people on site. I think that modular sector is an area we need to seriously look at.
“I think the less labour-intensive elements we can do in the field potentially the less people we require out there. Simplifying some of the activities might make things more streamlined.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/01/agl-commences-shutdown-of-coal-fired-liddell-power-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 1, 2022",AGL commences shutdown of coal-fired Liddell power plant,"Australia’s largest energy gen-tailer AGL Energy announced on Friday it had closed the first 500MW coal-fired generating unit at its Liddell Power Station in the New South Wales (NSW) Hunter Valley as it progresses plans to shut down the entire facility over the next 12 months.
The coal-fired Liddell Power Station will be shut down entirely in in April 2023 with AGL having outlined plans to transform the site into an integrated, low-carbon industrial energy hub dominated by a 500MW/2GWh grid-connected utility scale battery.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the closure of the first of the four units at Liddell was a significant moment for the company and a clear demonstration of the power producer’s commitment to the decarbonisation of its fossil-fuel fired generation portfolio.
“We announced the retirement of Liddell in 2015 and seven years later we are pleased to be in a position to begin the orderly and responsible closure and transition of the power station in line with our climate commitments,” he said.
“As the power station nears the end of its technical life, we are focused on ensuring it continues to operate safely for our people while providing power reliably.
“The transition of the Liddell site into the Hunter Energy Hub will continue to take shape between now and the site’s full closure next year. We are excited about our clean energy plans in the Hunter region, including grid-scale battery, solar thermal storage, wind, hydrogen and pumped hydro projects.”

AGL has already secured planning approval to build the 500MW/2GWh grid-connected utility scale battery at the site, providing a new source of dispatchable power and allowing the company to reuse the existing grid connection infrastructure.
AGL has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Fortescue Future Industries to explore a green hydrogen production facility as part of its planned Hunter Energy Hub which includes a hydroelectric power station at Bells Mountain.
Brokhof said the transformation of the Liddell site into a renewable energy hub would mark the company’s first rehabilitation of a thermal coal site.
“We’re committed to seeing this site continue its legacy as the backbone of the NSW electricity grid as we repurpose the infrastructure to continue delivering energy through the next phase of its life,” he said.
Liddell was commissioned in 1971 and currently ranks as one of Australia’s top 10 power stations in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. AGL said the closure of the first unit will deliver an annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that is equivalent to taking around 400,000 cars off the road.
The closure of the Liddell Power Station is part of an accelerating transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable power.

In February, AGL announced it had fast-tracked the closures of its two biggest coal-fired power plants. The 2,640MW Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley will be shuttered “no later than” 2033, two years ahead of its previously scheduled closure of 2035, while the 2.210MW Loy Yang A plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley will now close by 2045 rather than 2048.
Fellow gen-tailer Origin Energy has also brought forward plans to close its coal-fired Eraring power station in the Hunter region, announcing in January the 2,880MW plant will be closed in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.
The closure of the Liddell generator comes just days after a fire at the coal-fired Yallourn Power Station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley forced two or the station’s four generation units offline.
EnergyAustralia said there had been a small fire in a coal storage facility at the Yallourn power plant on Wednesday. The fire burnt for six hours and has left two generation units out of service. It is expected they will be returned to service within the coming week.
The fire is the latest setback for the plant which was last year damaged during severe floods. A state energy emergency was declared after it was discovered flooding had created significant cracks in the Morwell River Diversion wall which protects the Yallourn Power Station and adjacent coal mine site.
The power station, which supplies up to 22% of Victoria’s energy and 8% of Australia’s, is set to close by mid-2028.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/01/cec-report-reveals-record-year-for-renewables-but-new-investment-slows/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 1, 2022",CEC report reveals record year for renewables but new investment slows,"A new report published by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows renewable energy delivered a record 32.5% share of Australia’s electricity market in 2021, driven by an increase in small and large-scale solar PV, which surged to 12.4%.
The 2022 edition of the CEC’s annual Clean Energy Australia Report shows the nation’s renewable energy industry powered on in 2021, generating more clean energy than ever before and adding a record amount of new capacity but while construction activity was strong during 2021, investment decisions in new projects have dipped.
CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said the level of financial commitments for new large-scale renewable energy projects fell by more than 17% from $4.5 billion in 2020 to $3.7 billion in 2021.
The growth of Australia’s renewable energy was again led by small-scale solar. The rooftop solar sector added 3.3GW of new capacity in 2021, the fifth year in a row it has set a record for new installed capacity. Small-scale solar accounted for 24.9% of Australia’s total renewable energy generation in 2021,
The large-scale sector also had a bumper year in 2021, adding 2,955MW of new capacity across 27 projects, which was almost 1GW more than that added in 2020.
The hydrogen sector’s development also accelerated in 2021 with the industry having a pipeline of more than 100 projects worth $163 billion by the end of the year.

The battery energy storage sector also made considerable strides in 2021, including the completion of Australia’s largest battery with the commissioning of the 300MW/450MWh Victorian Big Battery in December.
“2021 was also a breakthrough year for big batteries, with 30 large-scale batteries under construction at the end of 2021 with a combined capacity and storage duration of 921MW/1169MWh,” Thornton said. “Energy investors are clearly confident about the important role and commercial viability of big batteries to deliver the reliable power of the future.”
Thornton said the impressive achievements are however clouded by a significant slowdown in the pipeline for new large-scale renewable energy projects. New capacity reaching financial commitment dropped from 3.16GW across 28 projects in 2020 to 2.11GW across 20 projects in 2021.
“This significant reduction is due to continued policy uncertainty combined with the challenges associated with connecting renewable energy projects to the grid,” he said.
“While investors are enthusiastic about investing in new large-scale renewable energy projects, these challenges have increased risks and slowed down the number of new projects coming forward. The slowdown is concerning in light of expectations that coal-fired power plants will continue to close earlier than previously anticipated.”

Despite the slowdown, the CEC said 68 large-scale projects – including 42 solar farms and two hybrid wind and solar projects – were under construction or financially committed at the end of 2021, representing more than 9GW of new capacity and more than $18 billion of investment.
Almost 3GW of new large-scale capacity was added in 2021, with the country’s three largest solar farms all beginning to send power to the grid during the year. The largest solar project commissioned in 2021 was the 275MW Darlington Point Solar Farm, developed by Edify.
The report also highlights that corporate renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) had another strong year in 2021. There were 18 corporate renewable PPAs announced in 2021, directly contractingmore than 800MW.
Tasmania continues to lead the nation in clean energy market share with 99.9% of the state’s electricity generation delivered by renewables in 2021. South Australia at 66.5% and Victoria at 33.4% recorded the next largest market shares.

The CEC maintains a list of compliant solar PV modules that are approved for installation under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES). This list is used by the Clean Energy Regulator and state electricity regulators.
The CEC said the equipment listed has “shown sufficient evidence that it meets the required safety standards for use within Australia. Evidence of compliance has been examined and verified by the Clean Energy Council”.
The CEC may however de-list a product, where the terms and conditions of listing have not been satisfied or have been breached – as determined by its independent Product Listing Review Panel.
MSquare, which is based in the western Sydney suburb of Toongabbie, was contacted for comment about the decision but a company spokesman said they could not “discuss it at this moment”.
Shayne Jaenisch, the chief executive of Adelaide-based solar PV module manufacturer Tindo Solar said he was aware of the decision and while no details about the delisting had been released, the CEC was right to delist solar products that do not live up to their claims.
“The CEC has not detailed why Msquare was delisted,” he said. “(But) there are many ways that a panel can breach the CEC’s listing requirements.”
Jaenisch said solar panel manufacture was a difficult industry that relied on advanced machinery, precision engineering and an expert workforce.
“We thank the regulator, the CEC, for enforcing its listing rules,” he said.
MSquare Energy told pv magazine late last year it had ambitions of becoming Australia’s largest solar panel manufacturer.
The company said at the time its panels up to 445W were CEC approved to be sold and installed in Australia, and that it was in the process of securing approval for its M10 modules up to 550W.
MSquare said it had been exporting some of its products to the United States, and had purchased a site in Kelso, near Bathurst, for a second manufacturing facility which it said would allow it to increase its manufacturing capacity from 300MW to 900MW.

Slovenia-based solar panel manufacturer Bisol has launched a new series of transparent solar modules for applications in agrivoltaic projects or solar carports.
“The carefully chosen transparent backsheet has an excellent resistance to external influences, which means it deteriorates exclusively on a bare minimal level throughout its lifespan,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The even better feature of this transparent backsheet is that it provides such great transparency that it can easily be compared to glass-glass modules, while the price point of the product remains much closer to the standard solar products.”
The module is being offered with wattages of 260 and 300W, respectively. “Bisol Lumina has a specially designed matrix with bigger gaps between solar cells and 30% transparency rate, which makes it perfect for agrivoltaic projects that are currently a major trend in the solar industry, as well as skylights, sun shades, and car canopies,” the spokesperson said.
Bisol
The smallest product measures 1,770×1,050x35mm, weighs in 20.5kg, and is built with 84 half-cut monocrystalline PERC bifacial cells with a size of 166x166mm. The panel features a front power conversion efficiency of 14%, an open-circuit voltage of 28.8V, and a short-circuit current of 11.2A. 
The largest module has a size of 2,110×1,050x40mm, a weight of 24.5kg, and is fabricated with 96 half-cut cells. Its front efficiency is 13.5% and the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are 32.9V and 11.2A, respectively.
Both products can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius and their operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius. They are enclosed between 3.2mm high transparency, tempered glass surfaces, and feature a junction box with an IP 68 rating. The maximum system voltage for both modules is 1,000 V. They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee.

Chinese inverter maker Growatt has launched a new inverter series for residential applications.
Called MOD 3-10KTL3-XH, the new product is available in eight different versions with nominal power of 3kW to 10kW. Their efficiency ranges from 98.3& to 98.6% and the European efficiency rating is between 97.5% and 98.1%.
The smallest device of the series measures 425x387x147mm and has a weight of 12.5kg. The largest inverter has a size of 425x387x178mm and weighs in at 14kg. 
It features up to two maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs, with MPPT voltage ranging from 140-1,000V.
“The new series was originally launched in China in February and is now being launched on the European market,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
“We have witnessed quickly growing demands for storage systems worldwide… soon we will also bring this forward-looking solution to the Australian market where tremendous energy storage potential resides,” Lisa Zhang, global marketing director at Growatt said.
The inverter can be used at a maximum operating altitude of 4,000 meters and its operating ambient temperature ranges from -25 to 60 degrees Celsius. The series also features IP66 enclosures.
“Such [a] battery-ready feature offers flexibility to users by allowing the inverter to work for a normal grid-tied solar system and later to be upgraded to a storage system with an extra battery pack, which saves users on initial investments,” Zhang added.
The system is offered by the manufacturer with its ARK XH residential battery. “A MOD 10KTL3-XH inverter can provide 10kW full power output plus 10kW full power battery charge simultaneously, doubling the productivity of the system,” it said in a statement. “What is more, its DC/AC ratio is as high as two, and with dual MPP trackers, the string current can reach up to 16A, making it a good match with high-power modules.”
