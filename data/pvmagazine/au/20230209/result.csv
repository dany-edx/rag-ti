Plico, the retail arm of Perth-based renewable energy company Starling Energy Group, operates a growing fleet of coordinated residential solar and battery systems. The VPP currently has an aggregated battery of more than 9 MWh and on Jan. 30, much of this capacity was made available to the WA grid as soaring temperatures and high demand threatened power system security.
Plico Chief Executive Officer Robbie Campbell said it is the first time a VPP has provided additional capacity to the grid in WA and is one of the most significant contributions made by a VPP nationally.
“This historic event was triggered by increased demand for electricity caused by a heat wave,” he said. “With energy supply shortfalls putting pressure on the WA grid, Plico was contracted by the market operator, AEMO, to provide additional capacity.”
Plico said more than half of its VPP’s power storage capacity was dispatched between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. on the day to support the grid. This included more than 3 MW in power exported directly to the grid.
Campbell said the VPP, which utilises inverter tech supplied by Brisbane-based Redback Technologies and software provided by Amp X to optimise consumption and dispatch patterns of the distributed energy systems, worked as it is designed to do, providing additional power to offset the high household demand that would have otherwise strained the grid.
“This is exactly what we’ve been working towards since our inception in 2019,” Campbell said. “We estimate that 3 MW powers approximately 1,500 homes who may otherwise have suffered a blackout.”
Driven by near-perfect solar conditions, WA households are embracing renewable energy technology at record rates with an estimated 36% of households having installed rooftop solar. This is equivalent to almost 2 GW of renewable energy capacity, collectively representing the largest source of electricity generation on the SWIS.
While the influx of rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources provides opportunities, it also presents major challenges for the electricity system which was not designed for two-way energy flow.
The state government has previously suggested VPPs could be “the future for electricity in WA” with state-owned electricity providers Western Power and Synergy among those exploring the benefits of VPPs.
Campbell says he’s not sure how many more activations will occur, but is prepared for any emergency. “To be called upon to be part of a fundamental solution to powering our state and help support the transition to clean energy and reach net zero – it’s thrilling,” Campbell said.

The Queensland government, which owns Stanwell, said the partnership will source renewable energy from its Energy and Jobs Plan’s pipeline of renewable projects which are to shift the state away from coal power. The Queensland government is aiming to supply 80% of the state’s electricity demand from hydro power, wind and solar farms by 2035.
Stanwell’s deal with Arnotts covers the company’s manufacturing site in Virginia, which features eight product lines and three packaging lines, and employs more than 600 people.
Arnott’s Group Chief Executive Officer George Zoghbi said the PPA is the latest in a series of renewable projects across its Australian sites and would put the company ahead of target for its net-zero goals as it looks to as it looks to transition to 100% renewable electricity across its operations by 2029.
“This is an exciting partnership that will enable us to transition the way we source electricity for our Virginia site and significantly reduce our environmental impact,” he said.
Arnott’s has also engaged Sydney-based CleanPeak to build a 1.3 MW rooftop solar system at the Virginia site.
Stanwell Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Rourke said the deal showed how the company, which has historically been known for its coal-fired energy generation, is moving to diversify its generation portfolio to support the decarbonisation of industry.
“Stanwell Energy is one of Queensland’s largest commercial and industrial energy retailers with a renewable portfolio of 2,100 MW from projects that are currently operational, under construction or under development,” he said.
“This extensive pipeline of renewable energy projects means that we can expand our renewable offerings for customers as Stanwell becomes a diversified and renewable energy provider.”
The deal is the latest renewable energy contract signed by a Queensland government-owned energy generator.  Earlier this week CS Energy announced it had signed a deal with Australian-headquartered global investment manager AMP Capital which will see four major shopping centres in Queensland’s southeast source 100% of their electricity needs from renewable energy supplied by the 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/09/superconducting-cables-offer-solution-to-loss-of-electricity-in-grid/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Superconducting cables offer solution to loss of electricity in grid,"Electricity grids are big, complex systems. Building new high-voltage transmission lines often spurs backlash from communities worried about the visual impact of the towers. And our 20th century grid loses around 10% of the power generated as heat.
One solution? Use superconducting cables for key sections of the grid. A single 17-centimetre cable can carry the entire output of several nuclear plants. Cities and regions around the world have done this to cut emissions, increase efficiency, protect key infrastructure against disasters and run powerlines underground. As Australia prepares to modernise its grid, it should follow suit. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity.
Plenty.
The main advantage of high voltage transmission lines is they’re relatively cheap.
But cheap to build comes with hidden costs later. A survey of 140 countries found the electricity currently wasted in transmission accounts for a staggering half-billion tonnes of carbon dioxide – each year.
These unnecessary emissions are higher than the exhaust from all the world’s trucks, or from all the methane burned off at oil rigs.

Inefficient power transmission also means countries have to build extra power plants to compensate for losses on the grid.
Labor has pledged $20 billion (USD 13.85) to make the grid ready for clean energy. This includes an extra 10,000 kilometres of transmission lines. But what type of lines? At present, the plans are for the conventional high voltage overhead cables you see dotting the countryside.
System planning by Australia’s energy market operator shows many grid-modernising projects will use last century’s technologies, the conventional high voltage overhead cables. If these plans proceed without considering superconductors, it will be a huge missed opportunity.
Superconduction is where electrons can flow without resistance or loss. Built into power cables, it holds out the promise of lossless electricity transfer, over both long and short distances. That’s important, given Australia’s remarkable wind and solar resources are often located far from energy users in the cities.
High voltage superconducting cables would allow us to deliver power with minimal losses from heat or electrical resistance and with footprints at least 100 times smaller than a conventional copper cable for the same power output.
And they are far more resilient to disasters and extreme weather, as they are located underground.
Even more important, a typical superconducting cable can deliver the same or greater power at a much lower voltage than a conventional transmission cable. That means the space needed for transformers and grid connections falls from the size of a large gym to only a double garage.
Bringing these technologies into our power grid offers social, environmental, commercial and efficiency dividends.
Unfortunately, while superconductors are commonplace in Australia’s medical community (where they are routinely used in MRI machines and diagnostic instruments) they have not yet found their home in our power sector.
One reason is that superconductors must be cooled to work. But rapid progress in cryogenics means you no longer have to lower their temperature almost to absolute zero (-273℃). Modern “high temperature” superconductors only need to be cooled to -200℃, which can be done with liquid nitrogen – a cheap, readily available substance.

Overseas, however, they are proving themselves daily. Perhaps the most well-known example to date is in Germany’s city of Essen. In 2014, engineers installed a 10 kilovolt (kV) superconducting cable in the dense city centre. Even though it was only one kilometre long, it avoided the higher cost of building a third substation in an area where there was very limited space for infrastructure. Essen’s cable is unobtrusive in a metre-wide easement and only 70cm below ground.
Superconducting cables can be laid underground with a minimal footprint and cost-effectively. They need vastly less land.
A conventional high voltage overhead cable requires an easement of about 130 metres wide, with pylons up to 80 metres high to allow for safety. By contrast, an underground superconducting cable would take up an easement of six metres wide, and up to 2 metres deep.
This has another benefit: overcoming community scepticism. At present, many locals are concerned about the vulnerability of high voltage overhead cables in bushfire-prone and environmentally sensitive regions, as well as the visual impact of the large towers and lines. Communities and farmers in some regions are vocally against plans for new 85-metre-high towers and power lines running through or near their land.
Climate extremes, unprecedented windstorms, excessive rainfall and lightning strikes can disrupt power supply networks, as the Victorian town of Moorabool discovered in 2021.
What about cost? This is hard to pin down, as it depends on the scale, nature and complexity of the task. But consider this – the Essen cable cost around $20 million in 2014. Replacing the six 500 kV towers destroyed by windstorms near Moorabool in January 2020 cost $26 million.
While superconducting cables will cost more up front, you save by avoiding large easements, requiring fewer substations (as the power is at a lower voltage), and streamlining approvals.

Queensland. The sunshine state is planning four new high-voltage transmission projects, to be built by the mid-2030s. The goal is to link clean energy production in the north of the state with the population centres of the south.
Right now, there are major congestion issues between southern and central Queensland. Strategically locating superconducting cables here would be the best location, serving to future-proof infrastructure, reduce emissions and avoid power loss.

Sydney-based 5B will lead the project in conjunction with Dr Mark Baldry from the UoS’s Faculty of Engineering. Clean energy developer Sun Cable, which is now for sale after entering voluntary administration in January, has been listed as an industry participant.
5B was selected as the preferred supplier for Sun Cable’s proposed Australia-Asia PowerLink project in the Northern Territory (AAPowerLink), which would include up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory.
The research partners said the scale of the Sun Cable project means that temperature-induced panel efficiency losses represent a major challenge that must be overcome through thermal performance optimisation.
The project, which was awarded $636,676 as part of the Linkage grants program, will include the building of “sophisticated multiscale models to simulate and understand the multiple interacting phenomena that cause panel heating.”
“This project will create the tools and know-how to optimise array design and solar farm development, delivering major efficiency gains and enhancing the viability of future gigascale solar projects,” the research partners said.
The project is one of eight energy projects to receive funding through the ARC Linkage Projects scheme 2022 Round 1. Funds totalling $40 million for 81 new projects were announced under the program.
Linkage grants support strategic research partnerships between Australian universities and other publicly funded research institutes, plus industry or community participants. Grants under the scheme are worth between $50,000 to $300,000 per year, for projects running between two and five years.
“By supporting the development of partnerships, the ARC encourages the transfer of skills, knowledge, and ideas as a basis for securing social, commercial and other benefits of research,” ARC Chief Executive Officer Judi Zielke said.
Other agencies to receive funding this week include the University of Melbourne which will work with Spark Property Developments to develop an ultra-low carbon precast panel system that allows for rapid modular construction. This proposed project, which was awarded $545,173, aims to develop a precast panel comprising a novel ultra-low carbon concrete mixture that is cast in vertical battery moulds.
Researchers at the University of Western Australia’s Oceans Institute received $420,000 to deploy helix-shaped anchors to secure floating wind developments.
Project lead Professor Christophe Gaudin said the project will reduce the cost of offshore floating wind energy. UWA’s partners on the project are Ocean Infinity (Australia), Ireland’s University of Dundee and Geowynd Offshore Engineering.

Polysilicon prices have increased since the start of the year, after a relatively long period of decline in the latter months of 2022, according to the silicon branch of the CNMIA.
Monocrystalline silicon currently sells at an average price of CNY 217.5 ($46)/kg, with prices ranging from CNY 200/kg to CNY 232/kg. This is 31.02% higher that the levels registered in mid-January.
The CNMIA said that polycrystalline silicon is being priced at an average of CNY 215.2/kg, with prices ranging from CNY 198/kg to CNY 230/kg, up 31.22% from mid-January.
After China’s recent new year holiday, wafer manufacturers returned to high operation rates in order to handle downstream orders. As a result, they quickly consumed all polysilicon in stock, according to the CNMIA. This contributed to a tense supply situation and higher prices.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/09/photovoltaic-thermal-system-based-on-pcm-cooling/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 9, 2023",Photovoltaic-thermal system based on PCM cooling,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia have fabricated a photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system that uses a cooling nanofluid circulation system with a phase change material (PCM). The system can absorb heat from the PV panels and transmit it to the nanofluid, where it can be transformed into thermal energy and used for different applications. The Malaysian group said their work uses micro-fins copper tubes for the first time, in order to enhance the thermal conductivity of the PCM.
PCM can absorb, store and release large amounts of latent heat over defined temperature ranges. They have often been used at the research level for PV module cooling and the storage of heat.
The scientists built the system with a 30 W solar module measuring 640 mm x 360 mm x 25 mm. They used a 9.52 mm pipe, which they soldered to the panel with copper tape and pure copper. They also used a PCM container filled with 2.75 kg of nano PCM, a heat exchanger, and a PCM expansion tank.
“The operational fluid from the reservoir is pushed through the PVT by a pump,” they explained. “In order to keep the entryway’s temperature stable, the working fluid loses heat from the PVT by passing through a heat exchanger connected with the cooling unit.”
The scientists tested the systems under different illumination conditions and a room temperature of 27 C, with the working fluid temperature set at 20 C, controlled by a water-cooling chiller. The temperature of the cooled PV panel fell from 86.2 C to 42.1 C, which pushed its overall efficiency to 89%.
“The thermal and electrical energy of a PVT system utilising Nano PCM and Nanofluids in a Micro fins tube is more than that of any other system studied,” the researchers said, without providing data on system costs.
The researchers presented the system in “Experimental analysis for the photovoltaic thermal collector (PVT) with nano PCM and micro-fins tube nanofluid,” which was recently published in Case Studies in Thermal Engineering. In recent years, the group has also developed multi-level fin heat sinks for solar module cooling, as well as lapping and longitudinal fins.
