The EV Index online data dashboard, produced by the AAA, shows that from 2022 to 2023 BEVs accounted for 7.51% of sales in the light vehicle market segment, up from 3.24%, with 87,217 battery electric vehicles sold last year.
Hybrid vehicle sales were also up according to the AAA EV Index data for Q4 2023, rising by 20.36%, or 16,653 vehicles year-on-year. Though still accounting for less than 1% of new vehicle sales, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales did rise with 11,219 cars sold in 2023, an 88.97% year-on-year increase.
Sales of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles remain very slow with just six sold in 2023, down on the 15 purchased in 2022.

The AAA said the sales figures confirm a clear trend of growth for BEVs and hybrids and a gradually shrinking market share for internal combustion engines (ICEs) which dropped to 3.06%, down 5.19% year-on-year. The association did however caution quarterly fluctuations disguise annual trends for all three fuel types.
The strongest sales for BEVs, hybrid and ICE were in the second, third and fourth quarter respectively, where BEVs outsold hybrids in the first two of 2023, hybrids outsold EVs in the third and fourth and national ICE vehicle sales grew quarter-by-quarter though sales in each state varied.
South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory, and the Australian Capital Territory have all shown in increase in EV sales compared to the previous quarter, while in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland sales fell slightly compared to the previous quarter.
Of the 21,474 light vehicle EV sales in the December quarter, the top three were Chinese manufactured Tesla, BYD and MG. The largest BEV sales from October to December 2023, were 8,469 medium SUVs, according to Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) data.
The AAA’s EV Index collates information from multiple national, state and territory sources, including information provided by the FCAI.

The Julia Creek project is a 1 GW solar and wind farm that would not only deliver energy to the proposed mine but also hook into the $5 billion CopperString transmission line linking Mt Isa to Townsville and the national grid.
Under the project sale agreement (PSA), EGPA will pay $3 million to acquire wind and solar monitoring equipment, more than 18 months of data, and intellectual property regarding engineering, environmental, geotechnical, flood plain and other project studies.
EGPA will also make two contingent payments totalling $4 million that will be payable in separate tranches upon the project achieving key development milestones. It has also agreed to pay QEM a revenue-based royalty of up to 2% generated by the Julia Creek renewables project, starting from its commercial operations date.
The PSA also provides QEM with the option to take up a 10-year power purchase agreement for the supply of up to 25 MW firm capacity to supply its mine operations.
QEM Managing Director Gavin Loyden said the sale is a major boost for the company, Julia Creek and the North West Minerals Province.
“In addition to the direct benefits for QEM in having access to renewable power for our vanadium project, the whole region will enjoy significant direct and indirect benefits from this scale of development,” he said.
EGPA Chief Executive Officer Werther Esposito said the proposed project has the potential to be one of Queensland’s largest renewable energy projects, capable of making a significant contribution to achieving the state’s renewable energy targets.
Esposito also said he expects the project to contribute to significant supply and employment opportunities for the surrounding community, creating a positive economic impact on the local area throughout the project’s development, construction, and operational phases.
EGPA, jointly owned by Italian utilities major Enel and Japanese oil and gas giant Inpex, already has a significant portfolio of wind, solar, storage and hybrid projects in operation and under development across Australia.
EGPA’s operational assets include the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in Victoria and its 51% stake in the Bungala 1 and Bungala 2 solar farms, which deliver a combined 220 MW of generation capacity into the grid in South Australia. It has also commenced construction on the 93 MW Girgarre Solar Farm in central Victoria and the 76 MW Flat Rocks wind farm in Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/15/nsw-council-switches-on-solar-in-search-for-100-renewables/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",ALEISHA HEY,"JANUARY 15, 2024",NSW council switches on solar in search for 100% renewables,"A 285 kW solar system installed on the newly established Water and Sewerage Services Operations Depot near Bega on the New South Wales (NSW) South Coast has commenced operations with the local council declaring the asset will help it achieve its renewable energy target by the end of the decade.
Bega Valley Shire Council (BVSC) Water and Sewerage Services Manager Steve Marshall said the new solar system enables council to qualify for the registration and trading of Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCS) with the Australian Clean Energy Regulator.
“Our latest site boasts a peak-power output of 285 kW and is anticipated to generate a substantial 300 MWh of energy annually,” he said. “In terms of consumption, this energy output can power 40 average Australian homes for an entire year or be likened to the fuel capacity of 685 cars, each holding 50 litres of petrol.”
“What this boils down to is taking about 60 tonnes of coal out of the energy generating process each year, which contributes significantly to environmental sustainability.”
Marshall said the new solar project has been linked to other council PV installations in the area to create the council’s most extensive solar energy generation site to date, “with inverters strategically placed to optimise energy flow into the main switchboard.”
“Collaborating with Energis Australia, our project partners helped with the design, procurement and integration of equipment,” he said. “A local provider, Transition Electrics, undertook the installation process and establishment of communications.”
The new solar array is the third PV system installed on BVSC water and sewerage assets with a combined 620 solar panels deployed across the South Bega reservoirs, the Bega-Yellow Pinch Pumphouse and the Bega Water and Sewerage Operations Depot.
Marshall said the council is also “currently working with local contractors to connect three additional water and sewerage sites.”
The council’s solar projects are complemented by a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement that BVSC signed with energy retailer Red Energy in late 2022 to source clean energy from the Metz Solar Farm near Armidale.
The BVSC is targeting 100% renewable energy by 2030 as part of its Community Strategic Plan 2040.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/15/genesis-frv-australia-press-go-on-new-zealand-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 15, 2024","Genesis, FRV Australia press go on New Zealand solar farm","New Zealand government-backed utility Genesis Energy and joint venture partner FRV Australia, the local arm of global renewable energy developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, have reached financial close on the 47 MW Lauriston Solar Farm being developed near Canterbury on New Zealand’s South Island.
Genesis said construction contracts for the $97 million (NZD 104 million) project being developed on a 93-hectare site about 100 kilometres south of Christchurch have been confirmed, initial works are already underway, and procurement of key equipment has started.
The development will be project financed by the Bank of New Zealand and Japan’s MUFG Bank which will fund approximately 70% of total project costs. The engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) will be provided by Australia’s Beon Energy Solutions.
The Lauriston Solar Farm will comprise approximately 80,000 solar panels and is expected to start generating electricity in early 2025 with Genesis, one of New Zealand’s largest energy generators retailers with approximately 500,000 customers, agreeing to purchase 100% of the energy produced through a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA).
Genesis Chief Wholesale Officer Tracey Hickman said achieving financial close on the project is an important milestone for the company, which is targeting 95% renewable generation by 2035, and the country with solar to play a clear role in New Zealand’s energy transition.
“It will enable us to provide cleaner energy to our customers, while also reducing emissions from our generation portfolio as Genesis invests in new renewable generation and moves to become net zero by 2040,” she said.
“The pleasing aspect of this project is it shows the value of our joint venture and that the model we have put in place for Lauriston works. It has allowed us to sign quality delivery partners, including our lead contractor, equipment suppliers and lenders.”
FRV Australia Chief Executive Officer Carlo Frigerio said the Lauriston Solar Farm is the first in a series of developments planned by the Genesis and FRV Australia joint venture, which was formed in late 2021 to develop up to 500 MW of solar capacity over the next five years.
“This marks our inaugural financial closing in New Zealand, serving as the cornerstone for FRV Australia and Genesis development efforts,” he said.
“It is a pivotal moment for both our presence in the country and the solar industry, which is just beginning to take root.”
The partners are also assessing three sites on New Zealand’s North Island with a combined capacity of up to 400 MW as Genesis focuses on moving to about 95% renewable generation by 2035.
The 47 MW Lauriston Solar Farm is the largest to reach financial close in New Zealand and will be the largest operational PV facility in the country when it comes online.
At present, the largest operational solar farm in the country is the 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm built near the town of the same name at the far north of the North Island. Developed by Lodestone Energy, the facility came online in December 2023 and is expected to generate 55 GWh of clean energy annually.
While solar is still in its infancy in New Zealand, developers are increasingly scoping the market with a number of recent announcements for projects in development, including plans for a 400 MW solar farm from private New Zealand company Todd Generation, and a 147 MW solar farm from UK-based Harmony Energy, both on the country’s North Island. Likewise, Lightsource bp and German investment manager Aquila Capital are looking to develop portfolios in New Zealand.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/15/can-australia-become-a-renewable-energy-superpower/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 15, 2024",Can Australia become a renewable energy superpower?,"At the annual United Nations climate meeting in the United Arab Emirates, Australia was one of the 118 countries to make a commitment to treble renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. Ahead of the COP28 Summit, Australia’s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, asserted that the country is capable of becoming a global leader in renewable energy.
There is no denying the fact that Australia is well positioned to make a major contribution to the global transition towards renewable energy. However, there are many challenges to attaining this goal and it’s worth exploring what it will take for Australia to achieve its potential as a renewable energy super power.
Australia’s renewable energy push
Given its abundance of natural resources—sun, wind, and the essential minerals required for clean energy technologies ranging from batteries to wind turbines—Australia has the potential to play a significant role in global renewable energy creation.
Additionally, Australia can be a major supplier of emerging technologies as well as critical minerals for the global transition to clean energy. It is the world’s leading producer of lithium, rare-earth elements, and cobalt. The world’s first shipment of liquefied hydrogen was made in 2022 when Australia’s Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) project produced and shipped the gas to Japan. Australia also has a wide range of pilot projects in the works for carbon capture and storage, and low-emission hydrogen technology, both of which are desirable for the de-carbonisation of industrial sectors where it is most difficult to cut emissions.
Meanwhile, according to Bowen, Australia has the greatest rooftop solar penetration rate in the world. In short, plans are in the works to reach 82% renewable energy by 2030.
Renewable energy is the most affordable and environmentally friendly energy source, and energy efficiency can lower costs and emissions too. The average cost of energy from solar and wind power is half that of energy from gas and coal. As technology advances, renewable energy will become more and more affordable.
Australians can be shielded from foreign energy price shocks by renewable energy just as they were shielded by the OPEC oil price rises of the 1970s by their reserves of coal and uranium. But to reach the commitment at COP28, significant investment is required. The transmission to clean energy requires infrastructure upgrades and grid stabilisation measures. Australia frequently experiences extreme weather conditions and its energy industry is faced with the challenge to become more resilient which will extend from output to logistics and distribution.
Australia’s government intends to spend $20 billion (USD 13.4 billion) to upgrade the grid’s reliability to meet the rising output of green energy. This will allow Canberra to achieve a 43% reduction in emissions by 2030. The government also plans to increase the share of clean energy to as much as 82% of the total electricity supply by 2030, up from roughly a third currently.
Australia still remains a major exporter of both fossil fuels and the critical minerals used in many clean energy technologies. A successful clean energy transition would support the country’s economic diversification and industrial growth while providing long-term resilience against global energy market shocks. Important advancements towards renewable energy are noticeable as one in three Australian homes, or three million homes, have solar PV installations totalling 17 GW of capacity.
Since the International Energy Agency’s  last review in 2018, Australia has passed the Climate Change Act (2022), which doubles the target for emissions reductions by 2030 and sets the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The Australian government also signed up to the Global Methane Pledge in 2022, joining 130 governments who are collectively targeting a reduction in methane emissions of at least 30% by 2030.
In recent months, the government has presented a host of policy strategies to fast-track the country’s energy transition. These include  the Rewiring the Nation Plan, the National Energy Transformation Partnership, and National Energy Performance Strategy.
Even with the stated objectives and the political will, significant investment is required. Planning delays, growing costs, and transmission bottlenecks are impeding the transition. For instance, in the National Electricity Market, just four renewable energy projects achieved financial close in the June quarter this year, whereas in the March quarter, no wind or solar projects received construction approval. This reinforces the pressure on federal and state governments to prolong the life of coal power plants until alternatives materialise. The current expansion of clean energy generation is well short of the four gigawatts annually estimated to meet 2030 targets.
Considering the COVID-19 outbreak, supply chain interruptions, the Ukraine crisis, and the Israel-Hamas conflict, the challenges to energy security are manifold. The main focus for Australia to successfully transition its fuel supply should be on grid adaptation, renewable energy infrastructure, and spending. Although Australia’s recent policy changes will strengthen the resilience of its energy system and encourage industrial growth and economic diversification, a comprehensive strategy is required to reduce the nation’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels and to reach the goal of net zero emissions reduction by 2050. Australia’s efforts to drive progress on low-emissions hydrogen and supplies of critical minerals, and its leadership on working with partners and international organisations to strengthen the diversity and resilience of clean energy supply chains will be crucial in the coming days to address this pressing challenge of the 21st century.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/15/fortress-debuts-high-voltage-all-in-one-residential-battery/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 15, 2024","Fortress debuts high-voltage, all-in-one residential battery","Fortress Power has announced its entry into the high-voltage energy storage residential market. It marked this milestone with the installation of its first residential Avalon System in late December.
The Avalon HV ESS system features a smart energy panel, customisable battery stack, and inverter. The system works inside and outside and is scalable up from 14.4 kWh to 176 kWh. It can be DC- or AC-coupled, with 200 A pass-through.
Operating at 200 V to 300 V at the DC terminal, the Avalon System closely matches PV array voltage, reducing the need for DC to DC conversion which, according to the manufacturer, enhances overall operational efficiency by approximately from 6 to 8%. 
The system includes a 7.6 kW or 11.4 kW inverter. It has four MPPTs with a voltage range of 80 V to 520 V and maximum input current per string of 16 A.
The Avalon Smart Energy Panel manages large loads in the house to stop the inverter from tripping. It can intelligently manage up to 12 different 120 V circuits, six 240 V circuits, or any combination, providing flexible whole home backup without a dedicated emergency power panel. 
With the integrated smart load panel, pre-installed AC coupling circuit, 200 A pass-through and straightforward EV charger installation, the Avalon System reduces the need for extra components, such as back up panel, AC combiner, separate smart load panel, bypass, and other, the manufacturer says.
Avalon boast a cycle life of more than 8,000 cycles and comes with a 10-year warranty. The system is based on tier 1 automotive grade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells.
Furthermore, for homeowners, Avalon could be turned into a source of revenue through the company’s EnergyBroker program by selling energy into wholesale markets or to extra energy.
“This helps achieve a shorter payback period while contributing to a more resilient and efficient power grid,” Fortress Power said.
