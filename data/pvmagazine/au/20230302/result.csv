The Newcastle-based company said the testing will enable it to support different operating regimes that can affect the efficiency of DER for the provision of grid services and participation in energy markets.
The lab, co-funded by the New South Wales (NSW) government, will emulate grid events and faults in order to test how a wide range of different manufacturers’ DER, including rooftop solar and residential batteries, will respond.
The facility will utilise PV and grid simulators to run testing scenarios such as phase imbalances, harmonics issues and the dispatch of Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS).
SwitchDin Chief Operating Officer Marc Sheldon said the lab will also provide an opportunity for the company’s customers to understand how different manufacturer DER will respond on their networks to deliver new grid services.
“This will be instrumental in supporting development work, the test lab and expanding our customer base,” he said. “In particular, the lab will support our work using SwitchDin’s cloud orchestration platform, Stormcloud, to coordinate a diverse fleet of solar inverters, batteries, EV chargers and other flexible loads.”

SwitchDin said the new test lab will also boost the company’s international expansion plans to Europe and the United States by allowing the lab to replicate grid environments in those markets.
The lab, being built at the company’s newly expanded headquarters has secured financial support through the NSW government’s $250 million Jobs Plus Program. SwitchDin said the support will lead to the creation of 55 direct and 33 indirect full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs by June 2024.
NSW Trade Minister Alister Henskens said the Jobs Plus Program is helping to unlock the enormous potential of home-grown businesses, as well as attracting global heavyweights to the state.
“These jobs will boost the state’s thriving economy, help to develop even more world-leading products, and cement NSW as Australia’s innovation capital,” he said.
Sydney-based modular solar array manufacturer 5B has also secured funding as part of the program with the company to grow its headquarters in Mascot to centralise its business operations. The government support is expected to deliver 30 direct and eight indirect FTE jobs by June 2024.
UK-based clean power and EV infrastructure company Zenobe is another recipient of funding under the program. The company said it will establish an office in Sydney as it looks to expand its operations across Australia and New Zealand.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/02/australian-startup-launches-lightweight-motor-for-electric-aircraft/,"EV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 2, 2023",Australian startup launches lightweight motor for electric aircraft,"Melbourne startup Kite Magnetics launched its 120 kW electric motor at the Avalon Air Show in Victoria this week, claiming the new lightweight offering will not only increase the range of electric aircraft but also enable a cleaner future for air travel.
Using nanocrystalline materials technology created by Dr Richard Parsons and Professor Kiyonori Suzuki at Monash University’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kite Magnetics has developed a high-performance electric motor that it says will enable small to medium-sized aircraft to fly further, carry more and emit less.
“We are proud to officially launch the world’s most powerful air-cooled electric motor for aircraft, the KM-120,” the company said. “Our lightweight electric motor is more powerful than a typical small car but only weighs as much as a full suitcase thanks to the use of our unique new magnetic material called Aeroperm.”
Parsons, founder and chief executive officer of Kite Magnetics, said the company’s technology involves a combination of novel nanocrystalline magnetic materials with advanced manufacturing methods that allows for the development of electric motors that are “significantly lighter and more efficient than anything available on the market today.”
The key nanocrystalline core material, which is mostly iron, cuts the energy wasted compared to existing core alloys, due to “quantum mechanical effects.”
“We are excited to launch not only the world’s most powerful air-cooled electric motor for electric aircraft but also the first commercially available electric motor that uses this new type of magnetic material,” Parsons said.
“With our Aeroperm magnetic materials technology, we can reduce the energy wasted in parts of an electric motor by more than 10 times. This means we can use air cooling even at very high power levels. This makes our motors simpler, more reliable and extremely lightweight.”
Kite Magnetics said the new KM-120 measures 300 mm x 387 mm and weighs in at 23 kgs, a figure that rises to 35 kgs when all the mountings, flange, etc are included. The company is now accepting orders for its new motors and expects to begin shipping to existing customers over the coming year.
The unveiling of the new motor comes just five months after Kite Magnetics secured $1.85 million (USD 1.25 million) in funding from venture capital fund Galileo Ventures, Investible Climate Tech Fund, Possible Ventures, Boson Ventures, and Breakthrough Victoria to accelerate the development of its technology.

Parsons sees potential to create electric motors for everything from cars to vacuums, but said aviation is the company’s initial focus, given the global aviation industry contributes three times more to climate change than all of Australia’s emissions combined.
“Currently, the biggest limitation of the adoption of electric aircraft is that they do not have enough range compared to conventional planes. The idea is that with our tech, electric aircraft can fly further and carry more,” he said.
“Our goal is to produce the enabling technologies for electric aviation so that emissions-free flight becomes possible in years, not decades. When the day comes that you can take off in an electric plane and see our motors hanging below the wing we will have achieved our mission.”
Parsons said outside of aviation, the company also sees opportunities for its electric motor and generator technology to transfer to a wide range of other industries, such as cars, buses, boats and trains.

The Glenrowan Solar Farm is one of six large-scale energy generation and storage projects to have won supply contracts under the state’s second renewable energy target auction (VRET2). Together, the projects will deliver 623 MW of new generation and up to 365 MW/600 MWh of new energy storage.
Pacific Partnerships Managing Director Simon Nicholls said the 10-year PPA for the sale of energy from the Glenrowan Solar Farm created the investment certainty required for the company to push ahead with the project which is expected to commence operations in late 2023.
“Securing a long-term VRET2 support agreement with the state of Victoria for clean power from the Glenrowan Solar Farm has been instrumental in giving the certainty needed to secure the connection agreements, regulatory approvals as well as construction and operations contracts to achieve financial close,” he said.
Pacific Partnerships through its energy business, Pacific Partnerships Energy, will develop and manage the Glenrowan Solar Farm with fellow Cimic Group company UGL to oversee construction, operations and maintenance of the asset being developed on a 245-hectare site about two kilometres southwest of Glenrowan, approximately 230 kilometres northeast of Melbourne.
UGL has already begun construction of the project with piling works commencing late last month. It’s expected this work, which involves the installation of approximately 35,000 piles, will take about three months to complete.
Once operational, the Glenrowan Solar Farm is expected to generate more than 260 GWh of clean energy per year, enough to power approximately 45,000 Victorian homes and support the government’s renewable energy ambitions.

Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the power generated from the solar farm will put the state one step closer to reaching its updated target of 100% renewable electricity across government operations by 2025.
“We have real climate action ambition – 95% renewable energy by 2035 and net-zero by 2045. And with construction starting today, this new solar farm will help us get there,” she said.
The Glenrowan Solar Farm is one of six renewable energy projects given the green light under the VRET2 auction which D’Ambrosio said will attract “billions of dollars of investment into regional Victoria.”
The VRET2 scheme is part of the state government’s plan to drive investment in all six renewable energy zones located across Victoria. The Victorian government has estimated the scheme will support the creation of 920 direct jobs and attract $1.48 billion (USD 1.02 billion) in new renewable energy projects in the state, with strong local content requirements resulting in about $1 billion of this being spent in local supply chains during construction.
VRET2 projects will also help meet Victoria’s new renewable energy storage target of at least 2.6 GW of energy storage capacity by 2030.

BMW has finally put its iX5 Hydrogen vehicle on the road, after four years of development. “In the course of the year, the pilot fleet will be used worldwide by various target groups for trial and demonstration purposes,” said the German automaker. BMW uses fuel cells sourced from Toyota Motor. The vehicle’s powertrain has a maximum output of 295 kW/401 hp. The gaseous hydrogen needed to supply the fuel cell is stored in two 700-bar tanks made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Together, they hold 6 kg of hydrogen, giving the BMW iX5 Hydrogen a range of 504 km in the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure (WLTP) cycle. Refuelling the hydrogen tanks takes three to four minutes. “We will go into production in the second half of this decade,” said Juergen Guldner, BMW’s hydrogen program manager.
Everfuel and Hy24 have announced a new joint venture to finance the accelerated development of electrolyser capacity across Scandinavia. Everfuel will own 51% of the venture, and the Hy24-managed Clean H2 Infra Fund will own 49%. The venture plans to invest €200 million ($313 million) in equity in green hydrogen infrastructure in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, in order to build, own and operate up to 1 GW of green hydrogen projects.
Sinopec has launched a methanol-to-hydrogen and hydrogen refuelling service station in Dalian, China. “The storage and transportation cost of methanol is also much lower than hydrogen, making methanol-to-hydrogen an ideal hydrogen production technology,” said the company.
John Cockerill and the Vietnamese authorities have agreed to collaborate on the development and production of renewable energy and green hydrogen. Vietnam sees Belgium as a preferential partner in hydrogen research.
StormFisher Hydrogen and Germany’s Kiwi have signed a deal to advance the development of green hydrogen-related projects in North America and Europe. “The partnership falls in line with ambitions from the Canadian and German government to enhance energy security with clean Canadian hydrogen,” said the two companies. Kiwi runs an industrial power-to-gas plant in Werlte, Germany.
GeoPura has secured GBP 36 million ($64 million) in an investment round led by GM Ventures, along with Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital, SWEN CP, and Siemens Energy Ventures. The UK green hydrogen producer said it aims to mass produce hydrogen power units (HPUs) with its partner, Siemens Energy. GeoPura plans to deploy a fleet of more than 3,600 HPUs by 2033.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/02/scratching-the-surface-of-silicon-in-tandem-solar-cells/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 2, 2023",Scratching the surface of silicon in tandem solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists led by Germany’s Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) have investigated how work on the surface of the silicon cell could lead to further improvements in perovskite-silicon tandem cell production.
In silicon wafer and cell production, the surface of the wafer is usually given a texture of tiny pyramid shapes, which serve to reduce reflection and trap more light in the cell. This texture is usually achieved by dipping wafers into liquid chemicals, which remove some silicon and leave behind the textured surface.
Some other processes, usually involving firing a plasma substance at the silicon surface, are known to offer better control over the size and uniformity of the bumps that make up the texture. Most manufacturers, however, see these as too complex and costly, with only a limited benefit compared to the wet chemical process.
Placing a perovskite solar cell on top, however, adds new requirements for the silicon surface. Many of the achievements made so far with tandem cells have been done on a silicon cell with no texturing, which makes it easier to integrate the perovskite but represents a lost opportunity for the silicon cell efficiency. The group at HZB investigated some of the more complex texturing processes and found that the increased control and smaller surface textures they afford could solve the perovskite integration challenge, or even be of interest again for single-junction silicon cells.
“For tandem cells, a uniform and small-sized Si texture is crucial in order to be able to wet process the perovskite top cell,” the group explained. “We showed that sub-micrometer sized random pyramids by an adjusted wet etching process are an interesting approach not only for such tandem solar cells but also for SHJ single junction solar cells.”
In their paper, Double-sided nano-textured surfaces for industry compatible high-performance silicon heterojunction and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the group describes experiments with different etching solutions. They found that varying the composition of the solution enabled them to control the size of the pyramids on the surface, maintaining the desirable anti-reflective features of the etched surface, while making it easier to place the perovskite layer on top.
“All JV parameters were similar or even slightly better as compared to those of cells with our standard micro-texture,” said the group.
Using these new nano-texturing processes, the group demonstrated a 28.9% efficient tandem cell. The researchers said they are confident that such a process could be adopted at scale.
“We expect that the presented processes will be easy to be implemented in industrial production and, hence, will contribute to the development of a production process for highly efficient tandem solar cells,” they said.
