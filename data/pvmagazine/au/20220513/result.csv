The IEA said this week that despite persistent pandemic-induced supply chain challenges, construction delays, and record-level raw material and commodity prices, renewable capacity additions increased by a record 6% globally in 2021.
In its latest Renewable Energy Market report, the IEA suggests new capacity for generating electricity from solar, wind and other renewables will grow to a record high in 2022, rising by more than 8% compared with last year, up by nearly 320GW with China, Latin America and the European Union (EU) leading the way.
IEA executive director Fatih Birol said the Russian invasion of Ukraine has added new urgency to accelerate clean energy transitions with governments increasingly looking to take advantage of renewables’ energy security and climate benefits.
“Energy market developments in recent months, especially in Europe, have proven once again the essential role of renewables in improving energy security, in addition to their well-established effectiveness at reducing emissions,” he said.
“Cutting red tape, accelerating permitting and providing the right incentives for faster deployment of renewables are some of the most important actions governments can take to address today’s energy security and market challenges, while keeping alive the possibility of reaching our international climate goals.”
Solar PV is forecast to account for 60% of the increase in global renewable capacity this year with the IEA predicting the commissioning of 190GW, a 25% gain from last year. The Paris-based body said utility-scale projects account for almost two-thirds of overall PV expansion in 2022, mostly driven by a strong policy environment in China and the EU driving faster deployment.

China accounted for 46% of worldwide renewable capacity additions in 2021 and is expected to largely maintain its market share of deployment in 2022-2023, with the commissioning of more than 140GW on average per year, driven mostly by large-scale solar PV deployment.
The growth in renewables comes despite elevated commodity and freight prices. The IEA said prices for many raw materials and freight costs have been on an increasing trend since the beginning of 2021. By March 2022, the price of PV-grade polysilicon more than quadrupled, steel increased by 50%, copper rose by 70%, aluminium doubled and freight costs rose almost five-fold.
“Compared with 2020, we estimate that the overall investment costs of new utility-scale PV and onshore wind plants are from 15% to 25% higher in 2022,” the IEA wrote.
“Surging freight costs are the biggest contributor to overall price increases for onshore wind. For solar PV, the impact is more evenly divided among elevated prices for freight, polysilicon and metals.”

While predicting solar PV costs will remain higher in 2022 and 2023 than pre-pandemic levels, the IEA said the technology’s price competitiveness had actually improved due to much sharper increases in natural gas and coal prices.
“Although costs for new solar PV and wind installations have increased, reversing a decade-long cost reduction trend, natural gas, oil, and coal prices have risen much faster, therefore actually further improving the competitiveness of renewable electricity,” it said.
While the outlook for new renewable energy capacity additions looks strong for 2022, the IEA cautioned that based on current policies “renewable power’s global growth is set to lose momentum next year”.
While solar PV is forecast to break another record in 2023, reaching almost 200GW, this is offset by an expected 40% decline in hydropower expansion and “little change” in wind additions.
“In the absence of stronger policies, the amount of renewable power capacity added worldwide is expected to plateau in 2023,” it said. “Ultimately, the forecast of renewable markets for 2023 and beyond will depend on whether new and stronger policies will be introduced and implemented in the next six months.”

Australia leads the world in the uptake of rooftop solar PV, with about one third of the nation’s homes already installing solar systems, but the rollout of household batteries and storage solutions is yet to reach those lofty heights.
That is now changing with residential users of renewable power becoming increasingly aware of energy storage’s essential role in maintaining reliable power supply.
Australian households’ enthusiasm for batteries has built in recent years. In 2020, 23,796 batteries with a combined capacity of 238MWh were installed, up from the 22,621 household batteries installed in 2019.
Australian home battery installation company Natural Solar recently revealed it has witnessed a 400% increase in battery installs across Australia in the past two years.
Natural Solar chief executive officer Chris Williams said the company’s battery installs were 419% higher in August 2021 compared to the same time in 2019, with enquiries peaking in October 2021, where they were up 449% from 2019.
“92% of all of the systems we [now] install across the country residentially are either a combination of solar and battery, or adding a battery to an existing solar system,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/13/ev-policy-should-be-front-and-centre-this-election-but-its-fallen-by-the-wayside/,"EV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 13, 2022","EV policy should be front and centre this election, but its fallen by the wayside","If there’s one silver lining to Scott Morrison’s comments last election that the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) would “ruin the weekend,” it at least put the topic on mind of all Australians. 
Three years on, there’s not a zinging one-liner in sight. Despite EVs increasing in capabilities and growing their market share around the globe, there’s significantly less debate on them from our national leaders. Labor at least attempted to make this a headline issue, announcing a $500 million fund to rollout charging stations across the country. The Greens raised the bar even further with a $6.1 billion plan, looking to rekindle car manufacturing in South Australia by empowering the state to tap into the growing global market for EVs.
Yet neither policy has courted a reply from The Coalition, nor have they drawn any real focus on the issue. If anything, EV policy should be front and centre this election. According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) global EV outlook, EV sales doubled last year to 6.6 million. Yet in Australia, EVs accounted for only 2% of total vehicle sales – roughly 20,665 cars.

An educated guess as to why our leaders are tip-toeing into or around this issue, would be that they’ve seen this figure and believe it is indicative of actual demand for EVs in Australia. It suggests despite global growth, EVs are still a fringe issue in this country – one that won’t win votes.
However, as the leader of a company at the coal face of this trend, the reality is a lot more nuanced. The current policy path of ignoring this trend until it’s too big to ignore is setting up a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. 
EV adoption hinges on action from Canberra. Lingering supply chain problems are prohibiting the variety of EVs entering Australia, which is keeping prices of cars high and stifling overall adoption. Compared to other countries, there’s also little incentive for consumers to adopt an EV in Australia. Many models are still a target for federal luxury car taxes, and separate state-based schemes introducing taxes for kilometres travelled.  
Beyond this, our customers still convey hesitation around the number of fast charging stations in their area. Their concern is that if they get an EV, they’ll be stuck plugging their car into a wall at home for hours to be able to use it on any given week.
This is essentially a chicken and egg problem. If policy is put in place to address this issue then the sector will grow. If left unchecked, the sector will still grow, but Australia will be left behind to become a global dumping ground for other country’s second-hard combustion engine cars as they move further towards mainstream EV adoption. 
This can’t be ignored forever. Eventually, Australia’s response to climate change will have to focus on the way we move around our cities and the country. We still rank among the top 10 countries globally in the number of cars per capita. The electrification of mobility in Australia is a fundamental piece in reducing our overall emissions and meeting net zero targets.
Carbar
While this election is focused on cost of living, longer term EVs will play a key role in reducing household costs, especially when paired with household energy capture and storage technology. We’re currently see this play out in Europe, where investment in this technology has helped some countries weather the effects of a strained supply in natural gas from Russia.
It’s disappointing that EV adoption policy in Australia has been put on the back-burner this election. The concern is that action on this issue will be slow regardless of who gets into power, simply because it’s not generating as much buzz as it should during the campaign. 
Getting the policy setting on this topic right now will ensure our ability to keep up with the global growth. To be clear: EVs won’t “ruin the weekend,” but failing to mount an adequate policy response to their adoption will ruin our ability to capitalise and get ahead of this global trend.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/13/aquila-capital-confirms-1gw-solar-pv-pipeline-for-new-zealand/,"INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 13, 2022",Aquila Capital confirms 1GW solar PV pipeline for New Zealand,"Auckland-based renewables developer Far North Solar Farm (FNSF) announced on Thursday it had partnered with German investment manager and asset development company Aquila Capital to develop an estimated $1 billion suite of large-scale solar PV projects across New Zealand’s North and South islands.
FNSF, which late last year commenced construction of a 16MW solar farm near Pukenui in the Far North, said the pipeline of projects could supply approximately 4% of New Zealand’s total annual energy demand and would represent approximately 11% of the country’s current clean energy generation capacity.
The 1GW pipeline includes multiple project sites across the North and South islands with FNSF confirming it has already secured 13 sites close to transmission points.
FNSF director John Telfer said both companies have “invested significant capital and resources to select and assess suitable project sites and obtain the required permits and consents to advance these sites to ready-to-build status”.
“We can’t wait to start constructing the solar photovoltaic sites we have planned and consented,” he said.
“To be partnering with such a committed global investor in clean energy generation as Aquila Capital, and on the scale we collectively intend, is exciting not only for us but also the entire country.”
Telfer said the companies aim to break ground on at least four North Island projects this year with the remainder of the projects to be rolled out over the next two to five years.

Hamburg-based Aquila Capital, which manages more than 12GW of wind, solar PV and hydropower assets globally, said the projects would support New Zealand’s clean energy transition and target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
Aquila Asia Pacific chief executive officer Alexander Lenz said the companies had been encouraged by New Zealand’s progressive renewable energy targets and the government’s soon-to-be-announced Emissions Reductions Plan.
“We are excited to reach this stage of development after assessing all possible sites and preparing for our solar PV build-out with FNSF,” he said. “This would not have been possible without New Zealand’s focus on meeting its progressive clean energy targets. The time for clean energy is now, and together with FNSF, we are ready to support New Zealand’s ambitious energy transition goals.”
The announcement comes as FNSF continues construction on its Pukenui solar farm being developed on the Far North’s Te Aupōuri peninsular. The $30 million project will comprise 32,000 solar panels spread across a 12-hectare site. The asset is expected to be commence generation later this year.
FSNF and Aquila Capital are the latest firms to target solar developments in the land of the long white cloud.
While the largest operational PV facility in the country is Sunergise’s 2.1MW Kapuni Solar Power Plant that began operations in May last year, power companies Meridian, Contact Energy and Genesis and new players Lodestone and Helios have all announced plans to build solar developments of various sizes in the past 12 months.
Meridian last year revealed it plans to build a 100MW grid-connected battery and solar farm at Marsden Point north of Auckland, while New Zealand’s Contact Energy has partnered with Lightsource bp, the renewables arm of Britain-based BP, to build out a large-scale solar portfolio of up to 380,000MWh by 2026.

New Zealand renewables developer Lodestone Energy has announced plans to build five solar farms in the upper North Island at a cost of $300m while English developers Hive Energy, Ethical Power Group and Solar South West have set up a joint venture they hope will lead to 350MW of utility scale installations in NZ.
Helios Energy, a collaboration of United States and New Zealand developers, has also committed to grid-scale solar developments in NZ while government majority-owned Genesis Energy announced it will be working with FRV Australia to deliver 500MW of solar power capacity across the country over the next five years.
These commitments come with New Zealand’s biggest solar array currently under construction. The 150MW Kōwhai Park solar farm is being developed by Christchurch Airport on a 400ha site adjacent to its runways. The project will scale up over the next 30 years with the first stage to deliver a 220-hectare solar array capable of generating enough electricity to power 30,000 homes.
Australian renewable energy fund Solar Bay has committed $100 million to the development of phase one and investment director Jack Sherratt said the project would set the standard for large-scale solar in New Zealand.
“There is nothing else like this in New Zealand – it’s innovative, far ahead of its time and absolutely world-leading in every sense,” he said. “The phase one solar array is 50 times larger than any existing array in the country – and it’s just the beginning.”
