The estimated $500 million Northern Midlands project is to be built on a 543-hectare site near the town of Cressy, about 35 kilometres southwest of Launceston.
The solar farm, which is currently in the planning phase, is to be connected to the nearby Palmerston substation by a 220 kV double circuit overhead transmission line. The project also has scope for the addition of a battery energy storage system.
TasRex, which was officially launched at the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone on Thursday, said the Northern Midlands Solar Farm is part of a portfolio of proposed solar and wind energy projects.
Headed by Bess Clark, the former chief executive officer of the Marinus Link transmission project, TasRex said its vision is to be Tasmania’s integrated renewable energy company, creating end-to-end value for all Tasmanians in the green energy supply chain.
“Tasmania is a leader in renewable energy; we look forward to building on this legacy to create a cleaner future and prosperous Tasmania for generations to come,” Clark said.
The company earlier this year penned a memorandum of understanding with the Tasmania government which Energy Minister Nick Duigan said “covers onshore and offshore renewable energy opportunities” and TasRex’s commitment to a Tasmanian supply chain and local jobs.
Under the non-binding agreement, TasRex will work with the Tasmanian government to increase the state’s renewable energy production, developing specific solar and wind energy projects with a goal of reaching a total installed capacity of 5 GW.
“We share the view that Tasmania is extremely well placed to develop more renewable energy to support our long-term plan for a growing economy and supporting jobs,” Duigan said.
“The state needs more renewable electricity to meet the demand of our growing economy and future industries, to ensure our energy security, to keep power prices low, and continue our zero emissions status.”
“We are the renewables powerhouse of Australia and we intend to remain there, and projects by local companies like TasRex can help us to achieve this vision.”

The $1.3 million (USD 830,000) project, partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to the tune of $499,744, is expected to reduce barriers to the connection and operation of inverter-based resources by helping system planners avoid upcoming oscillatory instability issues that can be caused by high levels of wind and solar.
By reducing instability, the new project aims to support the growth of renewable energy generation, optimise production from existing wind and solar projects, and encourage investment in additional renewable sources.
The NEM has faced ongoing operational challenges since 2018 due to the large uptake of inverter-based resources such as wind and solar, and the reduction in participation of conventional synchronous generators.
In 2019-20, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) curtailed the contribution of five solar farms for eight months while it worked to identify and address the causes of oscillatory instability in the West Murray Region of Victoria.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the challenge of oscillatory instability needs to be addressed to avoid issues in the long term for the NEM.
“To manage the risk of instability in an increasingly inverter-based grid, it is necessary to build reliable and efficient tools that can identify root causes early,” he said. “These tools should also be useful to explore the suitability of solutions for a grid increasingly dominated by renewable generation.”
Miller said he is confident the work being done by the Monash team could help in the ramp up of new renewable energy generation and storage projects.
The tool will be suitable for use by the AEMO and transmission network service providers, and will have applications for system planning, grid connection and operations purposes.
Associate Professor Behrooz Bahrani, head of the Monash Grid Innovation Hub which will lead the research, said the project aims to pave the way for a robust, reliable and renewable future for Australia’s energy infrastructure.
“Enhancing the resilience and stability of our national energy grid is paramount as we accelerate our transition to renewable energy,” he said.
“Monash is committed to doing all we can to facilitate the seamless integration of renewables into our grid, and we’re optimistic about the innovative solutions this collaboration will bring forth.”

The state government said it is seeking registrations of interest (ROI) from large commercial and industrial users, both generators and loads, regarding their plans for increasing demand for low-emissions electricity and related renewable energy project builds to supply major projects in the South-West interconnected System (SWIS).
Generation capacity in WA’s main grid is forecast to increase dramatically in the next two decades with the SWIS Demand Assessment, released earlier this year, anticipating an additional 7.2 GW of new industry electricity demand will occur in the SWIS by 2042.
Supplying this level of demand with electricity generated largely from renewable energy sources would require SWIS generation capacity to increase from 5.9 GW in 2022 to 51.1 GW of new generation and storage capacity. The majority of this new generation capacity is expected to be large-scale wind and solar, increasing from 1.2 GW in 2022 to reach 41.8 GW in 2042.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said large-scale investment in new transmission infrastructure will be essential to service this anticipated renewable generation and enable the supply of low-emissions electricity to all SWIS users.
“We are encouraging major industry customers to register their interest to be part of this once-in-a-generation transmission network growth as we power towards net zero by 2050,” he said.
“SWIS Demand Assessment modelling indicated industrial demand over the next 20 years would require almost 10 times the amount of generation capacity currently available.”
Johnston said the registrations of interest will help shape major transmission builds for the state, helping to deliver a clean energy future.
Coordinated by state-owned utility Western Power and Energy Policy WA, the ROI will help inform how and when future transmission builds could happen, including potential renewable energy hubs locations, to connect the renewables to the grid.
Energy Policy WA said the ROI process will help to establish the customer base that will shape those future major transmission expansion projects and prioritise areas for grid investment. The process will also help shape new funding mechanisms for accessing network capacity and will form the basis for potential new policy settings.
The ROI will provide industrial customers an opportunity to submit their project plans, status, timing, and willingness to contribute to network augmentation and connection costs. It is expected proposed projects will need to be commissioned prior to 2030 and proponents will need to demonstrate their ability to commit to network augmentation costs of about $100,000 per MW prior to 2026/27.
The ROI process will close on 1 November 2023.

Scientists from South Korea’s Inha University have developed a novel solar irradiance model that can purportedly predict data for a whole year with only two weeks of learning period.
The model is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm and is claimed to be particularly suitable with limited accumulated data.
“Reinforcement learning is an algorithm that independently maximises rewards through trial-and-error within a given environment,” the academics explained. “This is the first attempt to use a reinforcement learning for solar irradiance prediction model.”
In the study “Solar irradiance prediction using reinforcement learning pre-trained with limited historical data,” published in Energy Reports, the researchers explained that the learning data was set for the first two weeks of the year, while the prediction period was set for the remaining part of the year.
As inputs for those two weeks, the scientists used real data from Cape Town, South Africa, based on four metrics – sky cover, temperature, humidity, and out-of-atmosphere solar irradiance. They then compared the analysis made by the model with that of two reference models based on long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.
“The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning,” the research group added. “It introduces a memory cell state to the RNN. The memory cell state demonstrates superior performance in managing long sequence inputs.”
On a monthly average, the researchers found that the proposed model had a prediction error 0f 31.5 W/m2, which represented a 7% variation from the actual data. In comparison, the two LSTM models used in the experiment showed an average error of 57.4 W/m2 or 12.8% and of 40.5 W/m2 or 9.2%, respectively.
Furthermore, the researchers ascertained that, with the proposed model, approximately 82.8% of the points were distributed within 10% of the upper and lower errors of the actual results. With the two LSTM models, these values decreased to 71.9% and 78.8%, respectively.
“The proposed model displayed more optimised performance with only two weeks of learning data when compared to previous studies which typically required several years’ worth of weather data for learning,” the researchers concluded. “In particular, the long-term performance of the model was improved by learning the out-of-atmosphere solar irradiance as an input.”
