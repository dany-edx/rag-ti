Hydrogen could soon be stored in “nano-chocolates” instead of 700-bar pressure tanks, according to recent research by scientists from Germany’s Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) institute. The researchers claim that they have managed to bind hydrogen with the help of palladium and iridium, before releasing it again.
Palladium, a precious metal, is considered suitable for long-term hydrogen storage. The element absorbs hydrogen like a sponge, according to DESY.
“However, until now getting the hydrogen out of the material again has posed a problem,” explains Andres Stierle, the leader of the research team. “That’s why we are trying palladium particles that are only about 1 nanometer across.”
The special structure of the storage medium has driven comparisons with chocolate pralines. The small particles are built up like pralines and embed an iridium core that provides needed stability. On the outside, a layer of palladium surrounds the core. The palladium-iridium “pralines” themselves are only 1.2 nanometers in size and were fixed onto the graphene at intervals of just 2 nanometers.
Using an X-ray light source, the researchers were able to follow how hydrogen molecules bind to the palladium particles and then loosen again. This enabled them to see that the hydrogen only binds to the surface of the palladium, and that it can be easily removed from the palladium by slightly increasing the temperature.
Conventional hydrogen storage methods require the gas to be liquified or kept in pressurised tanks, at up to 700 bar. This means cooling it down to minus 253 C. However, DESY’s proposed approach purportedly requires much less energy.
“Next, we want to find out which storage densities we could achieve with the new method,” says Stierle.
However, the researchers will need to change the carbon medium to do this. In order to enlarge the surface on which the palladium nanoparticles can be arranged and to accommodate the particles in “significant quantities,” the researchers are considering carbon sponges.
They recently published their findings in ACS Nano, a journal produced by the American Chemical Society.

Germany-based car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz has presented this week the Vision EQXX, the newest model of its electric car fleet.
According to the company, the vehicle is the most efficient electric car it has ever built, thanks to outstanding energy consumption of less than 10kWh per 100km and a range of more than 1,000km.
The car features a newly built in-house system that is claimed to achieve a benchmark efficiency of 95%, from battery to wheels. “The battery pack in the Vision EQXX holds almost 100kWh of energy, yet has 50% less volume and is 30% lighter than the … benchmark pack in [the] EQS,” the manufacturer stated, referring to one of its best known electric vehicles.
Starting from 2024, all the vehicles in the series will be equipped with 117 solar cells placed on the roof.
“It was developed in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE – Europe’s largest solar energy research institute,” Mercedes-Benz said in a statement. “The net result of reducing the energy drain on the high-voltage system is an increase in range. On a single day, and under ideal conditions, this can add up to 25km of range on long-distance journeys.”
The power generated by the solar cells is stored in a lightweight lithium-iron-phosphate battery which supplies a climate blower, the lights, the infotainment system and other ancillaries. “Mercedes-Benz and its partners are working towards using solar power to charge the high-voltage system, too,” the manufacturer further explained.
In a recent interview with pv magazine, Bonna Newman, program manager for PV and mobility module technologies at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), said that electric cars incorporating PV modules on their bodywork or roof have the potential to reach more than 10,000km per year of pure solar-powered driving and that the modules could have a payback time of just three to four years. According to her, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and power prices.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/06/novel-design-for-shingled-solar-modules/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 6, 2022",Novel design for shingled solar modules,"From pv magazine Global. 
Researchers at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) have proposed a new design for shingled solar modules that they claim could make these products less susceptible to shading and hotspots, which remain the main hurdles to overcome for wider commercial adoption of this PV technology.
“Rather than proposing a particular interconnection or module architecture as a one-size-fits-all solution, our work offers a design framework based on minimising potentially dangerous hotspot temperatures while granting manufacturers the flexibility to play around with different design parameters,” the research’s corresponding author, Carlos Clement, told pv magazine. “Ideally, the way this would work is a manufacturer chooses a cell technology, may it be p-type PERC or whichever they choose, and through our model, one would generate a matrix of module parameters such as string length, cell fraction and number of strings, where the hotspot risk for each specific combination is quantified. The analysis can also be performed in the opposite direction, with specific module characteristics constrained first and then suitable cell technologies and characteristics determined afterwards.“
In the paper “Design of shading- and hotspot-resistant shingled modules”, which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics, the SERIS team developed an electrothermal model intended at creating a framework for the design of shingled panels that are resistant to shading and hotspots. “For the purposes of this study, we chose to model and test shingled modules manufactured from pPERC cells that were cut into one-fifth pieces via thermal laser separation for improved mechanical properties,” the scientists specified. “From our previous study, we learned that p-type cells exhibit an illumination-dependent effect on their leakage current as the cell approaches breakdown.”
Through the modelling approach, the researchers initially simulated a shingled module’s power and hotspot response to shading. They built mini-modules from 12 shingles that were laminated on 20x20cm glass with the same encapsulant and backsheet used in full-sized modules. These panels were tested under negative voltages and standard irradiation conditions and their cell parameters were extracted.
The model was then validated through experimental data. “The accuracy of this model depends largely on how well our split-cell subcircuit can capture cell behaviour at negative voltages approaching breakdown,” they further explained, noting that a simulation was performed on module power responses for different configurations of shingled modules. The electrothermal model developed was found to adequately capture the hotspot and shading response of the panels.
These insights were then used to set up the above-mentioned framework for designing hotspot-resistant shingled modules. This requires, first, understanding, via Monte Carlo simulations (MCS), which input cell characteristics are more suitable in a multivariate system where parameters are varying together. “From the perspective of minimising power loss, it is advantageous to have cells which have more leakage current,” the academics emphasised. “This can be explained by how larger leakage currents allow the shaded cell to match the current of the other series-connected cells without being pushed further into reverse bias.”
According to the research group, raising the number of strings determines, for the shaded cells, a delay in bypass diode activation and larger reverse voltages, which in turn result in higher maximum temperature measured in the cell itself. This, in their view, makes string length one of the most influential design levers in determining hotspot temperature. With an increasing number of parallel strings per block, the shaded string becomes able to operate at lower currents, and lower hotspot temperature.
“The work outlined here is perfectly compatible with existing manufacturing techniques for shingled modules,” Clement told pv magazine.
