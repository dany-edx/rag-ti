CEO and co-founder of RedEarth, Charlie Walker, told pv magazine Australia that the deal will encompass thousands of Australian homes over time, with the first tranche of solar-enabled residences currently under construction.
He’s not naming the developer just yet, but says more details of the agreement will soon be revealed.
Home buyers can opt for a minimum 6.3 kW solar system (no battery), or a solar-battery combination that completely powers their electricity needs, no grid required — and many configurations in between. They will also be eligible for subsidies or interest-free loans as offered in their state of residence.
Benefits of integrating solar at building stage include the lower costs enabled by bulk-buying and manufacture, as well as consistency of installation for contractors.  
“In Australia,” says Walker, “you’ve got more than enough energy hitting people’s roofs every day to create an excess of electricity. It’s just smart to make, use and store your own power, and to monetise the excess.”
RedEarth uses the software of another innovative and proven Australian technology provider to securely monitor and manage energy production and use in its VPP. 
By selling excess energy back into the grid when energy prices are high, or offtaking for other energy users, he calculates the RedEarth VPP will realise “up to 80 cents a kilowatt hour” for excess residential generation.  The management system will constantly optimise the price it can get for its customers’ energy.
RedEarth’s platform can support the grid and VPP member interests by coordinating its participants within a particular postcode to supply energy locally at a slightly better price than other providers can when supply to that area is unable to meet demand for a period of time, says Walker, and as its capacity grows it can also help moderate grid-wide shortages.
Even though they won’t get as high a return, customers on the RedEarth platform can also choose to sell their energy back to their electricity provider, such as Origin or AGL, for a credit that they can then pass on to relatives or friends.
“A better return than you get from Warren Buffet”
Walker says RedEarth treats every solar system in its VPP as an investment, and provides quarterly reports on the returns each system has generated.
Other benefits of this VPP include constant monitoring of solar/battery performance via secure telemetry; the system raises an alarm with RedEarth if generation isn’t up to expectations or if a fault occurs.
“We aim to call the customer before they call us,” says Walker.
And VPP participants can contact RedEarth if they want to increase the capacity of their system, say, when they buy an electric vehicle and need more battery storage to power their commute.
Walker says that even though Australia leads the world in rooftop solar uptake, with one in four homes now generating their own energy, the mass movement has yet to be realised.
“This is early stages, but we do see that every rooftop in Australia becoming its own power plant is a way to intelligently set up a renewables-capable grid.”

RedEarth released its first Personal Power Plants in 2019, after several years of development and testing; and also supplies Australian engineered and manufactured products to the off-grid and large-scale energy storage markets.
He says existing homes that want to join its new VPP are welcome, but RedEarth believes that at this stage of Australia’s renewable transition targeting new builds is “the way to get the most progress, most quickly”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/15/australias-biggest-community-solar-farm-starts-feeding-into-the-grid/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 15, 2021",Australia’s biggest community solar farm starts feeding into the grid,"Majura Community Solar Farm was eight years in gestation, and on Friday morning it woke up to the sun! 
The 1 MW generator is co-owned by some 550 people in the Canberra community, each of whom has invested between $500 and $100,000 to take part in Australia’s energy transition, and make a reasonable return in the process.
“We’re really pleased to have the kind of structure where we can have hundreds of investors, particularly those people who might rent or live in apartments,” Lawrence McIntosh, Principal Executive Officer of SolarShare told pv magazine Australia in 2019. 
Profits resulting from Majura’s annual revenue, calculated at more than $360,000, will be proportionally returned to investors.
Nick Fejer, Chair of SolarShare, said members in Majura can expect a 5% return within 12 months, possibly even by the end of the 2020-21 financial year, depending on the weather.
Fejer assured investors on Friday that although Australia is experiencing a La Niña weather phase at the moment, along with its cooler temperatures and fewer sunny days, the economic modelling for the solar fam is conservative and takes such variations into account.
The idea of a community-owned solar farm was originally mooted by the ACT Government, which has since also guaranteed a feed-in tariff for energy generated by the Majura project of 19.56 cents per kilowatt hour for the coming 20 years.
The first sod was turned on the three-hectare site — which is leased from nearby Mount Majura Vineyard — at the end of August last year, after renewable energy developer CWP Renewables provided an $800,000 loan in 2019, to cover the shortfall required for the 2.4 million project to go ahead.
McIntosh told pv magazine Australia today that, “Everyone involved is credibly proud that all those years of work have paid off. It was great to see this fabulous community of people who we’ve had around us — the investors, as well as service providers, the ACT government — getting a chance to see the project come to fruition in a really good way.”
Around 30% of Australians are still excluded from the benefits of powering their lives with renewable energy, for reasons such as they rent their home, or they have an unsuitably shaded roof or roof space too small to accommodate viable solar PV generation. 
“We’ve now got a model that works,” for including more people in the renewable transition, said ACT Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury at the celebration of generation from Majura. He added, “There’s no reason why it can’t be replicated. I’d like to think this is really just the first of this scale.”
Majura Community Solar Farm still holds the title of the largest community solar farm in Australia, although nearby Goulburn Community Energy Cooperative now has plans for a 1.2 MW solar farm on vacant land leased from the Australian Rail Track Corporation on the edge of the regional city.
McIntosh says SolarShare’s next investment is most likely to be in behind-the-meter solar generation, either rooftop or ground mounted, for local industry or commercial ventures.
Epho Commercial Solar, which was recently acquired by AGL, consulted on and built the Majura solar farm, and is contracted to run operations and maintenance on the project for the coming two years, after which the contract will be renegotiated.
In the meantime this community-owned generator will produce enough energy to power 250 homes and abate some 1,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide.
“On Thursday, we felt we were energising not just a solar power plant, but a whole community of people transitioning themselves to a more sustainable future,” says McIntosh.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/15/international-solar-fund-weathers-australias-storms-oscillations-and-grid-constraints/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,INSURANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 15, 2021","International solar fund weathers Australia’s storms, oscillations and grid constraints","Foresight Solar Fund, a UK-based renewable-energy fund with international assets that include Australia’s Longreach, Bannerton, and Oakey 1 and Oakey 2 solar farms, last week released its annual results for 2020, providing insights into performance of solar investments and energy-market impacts not readily available from unlisted asset holders.
With 723 MW of ground-mounted solar installed in the UK, 124.6 MW in Spain, and 146 MW installed in Australia, Foresight named the Covid-19 pandemic and the company’s efforts to keep its workforces safe as the greatest challenge to its operations in 2020.
Despite underperformance of its Australian assets, which were acquired during 2017 and 2018 and make up about 15% of the fund’s portfolio, Foresight saw continued growth in 2020, paid a dividend of 6.91 pence (almost 12 cents) per share, diversified its portfolio by acquiring four subsidy-free greenfield assets in Spain, and secured overwhelming approval from shareholders to introduce battery storage systems (BSS) into the portfolio.
“The recent vote by shareholders to allow an allocation to BSS of up to 10% of GAV [gross asset valley] provides an additional and exciting area of potential growth for the Company,” wrote Chairman Alex Ohlsson in his opening statement.
Counter to the stereotypes, Ohlsson also commented that, “Foresight Solar’s UK portfolio delivered another 12 months of positive performance, with UK electricity generation for the year 8.4% above base case expectations due to good irradiation levels and asset availability. 
In Australia, however, Bannerton Solar Park, near Robinvale in Victoria was 11.4% under Foresight’s irradiance performance expectations for 2020, and Oakey 2 Solar Farm, west of Toowoomba in Queensland, was 9.1% in the shade.
Overall, Foresight’s Australian assets were down on revenue by about 20% compared to budget, with three solar farms posting losses in projected production due to various factors.
Queensland’s 17.5 MW Longreach Solar Farm, one of 12 large-scale PV projects supported in 2016  by ARENA to boost Australia’s experience of planning and building large-scale solar assets, and originally developed by Canadian Solar, was curtailed in 2020 due to the low capacity of a local transformer, resulting in energy production that was 14.3% less than budgeted.
The grid constraint was resolved in October last year, with an upgrade to the transformer negotiated by the asset manager with local grid operator Ergon Energy.
In addition, the Fund reports that, “The Asset Manager has also been working with the tracker manufacturer to implement a new tracker algorithm, to increase energy yield in diffuse light conditions and early/late winter sun hours.”
The 110 MW Bannerton Solar Park was of course one of five West Murray generators curtailed to 50% of their output from September 2019 to April 2020, due to oscillation problems in that area of the grid. 
Collaboration between the solar farms, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and inverter supplier SMA, led to tuning of the affected solar farms’ inverter settings, which resolved the issue, but Bannerton was also affected by lower than expected irradiation levels in the second half of the year, which led to overall under performance of 31.3%.
Storms once again affected Oakey 2 Solar Farm in 2020, after significant damage was inflicted by hail and wind in 2018. Last year’s January storm took out some 15% of the site, which was subsequently rebuilt during the reporting period. 
The project received around $6.4 million in insurance paid out as compensation for revenue losses caused by construction delays due to the storms, and the latest annual report says that tracker structures have now been “reinforced and their control system redesigned to meet the design wind speed required for the site”.
Negotiations with the network provider enabled commissioning (originally planned for 2018) to be staged as reconstruction works progressed, which clawed back some of the expected production revenue.
Foresight has also negotiated a new fixed-price contract with Origin Energy for purchase of large-scale generation certificates (LGC) from both Oakey and Bannerton that will return a higher price for its energy and reduce the portfolio’s exposure to price volatilities in the LGC market.
In 2020, Foresight Solar Fund assets were of course subject to fluctuations in power prices: an almost 3 GW increase in distributed rooftop solar PV, for example, “led to an overall 2.6% decrease in operational demand across the NEM, compared to 2019”.
The report cites a 47% drop in average wholesale electricity prices across the National Electricity Market in 2020, as “mainly driven by decreased operational demand and lower gas and coal prices due to the impact of Covid-19, coupled with the increased variable renewable energy output.”
Foresight anticipates a recovery in Australian electricity prices and stability in the 2020s, followed by a rise in the 2030s as coal-fired power stations retire and prices shadow the marginal cost of gas generation.
It says an increase in storage and pumped-hydro capacity in Australia will partially mitigate the gap between the price of producing solar energy and the price of baseload energy.
For the time being, however, Foresight’s introduction of large-scale battery systems to its portfolio will be confined to a number of UK sites. It says, “addition of a limited number of batteries to the existing UK solar portfolio, along with greenfield co-location investments, will provide clear benefits to the Company’s investors” such as “an additional and diversified source of portfolio revenue”.
Among Foresight’s highlights of 2020, it says its international portfolio generated 969,564 MWh of clean electricity, or enough to power 334,000 UK homes, and that its collective investments avoided 749,00 tonnes of carbon emissions that would otherwise have been emitted by carbon-intensive energy sources.
“The nature of the Company’s business,” says the report, “means it is well positioned to serve the needs of those investors seeking to achieve positive environmental and social outcomes alongside attractive financial returns.
Foresight has set its FY 2021 target dividend slightly higher than its 2020 year-end dividend, at 6.98 pence per share.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/15/la-trobe-university-a-study-in-solar-energy-application/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 15, 2021",La Trobe University a study in solar energy application,"Solar-shaded car parking and an extra dusting of rooftop solar across the buildings of La Trobe University in Bendigo have added 800 kW to the campus’s solar generation. Thirty per cent of campus energy needs are now supplied by onsite solar as the University hurtles towards its goal of net zero emissions from its regional campuses by 2022 and university-wide net-zero emissions by 2029.
“It’s exciting to see these carports and other initiatives come to fruition after years of planning,” said La Trobe Vice-Chancellor, Professor John Dewar, of the University’s rollout, not only of solar, but also of 24,000 energy efficient LED lights across all campuses which have reduced the University’s electricity consumption for lighting by more than 50%.

Dewar and La Trobe Chancellor John Brumby officially launched the university’s $75 million net-zero initiative in 2019, with ambitious plans to transition the university’s Melbourne, Bendigo, Shepparton and Albury-Wodonga campuses, along with other properties to run on renewable generation within 10 years.
By July 2020, it had decked the hall rooftops of its north Melbourne Bundoora campus with more than 7,500 solar panels, or 2.5 MW of generation, capable of powering up to 50% of the campus’s daytime power usage when the sun and panels are working in tandem to produce at their peak.
At the time, Dewar estimated that the university would save up to $615,000 a year thanks to its switch to solar.
In January this year, La Trobe scored a triumphant win with the completion of its solar-powered sports stadium, part of Stage 2 of its Sports Park development.
The 519 kW rooftop stadium array can generate 724,000 kWh of solar energy each year, or more than enough to power the indoor stadium with its six multi-purpose highball courts, a teaching and research building and office space for commercial tenants. Daytime surplus from the facility is channeled to supplement the needs of the main campus.
The University last year also placed fourth in the world for its contribution to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, according to the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings. 
President of the Bendigo Sustainability Group, Colin Lambie, last week praised the drive of La Trobe University to achieve its goals, hailing it as a model for other organisations that are serious about minimising their emissions.
“Reducing carbon emissions and impact on the environment should be a significant focus for all organisations,” Lambie said.
Bendigo campus now has more than 3,300 solar panels installed; harvests around two million litres of rainwater each year, which it uses for irrigation and to flush toilets; and feeds a large-scale composter which turns around 100 kg of organic waste into 20 kg of nutrient-rich fertiliser for use on campus grounds every day.

Dewar said of last week’s solar carport completion, “Not only do students and staff now have a shady place to park their cars during hot days, but with this investment we have significantly reduced the campus’ running costs and carbon emissions.”
The completion of La Trobe’s Regional Solar Carports and Rooftops project, which included 270 panels (110 kW) installed over parking at Albury Wodonga campus, helps to reduce the University’s emissions from regional campuses by more than 20%.
