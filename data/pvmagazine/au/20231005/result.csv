HESA was formed by United Kingdom-headquartered companies Hive Energy, Ethical Power and Solar South West to develop solar assets in New Zealand. The joint venture has announced plans to develop a pipeline of nearly 350 MW of utility scale PV assets across the country’s North and South islands.
Lodestone, which is already building a portfolio of 198 MW across PV projects at Kaitaia, Edgecumbe, Waiotahe, Whitianga and Dargaville on the nation’s North Island, said the HESA developments are part of the next phase of its solar farm program.
Gary Holden, Managing Director of Lodestone, said the company had recently inked a conditional debt facility with ANZ to support its “mission of bringing next-generation renewable energy across the country at a scale New Zealand hasn’t seen before.”
“Through new capital partnerships, including a $250 million (USD 148 million) debt facility from ANZ, Lodestone will have the funding to support the significant growth of solar generation,” he said.
“The expansion puts us one step closer to bringing grid-scale solar to customers in all regions of Aotearoa New Zealand.”
Lodestone said the locations of the nine new solar farms included in the HESA arrangement will be revealed in the coming months.
Hive has however provided details about the capacity and locations of at least some of the proposed projects. On its website, Hive outlines plans for a 50 MW solar farm at Helensville south of Auckland on the North Island, a 20 MW project at Bunnythorpe near Wellington, and a 14 MW project at Te Toke. It also lists a 24 MW solar farm to be built at Clandeboye near Canterbury on the South Island.
While Lodestone did not confirm details about the individual projects, it said once constructed the HESA sites will provide more than 500 GWh in additional solar generation for New Zealand.
As part of the HESA arrangement, Lodestone has signed on Ethical Power New Zealand as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner for the solar developments in the partnership.
Ethical Power New Zealand Managing Director Matt Rowe said the new solar farms, which are at “various stages of development”, will support the country’s push towards a 100% renewable electricity grid.
New Zealand’s electricity grid already runs on about 82% renewable electricity thanks mostly to a large-scale hydroelectric network but the government is aiming to increase that level to 100% by the end of the decade.
“The delivery of these new solar farms will bring New Zealand significantly closer to meeting the country’s goal of decarbonisation,” Rowe said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/05/the-road-is-long-and-time-is-short-but-australias-pace-towards-net-zero-is-quickening/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 5, 2023","The road is long and time is short, but Australia’s pace towards net zero is quickening","The Hunter is developing a clean manufacturing precinct, and state and federal governments are investing heavily in the effort. Projects to create hydrogen and renewable energy to replace coal and gas are underway.
At Kooragang Island, just north of Newcastle, Orica and the Australian government are working together to change what the exhaust stacks at three nitric acid manufacturing plants put into the air. Nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas now released directly into the atmosphere, is being converted into nitrogen and oxygen, and emissions at these plants are set to halve.
Pessimism abounds about the world’s capacity to solve climate change, but as chief executive of Climateworks Centre, which works with governments, companies, regulators and investors to create pathways to net zero emissions, I see evidence every day of people doing hard practical work to bring their organisations into line with our national and global climate goals.
The road is long and time is short, but our pace is quickening. The price of renewables is falling, coal-fired power plants are sunsetting sooner, hydrogen technology is progressing. And as industries and economies change, so too will minds.
The ambition of climate action must continue to aim at a global temperature increase of no more than 1.5℃ because every tenth of a degree of warming brings exponentially worse outcomes. Last week, the US Treasury advised that financial institutions’ net zero plans should be in line with a 1.5℃ pathway.
In 2020 when my organisation’s climate modelling with CSIRO showed the first 1.5℃-aligned path to net zero for Australia, the Paris Agreement, which committed the world to strive for such a pathway, was five years old. The progress in technology in that time demonstrated potential to bring emissions to net zero over a decade faster than previously shown. Today, our modelling consistently identifies a 1.5℃-aligned pathway. But implementation needs to pick up speed.

Australia’s emissions are roughly a third from electricity, a third from mining, manufacturing, construction and buildings, and a third from transport and agriculture. So the path is clear.
Switch anything that runs on fossil fuels to electricity or, in a few cases, to a zero-emissions substitute such as green hydrogen or biofuel. Generate all electricity from renewable sources, and sequester emissions that can’t be eliminated. In short, it’s a technology upgrade across the economy plus investment in nature-based solutions that protect and restore ecosystems and sustainably manage agricultural land and forests.
At the same time, improve energy efficiency, a stealthy superpower at our disposal. Already, digitalisation is making everything from home thermostats to long-haul trucking more efficient. More stars are cropping up on home appliance energy rating labels.
Building standards are improving home energy performance. Victoria has said all new homes will be fully electric from next year. With a clear view of what is needed to bring homes to net zero, other states and the federal government can follow its lead.
As for electrification, even some of the trickiest switches from fossil fuels to renewable energy are underway. The Australian Industrial Energy Transitions Initiative, a group of heavy industry and business leaders co-convened by Climateworks Centre, shows iron and steel, aluminium and chemical supply chains, home to many of Australia’s “hard-to-abate” emissions, can cut between 96% and 99% of emissions by 2050, while increasing production to meet the needs of a net-zero global economy.
Until recently, electric and renewable processes simply could not generate as much heat as fossil fuels to power these industries. Take aluminium, which begins as bauxite, a reddish-brown rock very common in Australia.
To be transformed into aluminium, bauxite must undergo a process called digestion at around 200℃, followed by calcination at around 1,000℃, before it’s smelted into its final silvery state.
For a long time, no renewable process could get anywhere near 1,000℃. But near Gladstone earlier this year the world’s first hydrogen calcination demonstration pilot was announced at Rio Tinto’s Yarwun Alumina Refinery in Queensland. The pilot, funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, aims to prove hydrogen calcination is viable for industrial use at scale.

Success would be no small thing; this one industrial process alone is responsible for 1% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonising both calcination and digestion would cut up to three times that amount.
Yet we are out of time to work on all this incrementally. A few big changes are needed now. One is to deploy technologies across entire supply chains and across new, net zero precincts, with companies and sectors pulling together to achieve more than they can on their own.
Over the next year the federal government is also developing net zero plans for six sectors: electricity and energy, industry, resources, the built environment, agriculture, and land transport. Done properly, they will be a big deal in getting us to net zero.
A holistic approach can solve multiple goals at once: electrify, build renewable power, support communities and protect nature. This must occur in the industrial regions that power Australia’s economy. Five of them – the Pilbara, Kwinana, Hunter, Illawarra and Gladstone – contribute more than $160 billion to Australia’s gross domestic product (GDP), the equivalent of nearly half the value of Australia’s exported goods.
Industrial facilities in these regions can be brought together within a renewable energy industrial precinct. The idea is simple – supercharge industrial areas with plenty of renewable energy, green hydrogen, shared infrastructure, labour and knowledge. Coordinate the public policy and investment that will attract further private sector investment, supporting the transition of the existing and creation of the new at the same time.
These precincts will provide a path to prosperity for workers and industries, built on demand for the renewable energy that will underpin Australia’s ambitions to be an energy superpower produces green iron, green hydrogen and other products the world urgently wants.
The Net Zero Authority – created in July to help “seize the opportunities of Australia’s net zero transformation” – is the layer of connective tissue that will help these precincts succeed. The Authority will coordinate policies to support regions and communities to attract clean energy industries, and help investors and companies to take up net zero opportunities.
Beyond industry, all Australians have a role to play, in our actions and in our minds. At Climateworks we say, “start at the end goal.” Imagine a prosperous net zero society 30 years from now.
Huge industrial regions feature battery blocks, not exhaust stacks. Cities hum, more quietly than today, with electric vehicles. Homes are warmed and cooled by the power of the sun, and we breathe fresh air.
Once we put ourselves in that future, and look around at the infrastructure and relationships needed to create it, the rest of the equation can – and I believe will – be solved.
We are still far from that ideal, but the turning point, when it comes, will be swift. Australia has an enormous opportunity in decarbonising quickly, in a world that we know wants the same.

The funding round was led by Asia Pacific-focused venture capital firm Investible through its Climate Tech Fund and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) through Virescent Ventures, with support from United States-based venture investor the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment.
Renewable Metals said the capital will also support the expansion of the company’s staffing levels to further develop the battery recycling industry in Australia, which the CSIRO has estimated could help recover up to $3.1 billion of valuable battery materials and metals, including lithium.
With the demand for lithium and other critical minerals forecast to increase dramatically in the coming years, driven by rapidly growing demand for stationary storage and electric vehicles, just 10% of Australia’s lithium-ion battery waste was recycled in 2021, compared to 99% of lead battery waste. This is despite the reusability of 95% of lithium-ion battery components.
Established in 2022, Renewable Metals has developed an alkali-based solution to recycling end-of-life lithium batteries that it claims can recover more than 95% of the valuable materials including lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese and graphite.
Renewable Metals said its approach eliminates the need to pre-process to black mass (crushed battery cells), simplifies the extraction process, and reduces processing costs by up to 30% compared to competitors.
The company said its recycling technology works for all major battery chemistries, including lithium iron phosphate (LFP).
Renewable Metals Chief Executive Officer Luan Atkinson said the novel extraction method will allow the company to play a crucial role in advancing Australia’s sovereign capability in the battery supply chain.
“To decarbonise quickly, the world needs cost-effective recycling solutions that maximise recovery for all types of lithium batteries, not just higher value ones with nickel and cobalt,” she said.
“We’re thrilled to be backed by the CEFC, Grantham and Investible. Their support will accelerate our scale-up as well as help create two to three times more value than the current Australian practice of exporting batteries or black mass for recycling overseas.”
The recent study, produced by professional services company Accenture, estimates that growth in demand for batteries has increased by 64% in the past two years and will continue to accelerate to the end of the decade.
Australia’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources has estimated that global lithium consumption is forecast to grow by 20% annually but has warned of a potential shortfall of lithium.
Virescent Ventures Partner Blair Pritchard said battery recycling that extracts valuable metals and materials is an important part of building Australia’s circular economy as this demand for batteries grows.
“There is a growing global need for effective waste management strategies as demand for lithium-ion batteries rises, driven by the increasing electrification of transport and the renewable energy generation storage sector,” he said.
“By developing end-of-life battery systems, Australia can participate across the battery value chain, from critical minerals extraction, refining, processing operation and maintenance and the eventual repurposing and recycling of batteries and components.”

Founded in 2018 by robotics engineer and Cameron Van Der Berg and military veteran Chris Cox, Infravision has developed a drone hardware and software technology system that can be used by electricity transmission network owners to install and upgrade overhead power lines.
The company’s core product, the TX System, uses drones in place of traditional powerline stringing methods. Infravision said the ground and aerial robotics system – which is already being used by some of the world’s largest electric utility companies, including New South Wales transmission network operator Transgrid – is safer, faster and cheaper than traditional methods.
Van Der Berg, Infravision’s Chief Executive Officer, said the new funds will be used to scale operations in North America while meeting demand in Australia for new electrical infrastructure amid the transition to renewables.
“Today marks an incredible milestone for Infravision as we join forces with leading global energy investors to accelerate the decarbonisation of the world’s electric grid,” he said.
“This funding will enable Infravision to invest in the people, products and projects required to establish it as the industry standard for electric utilities and their construction partners on a global scale.”
Van Der Berg said the latest estimates show that Australia alone needs more than 10,000 kilometres of new transmission lines and nine times the large-scale renewable generation it currently has to meet net-zero targets.
“Infravision is at the forefront of this infrastructure program and is well positioned to capitalise on it over the coming years,” he said.
The Series A funding round was led by United States-headquartered investment firm Energy Impact Partners (EIP) which has more than $3 billion in funds under management. Norway’s Equinor Ventures, the venture capital arm of global energy giant Equinor, and Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison (SCE), one of the United States’ largest electric utilities, also participated in the round.
Sergej Mahnovski, managing director of strategy, technology and innovation at Edison International, said transmission is “the backbone of the clean energy transition.”
“Currently it can take more than a decade to build a new transmission line, so the pace of expansion must increase quickly,” he said. “Infravision’s drone solutions offer safe, fast, affordable ways to accelerate the huge transmission buildout we need.”
Infravision currently has operations in NSW and Queensland, along with teams in Texas and California in the US.

The perennial top three countries – China, the United States, and India – continue to account for some two-thirds of global utility scale solar generation capacity. Look beyond those simple totals, however, and you find some impressive relative results by many of those countries in the remaining one-third.
From Wiki-Solar’s comprehensive database of more than 22,000 utility scale solar projects around the world, it is possible to derive a wide range of comparators, including site performance ratios, average yield, and land utilisation. This article looks at national achievements and rates of progress.
Philip Wolfe, from analyst Wiki-Solar. Wiki-Solar
Firstly, we have assessed the nominal annual output of the large solar capacity in each country and compared it with national electricity consumption. On that basis, five countries now meet more than 10% of their electric power demand from utility scale solar. Most of these figures would be significantly higher if rooftop and other small scale solar arrays were factored in.

Chile tops the list, thanks in part to its exceptional yield from so many high-altitude desert sites. El Salvador and Jordan feature strongly, with solar contributing substantially to their more modest electricity demand. Spain carries the banner for Europe while Australia has progressed strongly after a slow start.
The UAE owes much of its elevated position to a single huge project, the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. India may be only number three, in terms of total generation capacity, but leads the United States and China in relative terms, with 8.6% of its electricity from utility scale solar, and 13.2% from overall solar capacity.
An extended list which shows most of the countries with significant utility scale solar capacity is available on the Wiki-Solar website. There you will find Germany, with 3.2% of its electricity demand met by big solar, a few places above China, which sits at number 29, with 2.6%
The rate of progress is another key indicator. We have evaluated this by looking at the change over the five-year period from 2017 to last year.
For comparison, we have extended this rate forward until utility scale solar would meet 100% of electricity demand. This is, of course, a theoretical exercise. No nation would, in practice, generate all of its power this way and neither the growth of solar nor the trend in electricity consumption will continue as a straight line. The results of the exercise are, nonetheless, illuminating.

Chile again tops the list and would need just 25 years to achieve that notional 100% utility scale solar coverage. Spain has seen outstanding renewed growth in recent years, taking it to number two on this list, with El Salvador and Jordan not far behind. In theory, the top ten countries for solar progress would all reach 100% solar, from utility-scale alone, before the end of the century.
Again, the full list is available online and features a strong European contingent – Portugal, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark – just outside the top ten. Some countries where recent progress in utility scale solar has been slow would need several centuries to reach 100%, by this measure.
The large solar power stations we are considering here are not, of course, for individuals or households. Another measure of comparative achievement is relative solar generation capacity per person.

Inevitably this is quite similar to the first table above but this time the UAE and Australia leapfrog Chile. The United States has a much higher ranking in this table because its power consumption per capita – from all generation sources – is substantially higher than most other nations. Again, the full table is available online.
Wiki-Solar has accurate site footprints for the majority of utility scale plants, enabling us to assess the land area typically used for big solar sites in different parts of the world. When this number is related to the land area of each country, it is no surprise to find that land usage is seldom an issue.

The most that any country currently devotes to utility scale solar is just over one tenth of 1%. Only two, relatively small and energy intensive countries – Taiwan and South Korea – would need to allocate more than 3% of their land for PV, even to achieve the theoretical 100% solar paradigm.
The full list shows the United States down among the countries that would need to devote around 0.5% of total surface area for 100% solar. The use of building-mounted systems and the growth of agrivoltaics, of course, means that the land allocated can also be productive for other purposes.
The expression “nominal output” refers to the design or expected annual output of solar power stations. Actual output in practice will vary with solar radiation and other climatic and site factors, such as grid constraints.
The 100% solar paradigm is used for illustrative and comparative purposes. A 100% renewables scenario featuring wind, hydro, and biomass alongside solar is more realistic.
National power consumption figures are mainly taken from French data company Enerdata and the International Energy Agency; population data is mainly taken from the United Nations. Utility scale solar figures come from the Wiki-Solar database. For consistency, generation capacity is quoted in MW/TW (AC) to enable direct comparison between PV and concentrating solar power plants and other forms of generation.

Mattiq is developing a range of alternatives to iridium, a costly and rare element crucial in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysers. The alternatives offer comparable or superior performance at a significantly lower cost, according to the Chicago-based company. It achieved this by evaluating “millions of combinations” of different elements for their suitability in industrial applications.
InterContinental Energy has secured USD 115 million (181 million) in equity investment from GIC and Hy24, a clean hydrogen investor. This funds will expedite the deployment of InterContinental Energy’s portfolio of projects and support the company’s vision to scale up the green hydrogen economy and drive large-scale market adoption of green fuels. InterContinental Energy is actively developing a portfolio of green hydrogen projects in Australia and the Middle East, strategically located in coastal deserts.
Hystar has unveiled plans for a fully automated 4 GW electrolyser factory set to be delivered in Høvik, Norway, by 2025, with construction commencing in early 2024. The company is also expanding its operations to North America, with a new location scheduled for 2024 and a multi-gigawatt factory scheduled for 2027. It is starting the hiring process for its North American headquarters as part of this expansion. In addition, the PEM electrolyzer specialist is in talks with key stakeholders in the United States and Canada to establish its first gigawatt factory on the continent, with ambitions to surpass its European plans within the decade.
Air Liquide and Trillium Energy Solutions have agreed to collaborate in the US heavy-duty hydrogen fueling market. They will focus on hydrogen supply and refuelling infrastructure to accelerate the heavy-duty hydrogen transportation ecosystem. The partnership’s initial phase involves deploying hydrogen stations along a strategically significant trucking route.
Daimler Truck says that a public road-approved prototype of the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck covered 1,047 km with one fill of liquid hydrogen. The test “has successfully demonstrated that hydrogen fuel-cell technology can be the right solution to decarbonise flexible and demanding long-haul road transportation.” The truck completed the run fully loaded, with a gross combined vehicle weight of 40 tons under real-life conditions. Ahead of the run, cryogenic liquid hydrogen at minus 253 degrees Celsius was filled into two 40 kg tanks mounted on either side of the truck chassis.
