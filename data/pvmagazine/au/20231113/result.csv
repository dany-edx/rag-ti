The Brigalow Peaking Power Plant, among the projects being built as part of the Kogan Creek Clean Energy Hub being developed near Chinchilla, will use a mix of green hydrogen and fossil gas to power a turbine for peaking power applications.
CS Energy Chief Executive Officer Darren Busine said the power plant will initially be capable of operating on 35% renewable hydrogen but a pathway will be put in place for the plant’s transition to 100% hydrogen.
Busine said the Brigalow plant will have fast-start capability and operate in high demand periods, providing crucial firming capacity to support the state’s renewable energy transformation.
“The open-cycle design of the Brigalow Peaking Power Plant provides the ability for multiple start/stop cycles per day and the ability to ramp up to full power output within five minutes,” he said.
“CS Energy is committed to securing a balanced mix of energy sources that can meet our customers’ decarbonisation requirements and support the delivery of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan.”
The Brigalow plant will consist of 12 aeroderivative turbines with a capacity of 33 MW per unit and is scheduled to be operational in 2026, subject to final approvals.
Renewable hydrogen will initially be sourced from the planned Kogan Renewable Hydrogen Demonstration Plant, which is expected to include a 1 MW hydrogen electrolyser powered by a co-located 2 MW solar farm. The project is expected to produce approximately 75 tonnes of green hydrogen annually.
Both the peaking power plant and the renewable hydrogen demonstration project are being built adjacent to CS Energy’s existing coal-fired 750 MW Kogan Creek Power Station and will form part of an energy hub that is to also include a 100 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage system.

St George announced it has entered into a subscription agreement whereby Jayson, through its controlled subsidiary Hong Kong Jayson Holding Co, will invest an additional $3 million in the company, increasing its holding from 3.5% to 11.73%.
The new investment, which builds on an initial $2 million funding agreement announced last year, comes after St George recently secured commitments for a $2 million placement of new shares to domestic and international investors.
St George Executive Chairman John Prineas said the company will use the new money to better explore its portfolio of hard-rock lithium projects, with a priority focus on the flagship Mt Alexander lithium operation in Western Australia’s Goldfields region.
“Our strategic relationship with Jayson will strengthen our capacity to advance Mt Alexander and unlock the full potential of our large landholding in this lithium province,” he said.
“This is a group with deep financial capacity and technical capabilities in lithium‐ion battery technologies, mining, chemical engineering and battery materials manufacturing.”
Jayson, a global supplier to the clean energy sector, will now have the right to acquire 25% of any lithium products from the company’s projects, subject to finalisation of offtake agreements once a JORC-compliant resource is defined.
Prineas said Mt Alexander, which is about 100 kilometres south of Liontown Resources’ Kathleen Valley lithium project, represented a “dominant” landholding in the emerging Mt Ida lithium province and that drilling has already confirmed widespread high‐grade lithium.
“We believe there is excellent potential for further exploration and drilling to discover significant lithium mineralisation,” he said.
St George is among a bevy of Australian hopefuls seeking to take advantage of the global demand for lithium and other battery metals needed for electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy storage.
Modelling by consultancy InfoLink forecasts the global lithium-ion battery market to post a compound growth rate of 24% through 2030. A market today of more than 400 GWh is expected to surpass 1 TWh in 2023, 2 TWh in 2026, and 4 TWh in 2030.

The $157 million (USD 100 million) Cirata floating solar farm comprises approximately 340,000 solar panels installed across a 250-hectare plot of the Cirata Reservoir in West Java, about 130 kilometres southeast of Indonesia capital Jakarta.
It is expected to generate 245 GWh of clean energy per year to be channelled into PLN’s Java-Bali distribution line, providing enough electricity to meet the needs of 50,000 households while offsetting 214,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
“Today is a historic day, because our ambitious dream to build a large-scale renewable energy generator is finally achieved,” Indonesia President Joko Widodo said at the launch of the project.
“Indonesia has successfully built the largest floating solar power plant in southeast Asia and the third largest in the world.”
“We hope there will be more renewable energy built in our country such as solar, hydropower, geothermal and wind.”
PLN Chief Executive Officer Darmawan Prasodjo said the group has already signed a memorandum of understanding with Masdar to develop the next stage of the project.
Prasodjo said the parties have agreed to add up to 500 MW of additional capacity but there is potential for the project to be scaled up to about 1,000 MW, noting that the 13 arrays installed so far occupy only 4% of the reservoir’s surface while newly introduced regulations permit up to 20% of the reservoir’s area to be utilised by the solar plant.
“This is just the beginning,” Prasodjo said. “The president instructed us to maintain the momentum so that renewable energy development could be escalated.”

Indonesian Energy Minister Arifin Tasrif said floating solar is a key part of the nation’s decarbonisation and net-zero ambitions.
Indonesia has set a target to expand renewable energy to 23% of its energy mix by 2025 and has committed to a 29% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
The government has admitted the target of 23% by 2025 will probably be missed with renewable energy accounting for just 12.3% of Indonesia’s energy mix in 2022.
“With the operation of the Cirata floating PV, we hope it will increase investor confidence and encourage technological innovation as a solution to limited land in developing solar energy, where Indonesia has enormous floating PV potential,” Tasrif said.
The Cirata floating solar farm is just one of a number of floating PV projects being pursued in Indonesia. Solar developer Sunseap Group has proposed a 2.2 GW plant on a reservoir on Batam Island near Singapore, while Singapore-based Reposttren Holdings is planning a 2 GW facility in West Java.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/13/researchers-shed-light-on-mysterious-higher-energy-yields-in-vertical-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 13, 2023","Researchers shed light on mysterious, higher energy yields in vertical PV systems","From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) has conducted a series of tests and simulations to understand why vertical PV systems tend to provide unexpected yield gains compared to horizontal arrays and have found that vertical installations have much lower operating temperatures.
“Although better than expected performance for vertical installation of bifacial PV has been reported at conferences and workshops, we haven’t seen any publications that show that this is accompanied with a much lower operating temperature than you would expect for free-standing fixed tilt PV with the same total irradiance,” the research’s corresponding author, Bas B. Van Aken, told pv magazine. “These lower operating temperatures have a positive effect on the operating voltage. And thereby on the total energy generation, particularly under high irradiance conditions.”
In the study “Thermal model in digital twin of vertical PV system helps to explain unexpected yield gains,” published in EPJ Photovoltaics, Van Aken and his colleagues explained that the voltage is influenced both by the amount of light and by the temperature of the solar cells. With increasing irradiance conditions, the voltage increases logarithmically, while with increasing temperature, the voltage decreases, typically by 0.3-0.4% per C.
“For a standard system, we observed that under high irradiance conditions, the increase due to the light is offset by the decrease due to the higher operating temperature,” Van Aken stressed. “However, for the vertical system, we observed that the operating temperature is not increasing so much and the voltage increase and decrease are more or less balancing.”
For its modeling, the group used digital twins, which are virtual representations that connect and visualise real-world assets, to create twins consisting of a real PV system and a copy in digital format. Digital twins are commonly used for operation and maintenance (O&M) of solar power plants. “The digital version mimics the output of the PV panels based on the time series of weather and other environmental data. The simulated values are compared to observed data,” the scientists explained.
They took their measurements in a vertical PV system located near the TNO facilities in Petten, the Netherlands. The east-west system features nine rows each equipped with eight 315 W bifacial modules, with the spacing between module rows being 2m, 4m, or 6m, respectively. Of the 72 modules deployed in the system, 60 rely on n-type M2 TOPCon solar cells. All of the panels are equipped with power optimisers provided by Israel-based Solaredge.
For its analysis, the group utilised an in-house developed extraction method and found that the heat transfer coefficients of the vertical panels are nearly double the values of the horizontal panels. Heat transfer coefficients define how heat energy passes from one material to another and are commonly used, for example, to make insulation in homes.
They also ascertained that the vertical array operates at a temperature difference with respect to ambient that is “nearly halved,” which they said results in a 2.5% higher annual energy yield.
“These results show the importance of checking the actual operating conditions of emerging applications of solar panels,” Van Aken concluded. “We expect that this effect has a 2-3% increase in annual electricity yield in the Netherlands, the lower operating temperature has a slowing effect on degradation mechanisms and the effect could be more significant in locations with higher irradiance conditions.”
