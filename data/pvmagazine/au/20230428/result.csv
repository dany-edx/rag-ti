“The world is changing and so is AGL,” AGL Chief Executive Officer Damien Nicks said. “After providing the market with notice of closure more than seven years ago, Liddell has finally reached the end of its technical life and the time has now come to safely and respectfully retire the station and join the change to a cleaner future.”
AGL plans to convert the Liddell power station site into a renewable energy hub dominated by a 500 MW/2 GWh battery energy storage system as the gen-tailer manages its transition to a renewable energy dominated electricity market.
“Today marks the end of one chapter for the site, but also the beginning of another with our plans to transform the site into the Hunter Energy Hub,” Nicks said.
“We already have plans underway to build a 500 MW grid-scale battery on the site, a feasibility study into a hydrogen facility is underway, and we are also exploring options with potential partners in industries such as solar, wind, and waste-to-energy.”

The closure of the Liddell power station, which initially generated 2,000 MW but in recent years has been typically generating closer to 750 MW, has triggered some concerns about a potential shortfall in generation capacity.
Transgrid Executive General Manager of Network Marie Jordan was unconcerned about any supply crunch in the grid, saying the closure is another sign of Australia’s rapidly accelerating energy transition.
“We haven’t really seen any change in the network. We’re ready for it, it is planned for and the network is operating fine,” she said. “We’re ready to take on 100% renewables.”
AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said attention will now switch to the demolition of the Liddell station with the emphasis on recycling and reusing materials.
“The demolition process is estimated to commence in early 2024 and take around two years to complete,” he said. “More than 90% of the materials in the power station will be recycled, including 70,000 tonnes of steel.”
“Critical infrastructure, such as transmission connections to the grid, will be retained as the site transitions into the Hunter Energy Hub.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/28/solar-generation-high-sparks-record-lows-across-energy-grid/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 28, 2023",Solar generation high sparks record lows across energy grid,"New highs in renewable energy generation, including record average output from rooftop solar, has resulted in the lowest demand in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in the March quarter since 2005, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) latest market intelligence report.
AEMO’s Q1 Quarterly Energy Dynamics report shows the average output of rooftop solar reached a record 2,962 MW for the first three months of 2023. The market operator said this was up 23% compared with the same period in 2022, reflecting resumption of high distributed PV installation growth rates after a slowdown in 2022.
Generation from large-scale solar and wind also surged during the quarter by an average 330 MW and 134 MW respectively, yielding a record quarterly average of 4,654 MW, or 11% higher than the same time last year. The increases in grid-scale solar and wind output were attributed in part to new and recently commissioned units coming online.
AEMO said the record solar generation saw instantaneous penetration of renewable energy peak at 65.8% during the quarter, but it was mostly about 37% of total power generation. At the high, which was up 4.4% on the previous record, rooftop solar accounted for 36% of supply.
Rooftop solar output peaked on 11 February 2023, reaching a record high of 11,504 MW, up 818 MW on the previous high achieved in Q4 2022.

AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said the insights highlight the fundamental changes underway as Australia’s energy system transitions from fossil fuels to renewable sources.
However, Westerman said the report also reinforces the need for more investment in new transmission infrastructure and “firming technology” to help the grid cope with the switch, noting that a number of major renewable energy projects in the Murray region of Victoria and southwest NSW were unable to supply their full capacity to the grid because of constraints in the transmission network.
“These insights reinforce that critical transmission investments, such as VNI West and EnergyConnect, are needed to share low-cost, low-emission renewable energy with consumers,” he said.
“This is clear with the projects in Victoria’s Murray River renewable energy zone that are burdened with generation impacts.”
In spite of constraint concerns, the growth in renewables helped deliver new records for minimum demand, drove wholesale electricity costs down to historic levels, and helped reduce emissions to record lows as coal-fired and gas generation decreased.

The record levels of solar generation contributed to the lowest operational demand for the first quarter of the year since Tasmania joined the NEM in May 2005, at 14,375 MW.
The AEMO report shows that operational demand declined to 21,181 MW, the lowest first quarter average since Tasmania joined the NEM in 2005. The new mark was 1.5% down on the same period last year. Operational demand bottomed out on 21 January 2023, reaching a record low of 14,375 MW in the half-hour ending 12.30pm.
Wholesale spot electricity prices in the NEM averaged $83 per megawatt hour (MWh) for the March quarter, down $10/MWh from the previous quarter and $4/MWh from the same time last year.
“Growing renewable output across the NEM meant that 12% of the time wholesale prices were negative or zero. Further, between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm, wholesale electricity prices were negative in South Australia and Victoria 60% and 55% of the time, respectively,” Westerman said.
The report also showed a record March quarter low for greenhouse gas emissions at 28.83 million tonnes, down 5.1% on a year earlier as electricity generation from coal and gas declined.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/28/victoria-begins-search-for-renewables-investment-to-kickstart-sec/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 28, 2023",Victoria begins search for renewables investment to kickstart SEC,"The Victorian government is progressing its plan to bring back the publicly owned State Electricity Commission (SEC) as an active energy market participant that will work with industry to invest in and speed up the delivery of renewable energy and accelerate the energy transition.
State Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio this week launched the Pioneer Investment Mandate which includes the project criteria and process for the reincarnated SEC’s first investment with the successful project expected to be announced before the end of this year.
“This is an exciting milestone for the SEC,” D’Ambrosio said. “We look forward to working with our partners to increase the amount of reliable, zero-emissions energy in the market by building and investing in renewable generation and storage.”
The state government has pledged that at least $1 billion will be spent on delivering 4.5 GW of renewable energy generation and storage projects that will be operated by the SEC. It is expected the state will retain a 51% stake in the renewable energy projects with “like-minded entities”, such as industry super funds, the preferred investors for the remaining share.
D’Ambrosio said the SEC has already held talks with potential investors and renewable energy companies and a Registration of Interest process, which will open on 2 May 2023, will seek to identify suitable renewable energy generation and storage projects.

The investment mandate dictates that the pioneer investment must utilise “proven” renewable energy generation and/or storage technologies, capable of delivering commercial returns.
The successful project will have a minimum generation capacity of 100 MW, with the mandate indicating a preference for larger capacity. The SEC noted that this first investment could involve a portfolio of multiple projects aggregating to larger capacity than the single project’s minimum capacity.
The SEC is also open to exploring the potential of co-located storage capacity with existing or proposed renewable projects, and standalone storage projects in excess of 100 MW of capacity with a range of storage durations.
The project or projects must be located in Victoria, with preference for those that support Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) development and accelerate the transition away from coal.
Projects must contribute to the SEC’s objectives of accelerating the transition away from coal, deliver commercial returns and begin operations and deliver electricity as soon as possible.
The SEC says it has a preference for projects with a defined delivery strategy, and which can begin operations and/or deliver electricity as soon as possible.
“The intention is to accelerate the renewable energy transition by partnering with industry and co-investors,” the investment mandate says. “We are seeking to invest in projects that can be brought forward and/or accelerated with the SEC’s involvement, while maintaining expectations of commercial returns.”
The ROI process will extend from May 2-15, followed by a more select market engagement phase targeting those projects with the potential to best meet the criteria set out by the SEC for the pioneer investment.
From late May, the SEC will invite select interested parties to submit an investment proposal and from mid-June it will commence the assessment of proposals to develop a shortlist.
The market search is also expected to help build a pipeline of longer-term investment opportunities, generating jobs and investment while helping Victoria achieve its renewable energy target of 95% by 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/28/to-be-truly-sustainable-in-our-energy-transition-we-need-to-think-local/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",,"APRIL 28, 2023","To be truly sustainable in our energy transition, we need to think local","The IPCC’s AR6 report, released in March, revealed solar energy is the most feasible option for reducing global emissions by 2030. The report stated every country must accelerate to keep warming limited to 1.5°C. This stark warning has in turn led to an acceleration in governments and companies’ decarbonisation plans. 
It is clear if we are to successfully transition toward a cleaner future, every industry and every Australian must contribute. In terms of energy alone, to achieve global net zero targets, the International Energy Agency has stated, a minimum of 190 GW of solar needs to be installed every year from 2023 onward. 

However, a necessarily fast-tracked energy transition requiring huge investment and skilled work should not mean that Australia should rely solely on technology and labour from overseas. 
Ironically, whilst sustainability is the name of the game for this transition, it seems that it is being ignored, especially in how the term relates to renewable project longevity, economic benefit, jobs for Australians and high-quality craftsmanship. 
Whilst more renewable energy and greater uptake of solar is obviously fantastic news, I know from experience that growth at a rapid pace must go hand-in-hand with thoughtful local investment, considering each project through to long-term operation. 
When people ask how ACLE remains competitive with global organisations, I credit the local workforce and knowledge, as well as the vertically integrated supply chain across engineering, procurement and construction services. I believe it is the minimal reliance on subcontractors in balance with local and international expertise that allows us to guarantee quality and speed simultaneously.  
We have witnessed unprecedented growth in demand for Australian-made solar projects which use local workforces. Since being founded in 2019, ACLE grew from delivering 24.6 MW in its first year to the construction of over 24 utility scale renewable energy projects, generating over 500 MW today. We have now made the move into NSW after completing projects across Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.
There is no doubt vertical integration comes with its own financial challenges, but it also allows ‘more bang for buck’ when it comes to quality. It also eliminates the typical downside of sub-contractors who want to get in and out as fast as possible, which can lead to corner cutting. 
Put simply, Australia has always faced a massive opportunity in solar and clean energy generation more broadly. Whilst the energy industry looks different to two decades ago, the local skills, jobs and drive to deliver have not changed. Australia has all the resources, skills and ambition to become a clean energy superpower and meet our reduction commitments.

The ACE Energy consortium comprises Spanish renewables major Acciona, NSW-based network operator Endeavour Energy, and Cobra, the renewable energy development platform of French construction giant Vinci Group.
ACE Energy beat out two other short-listed tenderers including Network REZolution, which comprises CIMIC Group companies Pacific Partnerships, UGL and CPB Contractors, along with gas infrastructure business APA Group.
The third of the short-listed tenderers was NewGen Networks, comprising infrastructure investor Plenary Group, Spanish infrastructure giant Elecnor, SecureEnergy (the joint venture of Elecnor and Australian engineering and construction company Clough), and the NSW government-owned network operator Essential Energy.
Having identified its preferred bidder, EnergyCo said it will now finalise arrangements with ACE Energy with a commitment deed expected to be executed in the September quarter.
EnergyCo said until that time, it reserves the right to recommence discussions with the second-ranked proponent if appropriate to do so.
As the network operator, ACE Energy will be responsible for designing, financing, building, operating and maintaining the network infrastructure for the clean energy zone. The infrastructure will include energy hubs and new high-capacity transmission lines.
Centred around the town of Dubbo, the Central-West Orana REZ was originally expected to deliver 3 GW of new solar, wind and storage capacity but that appears certain to be revised. A call for registrations of interest attracted 113 registrations, totalling 27GW and valued at $38 billion.
The Central-West Orana REZ is the first of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, which it expects will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state. REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, South-West and Illawarra regions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/28/funding-partnership-to-build-national-ev-fast-charging-network/,"EV,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 28, 2023",Funding partnership to build national EV fast-charging network,"The federal government will team with the NRMA to build 117 new fast-charging stations along Australian highways, including in regional and remote areas in every state and territory, over the next two years as part of a $78.6 million (USD 53 million) funding partnership designed to better connect towns and cities and address “known black spots.”
While exact sites for the infrastructure haven’t been finalised, the federal government and the NRMA have identified 131 potential regional locations with the fast chargers to be positioned about every 150 kilometres on national highways.
NRMA Chief Executive – Energy, Carly Irving-Dolan, said the network would for the charging backbone of Australia, connecting the country so everyone is able to drive when and where they want as the number of Australians buying EVs increases.
“Australia’s expansive landscape presents some unique and local challenges to ensure that we are ready for more electric vehicles on our roads,” she said. “We fundamentally believe that regional Australia should not be left behind.”
The federal government will commit $39.3 million dollars to the project as part of the part of the $500 million Driving the Nation funding package that is to be delivered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) over the next five years.

The new sites will complement existing and planned EV charging infrastructure with the fast chargers to be compatible with all EVs and accessible by all motorists. The minimum charging rate for each site is expected to be at least 75 kW.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the government’s stake in the charging rollout is designed to encourage more Australians to adopt zero-emission cars and eliminate ‘range anxiety’ for long-distance drivers.
“This project will help close the gaps and known black spots in the network and make it possible to drive from Darwin to Perth, Broken Hill to Adelaide, and from Brisbane to Tennant Creek in the NT,” he said.
“EVs aren’t just for the cities and Australians who drive long distances either for work or for holidays should be able to reap the benefits of cars that are cheaper and cleaner to run.”
The announcement comes one week after the government launched its National Electric Vehicle Strategy, which outlines strategies designed to accelerate the uptake of zero-emission cars in Australia which the peak motoring body said has now passed a major milestone.

New data provided by the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) shows that for the first time on record, EV sales in Australia have overtaken petrol-driven vehicles in the medium-sized car category.
The latest AAA EV index update reveals that in the first quarter of this year, 58.29% of new medium-sized cars sold were battery electric vehicles. Australians bought 7,866 battery electric medium-sized cars in the first quarter, up from 2,988 in the previous quarter.
Internal combustion engines still dominate sales in all other light vehicle categories.
In all categories 17,396 battery electric vehicles were sold in the first quarter, up 49.4% on the previous quarter, with 11,639 sold from October to December.
