The proposal will be spelled out by the union’s secretary, Daniel Walton, during his speech at the Sydney Institute on Wednesday night. Beyond that, the Australian Workers Union (AWU) is reportedly planning to push for the proposal at the Labor Party’s National Conference in August.
As it stands, Australia is the globe’s leading supplier of many critical materials used in renewable energy technologies, including lithium, but most of the high value refining and processing is done offshore, largely in China. The AWU’s proposal plugs into a much bigger wave of momentum around keeping more of the value from Australia’s critical minerals onshore.
“If we continue to just ‘let the market rule’ it will mean only one thing: Australia’s raw materials will be shipped off to China and China will be the only player in our region with the sovereign capacity to turn them into anything useful,” Walton is set to say in his speech on Wednesday.
“Our primary concern should be where the products of those mines are going and how it is affecting the world.”

Calls for Australia to progress past its traditional ‘quarry’ status have come from numerous players, and seem to be gaining traction within the Albanese government. Since coming to power, Albanese has pledged to revive Australia’s domestic manufacturing industry to make the most of the country’s critical minerals deposits like lithium, zinc, nickel and rare earths.
The proposal comes just as Ben Kim, the managing director for Posco Australia – a South Korean steel producer and major investor in Australia – discouraged the domestically focused movement.
South Korea is Australia’s third-biggest export destination and the country relies on Australian materials to produce its batteries, semiconductors and cars. If Australia were to begin doing more with our minerals onshore, it would put nations like South Korea in a position of competition rather than clear trade ally.

“The Australian government need to focus on what they are good at, that is the critical minerals mining side,” Posco’s Ben Kim told the Australian Financial Review. “For the manufacturing, maybe it is better to team up with a strong manufacturer like Korea and to have downstream ore processing plants in Korea,” he said.
“I think it is a sure fact that Australia is one of the highest labour cost countries in the world, so having many employees and [running] the factory with that manpower is not economical at all,” Kim added. “I am very doubtful about downstream or further processing plants built here in Australia.”
In December 2022, Posco Group announced it would invest $60 billion in Australia by 2040 across the green steel supply chain, including in renewable generation, electrolysis and steel making processes.
Unsurprisingly, Chinese officials have also rebuked Australia’s growing focus on critical mineral processing. China currently controls around 90% of the global production of refined rare earths, and the majority of critical minerals.
The McKinsey Global Institute’s Battery Insights team recently estimated the entire lithium-ion battery chain would grow from $127 billion (USD 85 billion) in 2022 to almost $600 billion by 2030. Indeed, Australia has already seen an enormous uptick in its revenues from lithium and other critical minerals. 
But those figures would be much, much higher if the nation weren’t simply exporting raw spodumene, for instance. In fact, Dr Andrew Minnett, cofounder of Australian lithium battery company Sicona Battery Technologies, estimates Australia has 96% of the raw materials used in lithium batteries, but just 4% of that value was kept onshore.
In February, Australia’s federal government formally launched consultations on its National Battery Framework issues paper, which is seeking to strategise paths towards developing a globally competitive domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem in Australia.

The ASX-listed company has been granted mining authorisation and had its mine management plan approved by the Northern Territory government, marking the final step in the approvals process ahead of the investment decision from the Core Lithium board.
When Core Lithium opened its Finniss Lithium Project just south of Darwin’s port last October, it had expected its processing facilities at the site to be operational by early 2023. It seems these facilities are slightly delayed, with Core Lithium CEO, Gareth Manderson, saying in a recent statement: “Our focus now is to safely complete commissioning of the Dense Media Separation (DMS) plant at Finniss and ramp up our integrated operation.”

Once operational, Core Lithium’s concentrator facilities are expected to produce lithium concentrate that will be of “battery-grade” – a high enough quality to be used in electric vehicles (EVs) and the big batteries increasingly deployed to store renewable energy generated throughout the day.
Core Lithium delivered its first cargo of spodumene concentrate, a high-purity lithium ore, from the Finniss project last week. Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Mining and Industry, Nicole Manison attended the milestone at the Darwin Port, where she also announced the granting of the mining authorisation for BP33.
The new BP33 project, the company says, will be located “within trucking distance” of its existing open pit lithium mine, crusher and processing plant – which is just 5 kilometres away.

To date, Western Australia has supplied the majority of the world’s lithium, but with demand soaring and growing momentum around making Australia a global battery materials hub, projects across the continent have picked up a new sense of urgency.
Core Lithium’s Finniss project is Australia’s first lithium mine outside of Western Australia and its opening came just one year after construction began. The company has been granted tenements – effectively a claim, lease or licence to the area – for massive tracts sitting in total at 500 square kilometres and situated in what the company describes as “one of the most prospective areas for lithium in the NT,” the Bynoe Pegmatite Field.

Lithium mining and minerals processing have long been contentious though, criticised for its hefty environmental impacts. Given Australia has among the world’s largest lithium deposits, and lithium batteries remain the primary storage chemistry used today, it seems fairly likely lithium projects in Australia will grow considerably.
With Australia already the world’s largest lithium supplier, both governments and industry appear to be putting increasing emphasis on moving beyond our global “quarry” status to establish more battery material processing facilities onshore to capture the full value chain of the expanding industry. 
Members of the Northern Territory government have previously described the Finniss Lithium Project as “just the beginning.”

The facility will be capable of moving 16 separate weighted objects in a sequence to test the capabilities of Green Gravity’s technology.

The facility will also be co-commissioned with a digital twin. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physically commissioned system, and can be used to test new components or hypothesis before they are trialled in the physical world.
The startup, founded and headed up by former BHP executive Mark Swinnerton, says the introduction of digital assets into Gravity Lab will quickly enable data to validate its commercial-scale energy storage systems.
It is partnering with both Bluescope and AI specialist xAmplify to realise the Gravity Lab, and is receiving support from software company NVIDIA.
The startup is proposing to lift and release ultra heavy weights in legacy mine shafts. The concept is similar to other gravity energy storage technologies, but Swinnerton believes the use of old mine shafts, rather than purpose-built tall towers, will be his competitive advantage.

This is because redeploying abandoned but very abundant infrastructure lowers both the capital and environmental outlay of its projects. “By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low,” Swinnterton says. “By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.” 
According to Swinnerton, Green Gravity will be able to attach capacity at similar unit costs to pumped hydro, but for substantially less capital outlay. “So you don’t have to pay $700 million (USD 468 million) like you do in some of the big pumped schemes,” Swinnerton previously told pv magazine Australia. “You just say, ‘well, we’ll pay $30 million’. You’ll get less energy, but you’ll get a similar unit cost outcome to the pumped hydro and there’s lots of them.” 
Last November, Green Gravity and international engineering heavyweight GHD executed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop new applications for the startup’s storage solution. It also completed domestic capital raises in 2022, but has its sights set on raising substantially more global capital.
Green Gravity claims it has uncovered at least 3 GWh of potential storage capacity from the 175 sites it has assessed and found to be suitable. “I can guarantee you unequivocally that there is more than that available – and that’s just in Australia,” Swinnterton said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/16/india-to-join-germanys-green-hydrogen-strategy-update/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,GERMANY,INDIA",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"MAY 16, 2023",India to join Germany’s green hydrogen strategy update,"From pv magazine Global
India’s investments in renewables and grid upgrades provide the necessary assurances for investors to fund long-term hydrogen projects. By leveraging borrowing in dollars and euros, the country aims to reduce risks and costs, with export-oriented projects forming a key component of its hydrogen strategy.
In other words, German partners play a crucial role in reducing investment costs and enabling the launch of new projects, while India’s domestic market provides the necessary long-term assurances for the sector. Panelists at a conference organised by the Embassy of India in Berlin, Thyssenkrupp, and the World Energy Council highlighted India’s position as the third-largest producer of grey hydrogen, following Russia and China, and the world’s leading importer of ammonia.
“India has the largest electricity grid,” said Indian Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, adding that the pandemic and a year of war in Europe showed the need to restructure Europe’s industries. “But markets need to remain open.”
The two countries will collaborate not only in the financial sector but also in technology, providing significant benefits to various German companies, including major ones.
Thyssenkrupp, with its vertically integrated companies in Germany and India, holds a strategic advantage. The group possesses expertise in demand, supply, and infrastructure, making it well-positioned. In other words, the company requires hydrogen, has the capability to produce it through Nucera, an electrolyser company, and already operates hydrogen infrastructures via Uhde. The CEO of Uhde said that the company will soon announce a demo plant for hydrogen cracking.
Representatives from Germany’s MAN Energy&Solutions and RWE Supply & Trading, along with Indian companies Greenko Group, Avaada Group, and ACME Group, actively participated in the conference. High-profile executives from these companies highlighted the enduring engineering collaboration between Germany and India.
Diversified strategies
Greenko Group, in collaboration with Belgium’s John Cockerill, aims to double its OEM electrolyzer production capacity within a few months, according to the company’s founder. They express confidence in the Indian market and production capacity.
“We don’t need subsidies. In India, the cost of green hydrogen without subsidies is already below USD 3/kg,” said Greenko Group’s founder, Mahesh Kolli.
India and Germany aim to diversify their investments and import/export strategy. Indian hydrogen companies are actively involved in projects in Oman and Egypt. Meanwhile, the German government is developing its hydrogen strategy, focusing on tenders and auctions with various schemes. Currently, Germany sees South America, Australia, Canada, Namibia, and Mauritania as its ideal hydrogen partners.
“India will be part of Germany’s hydrogen national strategy. I am quite sure, yes,” said Till Mansmann, innovation commissioner for green hydrogen in the German Ministry of Education.
Trained physicist Mansmann highlighted Germany’s prolonged delay in investment decisions, but emphasised that the country’s experience with LNG terminals will inform the forthcoming Hydrogen acceleration law.
Panelists emphasised that top officials from the German government actively travel to shape this strategy, suggesting that one should examine the trips of Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck to comprehend the future hydrogen strategy of the country.
“We will import 70% of hydrogen needs in 2030, and the situation will not change till 2045,” said Mansmann.
The conference did not highlight any diverging interests between Germany and India in the hydrogen sector. However, India aims to sell energy carriers and low-carbon products at a premium price, expanding its presence in higher value-added markets, which have historically been a German specialty. Additionally, some participants proposed the idea of large German conglomerates establishing or utilising subsidiaries in India.
