The company posted total revenues of US$5.38 billion, up 18.1% on 2019; and non-GAAP (according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income of US$146.9 million, which was 1.2% down on 2019. It’s gross margin calculated across 2020, was 17.6%, compared with 18.3% in the full year 2019.
Looking ahead, Li said the company expects “total shipments in 2021 to grow over 30%, to be in the range of 25 GW to 30 GW”; while annual in-house production capacity will reach 33 GW of monocrystalline silicon wafers, 27 GW of solar cells and 37 GW of modules.
Li credits the company’s integrated operations and supply chain management for its resilience against continuous volatility in the industrial value chain, which he predicted was likely to continue into the second quarter of 2021.
But, he said, “As the world enters into the era of grid parity,” in which renewables-generated electricity comes at a lower or equal price to that generated by traditional fossil fuels, JinkoSolar expects “to solidify our foothold in major regions worldwide”.
According to strategic solar consulting firm SunWiz, JinkoSolar captured 22%, the highest market share, of the Australian distributed rooftop generation market.
Anita Li, General Manager of JinkoSolar for APAC and ANZ, was “excited to confirm our leading position in the Australian market as the No.1 modules supplier in the national rooftop business”.

In January of this year JinkoSolar had already claimed the biggest share — more than one-third by end 2020 — of the Australian utility-scale solar market, based on data available on the Australian National Electricity Market Dashboard.
At the time, it looked forward to claiming 1 GW of the nation’s utility solar capacity, when the Sunraysia, Glenrowan, Jemalong and Batchelor solar farms were fully commissioned this year.
January 2021 also saw JinkoSolar pad proudly away from the podium bearing the pv magazine best Module award for its high-density Tiger monofacial module. 
“The technology is really innovative,” explained juror Jay Lin. Jinko’s Tiger deploys tilting to great effect, packing 156 half cells into the larger module format for utility-scale and C&I roofs, and 132 for the residential segment. Thus, the Tiger achieves 455-475 W from 156 cells and 375-395 W from 132 – both using mono PERC cells. 
“At 21.6% module efficiency, Jinko’s Tiger is no pussycat,” the jurors representing the industry concluded.
The company says it expects its new-generation Tiger Pro flagship products to “account for 40% to 50% of the total shipments this year, with cumulative orders of over 10 GW”, but it is as yet uncertain when the high-performing residential and C&I Tigers will come to bask on Australian rooftops.
Xiande Li said that although the “mismatch between supply and demand” that emerged in the last quarter of 2020 was continuing to drive volatility in the solar market, “there is enough polysilicon to support over 180 GW of module production”.
February this year saw the company line up a strategic cooperation agreement with Tongwei Co. “to jointly invest in a high-purity crystalline silicon project with annual capacity of 45,000 metric tons and a silicon wafer project with an annual production capacity of 15 GW”.
Also in February, JinkoSolar signed a solar-glass procurement contract with Flat Glass Group Co., which secured around 338 million square metres of rolled glass to support the production of 59 GW of JinkoSolar modules from 2021 to 2023.
In other news released with JinkoSolar’s annual results, Li said the company is developing energy storage products specifically designed for the US and Japanese markets, and that its “Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) systems have been installed in a number of commercial real estate projects in China”.
Its latest BIPV project is a carport for 40 electric vehicles, which was connected to the grid in China in January. JinkoSolar’s BIPV products replace the traditional roof of the carport and feed electricity into charging pylons, with an annual generation capacity of more than 150,000kWh.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/12/battery-storage-systems-30-cheaper-than-rival-gas-peaker-plants-for-firming-renewables/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 12, 2021",Battery storage systems 30% cheaper than rival gas peaker plants for firming renewables,"In its new paper — Battery Storage — The New, Clean Peaker — released on the weekend, the Clean Energy Council (CEC) has amassed a battery of evidence that large-scale battery energy storage has become the superior solution to spreading energy generated by solar and wind throughout any day, and instantly responding to peak energy needs in the National Electricity Market (NEM) for long and short durations.
The paper compares the levelised cost of energy delivered by a new 250 MW gas peaker plant with 250 MW four-hour and two-hour grid-scale batteries, and finds that overall — when capital cost, cost of fixed operations and maintenance, and cost of variable operations and maintenance are calculated — the batteries are 17% (2-hour) and 30% (four-hour) cheaper.
Improvements in battery-operating technology mean storage now outperforms gas-fired peaking plants on speed and reliability of response, which was the basis of gas technology’s biggest claim to a place in the future renewable-energy-based electricity system.
Where gas plants can respond within 15 minutes, says the CEC report, battery solutions can discharge as “demand (and correspondingly prices) approach peak levels” and sustain output “to cover the typical daily peak duration”.
CEC Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said in a statement released with the report, “Batteries can ramp up quickly, have zero start-up time and provide a better frequency response.”
He referred not only to the study as evidence, but to the experience of large-scale batteries such as the Hornsdale Power Reserve connected to the NEM over recent years, saying, “Over the past three years, batteries have been essential in keeping the grid stable and keeping power flowing to energy users.”
The paper draws on the Australian Electricity Market Operator’s calculation that by 2040 between 6.6 GW and 19 GW of new dispatchable resources will be required to help meet fluctuating demand, and to stabilise frequencies across a NEM that will be powered by 26-50 GW of new renewables.
CEC findings underscore that, “batteries are now the most prudent choice to meet this level of dispatchable capacity”, it says.

Where capital cost was previously the biggest barrier to more widespread deployment of grid-scale batteries, product innovation and manufacturing at scale have already helped drive those costs down to the point where this year alone has seen developers announce 15 large-scale battery storage projects, with a total of 6.6 GW of capacity and $4.3 billion of investment.
These include AGL’s 200 MW four-hour duration battery storage facility to be built adjacent to its coal-fuelled Loy Yang Power Station; the ACT Government’s budgeting for a 250 MW battery energy storage system (BESS) to support the Territory’s grid; renewable developer Neoen’s plan for a 500 MW BESS west of Sydney in Wallerawang; and Edify Energy and Precinct Capital’s plan to build a 28 MW battery to stabilise the grid in Newcastle’s industrial precinct of Mayfield West.
Delivering Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) is not the only source of revenue to reward investment in batteries, and although the markets for battery services are still emerging, batteries can offer a wider range than gas peaker plants of network services, such as digital inertia, voltage support and system strength — at lower cost.
“It is no longer economically rational (or necessary) for proponents, investors or governments to build gas peaking plants in Australia,” states the CEC report, seeking to shatter once and for all the preference that “some” in the government and industry hold “for new gas peakers as the firming support for variable renewable energy”.
In fact, the report finds that risks to shareholders, tax payers and electricity customers, posed by investing in gas peaking technology are growing. They include:
Batteries of course not only emit no carbon during the discharge of their energy, but they facilitate greater uptake of renewable technologies while providing stability and security services to the grid.
The CEC also argues that the responsiveness — the necessary ramping up and down of peaking service providers — does not favour gas plants which will, says the CEC have a shorter lifespan when operated in a grid increasingly powered by renewables; and also require more regular downtime for maintenance.
“In contrast,” writes the CEC, “batteries have higher availability (given less maintenance work is required) and can offer guaranteed fixed power and energy for over 20 years to effectively maintain capacity over their entire useful life.”
Over time, batteries will become even more economical as a source of peak energy, as the costs of battery production fall, and the price of energy from proliferating renewable generation also becomes cheaper.
“The commercial case for batteries will continue to improve as battery technology advances and new markets are established to reward the services they provide,” says Thornton.
His one caveat in the undeniable, researched outcome of this BESS-vs-gas peaker comparison, is that long-term certainty for investment in batteries, “remains reliant on appropriate market reforms and forward-looking policy that incentivise new, flexible technologies that are needed to complement renewables”.
The methodology and modelling assumptions behind the CEC report are explained in its appendix.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/12/hair-coming-to-a-next-generation-solar-cell-near-you/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 12, 2021",Hair! Coming to a next-generation solar cell near you,"Materials science is one of the most open-ended fields of discovery. As if to prove the point, researchers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) have used human hair clippings sourced from a Brisbane barbershop to create carbon nanodots which were then incorporated into perovskite solar cells, where they’ve been found to confer an armour-like framework that supports greater stability and improved performance.
Professor Hongxia Wang, who led the group that recently published a paper on their findings in the Journal of Materials Science A, has been researching advanced solar cells for 20 years, and working with perovskite technology for about a decade.
Perovskites are widely considered the successor to today’s monocrystalline silicon solar cells. Their outstanding properties include the fact that they are lightweight and can be manufactured as a flexible film, suitable for a vast range of energy-generating applications, from clothing, to materials used in making tents, to powering spacecraft.
Wang says the team’s ultimate aim is to make solar energy cheaper, easier to access and longer-lasting, thereby helping to cleanly deliver global energy needs.
The big challenges in the area of perovskite solar cells are improving stability of the device so that it’s “able to operate for 20 years or longer, and the development of a manufacturing method that is suitable for large-scale production”, she says.
Wang tried incorporating the carbon-dot solution out of “curiosity” after her colleague, Associate Professor Prashant Sonar of QUT’s Centre for Materials Science transformed hair clippings into carbon nanodots by breaking down the hairs and then burning them at 240 degrees Celsius … and subsequently used them to create flexible displays that may be used in future iterations of smart devices.

The effect on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been astounding. Wang’s team found that adding a toluene-based antisolvent containing carbon dots to the synthesis of perovskite film forms a two-layered chemical structure with a wave-like, textured perovskite layer on top of a dense perovskite counterpart, which enables reduced optical losses through light trapping. 
The carbon dots form over and around the surface of the perovskite crystals to act as armour, such that the perovskite film shows “reduced density of interfacial defects, improved carrier recombination lifetime, better energy alignment with the adjacent hole transport layer and enhanced hydrophobicity”, says the paper’s abstract.
It concludes in summary that, “By leveraging these advantages to enhance the efficiency of PSCs, we have achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 20.22%, higher than 18.72% for PSCs without carbon dots, and the device stability is also significantly enhanced.”
The “armour” protects the perovskite material from moisture and other environmental factors which have previously been found to damage it; which has implications for the manufacture of perovskites.
Says Wang, “Currently, all the reported high-performance perovskite solar cells have been made in a controlled environment with extremely low levels of moisture and oxygen,” and producing very small cell areas which can’t feasibly be commercialised.
The “hairy” armour is a step towards better understanding how to protect perovskites in the conditions needed to enable large-scale production, and improve their stability over time.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/12/renewable-watts-up-36-on-same-time-last-year/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 12, 2021",Renewable watts up 36% on same time last year,"The total utility-scale PV generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) for March 2021 is in! And up 36% on the same month last year, according to Rystad Energy’s latest bi-monthly Watts Generating report which covers the renewable energy output of 72 PV assets across the nation, and identifies trends in the NEM and Western Australia’s Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM). 
In 2020, large-scale PV generated 550 GWh of power during March, and this year solar farms cranked out 746 GWh of electricity.
Plus there’s much more sun in the pipeline, with New South Wales and Queensland socking it out for supremacy in the solar generating stakes.
In March, Queensland beat NSW by a whisker, putting out 280 GWh of power from utility PV, compared with the NSW tally of 279 GWh.

“But NSW is currently the regional hotspot for commissioning activity,” writes David Dixon, Senior Analyst in the research company’s Australian renewable energy division.
Of the 18 renewable energy assets currently undergoing commissioning around the country, 11 are located in NSW, with PV concentrated in the West Murray and Central West regions. Of  1276 MW due to be commissioned in the NEM in coming months, NSW can lay claim to 946 MW.
Among the NSW solar farms about to complete commissioning are Edify Energy’s 275 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm, RWE’s 220 MW Limondale 1 Solar Farm; John Laing/Maoneng’s 200 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm; and Lightsource BP’s 174 MW Wellington Solar Farm.
The majority of these projects have come out of a morass of challenging network conditions that resulted in long delays to grid connection, costly add-ons such as Darlington’s two synchronous condensers, and a retreat from further renewable investment by developers such as John Laing.
March itself saw commissioning of Total Eren’s 200 MW Kiamal Solar Farm in Victoria, which is  the biggest large-scale solar farm to be fully operational in the NEM, overtaking Neoen’s 150 MW Coleambally Solar Farm and Blackrock and Edify’s 150 MW Daydream Solar Farm.
Kiamal has also had its share of challenges, which Dixon notes included “the exit of its EPC Biosar half way through the project, the requirement to install a synchronous condenser and marginal loss factors in the region being downgraded in recent years”.
Rystad found that the highest-performing PV assets in Australia by AC capacity factor were in Western Australia: with Synergy’s 40 MW Greenough River 1 Solar Farm generating at a capacity factor of 32.5% and Risen Energy’s 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm coming in at 32.4%; and Queensland dropping a percentage point or so with the still high-performing Kidston Solar Farm at 30.8% capacity factor.

Capacity factor relates to the amount of energy actually produced relative to the hypothetical  maximum production that the asset is capable of when running 100% of the time. PV generation is of course limited to certain hours of the day, impacted by cloud cover, and may be curtailed at times and for various reasons by energy market operators.
Overall Queensland had the highest capacity factor ratings for March, according to Rystad Watts Generating report, with the largest number — nine of 26 — solar farms generating at 25% AC CF or more during the month.
And Neoen retains its position as the top generator of utility-scale solar in the country.
