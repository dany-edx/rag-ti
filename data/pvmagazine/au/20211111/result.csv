NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean announced on Thursday that the Central-West Orana REZ, centred on the inland town of Dubbo, has been formally declared, paving the way for a huge pipeline of large-scale renewable energy generation and storage projects to come online, creating thousands of jobs and providing enough cheap, clean and reliable electricity to power more than a million homes.
“New South Wales is driving the nation’s action on climate change, by securing our economic and environmental prosperity for decades to come,” he said.
“Once complete this REZ will provide at least 3000 megawatts of cheap, reliable electricity, enough to power 1.4 million homes. It will also drive $5.2 billion in private investment into the Central West by 2030, supporting around 3,900 construction jobs.”
The declaration is the first step in formalising the REZ under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020. It sets out the intended size, location and infrastructure that will make up the Central-West Orana REZ which is centred on Dubbo and extends west to Narromine and east beyond Mudgee and takes in Wellington to the south and Gilgrandra to the north.
While the network capacity for the REZ is listed as 3 GW of solar and wind generation with transmission and storage, that is expected to be increased with the declaration highlighting there is scope for additional generation, storage and network infrastructure to be added in the future.

The Central-West Orana REZ is one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW Government’s electricity roadmap, which will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the New England, South-West, Hunter-Central Coast and Illawarra regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online ahead of the planned retirement of the state’s aging thermal-generation fleet.
The Central-West Orana region was selected to host the state’s first REZ due to the level of planning and investment in new solar, wind and energy storage projects already underway in the region, with about 4.5 GW of renewable energy projects either approved or in the planning system.
A call for registrations of interest in the Central-West Orana REZ last year attracted 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion, a response that Kean labelled “astounding”.
The Central-West Orana REZ was formally declared on 5 November, just 12 months after the state government legislated to install 12 GW of renewable generation and 2 GW of energy storage over 10 years, to replace retiring coal-plant generation.
“In New South Wales, we not only have targets and plans, we also have nation-leading legislation that will deliver on our commitment to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050,” Kean said.
“REZs are modern-day power stations which bring together low-cost solar and wind generation with transmission and storage to produce cheap, clean and reliable electricity.”
The state-owned Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo) has been appointed as the infrastructure planner for the Central-West Orana REZ and will coordinate the transmission, generation, firming and storage projects.
The first stage of the Central-West Orana REZ will be the development of new high-voltage transmission infrastructure, including power lines and substations, to connect renewable energy projects, including large-scale wind and solar farms to the existing electricity network.
New high-voltage transmission lines have been proposed to run in a 180-kilometre corridor from the existing network near Merriwa, passing south of Dunedoo before continuing south-west and connecting at the existing network east of Wellington. The study corridor includes an option to extend further south near Lake Burrendong. The existing 500 kV Wollar substation will also be upgraded as part of the Central-West Orana REZ Transmission project.
The new infrastructure will be delivered by the NSW transmission planner TransGrid.
The Central-West Orana REZ Transmission Project is expected to be shovel-ready at the end of 2022, with construction commencing in early 2023.
Member for Dubbo Dugald Saunders said the declaration of the Central-West Orana REZ was a great milestone for the region.
“Our region is blessed with some of the best renewable resources anywhere in the country, and this REZ will provide jobs, investment and economic benefits for generations to come,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/11/ccs-link-takes-shine-off-500-million-plan-to-boost-cefc-funding/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",CCS link takes shine off $500 million plan to boost CEFC funding,"The Australian government has pledged $500 million as part of the planned creation of a $1 billion technology fund intended to drive investment in Australian companies and develop new low-emissions technology, including carbon capture and storage (CCS).
The Low Emissions Technology Commercialisation Fund would combine $500 million of new capital for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) with a further $500 million to be raised from the private sector.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the fund would, subject to parliamentary approval, invest in early stage and growth businesses which are commercialising technologies that have the potential to accelerate Australia’s transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.
“Our plan to reach net zero by 2050 is an Australian one that’s focused on technology not taxes and this fund backs in Australian companies to find new solutions,” he said.
“We are backing Australian businesses by creating an environment for their successful ideas to thrive.”
The government’s list of potential areas for the fund’s investments include improvements to solar panels, the development of lighter and smaller battery cases and software developments to improve the operational efficiency of low-emissions technologies.
The legislative package would also include the expansion of the CEFC’s remit to enable it to invest in CCS.
The CEFC can currently invest in a broad range of low-emissions technologies, with CCS among those few technologies the clean energy funding body cannot back. The government’s legislation, set to be introduced in this term of Parliament, would remove the prohibition relating to CCS.
The government regards CCS as a priority under its Technology Investment Roadmap but the Smart Energy Council (SEC) said the technology remains uneconomical and unproven at scale.

“The Smart Energy Council absolutely rejects these latest attempts to gut the CEFC by forcing it to fund unproven, uneconomic CCS technology,” the SEC said in a statement.
“No CCS projects have been delivered on time, on budget or with promised emissions reductions anywhere in the world, despite decades of trying. The technology remains hugely expensive.
“This is yet another attempt to prop up Australia’s thermal coal industry, at the expense of renewables.”
CEFC chief executive officer Ian Learmonth said the Technology Commercialisation Fund would enable the green bank to continue investing venture and growth capital to support the commercialisation and deployment of low-emission technologies.
“It will also complement the ongoing role of our $200 million Innovation Fund, which is matching investors with local entrepreneurs whose homegrown technological breakthroughs are so important to decarbonisation,” he said in a statement.
“There is no single solution to cutting carbon emissions, which is why the diversity of these technologies is so important.”
The proposed allocation of an additional $500 million to the CEFC for investment through the Technology Commercialisation Fund would represent the first increase in Australian government funding for the CEFC since it was established in 2012.
In that time the CEFC has committed $9.5 billion across 220 large-scale projects and 23,700 smaller-scale transactions, driving $33 billion in new investments across the economy.
The government is expected to introduce legislation to establish the Technology Commercialisation Fund in this term of Parliament.
The announcement of the proposed fund comes just weeks after oil and gas giant Santos and joint venture partner Beach Energy revealed a final investment decision (FID) to proceed with the $220 million Moomba CCS project in South Australia.
Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher said the project has been successfully registered with Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator (CER) with start-up expected in 2024.
“This carbon reduction project in the South Australian outback will be one of the biggest and lowest cost in the world and will safely and permanently store 1.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year in the same reservoirs that held oil and gas in place for tens of millions of years,” he said.
The Moomba CCS hub is the first project of its kind to be registered under the government’s Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF).

Obviously, this makes Marble Bar the ideal place to invest in solar panels, and that’s why the WA state government’s WA Recovery Plan has funded the completion and commissioning of a town battery to store excess solar energy.
State-owned regional energy provider Horizon Power’s $31 million Energy Storage in Regional Towns project, which will also see community battery energy storage systems (BESS) installed in Broome, Carnarvon, Exmouth, Wiluna, Yalgoo and Yungngora by the end of 2022, believe Marble Bar’s new BESS will free up more than 100 kW of hosting capacity.
The BESS systems in Wiluna and Yalgoo were commissioned last month, and the towns of Menzies and Gascoyne Junction are also being investigated as potential hosts for a BESS solution.
Marble Bar’s approximately 600 residents will now be able to connect a standard rooftop solar system of 3 kW, which could see their electricity bills cut by an average of $1,275 annually.
Moreover, Marble Bar is already home to a centralised solar farm that generates more than 1 GWh each year.

Horizon Power’s Energy Storage in Regional Towns project aims to free up around 10 MW of hosting capacity across the aforementioned towns, providing more than 3,000 households across regional WA with the ability to connect their systems.
“We know customers from across our service area have a strong appetite for connecting their own rooftop solar systems and installing batteries like this one in Marble Bar mean we can help them acheive this,” said Horizon Power CEO Stephanie Unwin at an event at the Marble Bar civic centre to commemorate the commissioning.
“This exciting project is just another way we are delivering on our goal to reduce our customers’ energy bills by 10% and have zero refusals when it comes to connecting solar in the next four years.”
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnstone said the BESS systems would make more solar capacity available in regional areas and “is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13,000 tonnes a year.” Moreover, “The project roll-out will also support economic development, providing opportunities for local installers to supply solar systems to customers.”
The Marble Bar battery was supplied and installed by WA-based Hybrid Systems Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/11/gallium-arsenide-nanowire-solar-cell-with-7-7-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORWAY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 11, 2021",Gallium arsenide nanowire solar cell with 7.7% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Solar cells based on III-V materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) can achieve much higher efficiencies than those ensured by conventional crystalline silicon. Their costs, however, still confine the technology to niche segments such as applications in space or expensive innovative projects with relatively long implementation timeframes.
Some researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) have decided to take a different approach and used GaAs not as a substrate for the solar cell but as a material to fabricate an axial p-i-n junction nanowire array. These nanowires are then used to build a nanowire solar cell to be used as a top cell in a dual tandem cell with a bottom silicon cell.
Nanowire solar cells have the advantage over planar solar cells in allowing for a thick absorbing layer to fully absorb the solar spectrum. Other advantages are reduced reflection, extreme light trapping, improved bandgap tuning, facile strain relaxation, and increased defect tolerance.
The nanowires were grown through molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which is a technique commonly used for thin-film deposition of single crystals in the production of semiconductor devices.
“We have worked to minimise the cost of growing the top GaAs nanowire cell, because it’s the GaAs fabrication cost that is one of the major issues that is currently holding back the technology,” said researcher Helge Weman, noting that these nanowires could be easily produced on an industrial scale through metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). The latter is a different type of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and is commonly utilised for the deposition of crystalline micro or nano-thin films.
The nanowire structure used in the cell has a tiny footprint and this, according to the research team, enabled the formation of high-quality crystals in the nanowire and in the interface with the silicon, which improved the overall cell’s efficiency.
“Employing this method, a GaAs nanowire array solar cell with only around 1.3% areal coverage of the nanowires shows a photoconversion efficiency of around 7.7% under 1 Sun intensity [at standard radiation conditions], which is the highest achieved efficiency from any single-junction GaAs nanowire solar cell grown on a silicon substrate so far,” the researchers stated. “This corresponds to a power-per-weight ratio of the active III–V photoconversion material [of] as high as 560 W/g, showing great promise for high-efficiency and low-cost III–V nanowire solar cells and III–V nanowire-silicon tandem solar cells.”
The details on the solar cell and the related manufacturing technique can be found in the paper GaAs/AlGaAs Nanowire Array Solar Cell Grown on Si with Ultrahigh Power-per-Weight Ratio, which was recently published in ACS Photonics. “We are exploring growing this type of lightweight nanowire structure on atomically thin two-dimensional substrates such as graphene,” said researcher Anjan Mukherjee, referring to the further development of the technique. “This could open up enormous opportunities to produce lightweight and flexible solar cells that can be used in self-powered drones, micro-satellites and other space applications.”
