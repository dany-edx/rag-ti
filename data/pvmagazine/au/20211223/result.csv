https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/23/installers-to-play-key-role-in-unsw-solar-module-recycling-strategy/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 23, 2021",Installers to play key role in UNSW solar module recycling strategy,"A team of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) has devised a reverse logistics model which they say leverages existing systems to improve the traceability of end-of-life solar PV modules and cut the costs associated with transporting them to recycling points.
Lead researcher David Leyton, a part of the research team overseen by Richard Corkish, chief operating officer of SPREE’s Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, and postdoctoral fellow Nathan Chang, detailed the Solar Reverse Logistics Model (SRLM) in a presentation at the Asia-Pacific Solar Research Conference in Sydney last week.
Leyton, a registered electrical contractor who is completing his PhD at UNSW, said the reverse logistics model relies on installers transporting end-of-life solar PV modules from the job site back to the warehouse from where they purchased the new modules.
The serial numbers of the end-of-life modules are recorded and allocated to a pallet or container which also bears a serial number. From there, the modules are ferried to a central collection point and onto a recycling facility.
“There are two aspects to the Solar Reverse Logistics Model; the serial numbers and the return leg of the electrician,” Leyton told pv magazine.
“The serial numbers are a no brainer. In the solar industry we are very sensitive to the serial number of the solar module. Every solar module that has ever been installed on the grid has been recorded and most importantly, the serial number has been recorded.
“We would use the same system to scan the serial numbers of the end-of-life modules and then add serial numbers to the pallets and containers along the logistics chain.
“You pick up modules, scan the serial numbers, take them to a container, scan the serial number of the container and then it is clear where those panels are. Then the container goes to a recycling facility, or it goes to reuse. It’s all manageable.”

While tracking end-of-life solar PV modules might be a “no brainer”, overcoming the economic challenges associated with recycling solar PV modules has proved problematic. While solar PV modules are 100% recyclable, stripping and sorting the materials is a costly exercise and the return on those materials isn’t not yet large enough to cover those costs.
“The main problem with recycling solar modules is that at the end of their life they are not worth as much as they were at the beginning,” Leyton said. “When you recycle them, the value you get out a recycled solar module is the equivalent value of some aluminium and some glass and a little bit of silicone and silver. Plus, you have to spend an awful lot of time and energy deconstructing your module. That’s the challenge.”
Leyton said the SRLM approach would help cut costs on the logistics side, making recycling a more attractive proposition.
“With the installer transporting the used modules back to the collection point you eliminate the need for someone else to fulfil that role,” he said. “You don’t have two vehicles going out to the same site. The installer takes on another role and they get compensated for that role.”
The idea to utilise the installers to transport the used modules was discovered almost by chance. Leyton said while collecting modules from the warehouse for an installation, he noticed one of the panels was damaged. The panel was replaced but Leyton opted to take the damaged panel with him and while driving away the reverse logistics model became clear.
“When you deal with modules a lot, when you install them, deinstall them, move them, transport them and so on you get a different perspective,” Leyton said.
“The lightbulb moment happened when driving home with both the new modules and the one smashed module in the van.
“The same installer can take new modules to site and he or she can take the end-of-life modules back from site.”
“The electrician or the solar company or whoever is doing the job is coming to the property with new panels, therefore they have space to take the old panels away.”
While acknowledging the “details and the economics and who pays who and how much for each panel” is still to be resolved, Leyton said Australia’s embrace of solar means it is imperative strategies are put in place to ensure end-of-life modules are reused or recycled, reducing the amount of waste heading to landfills.

According to the nation’s Clean Energy Regulator (CER), as of mid 2021 there were more than 3 million residential, commercial, and large-scale solar PV installations across Australian with a combined capacity of more than 22.3 GW.
That uptake is generating what some have labelled a “landfill nightmare”. In 2018 Australians generated 2,700 tons of PV waste as the earliest modules reached their end of life. It is estimated more than 100,000 tons of modules will enter the national waste stream by 2035. By 2050, it’s expected there will be 1.5 million tons of solar PV waste in Australia.
“The industry is booming but the only problem with all this solar is that it has to be recycled. It has a finite lifespan,” Leyton said.
“My solution is we in the solar industry are responsible, not the couriers, not the waste people, not the customer, we are responsible.
“The installer should take back the solar module to a wholesaler or site that can receive them. If they take it back to a wholesaler it makes perfect sense. Wholesalers have space plus they are getting trucks coming to them with modules and they are leaving empty. It would make a whole lot more sense to take the end-of-life module back to the wholesaler and the wholesaler to put the end-of-life modules on the trucks which are delivering to them in the first place and then they go back to a central citywide hub. That’s the reverse logistics.”
Leyton said the SRLM concept has attracted support from the industry, including installers and manufacturers.
“There’s been a lot of industry interest,” he said. “I’ve spoken with a number of manufacturers and the evidence is that they are more than willing to bear their share of responsibility.
“I don’t think you’re going to get any resistance from anyone in this industry to a way forward.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/23/photon-offloads-solar-farm-to-focus-on-solar-hydro-technology-in-australia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 23, 2021",Photon offloads solar farm to focus on ‘solar-hydro’ technology in Australia,"The Australian arm of the Amsterdam-headquartered Photon Energy has sold its 65% stake in the $188 million Maryvale Solar Farm in New South Wales (NSW), announcing the move will allow it to fully focus its future development activities on utility-scale projects based on the RayGen Resources technology which merges solar PV power generation with long-duration electro-thermal energy storage.
Photon announced this week it has sold its share in the 160 MWdc (125 MWac) Maryvale Solar Farm being developed near Wellington in central western New South Wales to the German-owned renewable energy developer Wirsol.
The agreement entails an initial payment of €500,000 ($A788,000) and also calls for Wirsol to pay Photon another two ‘milestone-related’ payments, due upon successful completion and commissioning of the project. Construction of the project is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2022.
Michael Gartner, Photon Energy chief technical officer and managing director of its Australian operations, said the transaction will allow the company to further explore Melbourne-based RayGen’s solar co-generation and electro-thermal energy storage technology and build out its Australian portfolio.
“Having Wirsol as a partner in Maryvale confirms the quality of our assets and will allow us to accelerate our growth in renewables within the framework of an efficient and sustainable energy transition and with the goal of adding over 500 MWp of PV generation capacity before the end of 2024,” he said.

The transaction comes just six weeks after Photon revealed plans to build a large-scale renewable energy facility in South Australia utilising RayGen’s technology which combines concentrated solar PV technology with electro-thermal storage comprising water-based pit thermal energy storage, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbines and industrial chillers.
The proposed SA project would have a total solar generation capacity of 300 MW with a grid connection capacity of 150 MW. The target energy storage capacity is 3.6 GWh, equivalent to 24 hours of full load, to the grid, from storage.
Photon, which entered a strategic partnership with RayGen in 2020 and earlier this year made a $3 million equity investment in in the company, said it has already secured 1,200 hectares of land for the project but has not yet revealed the specific location.
“RayGen technology tackles head on the problem of intermittency of solar energy as it combines high efficiency concentrated PV generation with thermal absorption and storage, providing for the highest energy density of any solar technology available today,” Gartner said at the time of the capital increase.

For Wirsol, a subsidiary of German-based renewable energy group Wircon, the acquisition of the Maryvale Solar Farm adds another utility-scale solar project to its Australian portfolio.
The developer’s other Australian projects include the 110 MWp Wemen Solar Farm in north-western Victoria and the 60 MWp Whitsunday and the 90 MWp Clermont solar farm in  Queensland. In October, Wirsol announced it had acquired the land rights to develop the 75-85 MWp Barnawartha Solar Farm near Wodonga in Victoria.
It was project manager of 149 MWp Glenrowan West Solar Farm during its construction and commissioning phase, and now operates the Victorian facility on behalf of German owners Wirtgen Invest. Wirsol also co-owns, with Edify Energy, the 25 MW/50 MWh Gannawarra Energy Storage System, which sits alongside the 60 MW Gannawarra Solar Farm in Victoria.
The Maryvale Solar Farm, being developed near Wellington, about 50 kilometres southeast of Dubbo, will comprise an estimated 450,000 PV modules installed on a single axis tracking system alongside 40 inverter stations.
Located in the NSW Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), which is anticipated will unlock up to 3 GW of new generation by the mid-2020s, the solar farm will connect to the grid via an existing Essential Energy 132 kV transmission line.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/23/rio-tinto-targets-european-ev-market-for-2-4-billion-lithium-project/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,EASTERN EUROPE,EUROPE,SLOVAKIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 23, 2021",Rio Tinto targets European EV market for $2.4 billion lithium project,"ASX-listed miner Rio Tinto continues to strengthen its portfolio for the world’s transition to cleaner energy sources, announcing it will support the development of a “battery ecosystem” in Europe with an investment in electric vehicle (EV) battery producer Inobat Auto.
Rio Tinto said the investment will help Inobat complete the construction of an 88,000 square-metre battery research and development (R&D) centre and pilot plant being developed near its existing headquarters in Slovakia.
Inobat, which specialises in research, development, manufacture, and provision of electric batteries custom designed to be used in automotive, commercial vehicle, and aerospace sectors, is also planning to build several gigafactories, including one in Serbia, home to Rio Tinto’s $2.4 billion Jadar lithium-borates project, one of the largest greenfield lithium projects in development.
Managing director of Rio Tinto’s battery materials business, Marnie Finlayson, said the investment comes after the two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May, outlining an intention to work together to progress the establishment of a “cradle-to-cradle” EV battery value chain.
“We are delighted to be able to deepen our partnership with InoBat through our investment and look forward to benefitting from a broader perspective of the battery materials sector, as well as insights into future battery chemistries and technologies,” she said.
“Our Jadar lithium project in Serbia is on the doorstep of the European electric vehicle market. Capable of producing enough lithium to make around 1 million electric vehicle batteries a year to the highest environmental standards, we believe Jadar will be a critical supplier of the European battery ecosystem.”
The world’s second-largest metals and mining corporation, Rio Tinto has predicted a 25-35% increase in lithium demand over the next decade as the sales of EVs continue their upward trajectory.

Independent energy research firm Rystad Energy estimates that EVs, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV), will this year account for about one in every 10 new cars purchased, with a global market share of 10.3%, up from 5.3% in 2020.
This market share will be a new global record, marking the first time EV sales have accounted for a double-digit share of total vehicle sales, which are projected to be around 69 million in 2021. Rystad anticipates a high adoption scenario of 72% EV share globally by 2030 and close to 100% by 2040.
Rio Tinto said the scale and high-grade nature of the Jadar deposit provides the potential for a mine to supply lithium products into the EV value chain for decades and position the company as the largest source of lithium supply in Europe, one of the world’s largest growing EV markets.
“This collaboration with InoBat will enable an important exchange of knowledge and information on lithium processing, recycling and technologies for the next generation of batteries,” Finlayson said.
The miner said the Jadar project, which remains subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences, has the potential to produce approximately 55,000 tonnes of battery grade lithium carbonate per year. The project will also produce borates for use in solar panels and wind turbines.
If approved, construction of the Jadar mine is expected to take up to four years to construct with Rio Tinto anticipating first saleable production in 2026.

Inobat has said the battery R&D centre and pilot plant, which will be powered by green energy through grid electricity and solar panels, is set to be operational in early 2022.
Inobat chief executive officer Marian Bocek said the company is “thrilled” to partner with Rio Tinto and the cooperation between the mining group and the battery developer will cover the entire life cycle of lithium, from raw materials to recycling.
“Our mission has always been to provide solutions across the entire value chain,” he said. “With Rio Tinto, we are looking forward to further developing our manufacturing capacities and working closely on the downstream development of a battery ecosystem with common decarbonisation efforts at its core.”
Rio Tinto’s lithium pipeline also includes the Boron mine site in California which earlier this year commenced production of battery-grade lithium from waste rock.
The demonstration plant has a design capacity of 10 tonnes per year of battery grade lithium. It will be run throughout 2021 to optimise the process and inform Rio Tinto’s feasibility assessment for progressing to a production scale plant with an initial capacity of at least 5,000 tonnes per year, or enough to make batteries for approximately 70,000 EVs.

Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow has completed construction on a 600 kW floating PV array in Hanoi, Vietnam.
The solar plant is powering the Vinhomes Ocean Park, a complex comprising a residential area and park that was built recently in the city’s outskirts.
“The solar panels were installed with a tilt angle of five degrees and the anchoring was made with deadweight block anchor[s],” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “This solution was friendly to the water body and lake bed, which has a depth of five meters, and maintained the original landscape.”
The array was built with a floating structure provided by Sungrow itself and mainstream, 182mm solar panels with a power output of 540 W each. According to the manufacturer, the project will not only power the park and local community but also offer an “attractive landscape.”
The new floating array is not the first project of this kind built in Vietnam and Sungrow said it has deployed around 125 MW of floating PV capacity in the country.
At the end of 2020, two large scale floating PV power plants, totalling 70 MW, were grid connected in the country. The two facilities, each of which have a capacity of 35 MW, were deployed on the Gia Hoet 1 and Tam Bo irrigation lakes, in the commune of Quang Thanh, located in the district of Chau Duc.
Both projects were likely developed under Vietnam’s FIT scheme for solar.

The Tractebel engineering subsidiary of French utility Engie is part of a partnership which has developed an offshore concept for the storage of hydrogen in caverns, a system the project partners have called a global first. “The design study … outlines an innovative solution for large scale hydrogen storage on the high seas: A scalable offshore platform for the compression and storage of up to 1.2 million m³ of hydrogen,” Engie wrote last week. “Underground salt caverns will be used as storage and buffer for the hydrogen produced offshore before the gas is transported via the pipeline network to the onshore grid, and finally to consumers and customers.” The storage and compressor platforms can reportedly process 400,000Nm3 (normal cubic meters) of hydrogen per hour, with the energy storage medium stored in underground salt caverns at a pressure of up to 180 bar.
The government of Western Australia is backing its hydrogen industry with three projects set to receive support from its lead agency services. Province Resources’ HyEnergy Project will harness 8 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity to produce around 550,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year. The Murchison Hydrogen Renewables facility will use solar and wind to produce 5.2 GW of electricity to power the production of hydrogen which will be converted into 2 million tonnes of green ammonia annually. It is expected InterContinental Energy’s Western Green Energy Hub will use up to 50 GW of solar and wind capacity to produce up to 3.5 million tonnes of hydrogen or 20 million tonnes of green ammonia per year.
The European Commission has approved, under EU state aid rules, a €900 million (AU$14 million) German scheme to support investment in the production of renewable hydrogen in non-EU countries, which will be then imported to the EU. “The scheme, called H2Global, aims at meeting the EU demand for renewable hydrogen that is expected to significantly increase in the coming years, by supporting the development of the unexploited renewable resource potential outside the EU,” wrote the commission yesterday. The ten-year project will be managed by special-purpose entity Hint.co. “This intermediary will conclude long-term purchase contracts on the supply side ([for] green hydrogen production) and short-term resale contracts on the demand side (green hydrogen usage),” said the commission. Prices will be determined via a double-auction model, where the lowest bid price for hydrogen production and the highest selling price for hydrogen consumption will each be awarded contracts.
Spanish company H2B2 Electrolysis Technologies is developing a project to generate up to 1,000kg per day of solar-powered emission-free hydrogen in California. The SoHyCal project, in Fresno County, consists of the construction, financing and operation of a renewable hydrogen production plant using polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) technology, and with a nameplate capacity of up to 3,000kg per day.
Hydrogen-powered equipment was mentioned as part of Hyundai Construction Equipment‘s plan to invest €150 million into its Ulsan production plant, in South Korea, to increase capacity by 50% to more than 15,000 machines per year. “The move will support Hyundai’s growing presence in the booming global construction equipment market while providing a manufacturing base for a new generation of electric and hydrogen-powered equipment,” the company wrote yesterday.
Sweden has shown it has the potential to become a pioneer in green steel production, according to a note released today by U.S.-owned analyst Wood Mackenzie. The Nordic nation produces 3.2% of the crude steel made in the EU and U.K. Sweden’s steelmakers expected to bank on the cost reductions offered by alkaline electrolysis technology, as well as benefiting from the declining cost of renewables and rising carbon prices, according to WoodMac. “At a levelised cost of electricity at $30/MWh, wind power is a highly economical source of power generation in Sweden today,” wrote the analyst. “Further cost reductions are expected, with better financing structures for onshore wind, lower capex [capital expenditure levels] for onshore and offshore installations, technological optimisation for asset management, and state support for offshore grid infrastructure.” WoodMac added, the combination of hydrogen from alkaline electrolysis and energy from onshore wind is the most cost-effective option for green crude steel production in Sweden. “Assuming a carbon price of US$100/tonne, green steel producers could benefit from US$85/tonne of carbon credits,” wrote the analyst. “Better financing models for onshore wind and 48% lower capex for alkaline technology in 2025, yield [a] steel cost of US$360-390/tonne in carbon price scenarios ranging between $50/tonne and $150/tonne.”
