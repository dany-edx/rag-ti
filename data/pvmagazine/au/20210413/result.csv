Today that venture has experienced another push – with two of Australia’s budding vanadium producers both announcing news of their developing strategies.
Fittingly, the two companies both seem to be moving in similar veins – taking notes from the other as they both forge forward on Australia’s lesser travelled energy storage path.
Australian mining technology company TNG Limited, which owns the world’s most advanced vanadium project – the Mount Peake Vanadium-Titanium-Iron Project (Mount Peake Project), has agreed to a joint venture with major Singapore-based vanadium redox flow battery manufacturer, V-Flow Tech.
Under the proposed joint venture, TNG and V-Flow will collaborate on the development and delivery of new energy power systems underpinned by vanadium redox flow batteries, with V-Flow supplying the battery systems, and TNG supplying the high-purity vanadium electrolyte required to operate the batteries.
The vanadium electrolyte will be supplied from TNG’s Mount Peake Project, which is located 230km north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. It is set to produce around 6,000 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide to be used for vanadium redox flow batteries every year.

The joint venture’s aim is to create green power systems targeted to remote sites in regional Australia. Currently, much of regional Australia is powered by diesel generators – but TNG argues flow batteries are a cleaner, more economically viable alternative for Indigenous communities, pastoral stations, road houses and mine sites.
The establishment of the joint venture, which is still being formally negotiated,  will represent a major step towards TNG achieving its vision of becoming a commercial supplier of vanadium redox flow battery systems in Australia, it said in its ASX announcement today.
Australian Vanadium
Australian Vanadium (ASX: AVL) is also vying to become a commercial supplier of vanadium flow batteries in Australia, developing the strategy through its subsidiary company VSUN.
Funnily, VSUN has been supplying VRFBs through its battery manufacturing partner (surprise surprise) V-Flow Tech for some time.
In another synchronicity, but this time in the opposite direction – Australian Vanadium is following in TNG’s footsteps, filing a patent application for its vanadium processing route. (TNG’s proprietary TIVAN process for the extraction and recovery of high-purity vanadium is already patented. It is considerably different from Australia Vanadium’s route though – with the TIVAN process involving acid, where Australia’s Vanadium’s is based on roast and water leach.)
Australian Vanadium
On Monday, Australian Vanadium announced it had submitted a provisional patent application for its vanadium processing route. The patent application relates to a method for preparing high-purity vanadium pentoxide.
“The processing circuit is at the core of AVL’s ongoing BFS engineering study as part of the Company’s plans to develop the Australian Vanadium Project at Gabanintha, in Western Australia,” the company said in a statement.
The application begins a 12- month period in which a patent application can be filed claiming priority.
Flow batteries are an intrinsically different beast to the predominant lithium-ion batteries, which are the domain of giants like Tesla. Lithium-ion batteries are what’s known as solid-state batteries, storing energy in metal.
Flow batteries, on the other hand, store energy in electrolyte liquids. They are usually designed to have two tanks, one containing a positively-charged anode and the other with a negatively-charged cathode, separated by a membrane.
Using liquids allows flow batteries to produce electrical currents without degradation, giving the batteries a longer cycle life and allowing them to store charge for longer periods compared to lithium-ion batteries. It also makes them non-flammable and well-suited to the tough conditions in Australia’s outback.

Flow batteries can also be fully discharged without damage, and are easily scaleable – able to be fitted to one another to increase capacity.
Their pitfall? Size. Tanks of fluid can, by nature, only be made so small. Which is part of the reason lithium-ion batteries have been far quicker out the gate – we’ve needed small, high-powered batteries a lot longer than we have utility-scale ones. Despite being arguably less well suited for larger scale applications, lithium-ion batteries have benefited massively from their ubiquity and visibility, having been used for decades in our phones, laptop chargers and now in our EVs.
Companies like TNG and Australian Vanadium, as well as others like Redflow, are working hard to establish flow batteries in the market though– which is no easy feat given humans’ tendency to continue on established paths.
Nonetheless, the market for flow batteries has recently experienced massive surges worldwide as cognisance grows about how battery makeup affects its applications. In other words, as the energy storage market grows, so too is market acceptance of flow batteries.

The effort will be staged in two parts, with Stage 1 including the re-configuration of its power station to add a 2 MW battery energy storage unit and increase gas generation. The company says the move will significantly reduce the need for back-up diesel generation, with four diesel generators being removed.
Stage 2 will include will include what the company is calling a “future mixed renewables power station,” and is expected to come to fruition in 2023.
To implement the strategy, Wiluna Mining Corp has signed a 10-year contract extension with Contract Power Group, with the provider to power the mines until 2031.
“Contract Power Group are experts in efficient generation of electrical power and in decarbonisation by harnessing off-grid wind or solar power,” Wiluna Mining Corp said in a statement. “Wiluna are refining its plans with Contract Power Group to include decarbonisation within our methods of power generation at site. This may also moderate our exposure to future volatility in the cost of hydrocarbon fuels.”
The company said it will focus on renewable power studies and options during 2021 and 2022 to:
“We look forward to working with Contract Power to not only transitioning the Wiluna Mine once again into one of Australia’s biggest and most profitable gold mines, but to helping it become one of Australia’s cleanest mines,” Wiluna Mining’s Executive Chair, Milan Jerkovic, said.

The energy giant will now be partnering with Finnish technology company Wärtsilä to develop systems for its commercial and industrial customers which integrate renewable behind-the-meter and off-grid technologies. The aim is to provide customers who have energy requirements above 20 MW with a broader range of options to improve energy efficiencies and supply.
In March, AGL acquired Epho and Solgen Energy Group. The merger propelled AGL to the position of Australia’s largest commercial solar provider in Australia. Its new partnership with Wärtsilä continues on from this presumably, extending the possibilities for C&I customers to not only generate green energy, but to solar shift.
The “innovative systems” to be established as part of the agreement with Wärtsilä will integrate solar, wind, battery storage and gas-firming technology. As Wärtsilä Energy’s President, Sushil Purohit, pointed out in a statement, intelligent energy management software and balancing engine power plants will also be necessary to support the integration of renewable energy sources into power systems in ways that maintain system flexibility, network stability and energy security.
“These systems will provide customers with certainty and peace of mind – knowing on low generation solar or wind days, flexible firming technologies are in place to meet their demands,” AGL’s Chief Operating Officer, Markus Brokhof, said.
Just last month, AGL announced it will partition itself into two energy businesses with separate strategies (one green, one brown) following intense pressure stemming from its poor environmental record and slumping fossil fuel assets. This announcement, which was met with little enthusiasm from the market, came off the back of news the company would retire Australia’s dirtiest coal power station, Loy Yang, early to replace it will a 200 MW big battery.
In January, AGL also secured Wärtsilä under a non-exclusive framework agreement to supply up to 1000 MW of grid-scale batteries across the NEM.

Suzhou-based solar company Jolywood is planning to invest in a new factory in Indonesia with its state-owned local partner.
The Jolywood (Taizhou) Solar Technology Co Ltd major subsidiary of the manufacturer is planning a fab able to produce 1 GW of solar cells and panels per year through a joint venture (JV) with PT Len Agra Energy. The venture will be 60% funded by the Chinese partner.
The Len Agra Energy solar manufacturer and project developer is owned by state-controlled energy company PT Len Industry and by PT Agra Surya Energy.
The fab will open up the Indonesian and U.S. markets for Jolywood, thanks to domestic content requirements instituted in the former country and the fact Indonesia is not among the nations upon which the U.S. imposes import duties on solar products.
The plans outlined by the Jolywood board indicate permission for the JV will have to be given by Chinese state departments including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and the National Development and Reform Commission, as well as their Indonesian counterparts.
Jolywood is the largest n-type TOPCon technology user and the only one with gigawatt scale production capacity for such products. The Jolywood website states the company had 5.1 GW of n-type TOPCon cell and module capacity last year.
