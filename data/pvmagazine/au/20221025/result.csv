Such a scheme would see state governments partner with the federal government for a series of large-scale renewable storage project tenders.  The idea being to accelerate the build out of utility-scale firming mechanisms to support the desperate need for more renewable energy rollout.
The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Integrated System Plan (ISP) forecasts the need for 60 GW of firming capacity by 2050, triple what is currently available.
In a speech made at Australian Energy Week in June, 2022, AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman expressed deep concern about the scale of investment being made into energy storage projects.
“That firming capacity, including dispatchable storage, is absolutely critical and, to be frank, one of my worries is we’re not really seeing that investment in firming capacity at sufficient scale at the moment,” said Westerman.
SEC Chief Executive John Grimes said there is no way Australia can reach its target of “82% renewables by 2030 unless we unleash renewable energy storage. We need everything from batteries on wheels in electric vehicles to household battery systems to unlocking massive investment in large-scale energy storage projects through a Renewable Energy Storage Acceleration Scheme.”
The scheme would require a large-scale renewable energy storage target in gigawatts or each state and territory, adding up to a national large-scale renewable energy storage target (LREST).
Love me tenders
The aforementioned tenders would see proponents bid a floor price for a potential project’s net revenue over a set period. Successful proposals would then be able to take advantage of low-cost financing that might otherwise be difficult to obtain in a market where some perceived uncertainty lurks in storage revenues.
CEIG Chair Simon Corbell said the potential scheme would deliver “fast, proven and cost-effective renewable energy storage and provides exactly the right signals to investors. The scheme also retains strong incentives or owners of storage assets to pursue other revenue schemes, thereby reducing risk to consumers and taxpayers.”
According to the SEC the revenues of such large-scale projects would likely far exceed the initial floor bid, meaning the government would not have to contribute payments to the projects themselves. Moreover, “claw back provisions” in the scheme would mean that storage projects would make return payments to governments when their revenues reach a net revenue ceiling set in the tender process.
CANA’s CEO, Glen Klatovsky, added that the scheme would provide governments with “a genuine way to make sure energy storage is operating and ready to go as our old, polluting coal-fired power stations retire.”
Utility-scale battery energy storage systems can be operational within 18 months of being awarded a tender if the project is sufficiently advanced in its planning.
“We urge energy ministers to put in place a Renewable Energy Storage Acceleration Scheme before the end of the year,” said Klatovsky finally.

Los Angeles-based technology start-up Nanotech Energy says its proprietary, graphene-based, nanotechnology overcomes the safety challenges of traditional lithium-ion batteries, and its latest announcement signals it might be making progress in bringing its products to the mass market.
Nanotech’s battery uses lithium-ion chemistry supported by graphene and a proprietary nonflammable electrolyte technology that improves the electrochemical properties and safety of its electrodes.
According to the company, graphene provides ideal electronic and mechanical support to increase the reversible capacity, power and cycling stability of standard cathodes. Nanotech produces its own graphene, which allows it to be vertically integrated.
On Thursday, the company announced it would supply more than 1 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to Athens-headquartered Smile Energy, acting as the distributor for Greece and the surrounding region with Nanotech Energy BESS products through to 2028. Greece has recently doubled its 2030 energy storage target to 3 GW.
Smile Energy will potentially use Nanotech’s products to develop BESS for private homes, commercial real estate, and the marine sector and building on its pipeline of 700 MWh of energy storage across Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania.
The startup uses a solution processing method that allows graphene to be coated on “any substrate” along with a laser process step that forms a graphene foam. The company had originally applied its graphene technology to making better supercapacitors, but now focuses on its “super battery.”
“Nanotech Energy is the first and only producer to break the 50% content barrier by reaching 98% monolayer graphene, the wonder material that powers our products. We’ve already developed groundbreaking energy storage using technology that has the high capacity of a battery and the power performance of supercapacitors in a single solution,” said Nanotech Energy CEO Jack Kavanaugh.
According to the technical data sheet for Nanotech Energy Nonflammable GOC18650A batteries, it has a cycle life of 1200 cycles before it degrades to 88%. Its gravimetric density is 215 Wh/kg, while volumetric density stands at 557 Wh/l. The operating temperature range is from -20 to 60 degrees Celsius.
In August 2021, Nanotech Energy raised USD 64 million ($98m) in a Series D at a USD 550 million valuation, with total funding thus far standing at USD 94.9 million. The privately held company has been backed by Multiverse Investment Fund, Fubon Financial Group, and Volkswagen, among others.
Meanwhile, Nanotech has announced it is expanding its operations with a new manufacturing facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, Nevada. The first of two buildings planned will produce 2.5 GWh of batteries annually, with the plan to continue expansion to 15 GWh over the next several years, the company said.
The first building is slated to open in Q4 2022, and Nanotech is currently taking battery pre-orders. Limited production will kick off in 2023 with full production starting in 2024.

China’s total annual solar cell and module production capacity may increase from 361 GW at the end of last year to up to 600 GW at the end of 2022, according to the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA).
“Since January, 20 companies disclosed to expand module production totalling 380 GW, planned to be executed within the next few months or up to 1,5 years,” the analyst firm said, noting that most of this capacity relates to n-type modules produced with tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells or panels based on cells with a heterojunction (HJT) design. “Reportedly, TOPCon related expansion plans exceed 220 GW, whereas HJT is nearing the 150 GW mark. As an example, recently one HJT company conducted an online pitching and according to them almost 800 people joined that call,” it added.
So far this year, the output of polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules has already beaten the achievements of the Chinese PV industry in 2021 by some 50%. “By June, module shipments of the TOP 10 manufacturer crossed the 100 GW and by the end of September may have reached 140-150 GW (2021: 133 GW),” said the AECEA. “Just five of these top 10 have set shipment targets of between 183-205 GW.”
Furthermore, the AECEA revealed that the country’s polysilicon capacity should grow from around 530,000 MT at the end of 2021 to up to 1.2 million MT in 2022, jumping to 2.5 million MT in 2023, and up to 4 million MT in 2024.
“In the near term, the overall industrial landscape won’t fundamentally change. Incumbent companies are further consolidating their market positions through backward/forward integration,” the AECEA stated. “By and large, vertical integration remains their favored business model, which in times of external supply constraints or external supply dependencies has gained ever more weight.”
