The new $11 million plant includes a production line that can produce panels featuring M10 cell technology and has allowed Tindo to expand its suite of solar modules, with the company recently launching a new 545 W large-format panel for utility-scale solar projects.
The newly commissioned factory has the capacity to produce up to 150 MW of solar panels per annum and is more than three times the size of the company’s previous manufacturing facility.
The release of the video comes after the International Energy International (IEA) earlier this month warned of a need to diversify the world’s solar PV supply chain and expand the production of solar modules, suggesting the sector’s heavy reliance on China has led to imbalances that pose risks to its future growth.

China is the world’s largest solar supplier, dominating not only panel manufacturing but the entire upstream supply chain with a special report from the agency showing the nation controls more than 80% of all the manufacturing stages of solar panels.
When announcing the report, IEA executive director Fatih Birol said China’s dominance of PV supply chains poses specific vulnerability and risks to the industry.
“We believe this level of concentration in any global supply chain would represent a significant vulnerability; solar PV is no exception,” he said. “It is a must, in my view, to diversify. Otherwise, we may see major challenges in the days, months and years ahead.”
These challenges have already resulted in delays in solar PV deliveries and higher prices with the report revealing solar panel prices have increased by about 20% over the past year.
The imbalance of the solar supply chains has also had a marked effect on Australia’s balance of payments with the nation, which once led the world in developing solar PV technology, now one of the largest importers of PV components.

The IEA said in the past five years solar PV imports have reduced Australia’s trade surplus by 4%. During the same period, Australia ran an average trade deficit on solar panels and associated components of more than $10 billion (US$7 billion).
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen has backed the calls for an expansion of Australia’s solar PV manufacturing capacity, saying the nation needs to maximise the benefits of its world-leading research and development.
“The solar panels around the world, the technology that’s in them, in no small part was invented here,” he said last month when announcing the Federal Government’s $45 million extension of funding for the Australia Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics. “That’s something we can be proud of, but we’ve got to take it now to the next step.
“We’ve put 60 million solar panels on roofs in Australia in the last 10 years. One per cent of them have been made in Australia. That’s got to change. This is Australian technology, we want to see more of it made in Australia.”
The IEA estimates diversifying the supply chain could attract more than $170 billion (US$120 billion) of new investment in PV solar manufacturing facilities by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/21/lessons-from-australias-climate-wars-help-chart-path-to-better-climate-policy/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 21, 2022",Lessons from Australia’s ‘climate wars’ help chart path to better climate policy,"The groups want the Greens to back Labor’s policy for a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050 – then to push for more ambitious targets later. But Greens leader Adam Bandt has described Labor’s policy as “weak” and the party has the numbers to block Labor’s bill in the Senate.
Tensions over strategy in and beyond parliament are a normal part of social movements and the policy process. Plus, it’s just plain hard to broker agreements for ambitious and effective climate policy.
But as my research has shown, Australia’s long-lasting climate wars offer three painful lessons we shouldn’t ignore this time around.
Image: The Greens
It’s easy to dismiss the Greens and their allies in the environment movement as naive idealists. But at this historic moment, what constitutes realism is a matter of both political strategy and science.
The last time the green movement intensely debated carbon targets was in 2008. Then, the Rudd Labor government proposed a carbon pollution reduction scheme with a goal of a 5-15% emissions cut by 2020. The Greens argued it was inadequate and compensated polluters too generously.
In response, established green groups like the ACF and World Wildlife Fund for Nature and union peak bodies formed a coalition that backed Labor’s scheme and publicly disagreed with the stance of the Greens and most smaller green groups (including Greenpeace). By the end of 2009 the environment movement was split.
The big green groups identified as realists. They saw the scheme as imperfect, but were optimistic they could influence and improve it over time.
The grassroots wing of the environment movement, including new groups like Rising Tide and the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and GetUp!, was not convinced. They felt the big green groups were closing the window of opportunity too soon by agreeing to Labor’s scheme ahead of parliamentary debate. Given the grave climate threat, they wanted more and faster progress on emissions reduction.
Both the Greens and these newer groups believed Labor’s scheme was, as Greens leader Bob Brown put it at the time, “worse than doing nothing”. In particular, they objected to the weak emissions target, corporate windfalls and loose carbon offset rules.

After Rudd was replaced as party leader, Labor shelved the scheme, drawing criticism from the Greens and green groups of all stripes.
So what’s changed 14 years later? Labor wants the Greens and independent senators to support a bill legislating a symbolic goal (the 2030 target) without much detail about how it will achieve this.
For now, most green groups appear willing to support Labor’s carbon target legislation as long as the target is a genuine “floor” on ambition and there is an effective policy “ratchet” that can be used later. This is a Greens strategy straight from the 2008–09 period. But they are even clearer now that the ratchet should address coal and gas expansions.
The legacy of the Rudd government’s weak carbon trading scheme lived on in the Gillard government’s 2011 carbon farming laws and the Abbott government’s Direct Action Plan. It left our main federal climate policy as a deeply flawed carbon offset scheme tied to incredibly loose caps on Australia’s heavy emitters.
Carbon trading and offsets are a remarkably indirect way to deal with the climate problem. Emissions trading regulates emissions at the end of the pipe and tend to be designed in way that provide far too much flexibility about where and when emissions are cut.
Existing evidence suggests carbon prices have not caused actual emissions reduction. Now it seems that Labor may end up using the existing safeguard mechanism and carbon offset scheme to reach its 2030 target.
Market mechanisms, particularly emissions trading and offsetting, emerged as a political solution to industry resistance to climate policy.
In 2009, former CSIRO economist Clive Spash published compelling criticism of carbon trading schemes. He outlined the gap between textbook theory of emissions trading and the realpolitik of industry influence over price design – and rubbished the idea you fossil fuel emissions can be offset by land carbon emissions.
Creating “credits” from land ecosystems should not be used to compensate for fossil fuel emissions. In terms of regulatory practice, land offsets are broken by design.
This week Labor will introduce a second piece of legislation to renew the Climate Change Authority’s role in measuring progress. This has green group support. But it’s doubtful expert advice alone will ramp up ambition.
No single piece of legislation will fully tackle this crisis. We urgently need strategies investing in new industries and transition arrangements in the communities most affected by the turbulence of economic transition.
Politically, carbon markets have not helped broker consensus between political parties and with industry.
Tightening the loose baselines of industrial facilities and removing the link to offsets would make the safeguard mechanism more effective. Direct industry regulation like this sends a very efficient and clear market signal.

At present, environment groups are supporting the case for direct energy industry policy. In the decade since the climate wars began, most of Australia’s green groups have split off to work on electricity market reform and local campaigns to stop coal and gas expansion.
Expanding renewables and transitioning away from coal and gas require planned industrial restructuring at state and federal levels and careful diplomacy with our trading partners. These issues were never going to be addressed with a carbon price alone.
Every green group will need to push Labor to keep coal and gas in the ground. And hold Labor to account on the policy mechanisms it will have to ramp up if the government is serious about climate mitigation.
Most members of environment groups would identify as political realists. They know perfect policies are impossible. Here’s hoping they can pressure our reluctant government to get on with things.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/21/nsw-announces-tender-round-for-large-scale-wind-solar-and-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 21, 2022","NSW announces tender round for large-scale wind, solar and storage","A key milestone in the transformation of the New South Wales (NSW) electricity network has been reached with AEMO Services, serving as the NSW Consumer Trustee, announcing details of the inaugural tender round for new large-scale generation and long-duration storage as the state government strives to get ahead of the retirement of coal-fired generators.
AEMO Services, an independent subsidiary of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), announced on Wednesday that the first tender round for new large-scale wind, solar and storage projects will commence on 4 October 2022. Tender registrations will be open from late August.
The tender, the first in a rolling schedule that will continue over the next 10 years, is designed to select projects capable of delivering new large-scale energy infrastructure as the NSW government looks to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
The Roadmap, launched in 2020, sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by 2030 as the state prepares for the exit of its coal-fired generators.
AEMO Services said its first tender is expected to deliver about 2,500 GWh of annual generation and 600 MW of long-duration storage although it has the discretion to increase that capacity. It is anticipated the generation projects would achieve commercial operation before 2025 while the energy storage projects would come online before 2027.
The tender will include Long-Term Energy Service Agreements (LTESA) and access rights for projects intending to connect to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure with AEMO Services saying it will provide certainty for investors and developers.
The tender will also offer LTSEAs and access rights in the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), which is tipped to deliver at least 3 GW of renewable energy after a call for registrations of interest attracted 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.

AEMO Services said developers of new large-scale wind, solar and storage projects across NSW are encouraged to apply.
AEMO Services chair Dr Paul Moy said the announcement of the first tender was an important milestone for the electricity market transition in NSW.
“Since the Roadmap was enacted, more than 3.6 GW of energy investment has been committed or ‘anticipated’ across NSW and AEMO Services expect nearly all of these projects to be eligible to participate,” he said.
“Many, many more projects have also sufficiently progressed through the development pipeline and are likely to be eligible.
“We expect there to be strong competition for the key contract types, LTESAs and transmission access rights, in newly created Renewable Energy Zones.”
Under the proposed contracts, successful generators will be offered 20-year terms under the LTESAs. The contracts will also include zero price floors. Battery projects will be offered 14-year contracts, while pumped hydro energy storage projects would secure 40-year deals.

AEMO Services acting executive general manager Melanie Koerner said the LTESA and tender design incentivise competition, ensuring that the Roadmap’s infrastructure objectives would be met.
“Our primary responsibility is to act in the long-term financial interests of consumers. Our tender process is designed to foster competition, by providing an efficient and repeatable bidder experience for project proponents and ultimately lowering costs for consumers,” she said.
“Our Q4 2022 tender is the start of our 10-year tender plan and marks a fundamental change to the way electricity investment is delivered in NSW and Australia. That scale of that transformation is reflected by the unique products on offer and the rolling nature of our tenders.
“It’s a big moment for the Roadmap and for AEMO Services, as a newly established independent organisation, but it’s our intention that this process quickly becomes business as usual for the electricity sector.”
All of NSW’s five operating coal-fired power stations are due to close by 2040 at the latest, with AGL’s Liddell plant in the Hunter the first go with a scheduled close in 2023.
Origin Energy’s Eraring power station, also in the Hunter, will be closed in 2025 while Delta Electricity ‘s Vales Point plant is due to be decommissioned in 2029. AGL’s Bayswater coal-fired power plant is set to close “no later than” 2033 while EnergyAustralia’s Mount Piper plant near Lithgow is scheduled to shut in 2040.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/21/small-cracks-have-negligible-effect-on-solar-cell-performance/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 21, 2022",Small cracks have negligible effect on solar cell performance,"Researchers from England’s University of York have investigated how the performance and durability of solar cells may be affected by different sizes of cracks and the formation of hotspots.
They specified that their work is intended to fill a gap of knowledge on whether all crack types can lead to a significant drop in the output power generation of solar cells.
“The crack issue in solar cells becomes worse as the thickness of the wafer is being reduced,” they said. “This is the case because the reduced thickness makes it easier to develop extra mechanical stresses in the cells when assembled into a full-scale PV module.”
Their analysis was conducted on three-busbar solar cells, provided by an unnamed manufacturer, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.61 V, a short circuit current density of 38.8 mA/cm2, and a peak power of 4.72 W. They used electroluminescence (EL) imaging through a digital camera with a resolution of 6k × 4k pixels and a camera lens of 18-55 mm.
“The solar cell samples were connected with a power supply for biasing purposes under short circuit conditions,” the scientists said. “The percentage of the crack was computed by subtracting a cracked vs crack-free image.”
 

The UK group submitted the cells to solar illumination under varying irradiance of 100-1000 W/m2 and their temperature was kept constant at 25 C. Through these measurements, it found the solar cells were affected by crack percentages ranging from 1% to 58%.
The researchers explained that output power losses for the cells with crack percentages below 11% were insignificant, adding that these cells are relatively equivalent to non-cracked cells.
“It is recognized that a hotspot is to develop if the crack percentage, which is essentially representing an inactive area in the solar cell, is in the range between 11 and 34%,” they also explained.
According to the academics, their findings confirm that small cracks have a negligible effect on solar cell output, and they develop no hotspots. They also found that a crack percentage of over 46% is also insufficient to develop a hotspot, as there is a significant inactive area in the cells, which means the localized heat can be critical but not enough area to develop a hotspot.
They presented the results of their work in the paper “Rapid testing on the effect of cracks on solar cells output power performance and thermal operation,” published in scientific reports.
“There are still some critical questions to be answered/linked with this research work; an example, how do cracks or hotspots develop over time?,” they concluded. “This has to be investigated over a long-term period for solar cells operating in diverse environmental conditions rather than simply examining the solar cells under artificial indoor illumination.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/21/turnbull-backs-us-solar-energy-companys-technology-to-decarbonise-heavy-industry/,"INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 21, 2022",Turnbull backs US solar energy company’s technology to decarbonise heavy industry,"California-based solar steam producer GlassPoint has appointed former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to its advisory board as it looks to roll out its concentrated solar technology in the hard-to-abate mining, metals and manufacturing sectors.
The company, which has been recapitalised and refocused after entering liquidation in 2020, uses concentrated solar arrays housed in glass greenhouses to produce steam at gigawatt scale with no carbon emissions.
GlassPoint’s enclosed trough technology uses large, curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight on a boiler tube containing water. The concentrated energy boils the water to produce high-pressured steam which can be used in place of natural gas. Enclosing the system inside a glasshouse structure protects the solar collectors from the elements and reduces operation and maintenance costs.
Turnbull, who also serves as non-executive chairman of Fortescue Future Industries, said GlassPoint’s technology is ideally suited for use in heavy industry, like mining and manufacturing, which are increasingly seeking ways to reduce carbon emissions and achieve net-zero targets.
“The world can’t meet its net-zero pledges unless industrial players make enormous leaps in decarbonizing operations,” he said. “Consider that it’s common for large industrial plants to require more energy than many cities, much of which goes to thermal processes.
“Solutions like GlassPoint, which help hard-to-abate industries reduce emissions up to 80% and are available today, will play a major role in combating climate change.”

GlassPoint founder and chief executive Rod MacGregor said Turnbull, who is joined on the advisory board by former Alcoa chief operating officer Tomas Sigurdsson, will play a key role in aiding the company bring its solar steam solution to a wide range of heavy industries essential to the energy transition, helping them to cost-effectively reduce carbon emissions and meet net-zero commitments.
“Their expertise and deep understanding of industrial market dynamics and clean energy will be invaluable in serving our mission of decarbonizing process heat at scale,” he said.
Turnbull’s appointment comes after of GlassPoint last month signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company to develop the world’s largest solar process heat plant at its alumina refinery in Ras al Khair.
GlassPoint said when complete, the 1.5 GW facility will help the Saudi mining enterprise achieve its sustainability goals by reducing carbon emissions by more than 600,000 tons annually, or 4% of its overall carbon footprint.

The project is set to have a combined capacity of 128.5 MW, 87 MW of which is solar and 41.5 MW BESS. According to Vena the project will be capable of providing clean energy to around 35,000 homes each year, negating 207,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.
The financing for the project was facilitated by Singapore’s DBS Bank, ING, and Siemens Bank. And the project has already found a power purchase agreement (PPA) through South Australian retailer Zen Energy. Zen Energy CEO Anthony Garnaut said the company is proud to be supporting the construction of a renewable energy asset in what is “the critical decade for climate action”.
Vena Energy Australia head, Owen Sela, described the project as “an example of this shift” to accelerate the energy transition across the Asia-Pacific region by providing “both generation and storage for renewable energy to the South Australian network as part of its plans to achieve net-zero by 2030.”
“In Australia we have around 5 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline,” continued Sela, “accommodating the demand for clean, reliable energy sources.”
DBS Bank’s group head of energy, renewables and infrastructure, Lim Wee Seng, noted that the task of accelerating the transition to a low carbon future is “not just about increasing renewable capacity but about enhancing the quality of solutions offered. Tailem Bend 2 – a hybrid that offers green energy and firming assets – represents the type of quality solutions needed.”
UGL Limited has been named as the EPC contractor to deliver this second stage of the project, with Doosan GridTech as the head contractor for the BESS component.
Construction on the project has already begun, with BESS construction to commence in late 2022. The project is expected to come online in 2023.
