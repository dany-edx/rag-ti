“The electricity grid is changing from the traditional one-way system delivering electricity to homes and businesses, to a modern two-way system where people can now consume, generate, export and trade energy,” the SA Energy and Mining Department (EMD) said in a statement.
“As our energy system continues to change, there are challenges as well as opportunities that need to be identified and explored. The green paper released today explores the opportunities and challenges for the state’s energy transition across government, industry and community sectors.”
“It highlights the dramatic transformation to date of South Australia’s energy sector, from a coal and gas-reliant state at the turn of the century to one powered by more than 70% renewables.”
Among the priorities outlined in the green paper is identifying how best to maximise the opportunities and address the challenges associated with the increasing supply of electricity to the grid from rooftop solar.
South Australia has one of the highest per capita levels of rooftop PV anywhere in the world with more than 357,000 rooftop solar systems of up to 100 kW installed across the state, with a combined capacity of more than 2,700 MW.

With more than one in three households with rooftop solar systems in South Australia (and increasing), rooftop solar is already the state’s largest generator, capable of providing more than 1 GW of energy under the right conditions. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) estimated that in 2021-2022 the annual rooftop solar generation was 2,269 GWh, or 17% of total annual underlying consumption.
While the South Australian government remains committed to supporting the uptake of rooftop PV, the green paper points out that the uptake of small-scale solar and other distributed energy resources (DER) has created a range of system security issues.
“DER technologies are playing a central role in transforming our power system, as this small-scale method of power generation or storage is rapidly becoming a major source of our energy,” the EMD said. “But our electricity grid was not designed to make the best use of these new and emerging technologies, and is now experiencing many new challenges, including frequency and voltage fluctuations, and minimum operational demand and system strength concerns.”

South Australia has already introduced several new technical standards and requirements for smaller generating systems – including remote disconnection requirements and dynamic export control – but the state government said further work is required to continue to leverage these technologies for the benefit of all South Australians.
With AEMO forecasting the state’s variable renewable energy generation will reach 85% by 2025, South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said now “is an appropriate time to tease out some of the thorny issues still to be addressed, propose some options for further progress, and try to anticipate what lies ahead for our state.”
“There are undoubtedly short-term energy issues to be resolved in 2023 but this co-designed policy aims to look beyond the horizon to plan for the next steps,” he said.
The Energy Transition green paper will remain open for public consultation, until 14 August 2023. Feedback will be used to develop a white paper that will set lay out a pathway for the state to transition to a net-zero emissions future.

Line said the George Town green hydrogen plant, which is to include 7.6 MW of electrolyser capacity, will be capable of producing more than 1,200 kilograms of green hydrogen daily for use in local industries, including transport and mining.
Electricity for the hydrogen production will come from Victorian-headquartered Climate Capital’s neighbouring 5 MW Bell Bay Solar Farm, which is under construction and is expected to be completed shortly before the hydrogen plant.
The council approval for the green hydrogen facility comes after the approval of permit conditions by the Tasmanian Environment Protection Authority earlier this month.
Line founder and Executive Chairman Brendan James said the approval for the facility’s construction is a significant milestone not just for the Brisbane-based developer but for the Australian hydrogen industry as a whole.
“We’re thrilled to be the first project in Tasmania to receive development approval for the production, storage and distribution of green hydrogen at commercial scale,” he said.
James said the facility would deliver tangible solutions to decarbonise global supply chains with hydrogen produced at the plant to be stored as a gas and made available for vehicle refuelling and other applications such as energy production within Tasmania, replacing imported diesel.
“The need to put in place a green energy solution to diesel replacement, particularly in the areas of heavy transport and heavy industry, has never been greater,” he said.
Line’s project is one of a slew of green hydrogen projects planned for the growing hub of Bell Bay, an industrial centre and port in the state’s north.
Bell Bay Powerfuels, a partnership between Brisbane-based Abel Energy and Iberdrola Australia, is progressing plans to deliver a 240 MW green hydrogen and green methanol production facility at Bell Bay while Countrywide Hydrogen, a wholly owned subsidiary of Queensland-based independent power producer ReNu Energy, has announced plans to develop a  10 MW facility there.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), Woodside and Origin are also investigating hydrogen production at Bell Bay.
FFI’s proposed Bell Bay project is a 250 MW green hydrogen development with the capacity to produce green ammonia for domestic use and international export.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/30/energy-transition-is-off-track-says-irena/,"COVID-19,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 30, 2023","Energy transition is off-track, says IRENA","Recent analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment has shown that the world is struggling to adhere to the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the target set by the Paris Agreement.
“The ramifications of each fraction of a degree cannot be overstated – particularly for the world’s most vulnerable populations, who are already suffering the destructive impacts of climate change. The ubiquity of climate-induced disasters – be they floods, droughts or fires – demonstrates the pressing need for a course correction,” said the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in its World Energy Transitions Outlook report for 2023.
IRENA warned that the energy transition is “off-track,” noting that the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and ripple effects of the invasion of Ukraine have compounded the challenges faced by the energy transition.
“Every fraction of a degree in global temperature change can trigger significant and far-reaching consequences for natural systems, human societies and economies,” said IRENA.
IRENA offered threshold levels of technology deployments that will be needed to meet the Paris Agreement target. It said that roughly 1 TW of renewable energy deployments are needed each year through 2050 to stay on pace. In 2022, about 300 GW of renewables were added. Renewables accounted for 83% of new capacity added, yet the rate still lags what is needed to decarbonize.
Despite dominating the share of new energy projects worldwide, IRENA said both the volume and share of renewables need to grow substantially. IRENA said this is both technically feasible and economically viable, but without divestment from fossil fuel interests, it may not occur quickly enough to stave off the worst effects of climate change.
“While there were record renewable power capacity additions in 2022, the year also saw the highest levels of fossil fuel subsidies ever, as many governments sought to cushion the blow of high energy prices for consumers and businesses,” said IRENA. “The business case for renewables is strong, but deeply entrenched barriers stemming from the systems and structures created for the fossil-fuel era continue to hamper progress.”
IRENA noted that solar deployment is well behind what is needed to meet Paris targets. Solar has deployed 191 GW in recent years, but must reach 551 GW annually by 2030, and 615 GW annually by 2050. Solar would represent nearly 60% of capacity additions by mid-century.
IRENA also notes a need for nearly tripling investment in renewable energy generation. In 2022, annual investment is around $732 bill (USD 486 billion) per year, and that must reach $1.3 trillion by 2030 to stay on pace. By 2050, the need for new generation investments flattens some, as IRENA projects a need for $1.96 trillion in annual investments by 2050.
Additionally, investments in power grids and flexibility, like energy storage and transmission, total $412 billion in 2022. IRENA said investment in the grid needs expand to $911 billion per year in 2030 and $1.2 trillion per year in 2050 to remain on pace with climate goals.
IRENA notes that the world has made impressive progress in the march towards carbon-free energy. Since 2010, solar capacity has grown 26 times. Risk assessment firm DNV said that solar may have to perform the act of multiplying its contribution over 20 times again by mid-century.
“By mid-century, total installed capacity will be 9.5 TW for solar PV and 5 TW for solar and storage. The resulting 14.5 TW of solar capacity is 24 times greater than in 2020,” said DNV.
The firm said that solar is expected to represent 54% of installed capacity by 2050. By then, it will be in an “unassailable position as the cheapest source of new electricity globally,” said DNV.
“Moving forward, public investments in renewable energy need more capital,” said the IRENA report. “Similarly, lending to developing nations needs to be transformed, for example, with grants and concessional loans, like the loss and damage fund launched at COP27. Meanwhile, public finance and policy should continue to be used to crowd in private capital.”

The US company said it intends to invest more than $750 million (USD 500 million) to develop the land for a 5 GW of cell and 3 GW of module capacity manufacturing plant. It will make the investment through SEG ATW Solar Manufaktur Indonesia, its joint venture with ATW Investasi Selaras, an Indonesian renewable energy developer.
The project is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. It will be one of Indonesia’s largest solar cell and module factories, according to SEG.
“The country offers a supportive environment with favourable policies, taxation benefits and abundant silicon resources,” SEG Solar Chief Executive Officer Jim Wood said.
The Batang cell production line will supply SEG Solar’s recently announced 2 GW module factory in Texas, enabling the company to become more vertically integrated, it said in a statement.
The company recently reported plans to develop module manufacturing equipment with Suzhou Horad New Energy Equipment to produce 2 GW of tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar modules in Houston.
