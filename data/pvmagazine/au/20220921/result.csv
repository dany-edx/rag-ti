MLP is Australia’s largest intermodal freight facility. The 243-hectare site connects Port Botany with rail terminals and warehousing, acting as a national distribution centre for interstate operations.
Logos, which was part of a consortium that purchased the facility in 2021 in a $1.67 billion deal, will fund the construction of the 60 MW rooftop solar PV array and 150 MWh battery energy storage system with Sydney-based Solar Bay delivering the ongoing operation of the embedded network.
“This maximises outcomes for all involved – from Solar Bay as the operator, to Logos as the investment and development manager, to our tenants, with the economies of scale at MLP offering a distinct, market-leading advantage with the amount of renewable energy provided through a microgrid,” Logos Australia and New Zealand head Darren Searle said.
Once fully operational the precinct-wide microgrid, which will operate at a combination of 11 kV and 33 kV, will be capable of supplying 100% of MLP’s energy requirements during daylight hours and will source electricity from an off-site wind farm to supply renewable electricity outside peak solar generation periods.

Solar Bay investment director James Doyle said the rooftop solar and battery storage system will connect into the high voltage network at multiple points, with complementary technology such as megawatt-scale electric vehicle/truck fast chargers also able to be integrated throughout the precinct.
“MLP is a prime example of the convergence between property and energy infrastructure that we’re seeing across Australia and New Zealand,” Searle said. “A precinct-wide microgrid facilitates the on-site installation of utility scale solar and batteries, providing tenants with the ability to access a vast amount of renewable electricity that match the scale of their electrified operations.”
The combined capacity of the rooftop solar and battery energy will generate enough clean energy to power the equivalent of 40,000 homes, avoiding an estimated 67.2 kilotonnes of carbon emissions each year.
The companies said the impact of the MLP solar and battery microgrid will extend far beyond the site itself and will “play a key role in the state, regional and local economies given its size, scale and influence”.
“With a number of the significant loads at MLP able to be flexed in real time, the site be will also interact with the National Energy Market (NEM),” the companies said in a statement. “This will … optimise the consumption of on-site generation and provide services back to the NEM when required, via demand response and the ancillary market.”

While already massive, the rooftop solar system is expected to grow even further. With more than 800,000sqm of roof space at the precinct the 243-hectare site has the capacity to accommodate up to 130 MW of rooftop solar, capable of generating 183 GWh of electricity per annum.
Doyle said future stages of the microgrid could be used to meet changing needs of tenants, including thermal storage, hydrogen generation and supply, and related low-emission infrastructure.
“With over 800,000sqm of rooftop solar possible we can also assist in the decarbonisation of transport and utilise surplus generation to produce low emission fuels such as hydrogen,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/21/alinta-gives-green-light-for-wa-solar-and-battery-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Alinta gives green light for WA solar and battery project,"Alinta Energy on Tuesday announced it had signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with BHP which will see the construction of a 45 MW solar farm and 35 MW battery energy storage system near the utility’s existing power station at Port Hedland on Western Australia’s north coast.
The announcement comes after Alinta earlier this year submitted development plans proposing to build a 90 MW solar farm and a big battery near its gas-fuelled Port Hedland Power Station (PHPS), approximately five kilometres south-west of the Pilbara town.
Alinta Energy managing director and chief executive officer Jeff Dimery said the deal with BHP will underpin the development of a 45 MW solar PV facility and associated battery energy storage system. It will also involve the development of a combined underground and overground 33 kV connection to the existing PHPS switchyard.
“We’re excited to get the project underway and thank BHP for their partnership and vision,” Dimey said.
Construction of the solar farm, subject to final regulatory approvals, is expected to begin in December 2022, generating an estimated 200 jobs.
Once completed, the solar farm is expected to supply 100% of the average daytime energy requirements for BHP’s iron-ore operations in Port Hedland, with the remaining power requirements to be met through the integrated battery system and Alinta’s existing gas-fuelled power station.
BHP expects the deal will cut the operation’s energy emissions in half by the end of 2024, helping the miner to reduce operational emissions by at least 30% from financial year 2020 levels by 2030 and achieve its long-term goal of net zero operational emissions by 2050.
“We are committed to supplying iron ore more sustainably while investing in WA and creating local jobs,” BHP’s WA iron ore asset president Brandon Craig said.
BHP and Alinta have also signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the Shay Gap wind farm, a 45 MW project with a potential first-generation date of 2027.
BHP in recent years has signed power purchase agreements to provide renewable energy to BHP’s Nickel West operations in Western Australia, Olympic Dam operations in South Australia, BMA operations in Queensland and the Escondida copper mine in Chile.
The agreement with Alinta follows BHP’s recent PPAs to provide renewable energy for its Olympic Dam operations in South Australia and Nickel West operations in WA’s Northern Goldfields region. The miner has also commenced construction of its first large-scale off-grid renewable energy project, a 10.7 MW solar farm and 10.1 MW/5.4 MWh battery energy storage system being developed at its nickel operations at Leinster in WA.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/21/fortescue-plans-additional-2-gw-to-3-gw-of-renewables-as-part-of-9-2-billion-investment/,"LEGAL,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Fortescue plans additional 2 GW to 3 GW of renewables as part of $9.2 billion investment,"Resources major Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) said it will invest $9.2 billion ($US6.2 billion) to eliminate fossil fuel use from its iron-ore operations entirely to achieve “real zero” emissions by the end of the decade.
Fortescue said the majority of the capital will be spent in 2024 to 2028 and will include the deployment of an additional 2 GW to 3 GW of renewable energy generation and battery storage and eliminate its reliance on gas and diesel-fired generation and diesel-fuelled mobile plant, including haul trucks and trains.
The company said studies are also underway to optimise the localised wind and solar resources.
Speaking at the United Nations Global Compact in the United States on Tuesday, Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest said the investment is part of the group’s transformation into a renewables-focused operation.
“Fortescue, FFI (Fortescue Future Industries) and FMG, is moving at speed to transition into a global green metals, minerals, energy and technology company, capable of delivering not just green iron ore but also the minerals, knowledge and technology critical to the energy transition,” he said.
Forrest said Fortescue’s plan would “set an example that a post-fossil fuel era is good commercial, common sense”.

“There’s no doubt that the energy landscape has changed dramatically over the past two years and this change has accelerated since Russia invaded Ukraine,” he said. “We are already seeing direct benefits of the transition away from fossil fuels – we avoided 78 million litres of diesel usage at our Chichester Hub in FY22 – but we must accelerate our transition to the post-fossil fuel era, driving global scale industrial change as climate change continues to worsen.”
When fully implemented, the investment is forecast to displace 700 million litres of diesel and 15 million gigajoules of gas per annum by 2030, and avoid three million tonnes of carbon emissions per year.
It is also expected to enable Fortescue to eliminate carbon offset purchases from its supply chain as it looks to reduce emissions close to zero, which they call real zero rather than net zero.
Forrest said the investment would also provide significant economic returns, with forecasts tipping it to generate net operating cost savings of $1.2 billion ($US818 million) a year from 2030.
“This investment in renewable energy and decarbonisation is expected to generate attractive economic returns for our shareholders through energy cost savings and a sharp reduction in carbon offset purchases, together with a lower risk-cost profile and improvement in the integrity of our assets,” he said.

The investment builds on Fortescue’s announcement in February 2022 to build a 5.4 GW solar PV, wind and battery energy storage project to power its iron ore mining operations in Western Australia’s north-west.
The Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub would comprise a 3.33 GW solar farm and a 2.04 GW wind farm spread across approximately 10,000 hectares in the state’s Pilbara region. The hub would also include a battery with a storage capacity of 9.1 GWh.
FFI followed that up in March with plans to work with Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE) to develop the world’s first regenerating battery electric iron-ore train.
Fortescue said on Tuesday that the feasibility studies are progressing, with delivery of the first parabolic (gravity powered) drive trains to the Infinity locomotives scheduled to be operational by the end of 2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/21/novel-tech-to-recycle-silver-aluminum-from-end-of-life-solar-panels/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022","Novel tech to recycle silver, aluminum from end-of-life solar panels","Scientists from the University of Leicester in the UK have discovered a process to recover silver and aluminium from used PV cells that is cheaper and more environmentally friendly than current recycling processes using mineral acids.
The researchers used the technology on crystalline solar cells measuring 12 × 15 cm, weighing 2 g, and consisting of a 100 µm thick silicon wafer, coated with a 100 nm thick silicon nitride anti-reflective layer on the front side and a 20 µm thick layer of aluminium on the back side, both stripped with silver electrodes approximately 30 μm high.
“First, we place the solar cell in an aluminium chloride solution. The aluminium electrode is removed from the silicon wafer. We use ultrasound to promote the dissolution of the aluminium, which takes place within a few minutes,” researcher Guillaume Zante told pv magazine.
Given the low cost of aluminium, there may be no economic interest in recovering it, but the aluminium salt solution could be used for wastewater treatment purposes, according to the scientists.
“In the second step, the silver is dissolved from the solar cell using iron chloride, an oxidizing agent, in a choline chloride or calcium chloride brine, which takes around 10 minutes,” Zante said, noting that the components of these two brines, or salt water, are found in chicken feed and grit used on roads to avoid ice, respectively, and are thus widely available, cheap, and low on toxicity.
“It is interesting to note that iron dissolved in water cannot oxidize silver, but iron dissolved in the brine can. Using a brine instead of water improves the ability of iron to oxidize silver and improves the solubility of silver in the brine,” Zante said. “This is due to the presence of chloride ions in the brine. The addition of water to the brine dilutes the chloride ions, allowing the silver chloride to precipitate. Silver chloride is easily filtered from the solution.”
The process successfully recovers silver chloride with a purity of 98%, which according to the researchers could be converted into metallic silver in a further step, thereby increasing its purity. The process does not affect the silicon wafer and nitride anti-reflective coating, leaving open the possibility to reuse the silicon in PV panels or processing it for other uses.
The results were obtained in a lab setting, using a few grams of solar cells, and may differ at an industrial scale. However, the authors believe that industrialisation is feasible due to their use of cheap, low-toxicity and readily available chemicals.
“Since we are using cheap chemicals, the price could be as low as the processing costs with mineral acids and in some cases cheaper, around $0.4 lower per kilogram of solar cell as compared to mineral acids,” Zante said.
The researchers presented their findings in “Efficient recycling of metals from solar cells using catalytic etchants,” which was recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production. 
The scientists are currently developing a strategy to scale up the technology and to extract other metals from waste sources, including bismuth, tellurium and copper from thermoelectric materials, which are used in perovskite, thin film, and wiring and cabling in solar cells, respectively. They are also attempting to extract gold, nickel and copper from printed circuit-boards, as well as neodymium and dysprosium from waste magnets.
The academics are part of the Met4Tech project, which supports the creation of a circular economy for technology metals.

The cell also achieved an open-circuit voltage of 750.2 mV, a short-circuit current of 11,271 mA, and a fill factor of 84.76%. The result was confirmed by the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH) in Hamelin, Germany.
Longi achieved an efficiency of 25.47% for the same solar cell in March. The company said the performance enhancement was due to an improvement in the passivation process without providing further details.
The Chinese manufacturer also achieved an efficiency of 26.5% for a n-type heterojunction cell in June and a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it recorded a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon device.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/21/shift-in-energy-system-helps-victoria-smash-emissions-targets/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2022",Shift in energy system helps Victoria smash emissions targets,"The Victorian Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report 2020 shows the state reduced carbon emissions to 29.8% below 2005 levels in 2020 – well beyond the state’s target to cut emissions by 15 to 20%.
Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio on Tuesday pointed to a decrease in coal-fired generation and increase in renewable electricity production for the decline, saying the state is on target to achieve its goal of a 50% reduction in emissions by the end of the decade.
“Our nation-leading investment in renewable energy has helped us smash our 2020 emissions target – and we’re well on the way to reducing emissions by 50% by 2030,” she said.
“Changes to the way we generate electricity in this state were responsible for almost two-thirds of the cut to Victoria’s emissions between 2005 and 2020.”
The energy sector remains Victoria’s largest source of carbon emissions, with fossil fuel-fired generation accounting for 50.1% of the state’s total emissions in 2020 but it is also decarbonising the fastest, contributing almost two-thirds of the decrease in emissions during that period.
The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report shows that Victoria’s emissions dropped 5.8% between 2019 and 2020, with the electricity sector accounting for a 4.9% decrease.

The report attributes that decrease to the transformation of the state’s electricity system, which saw renewables jump from 22% to 25% of Victoria’s electricity consumption between 2019 and 2020, while the state’s share of energy generation hit a new high of 34% renewables in the 2021-22 financial year.
As of June 2022, there was a total of 9,624 MW of renewable capacity operating in Victoria, including 1,243 MW of large and commercial-scale solar, and 3,446 MW of rooftop solar PV.
The report says a further 1,998 MW of solar and wind power is under construction or being commissioned. In addition, renewable energy projects totalling 26,094 MW have been announced or are in early stages of development.
The report highlights that rooftop PV is playing a key part in the renewable energy transition with hundreds of thousands of small-scale solar systems installed and contributing the third largest share of generation behind coal and wind in 2021-22. From 2001 to 2018, about 384,000 rooftop systems with a combined capacity of 1,564 MW were installed in the state.

And with Victoria’s brown coal-powered electricity generators gradually being decommissioned, the pace of renewable energy installation and use is accelerating. From January 2019 to May 2022 there was a “dramatic increase” in the installation of small-scale systems with 236,000 systems installed with a combined capacity of 1,845 MW – more than doubling the installed capacity of rooftop solar systems in Victoria.
D’Ambrosio said the increase in renewables means Victoria remains on track to meet its 2030 target of 50% renewable energy, paving the way to a 50% reduction in emissions by the end of the decade and the legislated target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
“Shifting Victoria’s energy system towards renewables as fossil-fuelled electricity generators retire has had a significant impact on our emissions,” she said. “Our strong targets to bring online more renewable energy – including Australia’s first offshore wind targets – will help us to keep moving toward our 2030 target to halve Victoria’s emissions.”
The Victorian government is due to set an interim 2035 emissions reduction target in March following advice of an independent panel announced as required by the Climate Change Act.
