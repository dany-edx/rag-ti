China’s control of raw materials supply chains risks leaving others standing 
A key early goal of President Biden’s ‘Buy American’ policy is a push to replace the federal government’s fleet with American-made electric vehicles (EVs). As this definition requires that a minimum 50% of components are domestically produced, a key focus is now on battery production. As Energy Secretary-elect Jennifer Granholm argued at her recent nomination hearing, “We can buy electric car batteries from Asia or we can make them in America.” 
Similar policies are in place in Europe. And while the EU’s current local content threshold is lower for electric vehicles versus internal combustion engine vehicles at 40%, this is intended to rise to a comparable 55% by 2027. As with the US, European governments are encouraging investment in battery factories to replace traditional engine plants, shortening supply chains and keeping domestic car manufacturing alive and well for years to come.  
But there’s a major obstacle to achieving this. At present, China accounts for almost 75% of global lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity and this share is set to increase through the short term with its build-out of new facilities. And although the US and Europe are enacting policies to encourage domestic battery production, there has been a distinct lack of support for investment in the supply and refining of the raw materials to achieve this. In China, the opposite holds true. 
To learn more about what this means for the future of battery manufacturing, I spoke to Gavin Montgomery and Milan Thakore from our Battery Raw Materials team. 
The metals of mobility 
The five heavyweight metals for EV manufacturing are copper, aluminium, nickel, cobalt and lithium. But while the vehicle body relies highly on aluminium to minimise weight and uses copper for wiring, it is the three key cathode battery metals – lithium, nickel and cobalt – that are key to the production of batteries.  
The electrification of mobility is central to global efforts to decarbonise. And if the pace of EV production and ownership is to really take off, must be a huge increase in the production and refining of the key metals to achieve this. Wood Mackenzie’s base case sees nickel production rise by almost 70% by 2040, while cobalt and lithium demand will increase by 200% and 600%, respectively, over the next two decades. And if the world decarbonises more rapidly, demand rises far faster.  
China’s rising dominance of supply and refining 
First things first, China does not have it all its own way in the contest for key metals used in EV production. China remains hugely dependent on foreign miners, for example, for its supply of copper – the country is net short to the tune of around 9 Mtpa – with only limited equity ownership of resources around the world. Just as with iron ore, despite considerable efforts China has struggled to significantly increase its share of global copper resources.  
Arguably, this has fuelled China’s determination to seek greater control over battery raw materials supply chains. Over the past decade, the country has taken enormous strides to increase its ownership of, and access to, these, from cobalt resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to lithium reserves in Chile and Indonesian nickel mines.  
Cobalt – from the DRC to the PRC 
With the country’s increasing grip on global supply, Chinese miners are less encumbered than their western peers. Able to access competitive state capital and with lower requirement on returns, Chinese companies also face far less scrutiny on ESG, encouraging more appetite to operate in high-risk areas. Cobalt is a prime example. Almost three-quarters – and rising – of global cobalt production comes from the DRC, where western miners face prohibitive ESG risks. It is no coincidence that China’s cobalt refining capacity almost exactly matches the DRC’s share of global output.   
Access to raw materials isn’t the only story. China has also built out the lion’s share of refining capacity for these key battery materials, ensuring greater control over supply chains. 

Chinese – and Asian – manufacturers are going global 
Even as battery makers around the world look to invest in new capacity, mainland China will still be the largest producer of EV batteries by 2030, accounting for around two-thirds of total base case global manufacturing by this time.  
And faced with potential tariff barriers, Chinese companies, as well as other Asian battery manufacturers, are expanding their footprint overseas. China’s SVOLT has now confirmed it will build a 24-GWh plant in Germany, with cell production scheduled to begin in 2022, and module production the following year. In other parts of Europe and the US, South Korean and Japanese battery makers are also building new capacity.  
Alternative technologies hold promise, but access to raw materials remains key 
While the expansion of China’s battery manufacturing capacity is progressing in parallel with increasing Chinese ownership of the required raw materials and refining capacity, competing battery makers still have options. China’s control over production is far from absolute, while manufacturers are also investing heavily in thrifting to reduce the proportion of cobalt in batteries. General Motors and LG are developing a new battery system using 70% less cobalt through the increased use of aluminium, while Panasonic and Tesla are working on cobalt-free, high energy-density battery technology.  
This is encouraging, but even with the potential for a reduction in cobalt per battery, the scale of future EV production increases demand significantly. If global miners, battery producers and EV manufacturers are to compete with China as demand grows, they must also pursue greater investment across the range of raw materials and processing needed for battery production. This will need political support. For governments talking up domestic battery production, an improved understanding of existing raw material supply chains would be a good place to start.   
A happy Chinese New Year to you all and best wishes for the Year of the Ox.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/10/suntech-to-launch-new-inverter-in-australian-market/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Suntech to launch new inverter in Australian market,"Suntech has confirmed it will exclusively market Sunways residential and C&I inverters in Australia with the single-phase STS residential series having already secured Clean Energy Council (CEC) approval.
It will be the first appearance in Australia of Sunways inverters but Suntech Australia commercial sales manager Will Hall told pv magazine the company has a good pedigree.
“They’ve had strong international sales for many, many years,” Hall said.
Founded in Germany in 1993, Sunways was purchased by Suntech’s parent company Shunfung International Clean Energy Group (SFCE) in 2014. Production has since been moved to China but the German technical standards have been maintained, including the software control algorithm, R&D processing procedures, testing standards, and production management system processes.
A major player in the solar PV module market since 2001 with more than 24 GW of installed capacity in more than 100 countries, Suntech plans to begin the Australian rollout of Sunways inverters with the single-phase STS residential series with three-phase and hybrid inverters to be introduced later in 2021.
“Initially we’re looking at the single-phase inverters and we’ve got CEC accreditation and approval for them,” Hall said.
“The three-phase inverters are getting accredited and will be launched around June and then we’re looking to do the hybrid inverters towards the fourth quarter of this year.”
Hall said the first shipment of single-phase inverters was already Australia-bound and would be available for distribution in the coming weeks.
“We’re expecting the first container to land in mid to late March,” he said. “We were hoping to get it here a bit sooner but because of the Chinese New Year, production has slowed.”
The STS single-phase inverter line-up includes five variants – the 3KTL, 3.6KTL, 4.2KTL, 4.6KTL and the 5KTL. The series also includes a 6 kW version which is expected to be listed soon on the CEC’s approval sheet.
Efficiency rates for the STS inverters is reasonable with a rate of 97.40% and a maximum of 98.10% across all five variants. The inverters’ input current is 12.5 A with a 15 A short circuit current while the start-up (120 v) and MPPT voltage range (100 v – 550 v) match up against their competitors.
All of the Sunways inverters have been designed to offer high redundancy which allows for a continuous 10% AC output boost.
“It’s across all the single-phase inverters but for example, with the 5 kW inverter, you can boost to 5.5 kW if the NSP allows that,” Hall said. “Essentially, if you’ve got more panels you can get more power out of the inverter.”
The STS range, which measure a compact 410mm wide, 360mm high and 120mm deep and weigh just 13kgs, comes with a comprehensive series of protection mechanisms including built-in ARC device, real-time monitoring, in-built DC Type II surge protection and AC surge protection. A DC switch is listed as optional.
Also worth noting is the design of the STS inverters which have a horizontal circuit, allowing for all of the heat-generating components to be evenly distributed towards the top of the unit. The manufacturer claims the design allows for heat to dissipate more effectively, delivering internal temperatures about 10°C lower than the inverters it has been measured against.
“This is obviously going to lead to longer life span of the components and better reliability,” Hall said, adding that the entire range of single and three-phase inverters will come with a full 12-year warranty as standard.
Hall said the Sunways inverters would cater for an identified segment of the Australian market with the quality of componentry and price making them attractive to many end users.
“They’re using best-in-class components which gives it high conversion efficiency and price wise, it’s going to be up against the more popular Chinese brands, your GoodWe, your Solis,” he said.
“It’s going to be sitting around that price point but we’ve done a lot of analysis and can see that the components and the quality of the Sunways inverter is going to be far superior. The Sunways inverters will be for those customers who are looking for a European, German inverter that is at quite a lower price point.”
While Hall would not reveal the price, he did say the price of a “5 kW single-phase inverter is less than half the price of a SMA inverter.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/10/pure-hydrogen-signs-deal-to-develop-large-scale-facility/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Pure Hydrogen signs deal to develop large-scale facility,"The Pure Hydrogen International joint venture – comprising Real Energy’s wholly owned offshoot Pure Hydrogen and Liberty Hydrogen – has signed a term sheet with hydrogen project development firm Port Anthony Renewables to develop a 20-tonne-per-day hydrogen production facility at Port Anthony, about 200km southeast of Melbourne.
The announcement comes just weeks after Pure Hydrogen and Liberty Hydrogen established a joint venture company to develop a network of hydrogen manufacturing and distribution hubs – two in Queensland, and one each in New South Wales and Victoria.
Real Energy managing director Scott Brown said the Port Anthony site it is ideally suited to the company’s goal to build and develop a large-scale hydrogen business, providing access to shipping and road transportation — facilities that should allow for the export of any product that is unneeded locally.
“This is an ideal site for a hydrogen hub with the necessary attributes to cater for both domestic and international markets,” he said.
“This agreement builds on our strategy of co-operating and collaborating with experienced operators to develop a significant hydrogen business capable of servicing a large customer base.”
Brown said the Port Anthony project, which was originally being developed by Liberty Hydrogen, would utilise “best-of-breed hydrogen and fuel cell technology”. It is expected the project will involve the use of an electrolyser to produce hydrogen, powered by electricity sourced through either ‘blue’ or ‘green’ power purchase agreements.
The project is one of four hydrogen manufacturing and distribution hubs Pure Hydrogen is planning for Australia’s East Coast – with similar ventures mooted for the port cities of Gladstone, Mackay and Newcastle.
“We are making solid progress securing site control at our other three planned hubs, as well as potential new locations, as well as advancing further technology and new customer agreements with further updates pending,” Brown said.
Port Anthony has long been a hub for offshore oil and gas exploration and production and Port Anthony Renewables executive chairman Ben Anthony said the shift towards hydrogen would ensure it remains a cornerstone of Australia’s energy sector.
“This change of direction is in line with both current and future community expectations,” he said.
“It builds on Australia’s push to decarbonise a large energy-based industry by engaging in activities that substantially reduce carbon emissions.
“This deal with Pure Hydrogen International is yet another opportunity to show Port Anthony can manoeuvre itself to continue to provide that service to Australia through a greener way of operating. Port Anthony will continue to undertake the same activities it has for the many years, while at the same time reducing its carbon footprint.”

A chartered engineer, Westerman has been responsible for engineering, planning and operational control of National Grid’s electricity transmission network across Great Britain as well as the development of distributed energy systems such as rooftop solar, storage and energy metering. Most recently, he has grown a large-scale renewable energy business and led transformation and change programs across Europe and North America.
Westerman also contributed to the comprehensive review of the Australian Energy Market led by the Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel and had stints with global consulting firm McKinsey & Company and the Ford Motor Company.
Westerman’s return to Australia comes as the energy sector, both nationally and globally are undergoing rapid transition and he said he was delighted to be taking over the reins at AEMO.
“I’m looking forward to collaborating with market participants, policy makers and stakeholders across the energy industry to help inform and shape the best outcomes for consumers as the technology mix undergoes a dramatic transformation,” he said in a statement.
“Australia is leading the world in the adoption of renewable energy systems, and AEMO plays a critical role in maintaining a stable supply of power to the millions of homes and businesses that benefit from the energy these systems provide.
“AEMO must continue to operate our energy systems today while planning for the challenges of tomorrow, and that will be my focus.”
Australian Energy Council chief executive Sarah McNamara welcomed Westerman’s appointment and said his knowledge of markets in the United Kingdom and United States will be invaluable as AEMO looks to navigate the challenges ahead.
“His deep experience in energy transition and commercial markets make him a fine choice to protect the future security of the National Electricity Market (NEM), and balance the energy needs of today with the necessary changes for the future,” she said.
AEMO chairman Drew Clarke said the search for a CEO had attracted strong interest from high-calibre candidates both within Australia and globally.
“Daniel was selected from a strong field of leaders in the energy sector, and the board is confident his experience positions him well to lead AEMO through the next phase of transition in the energy sector,” he said.
“Experience in a commercial setting was highly valued in AEMO’s search, and the board was pleased to secure a candidate with experience leading major infrastructure projects through the investment cycle.”
Westerman replaces former CEO Audrey Zibelman who left in December to take up a role with Google’s future technology division known as X.
Nino Ficca has been serving as acting CEO since Zibelman’s departure and it is expected he will return to his role of non-executive director after Westerman’s arrival.

The electricity networks include AusNet, Evoenergy, TasNetworks and United Energy, trialling the use of smart charging hardware directed by signals from networks instead of electricity retailers. 176 residences will take part. 
The $3.4 million project is not the only EV charging trial ARENA is currently helping to fund. Indeed, ARENA committed $2.9 million to a 250-home trial with AGL in November, 2020. 
The purpose of the project is to help prepare the electricity system for the role played by EV charge management. Each relevant network will therefore install monitoring tools provided by JET Charge in each home to gauge the impact of EVs and then utilise that information on an aggregation platform operated by the network to control the EV charge. 
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said that this is the first time networks will be managing EV charging. “As the penetration of EVs increases,” said Miller, “it will be important to manage and orchestrate the charging of vehicles to avoid negative impacts on networks and costs and ensure the optimal outcome for all parties.” 
Jemena Networks Executive General Manager Shaun Reardon said that managing the extra consumption, particularly in neighbourhoods that already have high EV uptake, is key to ensuring the continued adoption of EVs in Australia. 
Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor commented that “An unmanaged uptake of EVs could have negative impacts on the electricity grid if a large number of vehicles are charged at home during peak periods. This trial will give us greater understanding of how to integrate future fuel technologies in Australia without compromising our energy grid.” 
While polls show a growing number of Australians believe electric cars are the future and support national EV policy, penetration of EVs in Australia lags behind many developed nations. This has not been helped by VIC and South Australia announcing a road tax on EVs, which, considering taxes are supposed to be applied to products the government wants to disincentivise, makes about as much sense as a quantum equation written in Wingdings.
Nevertheless, ARENA has already supported Origin and ActewAGL in trialling different technologies and approaches to accelerate the commercialisation of managed EV charging and V2G services respectively, as well as supporting the rollout of two fast charging EV networks across Australia by Chargefox and Evie Networks.

Inner Mongolia’s Baotou City could be set for 10 GW of solar and wind power generation facilities under the terms of its next five-year plan, polysilicon maker Xinte Energy has revealed.
An update issued yesterday by Xinte to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange – about plans for a 200,000-ton capacity polysilicon fab in Baotou – stated: “Investment and construction of the 10 GW [of] new energy power stations will proceed in phases according to the 14th five-year plan for new energy development and construction and load absorption on peak shaving access of [the] power grid in Baotou City.”
The update added, the framework agreement signed between Xinte and two local government bodies would harness the former’s expertise in constructing large scale solar and wind projects.
Under the terms of the framework agreement, Xinte – a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned electrical equipment manufacturer TBEA – would invest an initial RMB8 billion (US$1.24 billion) in a 100,000-ton-annual-production-capacity fab in Baotou, with the municipal and the Tumd Right Banner governments providing policy support and help with identifying development sites and issuing permits. Banners are administrative divisions of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region of China, which includes Baotou.
Construction of that initial phase would start as soon as sites and permits are secured, Xinte said yesterday, with the production lines expected to be operational 18-24 months later. A further 100,000-ton-capacity polysilicon factory would be added, together with “industrial silicon [facilities] and [a] supporting project” depending on market and permitting status, said Xinte.
A separate transaction announced yesterday will see state-owned energy company Beijing Energy International Holding Co Ltd spend RMB60.2 million (US$9.36 million) on six solar projects in Inner Mongolia with a total generation capacity of 115 MW.
The sale price of the Inner Mongolia Minghua New Energy Co Ltd project company owned by an investment business and a coal wholesaler was set at RMB301 million but will be adjusted down after monies owed by the business to its parents are taken into account.
The sellers are Zhongming Capital Holdings Group Co Ltd and Inner Mongolia Weiheng Industry and Trade Co Ltd.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/10/assessing-the-impact-of-large-wafer-modules/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"FEBRUARY 10, 2021",Assessing the impact of large-wafer modules,"From pv magazine Global.
The introduction of new wafer dimensions has brought about an impressive jump in module power ratings. But this has also confused the market somewhat, with a variety of different module sizes now available, all promising to bring down project costs without significant disruption for installers or developers.
Module makers have quickly split into two camps, working with either Longi’s 182mm wafer or the larger 210mm product introduced by Zhonghuan Semiconductor in 2019. And the industry as a whole is keenly awaiting results from yield models and then from the field, to see how the promised benefits play out.
In some of the first of the results to be published, energy consultancy DNV GL has worked with Trina Solar to evaluate the performance of the company’s Vertex modules, which utilise the 210mm wafer, and to compare this with the 166mm and 182mm products also brought to the market recently. The first set of results from these simulations was published in December, and DNV GL has now published a follow up report offering further insights.
The first report analysed the modules’ performance on a one in portrait tracker, while the new results swap this for a two in portrait design, and base the analysis on a 100 MW system connected using string inverters, at two locations in Spain and the U.S. state of Texas.
The study aims to keep all external and system design factors under control, allowing for objective comparison between the different modules. The cost comparisons made by DNV GL also took into account local costs for equipment, construction and installation, labor costs, grid interconnection fees, costs of operation and maintenance, land cost, and financial costs at each of the two locations modelled.
At the Texas site, the 545 W Vertex module was shown to produce the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). This spelled out as a 6.06% saving on the balance of systems components and a 3.72% reduction in LCOE compared to a 450 W, 166mm wafer module. Compared to the 182mm, 535 W module, DNV GL calculated a 1.2% saving in the balance of systems costs, and a 0.5% LCOE reduction for the Trina Vertex module.
Trina Solar explains that these cost savings arise from the module’s ‘low voltage, high string power’ design. This translates to more power from fewer modules, meaning fewer components and less installation work are needed.
