Major powers brought significant commitments to cut emissions this decade and pledged to shift toward net-zero emissions. New coalitions were also announced for decarbonising sectors of the global economy. These include phasing out coal-fired power, pledges to cut global methane emissions, ending deforestation and plans for net-zero emissions shipping.
The two-week summit, known as COP26, is a critical test of global cooperation to tackle the climate crisis. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are required, every five years, to produce more ambitious national plans to reduce emissions. Delayed one year by the COVID pandemic, this year is when new plans are due.
Pledges made at the summit so far could start to bend the global emissions curve downwards. Credible projections from an expert team, including Professor Malte Meinshausen at the University of Melbourne, suggest if new pledges are fully funded and met, global warming could be limited to to 1.9℃ this century. The International Energy Agency came to a similar conclusion.
This is real progress. But the Earth system reacts to what we put in the atmosphere, not promises made at summits. So pledges need to be backed by finance, and the necessary policies and actions across energy and land use.
A significant ambition gap on emissions reduction also remains, and more climate action is needed this decade to avoid catastrophic warming. Achieving necessary emissions reductions by 2030 will be a key focus of the second week of the Glasgow talks, especially as global emissions are projected to rebound strongly in 2021 (after the drop induced last year by COVID-19).
For its part, Australia contributed virtually nothing to global efforts in Glasgow. Alone among advanced economies, Australia set no new target to cut emissions this decade. If anything, this week added to Australia’s reputation as a member of a small and isolated group of countries – with the likes of Saudi Arabia and Russia – resisting climate action.

Since the last UN climate summit we’ve seen a worldwide surge in momentum toward climate action. More than 100 countries – accounting for more than two-thirds of the global economy – have set firm dates for achieving net-zero emissions.
Perhaps more importantly, in the lead up to the Glasgow summit the world’s advanced economies – including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand – all strengthened their 2030 targets. The G7 group of countries pledged to halve their collective emissions by 2030.
Major economies in the developing world also brought new commitments to COP26. China pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 and strengthened its 2030 targets. It now plans to peak emissions by the end of the decade.
This week India also pledged to achieve net-zero by 2070 and ramp up installation of renewable energy. By 2030, half of India’s electricity will come from renewable sources.
The opening days of COP26 also saw a suite of new announcements for decarbonising sectors of the global economy. The UK declared the end of coal was in sight, as it launched a new global coalition to phase out coal-fired power.
More than 100 countries signed on to a new pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. More than 120 countries also promised to end deforestation by 2030.
 
The US also joined a coalition of countries that plans to achieve net-zero emissions in global shipping.
But this week the developed world fell short of fulfilling a decade-old promise – to deliver US$100 billion each year to help poorer nations deal with climate impacts.
Fulfilling commitments on climate finance will be critically important for building trust in the talks. For it’s part, Australia pledged an additional A$500 million in climate finance to countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific – a figure well short of Australia’s fair share of global efforts. Australia also refused to rejoin the Green Climate Fund.

While the rest of the world is getting on with the race to a net-zero emissions economy, Australia is barely out of the starting blocks. Australia brought to Glasgow the same 2030 emissions target that it took to Paris six years ago – even as key allies pledged much stronger targets.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison arrived with scant plans to accompany his last-minute announcement on net-zero by 2050. The strategy, which comprised little more than a brochure, failed to provide a credible pathway to that target and was met with derision across the world.
On the way to Glasgow, at the G20 leaders meeting in Rome, Australia blocked global momentum to reduce emissions by resisting calls for a phase out of coal power. Australia also refused to sign on to the global pledge on methane.
Worse still, Australia is using COP26 to actively promote fossil fuels. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor says the summit is a chance to promote investment in Australian gas projects, and Australian fossil fuel company Santos was prominently branded at the venue’s Australia Pavilion.
The federal government is promoting carbon capture and storage as a climate solution, despite it being widely regarded as a licence to prolong the use of fossil fuels. The technology is also eye-wateringly expensive and not yet proven at scale.

Week one in Glasgow has delivered more climate action than the world promised in Paris six years ago. However, the summit outcomes still fall well short of what is required to limit warming to 1.5℃. Attention will now turn to negotiating an outcome to further increase climate ambition this decade.
Vulnerable countries have proposed countries yet to deliver enhanced 2030 targets be required to come back in 2022, well before COP27, with stronger targets to cut emissions.
This week, the United States rejoined the High Ambition Coalition, a group of countries from across traditional negotiating blocs in the UN climate talks. Led by the Marshall Islands, the group was crucial in securing the 2015 Paris Agreement.
In Glasgow, this coalition is pressing for an outcome that will keep the world on track to limiting warming to 1.5℃.
But significant differences persist between the US and China. Many developing countries want to see more commitment to climate finance from wealthy nations before they will pledge new targets. Can consensus be reached in Glasgow? We’ll be watching the negotiations closely next week to find out.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/05/taylor-prioritises-low-cost-solar-on-path-to-net-zero-emissions/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Taylor prioritises low-cost solar on path to net-zero emissions,"Having committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, the federal government has identified low-cost solar as key to achieving the target, adding it as a new priority technology in its updated Technology Investment Roadmap.
Details of the $15/MWh target for solar PV have been outlined in the latest update of the government’s Technology Investment Roadmap, with the Low Emissions Technology Statement 2021 (LETS 2021) released earlier this week.
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the updated statement expands the priorities set out in the first edition which was released in September last year, adding ultra low-cost solar as a new priority technology for investment. This includes an economic stretch goal of solar PV generation at $15/ MWh.
“Getting solar power down to less than $15 per megawatt hour, around a third of today’s cost, will be critical to reducing electricity sector emissions, but also in unlocking the potential of other low-emissions technologies like clean hydrogen,” he said.
“We see much greater potential for cost reductions in solar power than other sources of renewables.
“And Australia is blessed with an incredible landmass and the highest solar irradiation of any continent.
“If we can get this right and achieve this goal, we will not only be helping to achieve the other stretch goals, we’ll be positioning ourselves for an advantage in low-cost, bulk electricity supply.”

To be led by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the ultra low-cost solar initiative aims for solar PV to achieve 30% efficiency at 30 cents per installed watt by 2030.
John Quiggin, from The University of Queensland’s School of Economics, said the government’s $15/MWh target translates to 1.5 cents per kWh, a fraction of the 20 to 30c/kWh currently being paid by Australian households.
But he suggested the stretch goal is attainable, saying long-term solar power supply contracts in many countries are already being settled at prices of less than $0.02c/kWh and prices are continuing to fall.
Ultra low-cost solar PV is also seen as key to meeting the stretch goals for the existing priority technologies identified in last year’s statement, including clean hydrogen, low-emissions steel and aluminium, and electrical energy for storage for firming.
Other priorities identified in last year’s statement are carbon capture and storage and soil carbon measurement.
LETS 2021 also highlights the enabling infrastructure needed to deploy low-emissions technologies at a commercial scale, with the first two infrastructure priorities being battery charging and hydrogen refuelling stations for electric vehicles (EV) and a developing a digital grid with enhanced management systems and capabilities to support rapid growth in solar and wind generation.
Taylor said the government has announced $1.7 billion to fund the actions outlined in LETS 2021. This includes $565 million for low-emissions technology partnerships with other countries.
“Over the next decade, we will invest at least $20 billion investment in low-emissions technology, which is expected to unlock at least $80 billion and up to $120 billion of combined public and private investment,” he said.

Other aims in the statement include getting clean hydrogen production under $2/kg, achieving carbon capture and storage at $20/tonne CO2, and reducing the cost of low-emissions steel production to under $700/tonne and aluminium to under $2200/tonne.
The hydrogen sector would be boosted through investment in seven industrial hubs and a voluntary zero-emissions gas market.
“Our goal is to drive down the cost of a portfolio of low-emissions technologies, because getting them to commercial parity with existing approaches will make them more attractive,” Taylor said.
Technology Investment Advisory Council chair Alan Finkel said the updated statement is an investment strategy, designed to accelerate the development and deployment of new and emerging low-emissions technologies and has the potential to pave the way for net zero emissions by 2050.
“LETS 2021 represents the second important milestone in the development of a roadmap to guide our path toward this target,” he said.
“It underscores the importance of research and development, regulations, community engagement, voluntary action and efficient operation of markets. It introduces new policy initiatives, adds ultra low-cost solar as a priority technology in recognition of the contribution clean electricity makes to the success of the other priority technologies, and provides a new focus on enabling infrastructure that is essential to curbing emissions across the electricity and transport sectors.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/05/pv-system-design-for-low-cost-hot-water-production/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",PV system design for low-cost hot water production,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists at the University of Cordoba, in Spain, has developed a photovoltaic system design for hot water production that is claimed to use around 95% of the available energy it can generate.
The system consists of a 300-litre water tank with electric resistance, connected to a 1.6 kW photovoltaic system by means of a low-cost, experimental electronic conversion system. “It is a model that is versatile, sustainable and economical, which only produces a 5% energy loss,” said the research’s main author, Luis Cámara-Díaz.
The system is equipped with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) as it must constantly operate at the maximum power point. “Without using inverters or batteries, which are more common in traditional solar photovoltaic installations, we have developed a low-cost electronic system capable of acting as an MPPT device,” the researchers explained. “Keeping a fixed reference voltage is the MPPT tracking method used.”
A microcontroller board keeps the reference voltage at the required levels and a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) conducts or cuts the current, depending on the voltage. “The reference voltage, determined by the control system, is equivalent to the maximum power point’s voltage resulting from the grouping of photovoltaic modules,” the academics further explained.
The proposed approach was tested on a PV system built with five JinkoSolar JKM330PP modules with a power output of 330 W each. The electrical heater to produce hot water has a nominal power of 3 kW and heating electrical resistance of 37.8 V. The solar panels were connected in series to reach a nominal operating voltage close to the electrical network voltage.
The system was found to reach water temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius and to cover around 85% of the annual sanitary hot water consumption of a household with six people. “The novelty introduced by this low-cost electronic system is that it is possible to convert the available photovoltaic energy into heat, regardless of whether the existing solar radiation level is high or low,” Cámara-Díaz stated.
The tested system also includes a water recirculation system to allow the input of cold water in the DHW tank, and simulated water consumption and water renovation inside the tank. It was presented in the paper A Cost-Effective and Efficient Electronic Design for Photovoltaic Systems for Solar Hot Water Production, published in Sustainability.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/05/redback-unveils-solar-inverters-and-beefs-up-battery-range/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 5, 2021",Redback unveils solar inverters and beefs up battery range,"Redback Technologies chief executive officer Patrick Matweew said the addition of an inverter to the Brisbane-based company’s range of products marked a major change in the company’s strategy.
Redback inverter offerings have until now been confined to hybrid inverters as part of their battery storage systems. This has now been expanded with the introduction of the Redback Smart Inverter series.
“Based on the great success we have had since 2015 with our smart home battery solutions, coupled with the fact that there is no affordable Australian brand in the market, we have decided to expand our portfolio to include grid-tied PV inverters,” Matweew said.
“Every household has different energy needs, so we made a conscious shift to ensure we have an Australian solution for every customer.”
The Redback Smart Inverters are single-phase solar inverters in 5, 6, 8 and 10 kVA (kW) output with the company claiming a maximum efficiency of up to 97.5%. All come with a smart meter and wi-fi dongle as standard and allow for home batteries to be added in the future. They are all compliant with the new AS4777.2 (2020) standard.
Redback has also expanded its Smart Battery range, adding two new larger capacity models to its SB-Series.
In addition to the existing SB7200 7.2 kWh offering which was unveiled earlier this year, Redback has introduced the new SB9600 which has a nominal storage capacity of 9.6 kWh and the larger SB14200 with 14.2 kWh storage capacity.
Both the SB9600 and SB14200 have a 4.5 k active power output rating, while the SB7200 offers 3.3 KW rated active power with the company claiming a maximum efficiency of 96.60%.
The company said the units, which feature batteries from China-based manufacturer Pylontech, are compatible with most solar systems, can be remotely monitored and all three models can provide back-up supply in a power outage, where a back-up circuit is connected and battery energy is available.

“The batteries are also modular units, meaning they’re lightweight, easy to install and operate and as with all Redback solutions, the Smart Home Battery Systems are designed in Australia and are built to withstand Australia’s harshest conditions,” Matweew said.
“The new SB9600 and SB14000 have been developed and designed to be affordable for Australian households and with our latest addition of a 10-year warranty attached to the battery system, owners will have peace of mind for years to come.”
The new Smart Batteries will be available in Australia later this month, though the smaller 7.2 kWh Smart Battery is available now and is in stock in Australia.
The new inverter series is also expected to be available in Australia later this month.
The launch of the new products coincides with a rebranding of Redback which includes a new logo and colour scheme. Gone is the iconic redback spider, replaced by an orb reminiscent of the sun.
Matweew said building a stronger connection between the company’s Australian heritage and its purpose and vision was the main driver behind the decision to rebrand.
“The Australian sun is such an important aspect of our landscape; our new branding takes these iconic colours and incorporates them, along with the open road to Australia’s clean energy future. This ties in with our purpose to power a cleaner tomorrow,” he said.
“That is the key message – we want to give Australian households and small businesses an Australian option, one that is designed for our local conditions, that is robust and affordable, and there clearly is a gap in the market right now.”

Israeli inverter and energy storage company SolarEdge has posted record revenues for the last financial quarter, despite a lengthy Covid-related production shutdown in Vietnam, and has predicted the numbers will rise further during the current three-month window.
Reporting its third-quarter figures yesterday, SolarEdge said it had posted record three-month revenue of $526 million, up 10% from the April-to-June window and 56% from the same period of a Covid-ravaged 2020.
Those numbers included $477 million – another quarterly landmark – contributed from SolarEdge’s solar-related business, which marked an 11% quarterly rise and 53% more cash generation year on year.
Quoted in a press release issued to publicise the July-to-September numbers, SolarEdge CEO Zvi Lando, said: “We are exiting the third quarter with [a] record backlog for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022,” hence the optimistic forecasts for the current quarter.
According to the press statement, SolarEdge expects to generate $530-560 million of overall revenue for the three months to the end of the year, with solar sales to supply $490-515 million of it. If achieved, those returns would mark another set of three-month records.
SolarEdge reports a ‘net income’ rather than net profit figure and recorded a net $53 million in the last quarter – up 18% from the previous window and 21% year on year – and also announced it had shipped 1.9 GW of its inverters in July-to-September.
The statement did not flesh out why the company reported a considerably higher quarterly net income figure of $82 million under its own, rather than generally accepted accounting principle terms and Lando also revealed the company had experienced a 12-week Covid shutdown at its Vietnam production base.
Despite that setback, the chief executive said, SolarEdge was “able to supply products to meet the growing demand of our customers.”
