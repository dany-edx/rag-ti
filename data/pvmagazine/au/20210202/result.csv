These components, along with other composites, allows for what the company says are “dramatic improvements in weight, strength and thermal and electrical conductivity.”
The design, Vaulta claims, reduces the number of parts needed to house the batteries used in electric vehicles from about 20 down to just a few.
This cell casing technology, developed by Vaulta founder and director Dominic Spooner, will be paired with Quickstep’s manufacturing capability and market reach as it looks to move further into the electric-powered land and air vehicles markets.
As part of the partnership, the two companies will be actively working together on a joint proposal for Australian Defence.
“We were really keen to work with Vaulta because of what we believe they have to offer to the market, their Australian pedigree and the smart technology it provided in a new and high-growth field,” Quickstep CEO Mark Burgess said.
“Consumers and the wider market are showing a stronger interest in electrical vehicles and electric flight, and to cater for this we need more sophisticated systems in casing and batteries. 
“We identified this as a segment that we wanted to focus more on, as it’s a critical space across all the markets we operate in,” Mr Burgess added.
“The work Quickstep is doing in aerospace is all about lighter and better vehicles and we are looking forward to matching our innovative casing system with their new projects,” Vaulta’s Spooner added in the statement.
Vaulta says its battery casings allows electric vehicle manufacturers to save money, time, weight and space in their vehicles, and increase safety and workforce deployment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/02/queensland-partnering-with-japanese-firm-assess-co-locating-a-solar-driven-green-hydrogen-facility-next-to-coal-power-plant/,"HYDROGEN,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 2, 2021","Queensland, partnering with Japanese firm, considers building solar-driven green hydrogen facility beside coal power plant","Announced today, the collaborative study will look at the workability of the Kogan Hydrogen Demonstration Plant concept, which includes the co-location of a solar farm, battery, hydrogen electrolyser and a hydrogen fuel cell.
CS Energy’s CEO Andrew Bills said the demonstration project will focus on the hydrogen electrolyser being powered exclusively by behind-the-meter solar energy, making it one of the few truly ‘green hydrogen’ projects in Australia.
“CS Energy is pursuing this project to ensure we have the technical capability to enter the hydrogen market once it becomes more commercially viable,” Bills said in a statement.
Determined not to be left behind in what can only be described as a flurry of hydrogen news in the first month of 2021, Queensland’s government will inject $25 million to develop the state’s hydrogen industry.
“Queensland has a unique competitive advantage in the production of renewable hydrogen, with our proximity to Asia, established infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities and renewable energy generation,” Minister for Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni said in a statement. “Our key strategic advantage in Queensland is our State-owned energy generators and ports.”
The minister also noted that it was the second hydrogen collaboration between Queensland and Japanese energy companies in the space of three months, following Stanwell Corporation’s partnership with Iwatani Corporation in November 2020. Likewise, last week saw Japanese giant Sumitomo Corporation announce a partnership to pursue a solar-powered green hydrogen production plant in Gladstone. 
And it’s not just Queensland that is keen to corner the hydrogen market. Just yesterday, National Energy Resources Australia announced an initial investment of $1.75 million in 13 regional clusters designed to establish Australia’s global identity in hydrogen technology and expertise. Meanwhile, the Smart Energy Council is working overtime to develop a Zero Carbon Certification Scheme to guarantee the “green-ness” of the hydrogen Australia is eager to produce.
The Kogan Hydrogen Demonstration Plant, if found to be feasible, would produce the green hydrogen which is anticipated to soon be in high demand while also capitalising on the “strategic advantages” outlined by the minister, tapping into the state-owned Kogan Creek Power Station. CS Energy’s Andrew Bills also says the project would “prove up the virtual power plant, production of green hydrogen and use of a battery to facilitate renewables.” It would also diversify CS Energy’s revenue streams.
“The plant may also be able to provide other services like Frequency Control Ancillary Services [FCAS], which are important for grid stability, and which will be scoped as part of the joint feasibility study,” Bills added.
Big batteries, with all their FCAS wonders, and even Australia-made hydrogen batteries have also been making the news this month. After years of anticlimactic prophecies, perhaps 2021 will indeed prove the year of (green) hydrogen.

Already leading the country with its rollout of standalone systems to replace ageing infrastructure, Western Australia has now solidified its leader status with the launch of Boundary Power.
Born of specialists from the state’s regional power corporation, Horizon Power, and engineering firm Ampcontrol Limited (which includes its wholly-owned subsidiary CPS National), the venture may be new, but the team behind it are veterans.
With the successful deployment of 17 SPS systems on properties east of Esperance in 2019 already under their belt, the newly official team – which brings together Horizon Power and Ampcontrol’s combined expertise in SPS design, construction, deployment and operation – is now setting its sights on broader horizons.
In fact, the joint venture signifies the government’s “next step towards building a world-class SPS industry in Western Australia,” read a statement released by Energy Minister Bill Johnston’s office today.
To mark the occasion, the team at Boundary Power have unveiled a new, innovative series of SPS solutions to the market, namely the SPS Gen 2. The new, modular design of the Gen 2 is said to be easier to transport and install, as well as more affordable to maintain.
Boundary Power
“An SPS Gen 2 can be deployed off the truck and ready for energy export in just 90 minutes, with onsite maintenance, servicing needs and costs reduced thanks to easily swappable module components,” Boundary Power Director, Rod Henderson, said of the new market offering.
“We are confident Boundary Power’s SPS solutions are well suited to meet the growing demand we see in the marketplace, particularly among power utilities looking for a reliable off-gird power alternative.”
Indeed, the state’s deployment of SPS for regional customers has been impressive. Horizon Power is the first utility in Australia to remove 64 kilometres of poles and wire permanently by replacing the need for them with the installation off-grid systems. Another $10 million worth of deployments will kick off across the state by mid-February, with a further 45 off-grid systems set to installed.
“We have proven SPS to be a commercially viable renewable power solution that is fully off-grid and tailored to service a broad range of purposes and industries,” Henderson said.
Boundary Power
In this new rollout, the first of the 45 units is due to be installed in Esperance.  The deployment will include four near Kununurra in the Kimberley, one near Karratha in the Pilbara, seven in the Mid-West region and 33 in the Goldfields-Esperance region. This follows the announcement last week of $17 million worth of contracts awarded to local businesses to deploy 98 SPS throughout Western Power’s network.
“Western Australia continues be a world-leader in SPS technology, which is one of the reasons why the State Government is working with industry to capitalise on this emerging market,” Energy Minister Bill Johnston said in a statement.
“Boundary Power’s SPS Gen 2 brings together Horizon Power and Ampcontrol’s market-leading knowledge and expertise, and I look forward to the successful roll out this year.”
Customers who would like to explore the opportunity of having a SPS should direct their enquiries to enquiries@boundarypower.com.au.

The agreement is expected to cut the nickel refinery’s electricity emissions by 50% by 2024.
In it’s bid to become more sustainable, the mining giant has hooked onto Merredin Solar Farm, West Australia’s largest completed solar installation with an annual electricity output of 274GWh.  The project is also one of the state’s newest, connecting to the grid in 2020.
The solar farm is owned and operated by Chinese module supplier and project developer Risen Energy, and being run by the company’s Australian branch. Risen seeking to become a major player in Australia’s renewable energy production space. It’s two assets, the 132 MWdc Merredin Solar Farm in WA and its 121 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland, are the first steps in its ambitions to eventually deliver 2 GW of renewable energy to the Australian market.
“This agreement will bolster current and future Western Australian renewable projects. We look forward to welcoming many more clean energy partnerships to power manufacturing, minerals processing and other Western Australian industries,”John Zhong, Vice General Manager of Risen Energy Australia said in a statement.
The PPA marks the first renewable energy agreement of its kind signed by BHP in Western Australia and specifically sources 100% of the contracted energy from solar sources. The move is part of the company’s strategy to decrease its emissions, which has already seen BHP sign PPAs to cover operations in Queensland last year and also in Chile the year before that. Its Nickel West operations in the Goldfields, including the mine and smelter operated there, are attached to a partial PPA with Southern Cross Energy, which was extended last year.
Western Australia’s Minister for Mines, Petroleum and Energy, Bill Johnston, congratulated the move. “BHP’s Kwinana nickel refinery is a key contributor to WA’s future battery industry, and is helping global efforts to decarbonise. The McGowan Government is supportive of mining and resources companies that embrace clean energy solutions,” Johnston said in a statement.
“Nickel is a future-facing commodity, and sustainable nickel production is essential to meet future demand. This contract, the sulphide nature of our nickel deposits, and our integrated value chain increases our position as one of the least carbon intensive nickel miners in the world,” BHP’s Nickel West Asset President, Eddy Haegel, added in the statement.

The move marks Atco’s first major move into renewables in the National Energy Market (NEM) and could prove a significant one considering its centrality to the proposed Central West-Orana Renewable Energy Zone (CWOREZ). 
The 325 MW pumped storage project will be able to generate 2,600 MWh of stored energy for a period of up to eight hours. Thanks to the location’s close proximity to copious resources of solar and wind and also a 330 kV grid connection supporting the Sydney load centre, ensuring that it would be an important firming agent to the NSW Government’s CWOREZ. 
Atco Australia’s Executive General Manager, Business Development, Ben Bolot, credited the policy certainty provided by the NSW Government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, for providing Ato the security it needed to invest in such a large scale renewable energy project. Another strong demonstration that the policy vacuum at the federal level is haemorrhaging potential investment in the renewable space. 
“The Central West Pumped Storage Hydro Project will be an integral piece of the puzzle in supporting the development of new renewable generation capacity in NSW and transitioning our energy system,” said Bolot. “Grid stability and security is one of the most pressing issues confronting the energy sector. Pumped storage hydro projects provide the long duration energy solution required to complement the short duration battery projects that have been recently announced. This project is a critical part of securing our energy future and making NSW an attractive location for industry with stable, low cost energy supply as we transition away from carbon based fuels.” 
The CWOREZ, currently in its early stages of feasibility testing and planning, is set to be NSW’s first pilot REZ and expected to unlock up to 3 GW of new renewable generation by the middle of the decade. Atco believes its pumped storage project will be a key source of dispatchable power “to ensure the grid is reliable and secure to support the growth of variable renewable energy.” 
Atco expects construction on the project to begin in early 2023 and to see operations commence by late 2025.

The 390-405 W Vertex S is a smaller and lighter model than its Vertex counterpart utilised by solar farms. According to Trina’s senior country sales manager, Govind Kant, Australia’s residential solar market grew 15% in 2020 and “we anticipate Australia’s residential solar market to continue to grow by 8-10% this year.” 
“There was unprecedented growth in the residential market,” continued Kant, “More people were staying and working at home, so they were using more electricity. Australians really felt the impact of higher electricity prices and responded by opting to install rooftop solar to mitigate that.” 
Launching a new module in a booming market meant for Trina Solar that it would have to do something different, and that difference is in the size and weight of the panels themselves. Smaller and lighter, Trina says the Vertex S is easier to handle and install on the rooftops of homes and SMEs. 
In a statement Trina said that it surveyed Australian installers to determine the most practical size and weight of panels and found that panels really needed to weigh less than 23kgs and have a maximum length of 1.8m. The Vertex S weighs in at 21kg, is 1.75m long and 1.09m in breadth. 
According to Matthew Wilkins, CEO of South Australian installer Venergy Australia, Trina’s Vertex series “is a trend in the right direction.” 
“One of the challenges with Australian residential and/or SME customers is installations with limited roof space,” Wilkins told pv magazine Australia. With smaller, lighter, and more dense solar systems Wilkins says that spaces previously not viable for solar installation due to their limited roof space can now go solar. 
“The more energy density we can provide per square metre of roof space means less upfront Capital Expense from home and business owners,” continued Wilkins, “an important consideration when calculating the rate of return from solar installation, as well as cashflow-related issues of their personal or business resource.” 
The density of the Vertex S is a technological offshoot from Trina’s utility-grade panels, and has a power efficiency of 21.1% brought about by large size wafers 210mm in diameter with the space between cells minimised by new packing technology. 

“The trend in Australia is that consumers are opting for more powerful systems,” reiterated Kant, “so we believe Vertex S will be very popular as it offers a higher power density. 
The Vertex S comes with a 15-year warranty as standard but that can be extended to 25 years upon request and evaluation.

Telsa is intensifying its focus on solar, CEO Elon Musk said during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call on Jan. 27.
“There were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building … But now we [have] a little more bandwidth. We’re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly. So, I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar,” Musk said.
For Tesla, industry-leading pricing is central to its solar strategy. “[Getting the cost structure where it needs to be] is something that we’ve accomplished over the last year,” said CFO Zach Kirkhorn, without providing specifics.
Achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall, the Tesla Retrofit Solar, and the Tesla Roof is also an integral part of Telsa’s solar plans, Musk said. He added that the company is focused on reducing the amount of time and the “complexity of the install, and we’re making great progress in that regard.”
Improvements to Tesla’s solar retrofit strategy – including simplification, cost reduction, and improved pricing – drove an 18% increase that lifted solar deployments to 205 MW in 2020. Even though Tesla missed analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates, the company reported that total year-on-year quarterly revenue rose 46% to $10.74 billion, largely driven by growth in vehicle deliveries.
During the fourth quarter, Tesla said that storage and solar deployments came in at 1.584 MWh and 86 MW, respectively. On a year-on-year basis, storage deployment ballooned by 199%. Solar deployment increased by 59% compared with 2019.
On the storage side, 2020 was the first year in which total battery deployments surpassed 3 GWh in a single year, Tesla said. That was  an 83% increase against 2019. The company attributed much of this growth to the popularity of its utility-scale storage product, Megapack.

Malaysia’s Sustainable Energy Development Authority (Seda) has begun accepting applications for the Net Energy Metering 3.0 program (NEM 3.0) today.
The new scheme replaced the NEM 2.0 program that was introduced in January 2019 and expired at the end of 2020. The 500MW quota under the NEM 2.0 scheme was fully subscribed by the end of December. “All existing NEM 2.0 draft applications that couldn’t secure quota by 31st December 2020 will be removed from the dedicated platform during the maintenance period,” the Seda specified.
The NEM 3.0 program will be in force until the end of 2023 and will be aimed at allocating 500 MW of rooftop PV capacity.
This quota will be assigned through three different sub-schemes: the NEM Rakyat program for residential systems, which will allocate 100 MW and grant a net metering tariff over a 10-year period; the NEM GoMEn regime for government ministries and public entities, through which another 100 MW will be assigned under the same conditions as the NEM Rakyat; and the 300 MW NEM Nova scheme, or Net Offset Virtual Aggregation, which will enable commercial and industrial PV system owners to sell excess power to the grid at market price or system marginal price (SMP). In the Malaysian electricity market, the SMP is given by the price of the most expensive marginal generator scheduled or dispatched to meet demand in the half-hour period.
Net metering replaced Malaysia’s feed-in tariff incentive scheme in January 2016. In May 2017, Malaysia made the system more attractive and in 2019, with the NEM 2.0 program, the surplus power generated by the PV system was for the first time paid on a “one-on-one” offset basis, which meant that every kilowatt-hour injected into the network was offset against a kilowatt-hour of electricity taken from the grid. Under the previous regime, exported energy carried less value than consumed grid power.
At the end of 2019, the country had around 882 MW of installed solar generation capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The Malaysian government is also supporting large-scale PV through a series of tenders, the latest of which was launched in May.

Panasonic today announced it will exit the solar manufacturing industry within 14 months.
The Japanese brand issued a press release outlining plans to shutter its Malaysian factory, liquidate its Panasonic Solar Energy Malaysia subsidiary, and lay off staff, by March next year.
The manufacture of solar wafers, cells and modules at the company’s domestic fab, in Shimane prefecture, will also cease by the end of the next fiscal year, although no members of the Japanese workforce will be made redundant, with the electricals giant stating: “Employment will be maintained by transferring to other business areas where growth is expected, basically within the factory.” Panasonic confirmed the Shimane fab will continue to manufacture inverters, batteries “and other products.”
The company will continue to sell solar modules with its brand, with their manufacture sub-contracted out. The third-party-manufactured products will be sold in Japan after domestic production ceases, Panasonic stated, as is already the case for overseas markets.
The decision to exit solar manufacturing will also prompt photovoltaic R&D activity at the company’s Nishikinohama factory in Kaizuka City, Osaka, to be “downsized,” with “human resources … shifted to other growth areas,” the company added.
Malaysian staff will not be so fortunate, with Panasonic stating it will “support impacted employees with sincerity, providing measures including premium severance payment[s] and outplacement assistance.”
The move comes after Panasonic in August walked away from a projected partnership with Chinese heterojunction module maker GS-Solar which would have seen the Japanese company’s Malaysian operation transferred to the Chinese business and a photovoltaic R&D operation established by the two partners. Having announced the potential tie-up in May 2019, Panasonic abandoned the plan five months ago, stating GS-Solar had missed two deadlines to honor its commitments under the partnership, and reserving the right to take legal action against the Chinese company to recover consequent losses.
With the press release issued by Panasonic stating the decision was taken as part of a “structural reform of its photovoltaic business,” pv magazine has written to the company asking for more details about what prompted the change of direction.
The company said, after the collapse of the proposed GS-Solar tie-up in August: “Panasonic will look into every possible measure including new business collaboration with other partners to restore profitability in the solar business by the fiscal year ending March 2023, with more focus on the energy solution business, combining photovoltaic modules, [the company’s] HEMS*1 [Home Energy Management System product] and storage batteries.”
This copy was amended on 01/02/21 to include details of the proposed GS-Solar collaboration which fell through.
