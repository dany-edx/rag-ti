https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/15/australia-launches-its-first-national-household-battery-recycling-scheme/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",Australia launches its first national household battery recycling scheme,"Speaking at the B-cycle launch event this morning, Katharine Hole, CEO of the Australia Battery Recycling Initiative, said only around 10% of lithium, alkaline and other mixed household batteries in Australia actually get recycled, leaving a staggering 90% going to landfill. 
The majority of batteries are, and have always been, recyclable, but without a convenient and nationally coordinated infrastructure scheme to collect them, they rarely make it to that stage.
From today though Australians will be able to drop their small household batteries at Woolworths, ALDI, Bunnings, Officeworks, as well as community organisations. Drop off locations at Coles will be added in the coming months. 
While B-cycle is currently only targeting small batteries, the scheme is looking to expand to include batteries from electric vehicles and energy storage systems in future.

In total, B-cycle currently has 2,351 drop off points though the network is set to grow by an additional 1,200 points in the coming weeks. Australians looking for their nearest drop off point will be able to find it through the B-cycle website by typing in their postcode.
Libby Chaplin, who is heading up the scheme, described B-cycle not so much as a recycling service per se, but rather the network organising a circular system for Australian batteries.
While the program is supported by federal government funding, it is primarily being funded by a levy paid by battery importers. As part of the scheme, battery manufacturers will contribute 2 cents for every 24 grams of product (the weight of a typical AA battery) they sell in Australia.
B-cycle is currently a voluntary scheme, though Chaplin says all the major battery players in the Australian market have signed up.
For Michael Brendle, director of Battery Stewardship Council – the not-for-profit behind B-cycle, the scheme is about making it as easy as possible for Australians to recycle their batteries. He, and the rest of the B-cycle team, are looking to change consumer attitudes and make battery recycling a habitual practice.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/15/program-switching-concession-payments-for-solar-systems-to-be-expanded/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",Program ‘switching’ concession payments for solar systems to be expanded,"The South Australian government has announced will expand its ‘Switch for Solar’ program, opening up another 5,000 spots for residents on either an eligible Centrelink payment, who meet low income provisions, or hold an eligible concession card.
Program participants will be able to install a 4.4 kW solar system at no upfront cost in return for their annual Energy and Cost of Living concession payments over the course of a decade.
The program was initially piloted in May 2021, opening to 1,000 eligible residents. The state government described this initial pilot phase as “highly successful”, saying the program now has “proven results”.
“Electricity bills of households already in the program have fallen by well over $1000 a year resulting in a net benefit of up to an average of $538 for these low-income households,” Deputy Premier Dan van Holst Pellekaan said.
Concession holders in the state receive up to $215.10 per year from the Cost of Living Concession and up to $231.41 per year towards their energy bill, totalling up to $446.51. Swapping this payment for a decade would mean the government recovers a total of $4,460 for the solar system.
Data from the pilot trial found concession households who “switch” their total concession payment for the solar system receive an average of $538 in savings over and above their existing $446.51 saving from their concessions. This is higher than the initial estimate of $57 to $525 when the scheme was launched, the government said. 
“Around 28% of households so far have opted to co-contribute to get an ever bigger solar system and even bigger bill savings,” Pellekaan added.
“This innovative more than doubles the bill savings we deliver to concession households, through solar instead of cash payments, with strong safeguards for participants.”
South Australian concession holders will now be invited to register their interest in the program with the 5,000 systems to be rolled out from August 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/15/lithium-ion-home-battery-blaze-in-adelaide-reignites-safety-questions/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,QUALITY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",Lithium-ion home battery blaze in Adelaide reignites safety concerns,"A fire which badly damaged a home in the north Adelaide suburb of Burton, reportedly caused by a home battery system in the garage, has again brought into focus safety issues surrounding lithium-ion battery technology.
Metropolitan Fire Service northern operations commander Stuart Dawes described lithium-ion battery storage systems are an “emerging hazard to fire services around the nation,” reported the ABC.
Investigators have not yet concluded what caused the battery to catch fire and whether a fault in the product was to blame. It is not known what brand and make of battery the homeowner had installed.
Commander Dawes said fire services across Australia are currently developing policy and procedures to cope with the rise in these types of incidents. 
It is critical for home battery systems to be properly stored and maintained, with exposure to excessive heat or punctures potentially leading to thermal runaway events.

Pv magazine’s Insight Australia event in 2021 looked in depth at the safety issues surrounding lithium-ion technology. Speaker Professor Paul Christensen, one of the world’s leading experts on battery fires and safety, said global uptake of lithium-ion battery technology has “outstripped” our knowledge of the risks.
The problem with lithium-ion batteries, he said, is also the reason they are so useful: they store an enormous amount of energy in a small space. If that energy starts getting released in an uncontrolled fashion, as a result of say abuse including overheating or puncturing, it can lead to a thermal runaway event.
Thermal runaway involves chemical reactions occurring inside the battery which produce heat and gases. The heat caused by these reactions then accelerates further reactions, creating a “runaway” chain which can potentially lead to fires or explosions. 
According to Professor Christensen’s research, there have been around 40 utility-scale lithium-ion battery fires around the world in the last three years. It is far more difficult to say how many residential battery fires there have been. This is because, similar to solar-caused fires, different state authorities record the data differently or not at all.

In October 2021, the ABC also reported on a fire which broke out in a home in Broome in northern Western Australia. This fire wasn’t caused by a residential battery system but a lithium-ion battery used for a cordless drill which was left charging overnight. 
As with the fire over the weekend in South Australia, the damage to the home was extensive.
Ben Muller, Area Officer for West Kimberley at Department of Fire and Emergency Services, estimates 15 to 20 fires a year that are caused by lithium-ion batteries. He noted it is “certainly an increasing trend,” according to the ABC.
Muller suggested installing extra smoke detectors in rooms with lithium batteries.

Australia’s solar market has gone through surging periods of growth since the Commonwealth government’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme commenced on 1 April 2001. Between 2001 and 2010 the solar market’s growth sat around 15%, before a period of far more rapid growth from 2010 to 2013.
Australian PV Institute
After stabilising between 2014 to 2015, the market is trending upwards driven by residential installations. Rooftop solar today plays an important role in Australia’s energy mix, contributing 7.9% to the National Electricity Market (NEM) demand in 2021, up from 6.4% in 2020 and 5.2% in 2019.
Australian PV Institute
According to figures published by the Climate Council in February, renewable energy generation in the NEM increased by almost 20% in 2021, with renewables including large and small-scale solar PV supplying 31.4% of electricity generation last year.
In South Australia, these percentages are far more staggering. In the final days of 2021, the state ran for almost one week on renewable energy. South Australia’s 156 hours stint powered by wind, rooftop solar and utility-scale solar farms, firmed by fractional amounts of gas, was considered record breaking for comparable grids around the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/15/water-based-electrolyser-for-green-hydrogen-production/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 15, 2022",Water-based electrolyser for green hydrogen production,"From pv magazine USA
Verdagy, a company that is developing a water-based electrolyser for green hydrogen production, has secured cash to scale its technology in a US$25 million (AU$35 million) funding round led by TDK Ventures, Orbia, BHP Ventures, Doral Energy, Tech Ventures, Kholsa Ventures, Shell Ventures, and Temasek.
The technology is designed to provide hydrogen fuel for heavy industrial applications, a sector responsible for about one third of global emissions. The electrolyser can reduce its carbon impact by being supplied with sources like solar and wind.
Verdagy was spun off from chemical company Chemetry in May 2021 to develop a novel design to water electrolysis. The company’s device splits water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules through an electric current. The membrane-based technology uses large active area cells, high current densities, and broad operating ranges to deliver hydrogen at scale.
The company said its industry-largest cells operate at energy densities 10 times higher than traditional alkaline water electrolysis. The company said it has a load shedding ability of 95% to reduce energy costs and maximise production.
Analysts are now predicting that the global green hydrogen market will reach US$89 billion (AU$125 billion) by 2030, said Verdagy. Rising demand and falling costs has led to both renewable energy and electrolysis prices falling 50% to 60% every five years, said the company.
Verdagy operates a pilot plant in Moss Landing, California, a hotbed for large-scale energy storage and solar development.
“We believe that green hydrogen at the right scale and cost is key to decarbonising industrial processing of steel, aluminium, cement and chemicals – and in combination with captured CO2, enables the production of other chemical feedstocks and liquid fuels for marine and aviation applications,” said Sameer Bharadwaj, CEO of Orbia. “Orbia hopes to contribute to Verdagy’s success with its expertise in basic and advanced materials, large-scale chemical processes and a keen focus on decarbonisation technologies that support a sustainable future.”
Orbia said it is simultaneously investing in food security and growth, water management, infrastructure development, data access, health advancement and sustainable energy, energy storage and decarbonisation alongside hydrogen electrolysis.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory launched a new catalyst based on nitrogen and carbon to extract hydrogen from hydrogen storage materials at mild temperatures and under normal atmospheric conditions without using metals or additives. This “breakthrough” would ease current issues with chemical storage and in particular dehydrogenation, the team led by scientists Long Qi and Wenyu Huan said. “The key to its efficiency is the structure of the nitrogen. Catalytic activity can take place at room temperature because of the unique closely spaced graphitic nitrogens as nitrogen assembly which were formed during the carbonisation process. The nitrogen assembly catalyses the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (C‒H) bonds in LOHCs and facilitates the desorption of hydrogen molecules,” the Ames Laboratory wrote on Thursday. The related article was published on January 28 on Science Advances. 
A team of University of Delaware engineers has demonstrated a way to capture 99% of carbon dioxide from air using an electrochemical system powered by hydrogen. “We demonstrate an electrochemically driven CO2 separator (EDCS) to remove CO2 from the air feed using a shorted membrane that conducts both anions and electrons. This EDCS is powered by hydrogen like a fuel cell but needs no electrical wires, bipolar plates or current collectors, and thus can be modularised like a typical separation membrane,” the six researchers wrote in the article published last week in Nature Energy. The University of Delaware wrote that, as the hydrogen economy develops, this electrochemical device could also be used in airplanes and buildings. The approach tested by the team led by UD Professor Yushan Yan involves internally short-circuiting the device. “It’s risky, but we managed to control this short-circuited fuel cell by hydrogen,” commented Lin Shi, a doctoral candidate in the Yan group and the paper’s lead author.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the country is working on attracting new investments in electric vehicles and hydrogen, adding that priority should be given to green hydrogen given the country’s “unique opportunity.” Germany is considered to be a potentially central trading partner. “Over the past year, [the] government has built on its successful Hydrogen SA strategy to make major strides in positioning South Africa as a global leader in this new market. This includes the development of a Hydrogen Society Roadmap for the next 10 years as well as a Green Hydrogen Strategy for the Northern Cape, supporting the development of a green hydrogen pipeline worth around R270 billion [€15.65 billion],” Ramaphosa said on Thursday in his 2022 State of the Nation Address. Earlier this week, the South African president appointed Daniel Mminele as head of the newly established Presidential Climate Finance Task Team. “His experience before the SARB [South African Reserve Bank] included credit-risk analysis, corporate banking, and project and structured finance at private banking institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa,” the government wrote on Wednesday. 
Norwegian consultancy and classification society DNV launched, together with 18 industry partners, a new Joint Industry Project (JIP) to enhance the standardisation for hydrogen production systems using renewable energy-powered electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. “We are tackling this challenge by joining forces with major industry partners to work towards a new certification scheme and industry best practice for electrolysers which will facilitate successful water electrolysis projects. We undertook a similar approach for the wind energy industry about 30 years ago which proved to be very successful,” commented Axel Dombrowski, director Innovation & Digitalisation for Renewables Certification at DNV. Partners include BP, EDP, Equinor, Industrie De Nora, ITM Linde Electrolysis, McPhy, Shell, Siemens Gamesa, and thyssenkrupp nucera. The JIP is open for more partners to join until mid-April 2022.
Norway’s Aker Clean Hydrogen has increased its portfolio of projects and prospects currently under development to 2 GW, according to its results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Aker Clean Hydrogen was launched in February 2021. Among its key projects in the last quarter were the completion of the Hegra green ammonia project feasibility phase, the prolonged grid permitting process for the Berlevåg green ammonia project, and some developments at the Aukra project. “Aukra hydrogen hub proving to be technically and commercially viable; initial estimates showing competitive levelised cost of hydrogen,” Aker Clean Hydrogen wrote on Friday.
Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects more technological solutions related to storage and chemical plant design this year, mentioning the case of Haldor Topsoe, who redesigned its ammonia plant to respond to fluctuating hydrogen supply. On the other hand, fewer hydrogen projects are expected to be announced in the next months. “Will we see the same growth rate for the CCUS and hydrogen pipelines in 2022? We don’t believe so. The coming year will be all about maturing projects and securing funding,” the consultancy wrote on January 31. Wood Mackenzie said that translating hydrogen policies into reality will be politically sensitive. On Thursday, for instance, AP news agency reported that a panel of state legislators has rejected a bill that would have provided new financial incentives in New Mexico for hydrogen fuel derived from natural gas.
Boston-based clean energy solutions company Angstrom Advanced wrote that the development of the hydrogen energy industry also depends on the creation of “hydrogen communities.” The idea is to create an integrated energy system based on hydrogen. “At present, a couple of relevant projects have been launched worldwide, including but not limited to Rugao Hydrogen Town, Jiangsu, China; Harumi Hydrogen Town, Tokyo, Japan; and Orkney Hydrogen Town, Scotland,” Angstrom Advanced wrote this week.
