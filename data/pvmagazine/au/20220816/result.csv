The study was completed by hydrogen shipmaker cum project developer Provaris Energy (formerly Global Energy Ventures). 
The scope of the study included the integration of the HyEnergy Project’s proposed green hydrogen production facility with an onshore compression facility and offshore mooring and loading system, as well as the operation of a fleet of Provaris’ hydrogen ships exporting 200,000 tonnes per annum of hydrogen into the Asia-Pacific, with a focus on delivery into Singapore.
The now completed study has, Provaris says, confirmed the plan could work.
“Hazard identification, operational modelling and an environmental assessment demonstrated there were no significant risks that would prevent the project from progressing to the next stage of design and engineering,” Provaris said.

“We are very encouraged by the findings of the HyExport Study and look forward to exploring them further in our feasibility studies,” Province Resources’ Managing Director, David Frances, said.
The study has also been delivered to the WA government for final review, Provaris said.
Just yesterday, Total Eren announced it had signed an agreement with the Northern Territory’s government to progress plans for a gigawatt-scale green hydrogen production facility in Darwin.
The proposed Darwin H2 Hub, to be built on a 4,000 hectare site near the Territory capital, would include more than 2 GW of solar PV providing energy for a 1 GW electrolyser to produce more than 80,000 tonnes of hydrogen per annum.
Province Resources’ shares were placed in a trading halt last Thursday which remains in place. The freeze is because the company said it is still negotiating joint venture terms for the HyEnergy green hydrogen project with Total Eren.

Established just last year, Akaysha Energy’s portfolio includes the 150 MW / 300 MWh Ulinda Park battery project in Queensland’s Western Downs region west of Brisbane, as well as the Palmerston Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in Tasmania, which will use grid forming inverter technology to offer Virtual Synchronous Machine services to the Tasmanian network.
Akaysha is also planning to deploy a large-scale battery near Wellington in central-west New South Wales, known as the Orana BESS, part of the state’s first Renewable Energy Zone (REZ). The battery will have a capacity of between 200 MW to 400 MW and provide up to eight hours (1600 MWh) of energy storage.
In terms of how developed these projects are, Akaysha says the Queensland Ulinda Park battery has received Development Approval from the local council and is currently progressing grid connection, as is also the case with the Tasmania Palmerston BESS. The Orana BESS is still completing its community consultations and environmental surveys for planning approval.
Akaysha’s six other projects under development have not yet been made public.
“By tapping into BlackRock’s global capabilities and track record in climate infrastructure, we’re excited to fulfil our ambitions in accelerating the installation of utility-scale energy storage technologies that will mitigate the variability of renewable generation and deliver grid reliability and resilience to power system networks across Asia-Pacific,” Akaysha’s managing director Nick Carter said. 
Akaysha’s longer-term plans include developing storage projects in other Asia-Pacific markets, with a near-term focus on Japan and Taiwan. Akaysha also has plans to add adjacent opportunities, including developing green hydrogen assets, to its portfolio.
BlackRock’s co-head of Climate Infrastructure for the Asia Pacific region, Charlie Reid, said the roll out of storage assets is especially critical as coal-fired power stations continue to retire earlier than expected. “For our clients, we see tremendous long-term growth potential in the development of advanced battery storage assets across Australia and in other Asia-Pacific markets and look forward to working with Akaysha to ensure an orderly transition to a cleaner and secure energy future,” Reid said.

The company noted the news in a footnote of its ASX investor report yesterday, saying: “BlueScope is continuing to work with a range of industry and research organisations on out [Illawarra hydrogen hub] plans, noting that Shell will now pursue its involvement as a supporting partner rather than lead partner.”
Raey said he understood Shell’s shift was so the oil major could redirect its investments to other projects.
Last December, Shell signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with BlueScope to collaborate on two green hydrogen projects, including the development of a 10 MW renewable hydrogen electrolyser plant and, more broadly, the establishment of a hydrogen hub in the Illawarra as part of the NSW government’s $3 billion state-funded investment plan.
BlueScope said despite the changes it will nonetheless continue to investigate hydrogen production, including using it as a potential feedstock for a pilot direct reduced iron plant and for its blast furnaces at Port Kembla.
Another giant, Rio Tinto, will also continue to work with BlueScope on the vision.
BlueScope however believes the realisation of green steel production on the New South Wales south coast is still decades away.

The proposed Darwin H2 Hub, to be built on a 4,000-hectare site near the Territory capital, would include more than 2 GW of solar PV providing energy for a 1 GW electrolyser to produce more than 80,000 tonnes of hydrogen per annum.
NT Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said the Darwin H2 Hub would target both the domestic and international markets, helping the territory to stake a claim in Australia’s rapidly growing green hydrogen industry.
“With our abundant solar resources and our strategic location to support exports into the Indo-Pacific, the production of green hydrogen is a key opportunity for the territory to address the growing demand for this green energy globally,” she said.
“The signing of this MoU will help position the territory as the next Australian home of renewable hydrogen production.”
Total Eren Australia’s managing director Kam Ho said the partnership reinforced the company’s commitments to invest in Australia and low carbon energy sources.
“Our plan is to accelerate the development of the project to supply green hydrogen and also the opportunity to provide renewable energy which supports the decarbonisation plans for energy-intensive industries in the territory,” he said.

Headquartered in Paris, Total Eren has more than 3.5 GW of renewable energy assets in operation or under construction worldwide. It announced its entry into the Australian market in 2018 with the development of the 256 MW Kiamal Solar Farm in Victoria.
Late last year it added another project to its pipeline, signing an MoU with Australian mining firm Province Resources to progress plans for a massive 8 GW green hydrogen facility in Western Australia.
The feasibility study for the HyEnergy green hydrogen export project was this week submitted to the WA government for final review. The study analysed the export of 200,000 tonnes per annum of green hydrogen from the project in the Gascoyne region into Asia-Pacific, with a focus on delivery into Singapore.
Total Eren chief executive officer David Corchia said the green hydrogen projects are part of the company’s ambition to position itself at the forefront of the development of the hydrogen sector, describing it is the next step of growth of renewable energies.
“Total Eren has made the strategic decision more than two years ago to develop multi-GW wind and solar projects in locations benefiting from exceptional natural resources,” he said. “Those projects will aim at delivering clean and reliable energy sources in the form of hydrogen or its derivatives.”

The Energy Legislation Amendment (Transition from Coal) Bill 2022 sets out a timeline for the closure of the coal-fired Loy Yang A and B, and Yallourn power stations in the Latrobe Valley, which together generate about 70% of the state’s electricity.
“The writing is on the wall for Victoria’s brown coal plants which burn Australia’s most polluting coal,” Victorian Greens acting climate spokesman Dr Tim Read said.
“They’re old, unreliable and spew toxic pollution that is harming the health of local communities.”
EnergyAustralia has already announced plans to accelerate the closure of its Yallourn power station, declaring it will be retired by mid-2028, despite being licensed to operate until 2032. AGL has also brought forward the closure date of its Loy Yang A plant, shifting it from 2048 to 2045. Alinta Energy’s Loy Yang B is due to shut down in 2046.
Under the Greens’ plan, Yallourn will close in 2024, Loy Yang A in 2027 and Loy Yang B in 2030.
In addition to bringing forward the closure of the coal-fired power plants, the Greens also propose a job-for-job guarantee for coal workers and secure funding to 2035 for an independent Latrobe Valley Authority. Under the reform, the authority would be tasked with the power plants’ closure, and developing new industries in the region like offshore wind, clean manufacturing, and mine site rehabilitation.
The Greens said the bill would also increase Victoria’s legislated renewable energy target to 100% by 2030, a move it says would be supported by a $10 billion investment into renewables. The state government is aiming for 50% renewable energy by 2030.
“For too long Victoria has lagged behind other states and countries when it comes to transitioning away from polluting fossil fuels, but this bill gives us a chance to go further and faster in tackling the climate crisis,” Read said.
The Greens are releasing the bill alongside a climate policy package ahead of the November state election. The bill is expected to be debated and voted on in September following its introduction.

The company says it will reach financial close on both projects before the year is out and expects completion by 2024.
The announcement makes Lightsource bp Australia’s largest solar developer and owner based on the total megawatts of solar generation capacity to have reached construction as of August 2022.
The company said early work arrangements with engineering, procurement, and construction contractor Gransolar has led to construction commencing on the 400 MW (DC) Wellington North, in mid New South Wales near Dubbo, as well as the 90 MW (DC) Wunghnu solar and battery project in Victoria’s Goulburn Valley.
For the projects, Lightsource has recently entered into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Engie, Orica and Mars Australia.
Lightsource bp now has five projects in operation and under construction across New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, totalling over 1 GWp of generating capacity.
Its 107 MW (DC) West Wyalong project in the mid-south of NSW, and 214 MWp Woolooga Solar Farm in Queensland’s north coast are “in advanced stages of construction” and due for completion by the end of the year, the company said. Lightsource bp’s 200 MWp Wellington Solar Farm in NSW is already operational.
Lightsource bp’s Managing Director for Australia and New Zealand Adam Pegg says the company has more large scale solar projects “to come” in Australia.
“In addition to our solar ambitions, we are actively exploring other investment opportunities in the sector, and believe the hybridisation of renewables to complement solar – including battery storage, co-location of wind and integration with green hydrogen production – will be increasingly important to the future energy mix and in driving the energy transition,” Pegg added.
On top of the 1 GWp of Australian projects the company has under construction, it said a further 3 GWp are planned for Australia and New Zealand. “We see the acceleration of renewables happening more rapidly than previously anticipated, and expect our operations in Australia to make a significant contribution to meeting Lightsource bp’s global target of 25GW of solar by 2025,” Pegg said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/16/energy-ministers-move-puts-onus-on-emissions-reductions/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 16, 2022",Energy ministers’ move puts onus on emissions reductions,"Australia’s state, territory and federal energy ministers have as part of a new National Energy Transformation Partnership agreed to reform national energy policy to help fast track the transition of the electricity grid from fossil fuels towards 100% renewables.
At a meeting in Canberra on Friday the nation’s energy ministers agreed to enshrine “emissions reduction” as a new objective in the national electricity objective (NEO). Currently, the objective sets “price, quality, safety and reliability and security of supply of electricity” as the goals.
Speaking after the meeting, Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the change will ensure decisions made under the National Electricity Law, National Gas Law and National Energy Retail Law will consider emissions alongside other objectives.
“This might not sound much, but this is the first change to the national energy objective in 15 years,” he said.
“This is important. It sends a very clear directive to our energy market operators that they must include emissions reductions in the work that they do, the objectives they have, or any advice or decisions they make.”
Bowen said the move would provide greater certainty to drive large-scale clean energy investments that would be vital to achieving emissions reduction targets.
“The message of certainty to investors in renewable energy and transmission and storage around the world that Australia is open for business,” he said. “Australia is determined to reduce emissions, and we welcome investment to achieve it and we will provide a stable and certain policy framework.”
Former Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) director Andrew Stock, now with the Climate Council advocacy group, applauded the decision, saying it would “pave the way for low-cost, low-emissions energy sources, renewable energy like wind and solar, to play a greater role in Australia’s energy system”.
“For too long, the NEO has allowed industry and regulators to ignore the impacts of electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. “Now, all states and territories must ensure this legislation gets passed.”
The energy ministers also agreed to co-operate on the building program for ‘nationally significant’ transmission projects to connect more renewable capacity to major markets. The ministers have already identified three projects as qualifying for the designation: the Marinus Link between Tasmania and Victoria; the VNI West Victoria-to-NSW interconnector; and Hume Link, which will bring Snowy Hydro 2.0 into the national electricity market.
The ministers also discussed a future capacity mechanism to ensure firming power in the grid during the transition away from coal with federal and jurisdictional officials directed to provide options for a framework which delivers “adequate capacity, ensures orderly transition, and incentivises new investment in firm renewable energy”.
“Ministers intend to take a more active role in delivering the firming capacity needed as the system transforms and consider the best means to manage the risks of a disorderly exit of coal generation,” the joint communique said.
The ministers also agreed to a package of gas market reforms including extending the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) powers and functions to enable it to better forecast and manage east coast supply shortfall risks in winter 2023 and beyond.

University College London researchers have said in a new study that the pumping of hydrogen into gas networks poses risks and requires a rethinking of usual blending techniques. “The strongly inhomogeneous distribution of hydrogen within the pipe flow and on the pipe walls could indicate the location of potential pipe material degradation, including embrittlement effects of gas pipelines,” the researchers said in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. They focused on the common blending method, based on the injection of hydrogen through a side branch into a main gas header pipe (T-junction). “The low molecular mass of hydrogen reduces the penetration of a side-branch flow and increases the buoyancy forces leading to stratification with high hydrogen concentrations on the upper pipe surface, downstream of the branch,” the team said. “Top-side injection leads to the hydrogen concentration remaining >40% for up to eight pipe diameters from the injection point for volumetric dilutions less than 30%. Under-side injection promotes mixing within the flow interior and reduces wall concentration at the lower surface, compared to top-side injection.”
Nel has decided to double production of alkaline electrolyser stacks to 1 GW, by building a new, fully automated production line in Herøya, Norway. The €35 million (AU$50 million) production line is expected to be in operation from April 2024. The company made the investment decision a couple of weeks after it secured a record order for 200 MW of alkaline electrolyser stacks from an undisclosed US customer. This week, the hydrogen solutions specialist received a purchase order from an undisclosed European client for the delivery of several units that will fuel light- and heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles.
Fortune Business Insights said in a new report that the global fuel cell vehicle market will likely grow from US$446.7 million in 2018 to US$6,731.4 million by 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate of 29.7%. “The main drivers for market growth are the stringent regulations on carbon emissions, increasing acceptance of electric vehicles in emerging economies, longer driving range offered by these vehicles, and growing demand for improved fuel efficiency,” said Fortune Business Insights. It added that it expects the Asia-Pacific region to dominate the fuel cell vehicle market due to favourable policies, followed by Europe and North America. 
Research and Markets said in a new report that the global fuel cell market size will grow to US$2.9 billion this year. It said it expects the global market to hit US$9.1 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 26.0%. Station application of fuel cells is the largest segment of the market, followed by transportation, said the market research firm.
Allied Market Research said in a new report that the global market for fuel-cell unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) was valued at US$1.4 billion in 2021, and is estimated to reach US$4.5 billion by 2031. “Based on region, North America contributed to the largest share in 2021, and will maintain its dominant share during the forecast period,” the consultancy said.
Brooge Energy, a Cayman Islands-based energy infrastructure service provider, has hired Ernst & Young to provide consulting services for its planned green hydrogen and green ammonia plant in the United Arab Emirates. The company plans to launch a related study later this month, with the final report expected in the fourth quarter.
