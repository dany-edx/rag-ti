Both our electricity supply and demand are more weather dependent than ever, which is happening right at the point our weather systems are becoming more unpredictable than ever. Which makes modelling more vital than ever, at the exact moment our models are proving insufficient. 
To top that off, we’re needing to deploy new, less battle-hardened technology, there’s a whole swath of new players entering the energy sector, and we’re stuck with price signalling systems which no longer cater to our needs.
To use the 2016 Oxford Dictionary word of the year, which now seems to be more prophecy than observation, it’s a clusterf*ck. 
From Paul McArdle’s Global Roam in collaboration with the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting, the Generator Insights 2021, or GenInsights21, report published today is a deep dive into Australia’s energy system and it’s not particularly pretty. 
In summary: our electricity generation is becoming more variable and uncertain, which is not necessarily bad but does add layers of complexity to a system already piling them on faster than a game of Uno. Each of these layers of complexity is shadowed by an additional layer of risk. 
New risks mean new premiums. Which leads us to the question, who pays? Again, you get the picture. Clusterf*ck. 
And, as the authors remind us more than once, success is not guaranteed. Excellent.
The report is detailed 600+ pages, so below are just a few takeaways:
So the transition is rocketing along. At the beginning of 2017, renewables represented 13.6% of Australia’s total generation; as of September 2021, they accounted for 35.5%.

Rooftop solar, as we all know, is a hefty slab in that figure, but is largely invisible and uncontrolled. This, the authors note, means it will definitely have a limit in the National Electricity Market (NEM), we simply haven’t found it yet. 
Rooftop solar is also having a significant impact on the commercial returns of the whole generation sector, but especially utility-scale solar farms. Building on the refrain that (specifically) rooftop solar is “eating everyone’s lunch!”, the authors note: “the rise of rooftop PV has been the largest single determinant of declining grid demand and also market demand – and yet the nature of rooftop PV is such that this decline has not led to a commensurate reduction in peak demand, or peak requirement for Aggregate Scheduled Target.”
Adding to that is the little fact that sun shines on utility panels and rooftops alike means the wholesale solar-correlation penalty is compounded, leading to increasing curtailment of wholesale solar.
Rooftop solar, the authors say, is also starting to encroach on minimum safe operating levels of ‘keeping the lights on services’ such as inertia. “These challenges reside not just in residential rooftop PV but extend further to increasingly sizeable and sophisticated portfolios of commercial solar farms that purposively sit just below the 5MW visibility threshold.”
Way to steal our sunshine. 
It’s not just a technical problem either, but also a social one. The people who have rooftop solar are voters, so whatever policy is pursued will need to satisfy them, or it’s toast. 
The issues, they say, also bleed into the world of commercial challenges. For instance, the significant price depression in the market during (typically) the midday and afternoon, “would likely result in significant economic curtailment well before getting to the 100% level.”

Which brings us to what the authors call Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) boss, Daniel Westerman’s, Big Hairy Audacious Goal: 100% instantaneous renewables by 2025. It’s a challenge, they say, “so much more complicated” than simply generating 100% of our energy from renewable sources. For all the hurdles the country faces between now and that Hairy Audacious Goal, you’ll have to read GenInsights.
The report also raises the issue of the way Australia is modelling our storage needs, saying  ‘sunny skies’ scenarios seem to be the limit of what most are thinking about, and therefore modelling, at present. The report runs through a whole suite of scenarios which illustrate what can go wrong here, from looking across the world at Texas energy crisis in February, to how east coast droughts in 2007-2008 and 2016 impacted multiple layers of energy systems.  
“We urgently need to develop a ‘real world’ perspective of how much storage will actually need to be retained, simply for insurance purposes… and then working backwards, to ensure we don’t put the system into a long term position from which it is difficult, if not impossible, to recover,” the report says.
“Energy storage is the key to power systems being able to withstand shocks, hits and issues – yet we understand very little of how these projects will operate in a market otherwise dominated by ‘anytime/anywhere energy’,” it concludes.
Australia, unsurprisingly, has not priced carbon well in the market, “thereby distorting multiple levels of price signals, which is especially critical in a high Capex, low Opex electricity market such as the NEM,” the authors note.
“Countless times we see discussion and commentary on the number of MW installed, total percentage used at a particular point in time, yet without reference or understanding to price, price signal or financial outcome. Similarly, the electricity market (and its subsequent outcomes) should not simply be seen as another financial investment class, where the cheapest deployment of capital wins the day.”
The authors also raise concern about the NEM’s evolution drastically outpacing that of the market models, impinging on their ability to compute genuinely valid answers. Again, the authors point to pricing.
Take, for example, the newly implemented Five Minute Settlement, which cost an estimated $500 million to $1 billion to implement. “It may be a shock to many readers to learn that much market modelling performed to support individual project business cases, and to produce high profile industry reports, are not done with a 5-minute timestep,” they say, nothing these are often still done half hourly, others hourly, and some even more coarsely than that.
These are just a few of the challenges our energy system stares down the barrel of. How they’ll be fixed remains to be seen.

Grid-stabilising devices connecting renewables to distributed energy resources,"From pv magazine Global
Synchroinverters are a special kind of smart inverter that mimics a synchronous generator and are able to avoid grid voltage frequency fluctuations and faults by responding dynamically and autonomously to changes in the grid by software means, and providing an inertial response in an extremely short time. These devices have been developed mostly at the research level to date and are considered an optimal solution for integrating renewable energy with distributed energy resources such as storage and electric vehicles.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Israel’s Ministry of Energy (MoE) announced they have agreed to support, through the Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Energy program, a consortium formed by Israeli software provider Synvertec and U.S.-based power conversion and energy management systems provider Rhombus Energy Solutions to develop a new synchroinverter, which the DOE described as a dynamic and autonomous inverter utilising a unique control algorithm, allowing 100% of renewable generation by providing grid stability solutions for inverter-based applications.
“These new inverters are totally autonomous but can also respond to direct commands from the grid operator, when necessary,” a spokesperson from Rhombus Energy Solutions told pv magazine. “The solution is highly scalable, with the synchroinverter able to control inverters ranging in size from kilowatts to megawatts.”
According to the company, the devices are interoperable among themselves without compromising the expected performance of each of them separately and are able to provide grid stability services in less than 16.67 milliseconds. “The inverter will react to any changes in the grid in the same way a generator would; just much faster, in a cost-effective way, and [they] thereby play an active role in grid stability,” the spokesperson went on to say. “It is important to stress that the provision of frequency and voltage support is done simultaneously.”
The new inverter technology will rely on an agnostic algorithm developed by Synvertec that can be embedded into any three-phase inverter. The algorithm will be integrated into Rhombus Energy Solutions’ 125 kW bi-directional inverter, which the manufacturer describes as a device that can support power flow to and from the grid, allowing integration with power storage and non-grid renewable power resources. The device can be used either as a grid-tied, utility-interactive inverter or as a PV inverter.
The 125 kW-inverter is currently used by the company in the RES–DCVC125–480 EV DC Fast Charging unit developed by Rhombus. During grid-tied operation, the inverter’s site circuit breaker is closed and, when the battery is in discharge mode, the inverter injects current into the grid and supports critical loads. During standalone operation, the smart communication board is opened and the inverter, along with a battery, maintains power to critical loads.
The inverter also features an integrated standalone cooling unit, DC over-current protection, DC over-voltage protection, grid failure detection and protection, AC overcurrent protection, enclosures for over-temperature warning and under-temperature handling, and a hardware thermal protection circuit. “The 125 kW platform is a mass-production unit deployed across the USA and Canada and has a proven track record,” the company stated. “At its core, the switching power stage has been in production for more than 20 years and there are hundreds of units deployed in various configurations that are still in operation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/15/grid-software-solution-could-more-than-double-network-capacity-for-renewables-with-no-new-infrastructure/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES",MAX HALL,"DECEMBER 15, 2021",Grid software solution could more than double network capacity for renewables with no new infrastructure,"From pv magazine Global
A software system designed to free up electric grid capacity in a network in New York State proved so successful it was able to accommodate almost six times more solar generation capacity than planners of the trial had anticipated.
Scottish company Smarter Grid Solutions was tasked by Spanish-owned electric utility Avangrid with accommodating an extra 2.6 MW of solar generation capacity into the latter’s network in Spencerport after three 5 MW solar farms applied for grid permits.
The energy software company’s Flexible Interconnect Capacity Solution (FICS), which has been successfully deployed on U.K. grids, ended up being able to accommodate all 15 MW of extra solar capacity which would otherwise have been unable to be hosted on the distribution system.
And with the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) having predicted the FICS software could have the potential to treble the capacity of grid networks without any need for costly infrastructure investment, Smarter Grid Solutions is hoping the success achieved by its distributed-energy resource management system (DERMS) in the U.K. can be rolled out worldwide.
Graham Ault, of Smarter Grid Solutions, explained how the real-time electricity flow management system is already helping to integrate more than 400 MW of renewable energy generation capacity into grids which would otherwise have been deemed as having no free capacity.
“The FICS solution works in the same way as traffic lights and speed controls on public roads,” said Ault. “You can avoid building lots more roads and still achieve the maximum throughput of vehicles if you regulate the flow of traffic with smarter approaches like dynamic use of extra lanes, dynamic speed limits and traffic lights. That’s how the saving in grid infrastructure investment works – making the most out of existing infrastructure by monitoring traffic flows and deciding when to apply the different controls.
“The SGS software monitors the flow of power in the grid and compares that to grid capacity – like monitoring flowing and standing [or] jammed vehicles on roads – the sources of … problems. For the grid that’s the solar generators that are exporting at high power; on roads that’s … side roads, lanes, etc. [FICS] then [issues] signals to make everything flow better. For FICS, that takes the form of an instruction to a PV site to regulate the export of power upwards or downwards.
“Achieving a solution that achieves that on a second by second basis, 365 days a year is quite complex but our system now manages over 400 MW of renewable generation for grid operators with excellent results.”
