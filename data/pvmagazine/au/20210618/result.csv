The leaders of (supposedly) the world’s richest democracies failed again to agree to new funding to help poorer parts of the world invest in green technology and adapt to extreme weather.
But more interesting than these pledges and non-pledges were the things that weren’t mentioned at all. One of the greatest unmentionables at climate summit after climate summit is just how badly we keep track of contributions to global warming.
It’s the elephant in the room at any gathering where the leaders of rich countries discuss climate change: historical responsibility. Everyone knows that G7 nations have contributed disproportionately to the global warming that has already happened. But exactly how much more?
If you search online for which country has caused most global warming, you find a list of how much countries emit each year. Delve deeper, and the next thing you find is how much they have reduced their emissions since 1990. This flatters mature economies, whose emissions are declining. But for carbon dioxide – the effects of which last almost indefinitely (and to an only slightly lesser degree, nitrous oxide, a byproduct of fertiliser production and use) – it’s accumulated emissions over time that determine a country’s contribution to global warming, not emissions in any given year.

Focusing on current emissions is particularly kind to the G7’s host. The UK’s emissions have declined sharply since 1990, but the country did start belching carbon dioxide out of its dark satanic mills almost 100 years before the rest of the world caught on. A tonne of carbon dioxide emitted by an English cotton mill in 1800 is having exactly the same impact on global temperature today as a tonne of carbon dioxide emitted by a Vietnamese power station in 2021.
Brazil promoted an effort to quantify country-level contributions to global warming in the 2000s, but it was quietly allowed to die. At present, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main forum for international climate action, only requires countries to report their contributions to emissions, not warming. And everyone else, from corporations to personal carbon footprint calculators, follows suit.
“Isn’t that the same thing?” you might ask. Sadly, no. The method the UNFCCC has settled on to report emissions reflects their effect on the balance between the energy the Earth absorbs from the Sun and the energy it emits back into space over the 100 years after the date of the emission. This is somewhat related to their effect on global temperature, but it is a very long way from the same thing.
For emissions that accumulate in the atmosphere over decades to centuries, like carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, the distinction doesn’t matter. But for methane, and a host of other climate pollutants that persist from only a few days to a couple of decades, it matters a lot. Any country contemplating setting up a fracking industry (notorious for leaking methane) can be quietly confident that it will be 100 years before the warming effect of their fugitive methane emissions will be accurately reflected in their reports to the UNFCCC.
In the Paris Agreement, the world set itself a very ambitious goal. The headline goal is not about emissions, but to limit the rise in global average temperature to “well below 2°C”, pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C if possible.
That’s a good thing. By and large, the effects of climate change depend on how much we warm the planet overall, not warming by any given date, or the rate of emissions and warming at any given time, and certainly not planetary energy imbalance summed over an arbitrary time horizon. But right now, it is impossible to take stock of progress towards this temperature goal because countries, in their plans for 2030 and beyond, only report aggregate emissions using this rather odd accounting system that doesn’t reflect the effect of these emissions on global temperature.
If rich countries like the G7 are serious about stopping global warming, a good start might be clarifying who and what is causing it. There is no prospect of the UNFCCC changing its accounting system, but it does allow countries to report additional information if they deem it relevant.
And what could be more relevant than actual contributions to global warming? At COP26, the Glasgow climate conference in November 2021, the G7 nations could step up and declare they will henceforth report, in addition to their emissions, how much warming they have caused already, how much they continue to cause, and how much they propose to cause in future.
All the information exists. Warming contributions can be calculated using precisely the same formulae used for the UNFCCC’s own emissions reporting. It is simply a matter of putting the numbers out there and encouraging everyone else to do the same.
This isn’t just about outing the guilty rich. Acknowledging what is causing warming should focus minds on what it will take to stop it. And if we add up the G7’s planned contributions to future warming – never mind the contributions from China, India and the rest – it will soon become clear that we don’t just need to stop causing global warming as soon as possible, but we also need to be able to reverse it by taking carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere and storing it, safely and permanently, somewhere else. Which is another topic they prefer to avoid at climate summits.

The Fulham project is one of three solar-storage hybrid power plants Repowering Gippsland, a joint venture between Melbourne-based management team Solis Renewable Energy, Marathon Electrical and construction firm WK & MA Ferguson, has planned for the region.
The group has also secured planning approval from the Victorian government for the Perry Bridge Solar Farm, a 44 MW solar PV and 50 MWh battery project, and has announced plans to develop the Gippsland Renewable Energy Park (GREP) near Giffard West.
The GREP is the largest of the three projects proposed by the developers with the stage 1 planning permit application expected to focus on the development of a 500 MW solar PV facility and up to 500 MWh battery storage. Solis has however indicated there is potential for expansion of the park in subsequent stages to deliver up to 2 GW of solar generation.
Marathon Electrical director Brett Singh said the projects had been well received by the community.
“We are very excited by the ongoing progress and support for these projects,” he said.
“We have had significant interest from the local community and industry regarding the projects and are well advanced in discussions with AusNet regarding connecting the projects to the grid.”

The Fulham Solar Farm will be constructed on a 160-hectare site about 12 kilometres west of Sale.
The joint venture said detailed site assessments and designs have commenced, with a formal period of community consultation to be completed in the coming months, prior to submission of a planning application to the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP).
The 80 MW solar farm will comprise a single axis array system of about 160,000 bi-facial solar modules and will generate enough energy to power about 25,000 homes.
Construction of the Fulham project, subject to planning approval, is expected to commence in Q1 2022, with the solar farm set to be fully operational in late 2022.
The three solar-storage hybrid power plants are part of Repowering Gippsland’s plans to transform the region into a renewable energy hotspot.
The joint venture has also launched the Australian Renewables Academy (ARA), designed to establish a skilled workforce to support the transition to renewable energy in the region.
Singh said the ARA would be based in Sale and would develop courses and connections with education providers that are relevant to the renewable energy industry and could be delivered Australia wide.
“We intend to create opportunities for all members of the Gippsland community through supported training and work readiness programs,” he said.
“The ARA will ensure that the economic and social benefits of the rapidly developing renewables sector are realised by the local community through the development of a well-trained workforce, with transferable skills to make the most of the employment opportunities in the sector.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/18/environment-minister-threatens-shake-up-for-module-manufacturers/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 18, 2021",Environment minister threatens shake-up for module manufacturers,"Environment Minister Sussan Ley has directed solar PV module manufacturers to produce a “clear timeline” for establishing an industry wide recycling strategy for end-of-life technology with the government determined to avoid a looming “landfill nightmare”.
Speaking at the National Press Club this week, Ley said government is concerned that Australia’s record rollout of solar PV will eventually generate a huge pipeline of waste and a solution is needed now.
“I am putting the solar panel industry on notice with clear timelines for action,” she said.
“The uptake of millions of solar panels across the country from rooftops to solar farms has been vital from an emissions perspective but the explosion of retailers and importers in the area, and the lack of an industry wide approach to collection and recycling, means that it also looms as a landfill nightmare.
“We can’t fix one environmental issue by creating another.”
Australia has embraced solar PV, with 2 GW of new large-scale solar generation capacity added to the grid in 2020 while a record 3 GW of rooftop solar PV capacity was installed nationally last year.
All indications are for another bumper year in 2021 with the Clean Energy Council predicting another 3.5 to 4 GW of rooftop capacity will be installed while large-scale solar also continues at pace.
The lifespan of a solar module can be anywhere from 10 to 25 years, and while some industry figures have calculated that average solar module in Australia is three-years old, the number of panels nearing the end of life is about to grow exponentially.

Currently, almost all broken or expired solar panels in Australia go into landfill and researchers from the University of South Australia (UniSA) have estimated that more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter the waste stream by 2035
The government has been pushing the industry to develop a plan for the past six years, and Ley is expected to next week list solar modules on the government’s stewardship priority list – which already mandates how electronic waste, like televisions, is dealt with – to force a recycling solution.
A spokesperson from Ley’s office said a “product stewardship scheme for photovoltaic systems should encourage shared responsibility throughout the supply chain”.
“Designers, manufacturers, installers and retailers all have a responsibility to manage the impacts of their products through their life cycle,” the spokesperson said.
Clive Fleming, director of Adelaide-based Reclaim PV Recycling has previously called for a national approach to what he said looms as a growing issue.
“Research is suggesting that there will be more than 1 million panels requiring replacement annually by 2031,” he said.
“We need a nation-wide approach to managing the replacement and recycling of faulty, non-performing and end-of-life solar panels before this gets unmanageable and we start to see 2,000 tonnes of waste making its way to landfill annually.”
Image: PV Cycle
Fleming, who recently secured approval to establish a second facility in Brisbane, said current recycling options are expensive – the cost to recycle one solar panel with Reclaim PV about $10 plus freight charges to the facility.
Solar panels are 100% recyclable but stripping and sorting the materials is a costly exercise and the return on those materials isn’t yet large enough to cover those costs.
“We do need to charge at the moment for the recycling because the amount of solar panels coming in isn’t huge,” Fleming said.
“Until that tipping point comes where we can sell our materials in a larger volume, it means that we still have to charge for the process and our labour.”
Fleming said what would help keep solar modules from landfill was if more states and territories followed Victoria’s lead and banned them from being dumped.
The New South Wales government has made moves to address the situation, allocating  $10 million for a two-stage grant funding scheme aimed at keeping end-of-life solar systems out of landfill.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/18/taylors-plans-for-arena-under-scrutiny-in-senate/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 18, 2021",Taylor’s plans for ARENA under scrutiny in senate,"The Morrison government’s plan to expand the scope of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) so it can fund non-renewable energy projects has come under increased scrutiny with a parliamentary committee questioning whether it is legal.
Taylor has moved to expand the mandate of ARENA to allow it to fund carbon capture and storage projects and hydrogen that can be produced from fossil fuels. Projects in the heavy transport, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, gas supply, water supply, waste services and data centre sectors could also be funded.
Taylor said the changes are designed to make technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen commercially competitive to reduce emissions “without destroying industries or jobs”.
The proposed change has attracted criticism from the Labor Party while Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton said it will injects uncertainty into what needs to be a clear and strong economic signal for an orderly transition away from fossil fuels.
“There is no such thing as clean coal, and gas is not a low-emissions technology,” he said.
The Smart Energy Council has also voiced its opposition, declaring in a tweet it will fight the proposed changes which have now attracted the focus of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation.
In a letter to Energy Minister Angus Taylor, the Senate committee’s chair, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, expressed concern that his plan to use regulation rather than legislation to expand ARENA’s remit could be illegal.
The Liberal senator wrote to Taylor on Thursday, noting the objective of the laws governing ARENA were “to improve the competitiveness and supply of renewable energy in Australia”.
“The legislated functions of the ARENA are limited to supporting renewable energy technologies,” she wrote.
“There is nothing in the … Act to suggest that it was contemplated that the ARENA would have the ability to foster anything other than renewable energy technologies.”

Fierravanti-Wells said the committee believed “given the scope and impact of the measures”, they were more appropriate for parliamentary enactment rather than regulation, or delegated legislation.
“The committee therefore requests your advice as to why it is considered necessary and appropriate to use delegated legislation, rather than primary legislation, to expand the remit of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to include non-renewable energy technologies,” she wrote.
Fierravanti-Wells called on Taylor to explain the move by July 1, suggesting the committee could move a motion to disallow the change in the Senate if he did not respond.
Labor’s climate spokesperson Chris Bowen told parliament on Tuesday he believed the change could be illegal, saying the “the giveaway” was in the agency’s name.
“The ‘r’ in ARENA stands for renewable,” he said.
“It’s in the act, as the objective of the act, and it’s a pretty clear principle under other legislation that a regulation cannot conflict with the legislated act.”
Bowen said Labor supports any new energy technologies that stack up scientifically and commercially but said deserving non-renewable technologies should be supported in other ways and not allowed to dilute ARENA’s funding and expertise.
“Even the minister’s explanatory statement on the new regulations admits that ARENA’s legislated functions are currently limited to supporting renewable energy technologies,” Bowen said.
“Changing those functions would require legislation – not a cynical attempt to circumvent the parliament via regulations.”

State-owned regional utility Horizon Power successfully powered the community, home to more than 800 people, for a total of 80 minutes with renewable energy during a trial of the microgrid late last month.
Electricity was powered by 600 KW of utility solar PV and 700 KW of rooftop solar, supported by battery technology while an intelligent control system known as a Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) was utilised to unlock the microgrid’s potential.
Western Australia Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the successful trial was a landmark moment in the state’s energy transition.
“The operation of the Onslow microgrid powered by 100% renewables signifies a landmark step towards building a cleaner, brighter, renewable energy future for our state,” he said.
“This innovative project demonstrates how distributed energy resources can be safely integrated at the grid level, unlocking further benefits from Western Australia’s world-leading rooftop solar uptake.”
Image: Horizon Power
The Onslow project, which replaced diesel- and gas-fired generators, was initiated in 2016.  Stage 1 delivered a modular gas power station with 8 MW of installed capacity and associated infrastructure. Stage 2 saw the completion of a centralized 1 MW centralised solar PV farm and a 1 MWh battery storage system.
The microgrid also incorporates rooftop solar and residential batteries with the residents of the town having been incentivised to install solar and battery technology in their homes as part of the project.
The high uptake of renewables by the Onslow community enabled Horizon Power to effectively pilot the DERMS which manages the assets connected to its networks in a coordinated way.

The software solution, provided by PXiSE Energy Solutions, uses predictive analytics to maximise the amount of renewable energy in the microgrid while maintaining network stability for all customers.
The technology allowed Horizon to turn the gas generators at the power station off during the trial and power the Onslow community by coordinating the rooftop solar with the solar farm and large-scale batteries.
It is the first time the DERMS has been deployed in a remote microgrid in Australia. Further testing of the system is set to continue ahead of commissioning the project later this year.
Horizon has previously said the Onslow DER Project has brought forward a future where customers are recognised as being key to a greener energy future by helping inform the infrastructure and intelligent system controls which enable them to take a central role.
Horizon also believe the project is an ideal environment to integrate and test other energy technologies like electric vehicles and customer products and services.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/18/woodmac-forecasts-australias-low-carbon-hydrogen-export-revenue-to-reach-us90-billion-by-2050/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,SOUTH KOREA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 18, 2021",WoodMac forecasts Australia’s low-carbon hydrogen export revenue to reach US$90 billion by 2050,"Market researchers from Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac) have predicted that hydrogen can fall below US$2/kg long term and, what is more, Australia’s low-carbon hydrogen trade could be worth up to US$90 billion by 2050. 
To put that in perspective, by 2050 Australia’s low-carbon hydrogen trade could be worth, in today’s money, equal to the entire GDP of the Dominican Republic and slightly more than double the Jeff Bezos-MacKenzie Scott divorce settlement. 
Thanks to Australia’s extraordinary solar irradiance, vast potential (albeit controversial) for carbon capture and storage (CCS), and world-leading position in large-scale stationary battery storage flexibility, WoodMac believes Australia is uniquely poised to capitalise on low-carbon hydrogen production. 
What is more, Australia is also relatively well positioned to key off-taker markets. WoodMac’s head of markets and transitions, Prakesh Sharma, said “Australia’s key export markets – Japan, South Korea, China, India and Europe – are large carbon emitters and net importers of natural resources. Their import needs have steadily increased in the past two decades and now average at more than 70% of their total energy demand. As these countries raise climate ambitions, they will need to source clean energy to decarbonise steel, chemicals, cement, heavy-duty mobility, shipping and power generation.” 
This is why WoodMac already measured Australia’s green hydrogen electrolyser capacity project pipeline at 2.94 GW in 2020, beating out the Netherlands to be the world’s second-largest owner of hydrogen projects. Halfway through 2021 and that pipeline has grown to 4.25 GW, a 45% increase of advanced and early-stage project developments. 
By 2050 Sharma predicts “Australia’s share in the globally traded market for low-carbon hydrogen or its derivates could reach 25-45 million tonnes, equivalent to US$50 to US$90 billion in potential export revenue.” 
Challenges
The challenge, WoodMac believes, is not really cost competitiveness, which would be reached through large-scale development and the continuing decline in costs for electrolysers and renewables. The real challenge on the horizon is how to transport the goods. As Professor of Future Energies Ad van Wijk of TU Delft in the Netherlands explains, “What you see today is that the electricity production costs by solar is not the main factor, it is transport costs and storage costs which adds up to a much higher number…and then the conversion losses…” 
Hence why IDTechEX Energy Storage/Hydrogen Technology analyst, Daniele Gatti, told pv magazine: “Adopting a hydrogen economy means developing the entire supply chain: production, transportation and distribution, and also its consumption.”
Sharma points out the three best forms of seaborne transport methods for Australia’s potential export supply chains. Namely, liquid hydrogen (LH2), liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) and ammonia (NH3), all of which carry their own personalised pros and cons depending largely upon the end-use, purity and storage requirements. 
Nevertheless, WoodMac’s proprietary hydrogen costing and energy transition scenario modelling shows that Australia’s hydrogen delivered costs “can fall below US$2/kg longer-term, making it competitive in all end-use cases in key markets of northeast Asia.” 
Sharma believes Australia “can overcome hydrogen’s logistical challenge like it did in coal seam gas to LNG projects, automated trucks and remote-control mining operations and large-scale CCS deployments. Leveraging experience from hydrogen pilot programmes and great investment in research and development, consistent government support, partnerships and off-take agreements from Japanese and Korean firms would be crucial.” 
Of course, what is not much of a challenge to work out is whether there will be a market of that size. The answer is not just yes, it’s an emphatic yes with the caveat that the real size of the low-carbon hydrogen market could be a lot bigger than most people expect. After all, a great swathe of the world’s countries, including Australia’s off-taker partners such as Japan and Korea, have committed to a net-zero emissions world, which is to say they’ve committed to creating an enormous green hydrogen market because, as Sharma alluded to above, hydrogen is particularly effective at decarbonising tricky industries. 
Moreover, as Jan-Justus Schmidt, Co-founder Enapter said at the recent pv magazine Roundtables Europe 2021, we have not yet seen all the “killer applications” hydrogen is capable of.
Wood Mac joins a host of reputable company, including van Wijk, in estimating that ammonia will be “the first hydrogen-carrier in the export market facilitated by Australia from the mid-2020s. Low-carbon hydrogen demand in Japan and Korea reaches 30 million tonnes in 2050 with ammonia taking one-third market share on this route.” 
Uncertain certification 
However, as Aurélie Beauvais, Deputy CEO SolarPower Europe noted at that same event, one of the most important aspects of the development of green hydrogen at the moment is certification, which is to say, how we can know whether a hydrogen molecule is green or blue or grey or brown. “How can we define and certify renewable hydrogen,” Beauvais said, “and how can we make sure we are not double counting the electron that’s produced?” 
This is indeed an important question. “In a net-zero emissions world,” continued Sharma, “a stable and reliable source of low-carbon hydrogen supply becomes essential because it is impossible to tell how a given molecule of hydrogen has been produced. A guarantee of origin is therefore crucial to allow for minimal environmental impact, i.e., carbon leakage.” 
“Standards also help with risk assessment and transparent market pricing,” Sharma continued. “Australia stands to benefit as rules of hydrogen shipping, transport, storage and product quality are set and accepted internationally.” 
“This is a lifetime opportunity for Australia to harness its renewable energy resources and become a dominant player in the zero-carbon energy trade,” said Sharma finally. “It would be difficult for large Asian economies to reach climate goals without clean energy supplies from Australia.”

Today, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is praising accelerated investment in new renewable generation and DER which is driving a paradigm shift in the power system itself. 
According to AEMO, a full third of all homes in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) now have rooftop solar installed, with the 2021 Wholesale Electricity Market Electricity Statement of Opportunities (WEM ESOO) report forecasting that rooftop and large-scale commercial solar systems will hit the 40% mark of total generation capacity by 2030-31.
According to the report WA is on track for a rapid transition of its entire power system, with rooftop solar and large-scale commercial system installations forecast to grow at an average rate of 8% (219 MW each year). That would mean that rooftop and commercial solar installations would exceed 4 GW by 2030-31. 
In fact, the WEM ESOO analysis even shows, according to AEMO executive general manager, WA, Cameron Parrotte, “that even with the expected staged retirement of coal generators, including Muja C unit 5 in 2022 and Muja C unit 6 in 2024, connected and committed capacity is forecast to meet anticipated demand over the next decade.” 
Moreover, minimum operation demand from the grid is also forecast to drop significantly in coming years, from the record low of 954 MW to 232 MW by 2025-26. 
AEMO CEO and managing director, Daniel Westerman, said: “It is pleasing that AEMO’s analysis in the 2021 WEM ESOO confirms sufficient generation capacity to meet forecast demand in the SWIS over the next decade.” Adding, “As the energy transition unfolds, AEMO is committed to working collaboratively with stakeholders to implement the WA Government’s Energy Transformation Strategy, to ensure WA households and businesses are the beneficiaries of secure, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy.” 
Other predictions from the WEM ESOO analysis include an expectance to see increased business activity and new housing to drive a 0.2% yearly increase in peak demand over the course of the decade, a 0.4% turnaround from the 2020 WEM ESOO. Moreover, the analysis puts the Reserve Capacity Requirement at 4,396 MW for 2023-24, an ever-so-slight drop from the 4,421 MW requirement in 2022-23. 
Of course, such rapid uptake of variable generators and distributed solar brings its own challenges of voltage, system strength, and inertia standards. “AEMO is supportive of innovative solutions to help address these challenges,” said Parrotte, “pointing to the importance of projects already underway, like the WA Government’s Energy Transformation Strategy, to help alleviate system security risks under certain conditions such as when minimum operational demand is low.”

pv magazine: Your research focuses on the different flexibility options to support the integration of renewable energy. How important is the development of green hydrogen for the energy transition?
Ruchi Gupta: Yes, my research focuses on different flexibility options such as energy storage technologies, grid reinforcement and sector coupling, among others, to support the integration of renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies. Renewable electricity allows the decarbonisation of the power sector. However, the decarbonisation of other hard-to-abate sectors, such as carbon-intensive industries and long-distance transport, still remains a big challenge. This is where sector coupling – i.e., production of green hydrogen through surplus renewable electricity by electrolysis – can play an important role in achieving the net-zero target.
You’re currently working on assessing the potential of green hydrogen in Switzerland using GIS. Can you talk more about the project?
The project on assessing the potential of green hydrogen in Switzerland is a collaborative project of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA). In this project, we developed a detailed spatio-temporal assessment model to assess the techno-economic potential of power to gas plants (PtG) by evaluating their levelised cost of energy and value, considering their proximity to the different supply and demand centres. We also analysed various deployment strategies and set cost improvement targets to inform investors, project developers and policymakers about optimal locations or hotspots for the placement of PtG plants.
What’s the biggest obstacle to green hydrogen development in Switzerland?
I think one of the biggest obstacles to green hydrogen development in Switzerland is the cost of solar and wind electricity, since solar installations are limited to rooftops (due to the high land costs) and wind energy faces limited public acceptance. The cost levels in Switzerland are in general higher compared to other countries due to the higher labour costs. For example, the total installation cost of residential PV in Switzerland is almost double compared to India. Other driving factors for the high costs of renewable energy in Switzerland are the long duration of proceedings as well as demanding requirements for the environmental impact assessment.
How do you see the green hydrogen economy currently? Will it be a case of countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia becoming export superpowers because of their solar advantage compared to countries in say, North-east Asia and Europe?
It is correct that countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia have a solar advantage, however, there are other issues that need to be addressed. One of them is transportation and storage as a fully-fledged hydrogen infrastructure is still lacking. Having said that, if the opportunities are timely seized, it will surely create new export opportunities for countries with rich renewable energy sources.
You were previously part of a team that contributed to India’s National Energy Policy – do you think India’s solar resources will make it a big player in the future green hydrogen economy?
es, indeed. The price of the delivered power is the biggest driver of the cost of green hydrogen. The recent lowest bid of $ 0.027/kWh for solar and a competitive wind tariff gives India a competitive advantage to disrupt the green hydrogen economy. Considering India’s falling solar and wind electricity costs and increasing deployment targets of 450 GW by 2030, if the right and timely policies are adopted, India has the potential to become a net exporter of green hydrogen by 2030. India is also planning to promote local large-scale manufacturing of electrolysers. As per Niti Aayog, domestic electrolysers production and development of green hydrogen projects could create a new green technology market of around $18 billion to $20 billion in India along with domestic job creation.
What do you see as the biggest challenge to the development of green hydrogen?
I think the biggest challenge right now is the cost of green hydrogen, which is still not competitive compared to grey hydrogen. However, with the decreasing renewable electricity and electrolyser costs, green hydrogen will reach par or even cheaper in the future.
One element I would like to emphasise is that we should not only assess the cost, but also the value generated by green hydrogen. For example, oxygen and heat produced as by-products from the process of electrolysis can be sold in the market to generate revenue. In addition, power-to-hydrogen systems can provide other stacked benefits such as frequency control, avoided CO2 taxes and the sale of surplus renewable electricity to the grid. The world is going to pay a premium for carbon free products and that will increase the value generated by green hydrogen. Off course in order to achieve that, we need to unlock demand, and that requires having the appropriate policies in place for market creation and a progressive and stable regulatory framework.
What do you see as the biggest opportunity of green hydrogen?
Until now, green hydrogen is not seen as a profitable investment due to its high production costs compared to grey hydrogen. However, decreasing cost of renewable electricity generation due to economies of scale, offers a unique opportunity for cost competitive green hydrogen production.
What’s next for green hydrogen?
I think exciting times are ahead as we will see something similar to what we saw in the case of solar PV, with dramatic cost reductions and vast deployment that outperformed all previous forecasts. In the coming years, we will also see the first large-scale green hydrogen production facilities entering into operation. Demand creation, right policies and timely investments will be the key for the successful development of a green hydrogen economy.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UN to help the latter harness renewable energy in its peacekeeping missions around the world.
IRENA announced the agreement on its website yesterday and said the partners would work with nations hosting UN peacekeeping missions to install clean energy capacity wherever possible.
As part of the deal, IRENA has also pledged to help attract financial backing from private investors for such efforts.
The Abu Dhabi-based energy body said the deployment of renewables would boost the clean energy capacity of nations hosting peacekeeping operations as well as reducing the carbon footprint of the UN.
“Our six-year (2017-2023) environment strategy is transforming our operations in peacekeeping missions,” said Atul Khare, UN under-secretary-general for operational support, quoted in the IRENA statement. “Our focus on raising awareness, improving performance, and reducing our environmental footprint has prompted peacekeeping missions to implement more renewable energy projects. Several renewable energy projects are already under way in the field missions and we are keen to look for new and innovative ways to outsource renewable energy supply and to implement on-site renewable solutions.”
