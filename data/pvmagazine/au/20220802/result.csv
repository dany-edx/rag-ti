Charles Darwin University says it will operate the system for industry partners, students, and researchers, to further develop and commercialise hydrogen as an energy source.
The system will be housed at the Renewable Energy Grid Testing Facility in East Arm Wharf.
The installation will be the first hydrogen energy system in the Northern Territory (NT), with the state government last year announcing it would invest in supporting a local renewable hydrogen industry.
Professor Suresh Thennadil, Director of the university’s Energy and Resources Institute, said the government funding will enable it to develop a world-class grid testing facility that fosters collaborations between the university and industry through applied research projects and training programs.
“We are delighted to work with [Charles Darwin University] to adapt our proven and reliable SPS [standalone power system] product for researchers to test the capability of creating renewable hydrogen and integrating electrolysers and fuel cells into the grid,” Mike Hall, Executive Director of supplier Hybrid Systems, said.
Hall added the system would create hydrogen fuel from fresh water and store the fuel at the test facility. Hybrid Systems is a subsidiary of Pacific Energy Group.

The company launched in 2021 claiming its capillary-fed electrolysis technology will deliver a “giant leap” in performance and cost compared to incumbent technologies, promising to deliver hydrogen for less than $2 per kilogram by the ‘mid 2020s.’ 
This promise is based on the efficiency of its system, which Hysata says operates at 95%, a massive step up from the current hydrogen electrolyser efficiencies which generally sit at 75% or less.

The promise has attracted a host of big investors, including Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Ventures, the UK’s Kiko Ventures, Australia’s largest steelmaker Bluescope and superannuation fund Hostplus. Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) furthered its previous $750,000 investment, contributing  $10 million to the Series A funding round.
Alongside its capillary-fed electrolysis, Hysata is also promising easy equipment production, telling pv magazine Australia previously that it believes it can reach gigawatt scale hydrogen production by the middle of the decade thanks to its simple and mass manufacturable design.
The successful funding round, the company said, will help it grow its Illawarra-based team and set it on its path to gigawatt scale manufacturing.
Kiko Ventures’ Founding Partner, Robert Trezona, described Hysata’s technology as “game changing”.
“Having assessed scores of electrolyser technologies in my 20 years in cleantech, Hysata’s technology stands out as a true breakthrough. The company has redefined the core cell architecture for alkaline electrolysis, producing a practical and scalable solution with game changing efficiency. Hysata has the potential to be a globally significant company in the hydrogen economy and we look forward to supporting its growth, especially here in Europe,” Trezona said.
“Over the last 12-18 months, Hysata has been interacting with dozens of major customers globally,” Hysata CEO Paul Barrett added. “The impact our efficiency and system simplicity delivers to customers’ project economics truly moves the needle. We look forward to continuing to work with our shareholders and customers to bring this much needed technology to market as soon as possible.”

The ‘desktop’ study, meaning it carried out purely through research rather than physical investigations, will be conducted by the CSIRO looking at the Eyre Peninsula, west of Adelaide, where natural hydrogen company H2EX holds an exploration license.

South Australia is attracting a huge amount of natural hydrogen attention as Australia’s only jurisdiction with a legislative framework to allow for natural hydrogen exploration following amendments in February 2021.
In 12 months following that amendment, one third of the state’s landmass had been snapped up  by rush of companies applying for, and often being granted, exploration licenses for natural hydrogen, sometimes referred to as ‘gold’ or ‘white’ hydrogen.
Proponents of natural hydrogen believe the naturally occuring underground accumulations of the molecule, which have been known about for many decades but have not previously had a global market, could deliver sizeable quantities of hydrogen extremely quickly and affordably.
The outcomes of the CSIRO’s study are expected by the end of the year.
There are just a handful of companies in Australia pursuing natural hydrogen today with the Perth-based company H2EX, registered in 2021, one of them. In June, the company was granted exploration license 691 (“PEL 691”) for an area covering 5,991 square kilometres (sqkm) in the Eyre Peninsula.
In addition to PEL 691, H2EX says it has first ranking over approximately 32,000 sqkm of exploration applications in South Australia. “These applications will proceed through the Native Title process prior to the award of exploration licenses,” the company noted in its announcement.

“We are one of the first companies in the world to explore for natural hydrogen. This is an important step in finding clean energy sources created by Mother Nature for Australian local communities and industry,” H2EX CEO and Managing Director Mark Hanna added.
According to the company, two historical oil bores detected high levels of natural hydrogen (in the order of 50-85% purity) at the Eyre Peninsula site.
Natural hydrogen has been of interest to the national science agency for some time now, with the government-backed organisation publishing a paper in March 2021 entitled ‘Hydrogen in Australian natural gas: occurrences, sources and resources’.
“There is no question that within Australia and arguably the world, CSIRO is at the forefront of natural hydrogen research and field work,” H2EX Chairman & Non-Executive Director, Peter Coleman, said.
HyTerra
“CSIRO’s leading approach to innovation and technology and proven track record to help commercialise novel ideas makes them the perfect partner for H2EX.”
The study has been enabled by the CSIRO’s Kick-Start initiative, which provides funding and support for Australian startups and small businesses to access CSIRO’s research expertise and capabilities to help develop their business. 
To date, the only major discovery and implementation of natural hydrogen reservoirs has been in Mali in West Africa. In 2012, natural hydrogen was discovered and eventually connected to a fuel cell to supply electricity to the town of Bourabougu.
Canadian company Hydroma, behind the project, is now preparing to produce and export its natural hydrogen. It is far from the only company with such visions.
As of February, 18 exploration licenses had been granted or applied for South Australia alone. Many of the hopeful companies, which include Queensland’s Gold Hydrogen and Perth-based HyTerra, appear confident other Australian states will soon amend their legislation to allow for natural hydrogen exploration and ultimately projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/02/cooling-down-solar-modules-with-cotton-wicks-immersed-in-water/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,HUNGARY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 2, 2022",Cooling down solar modules with cotton wicks immersed in water,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the University of Miskolc in Hungary have developed a passive cooling technique for photovoltaic modules which they claim is able to lower the panels’ operating temperature by up to 22%.
The novel technique consists of attaching cotton wicks immersed in the water (CWIWs) to the backside of the photovoltaic module. The water is supplied to cotton wicks from top to bottom by gravity which the scientists said helps the effective absorption of cotton and reduces water consumption. “Exposure of the wetted cotton wicks to the surrounding air decreases dry air temperature and increases humidity, producing evaporating cooling that can exploit it to absorb the rising heat from the backside of the PV module,” they explained. “The technique contributes by creating a continuous cooling environment with less water consumption and better performance under hot conditions than in other studies.”
The CWs were arranged as serpentine forms avoiding any space between them. The scientists fixed them by using thermal silicon. They also placed two plastic bottles full of water at the top edge of the PV module. “The gravity-free flow of water helps transmit the water to the CWs without extra power,” they emphasised. “Thus, this method helps to distribute the water entirely from cotton wicks throughout the PV module.”
The performance of a polycrystalline solar module with a size of 0.65 m × 0.55 m and equipped with CWIWs was compared with that of a reference panel without the cooling system. They used a data logger with two voltage sensors and two current sensors. It recorded temperature, voltage, and current values every ten minutes during the experiment days. “The experiments were conducted according to climatic conditions of Basra City, Iraq, from 20 to 29 of August 2021,” the specified. “August is characterised by a sunny month with high temperatures and low humidity on most days with moderate winds.”
Through their measurements, the academics found that the PV module with CWIWs cooling showed thermal behaviour closer to the ambient temperature throughout the experiment period due to evaporating cooling of CWs. “The highest temperature recorded of the PV module with the CWIWs was 46.2 C at 12:20 PM, while the ambient temperature was 43.8 C,” they stated.
Compared to the module without cooling, the CWs-equipped module had an operating temperature that was 22% lower. “The moist condition resulting from the cotton bristles immersed in water and exposed to the wind has provided appropriate cooling that enhances efficiency to 7.25% and the power yield increment about 16.3 W,” they further explained. “Using CWIWs decreases entropy generation by about 14% due to reducing the lost exergy of the PV module than the PV module without cooling.”
The Hungarian group presented the passive technique in the paper Effect of Evaporative Cooling on Photovoltaic Module Performance, which was recently published in Process Integration and Optimisation for Sustainability. “The passive cooling applied in this work enhanced the performance of the PV module higher than in other similar studies, making it more reliable for application,” it concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/02/solarwatt-obtains-cradle-to-cradle-certification-for-its-glass-glass-solar-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 2, 2022",Solarwatt obtains ‘cradle-to-cradle’ certification for its glass-glass solar modules,"From pv magazine Germany
German PV module manufacturer Solarwatt has obtained a “cradle-to-cradle” silver certification for its glass-glass solar modules produced at its facility in Dresden.
The panels are said to be particularly sustainable over the entire cycle and the entire manufacturing process – from material procurement to recycling – is evaluated for certification. Solarwatt claims to be the first German module manufacturer to receive this certification, which responds to the growing demand for products that are sustainably produced in Europe.
“It is important to us that our modules not only deliver clean energy, but are also produced sustainably,” Solarwatt Managing Director Detlef Neuhaus said. “Solarwatt has already set up its production accordingly in recent years and uses 100 percent green electricity. We now wanted to make this commitment visible to our customers and have initiated the demanding certification process.”
The “cradle-to-cradle” certification is considered a globally recognised holistic product quality standard. The assessment is made for five categories: material health, recyclability of materials, energy management and CO2 emissions, water management, and social responsibility.
In addition to ecological aspects, social performance is also evaluated. “In contrast to pure environmental standards, the company’s social responsibility is also considered, for example using the UN Global Compact Self Assessment Tool,” said Annika Beck, Corporate Social Responsibility Manager at Solarwatt.
The certification values the production according to five different evaluation degrees: Basic, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Solarwatt achieved gold in the Energy Management & CO2 Emissions and Water Management categories, and silver in the rest. Ultimately, the lowest certification level achieved in an individual category is decisive for the overall rating.
The certification is awarded by the independent Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. The accredited agency EPEA assessed Solarwatt’s glass-glass solar modules.
