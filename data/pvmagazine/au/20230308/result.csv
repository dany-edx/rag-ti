The bank has reported a 600%-plus surge in its green home lending.
Those loans are for households looking to purchase products like new and used electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, solar hot water, grey water treatment systems, double glazing, energy-efficient white goods, solar batteries, and electric vehicle charging stations.
On the actual home improvement and renovation side, the government backed Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has made a $125 million commitment to support the Commonwealth Bank’s new Green Home Offer, intended to help cut emissions in the housing sector and improve energy efficiency in new and renovated homes.
The reduced-rate Commonwealth Bank loans will be available to customers who build or renovate to meet the new Green Star’ Home Standard requirements established by the Green Building Council of Australia.
The standards include things like installing rooftop solar, heat pump water systems, and achieving energy efficiency to a minimum 7-star Nationwide House Energy Rating. It also includes the absence of gas installation, with household electrification targeted.
“Australia’s residential houses and apartments are responsible for around 23% of overall electricity use and 11% of total carbon emissions nationally,” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy Jenny McAllister said.
McAllister noted the Albanese government is currently developing a National Energy Performance Strategy to further improve household energy performance, as part of a $15.2 million  (USD 9.9 million) investment to look at the demand side of electricity use.
While Australia leads the world in rooftop solar uptake, its houses are notoriously inefficient with standards lagging well behind regions like Europe. Tackling this issue is one of the clearest “low hanging fruits” to drive down emissions, with all the required technologies commercially available today.
The report A Practical Guide to Electrification for Existing Buildings released by the Green Building Council of Australia with the support of the CEFC earlier this year found that transitioning buildings to meet net zero goals and switching to all-electric buildings comes with multiple benefits, including significantly reduced electricity costs for households.
Specifically, the Green Building Council found improved energy efficiency and the installation of rooftop solar reduces household energy bills by at least $800 a year.
Coming back to the Commonwealth Bank green loan program, the $125 million in finance from CEFC supports a discount of up to 0.18% p.a. on standard variable rates over a five-year period, matched by an equal discount provided by the Commonwealth Bank, and applies to the entire home loan.
For example, on a loan balance of $750,000 and with a discount of 0.18% p.a., customers could save about $1,350 in interest in the first year of the loan.
“This latest investment brings our total commitment to green home finance to $350 million since 2020, when the CEFC took the lead in supporting initiatives to boost Australia’s energy efficient housing,” CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth said.
CEFC finance for the CommBank Green Home Offer follows the launch of the Bank Australia Clean Energy Home Loan in 2020 with $120 million in CEFC commitments to support the sustainable housing and a $108.5 million commitment to the Firstmac Green Home Loan in 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/08/next-acquisitions-for-octopus-australias-new-investment-platforms-revealed/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 8, 2023",Next acquisitions for Octopus Australia’s new investment platforms revealed,"Octopus Investments Australia, a subsidiary of the major UK-based Octopus Group, has revealed the next projects it plans to bring into its investment platforms, the first of which is the nearly-completed 180 MW Dulacca Wind Farm in southwest Queensland, which hosts some of Australia’s largest wind turbines. The 43-turbine project is backed by a 70% offtake deal with the Queensland government.
The next projects to be folded in are proposed hybrid projects, the Fulham project in southeast Victoria and Blind Creek in southeast New South Wales, near Canberra. 
Fulham is set to include an 80 MW solar farm coupled with a 120 MWh battery, while the agrisolar Blind Creek project will have up to 350 MW (AC) of solar and nominally a 300 MW / 600 MWh battery.
In an update video, Darren Brown, Octopus’ Co-Head of Investment and Development, noted the company is also working on its first standalone storage asset and hopes to bring that into operation, and the Octopus portfolio, later this year – though that was the extent of the details provided.
All of these projects have or are being developed by Octopus Australia, and it appears that ownership will then pass to investors aggregated by the company’s investment platforms, OREO and OASIS.
To recap, Octopus Australia launched these two platforms mid-2022, one for institutional investors and the other for wholesale investors, to provide funds for a multi-billion-dollar Australian renewable energy portfolio.
The platform for institutional investors, named the Octopus Australia Sustainable Investments (OASIS) Fund, on launch had already secured a $75 million (USD 49 million) commitment from the Commonwealth government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), as well as from superannuation fund Hostplus and Octopus Renewables’ Sky Fund, backed by European institutional investors.
The second fund, named Octopus Renewable Energy Opportunities (OREO), is aimed at wholesale investors and smaller players. Speaking to pv magazine Australia last year, Managing Director Sam Reynolds explained this platform was developed in response to feedback the company received from “sophisticated investors,” including people with high net worths and family offices, who were eager to invest in renewables. 
“Really the only way they could do it was by investing in smaller projects,” Reynolds said. That is, projects sitting around the $20 million mark – and since renewable projects are all about scale, it meant these investors missed out on the juiciest morsels. OREO, Reynolds said, is Octopus’ answer to this conundrum. “It’s an institutional style product but for wholesale investors,” Reynolds said. The minimum ticket to invest in the OREO fund is $25,000.
The investors participating in both the OREO and OASIS funds are then aggregated to create a large pool, which Octopus uses to acquire projects and generate returns.
Key to this is Octopus’ vision of expanding past single-project investments, and instead using the funds to build a diversified portfolio of projects, including large-scale wind, solar and storage.
Generally investors in Australia have put funds into single projects, Reynolds said, “and there’s not much you can do with that site for 35 years.”
“We see that as an okay way to play in the renewable energy space, but we think it’s better to have a portfolio – and that’s what the platform is, a portfolio of assets – wind, solar and storage – that look after the fluctuating nature of renewables but also the fluctuating nature of the daytime energy prices.”
In other words, it leans into the concept of power in diversity, diversifying both its pools of potential investors and the types of renewable projects it holds.
The investment platforms finance the entire renewable energy life cycle from development, through construction and into long-term operations.
Currently, the platforms’ cornerstone asset is the 333 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm, Australia’s largest operational solar project. Located in the south east of NSW, Octopus previously jointly held Darlington Point Solar Farm with Edify Energy before it used the OREO and OASIS funds to acquire the project in its entirety last year.
Darlington Point recently secured second offtake agreement with Smartest Energy Australia, owned by Marubeni – one of the largest infrastructure investments. Smartest Energy has agreed to offtake 25% of Darlington Point’s output, meaning the project is now contracted for 80% of its generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/08/locally-built-hydrogen-tow-trucks-to-be-hauling-in-victoria-from-this-year/,"EV,HYDROGEN,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 8, 2023",Locally built hydrogen tow trucks to be hauling in Victoria from this year,"Hyzon, a US-based startup with executives from Australia, drove its first Australian-built hydrogen fuel cell electric truck out of its Noble Park headquarters in Melbourne’s south-east on Monday, March 6.
The company has been active in Australia for a few years now and is beginning to deliver on its pre-orders, including with RACV’s towing subsidiary, Nationwide. Speaking at the launch, RACV CEO Neil Taylor noted that Nationwide owns 1,000 towing trucks – three of which are now powered by hydrogen, with the commercial trials potentially promising a new zero-emissions future for the fleet.
“We’re making it very clear that we’ve got a product now, the first product that’s been designed locally, that’s ready to go into market,” John Edgley, Hyzon’s Melbourne-based international president, told The Age newspaper. “That will give more confidence that actually we can start transitioning these big fleets in companies that have thousands and thousands of these trucks.”
Hyzon also has orders in from Coregas in New South Wales, Ark Energy in Queensland, and garbage truck company Superior Pak, part of an agreement which sprouted from a hydrogen innovation hub in Bundaberg.

As part of its partnership with RACV, Hyzon is turning its Australian Noble Park headquarters into purpose-built facility to include corporate offices, a showroom, assembly warehousing and workshops. The company is now preparing to break ground on the 10,000-square-metre manufacturing facility, with the early stages of construction having begun.
Hyzon says the facility is expected to generate over a 100 localised engineering and manufacturing jobs by 2025, with “hundreds more indirect jobs expected through the supply chain.”
Hyzon is headquartered in Rochester, New York, but its former CEO and co-founder Craig Knight is Australian, which has presumably led the company to pay attention to Australia’s often overlooked hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) market. The company established its Australian outpost in 2020, and, according to The Age, has now grown its teams to just over 50 engineers, fabricators, welders and designers.

The startup was born from Singapore-based company Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, founded in 2003 and specialising in hydrogen fuel cells. 
Coming back to the company’s new Melbourne base, Hyzon’s team have designed and built their first three trucks over the past year, replacing diesel engines in new Mercedes trucks with hydrogen fuel cells and tanks. The trucks were tested at Holden’s former proving ground in Lang Lang, southeast Melbourne, over summer.
Lead engineer Chris Heraud told The Age the vehicles were designed to be something of a Swiss Army knife of trucks in that they are able to be adapted to fit various applications, from towing to garbage collection.
The use of hydrogen in vehicles has been a hotly debated in Australia, but found a foothold in the heavy vehicle and trucking sector. This is because unlike electric vehicles, which well and truly hold marketshare when it comes to passenger cars, the batteries needed for big trucks are extremely heavy and require downtime to charge. 
This heavy-transport sector has been the sole focus of Hyzon, which has established itself in the US, Europe and Asia. While its trucks are quick to refuel, they cost about three times more than diesel alternatives.
Other countries like Germany, where vehicle manufacturing is central to the economy, are heavily subsiding zero-emissions trucks, but Australia has yet to introduce such measures.

Moreover, the cost of hydrogen – mostly importantly green hydrogen – needs to come down in price and up in commercially available for such technology to be a viable alternative to diesel. There has been no shortage of hydrogen production projects and refuelling station plans across Australia though, with some already coming online and many more in the pipeline.
Hyzon and RACV have said they plan to develop their own solar-powered green hydrogen refuelling station at Noble Park to cater to their fleet.
Australia Post has also launched a six-month zero-emissions truck trial, though it is using a fully electric truck from Volvo, the FL Electric. A smaller version of the truck has been trialled on Australian roads since 2021, with Volvo saying it has recently been given the green light to begin local validation of heavy-duty electric trucks on Queensland roads at weights of up to 42.5 tonne.  

“The truck has been in service for a couple of months now and is performing well,” Australia Post Divisional General Manager South, James Dixon, said. “In this case the FL Electric is an excellent fit for Australia Post.”
“We will continue to push electric vehicles into our fleet where we can to help reduce emissions wherever we can.” 
Australia Post has been using electric vehicles for coming on four years now, though the vast majority deployed to date have been three-wheeled electric delivery vehicles and electric bikes.
The Volvo FL Electric is based at Australia Post’s Redbank Plains Distribution Centre on the outskirts of Brisbane.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/08/raptor-maps-points-to-growing-problem-of-pv-system-underperformance/,"QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MARCH 8, 2023",Raptor Maps points to growing problem of PV system underperformance,"From pv magazine Global
US-based Raptor Maps has published its latest annual report on global PV system underperformance. The solar lifecycle management software specialist performed aerial inspections across 24.5 GW of large-scale solar systems.
The inspection statistics show that solar assets are becoming more anomalous each year. Underperformance due to anomalies nearly doubled from 1.61% in 2019 to 3.13% in 2022, said the company. Power losses have increased by 94% since 2019, it added, noting that anomaly-driven power losses could grow to almost 6% by 2025 at the current rate.
Raptor Maps estimates annual losses of USD 82 million ($123) for the 24.5 GW of assets it inspected in 2022, at an average of an USD 3,350 ($5030) annual loss per megawatt.
“Extrapolating across total global PV capacity (as of the end of 2021, excluding residential) translates to a USD 2.5 billion ($3.75 billion) annual revenue loss for the industry,” the company said.
The report includes data on underperformance by site size and module-level anomalies for the first time. The figures show that smaller sites had the highest average power losses as a percentage of their generation capacity. However, the largest sites exhibited higher average power losses. Sites between 100 MW and 200 MW in size had average power losses of 4.04% – 29% higher than the global average.
“Sites larger than 200 MW are losing, on average, around USD 4,320 per MW, with some sites losing up to USD 12,900 per MW,” claimed Raptor Maps.
The report shows that system-level anomalies are the largest drivers of power losses, with string, inverter, and combiner anomalies affecting the most power as a percentage of total power inspected, at 1.06%, 0.70%, and 0.67%, respectively. String anomalies were reportedly responsible for 34% of lost revenue, while inverter and combiner anomalies were respectively responsible for 22% and 21%.
At the module level, Jinko Solar, First Solar, Trina Solar, Canadian Solar, and Longi were the top five manufacturers of inspected assets. Cell and diode anomalies were the most common module-level and sub-module-level anomalies among these manufacturers, according to Raptor Maps. Combined, the two categories accounted for roughly 70% of observed defects. Physical damage accounted for 18% of defects.
Monocrystalline modules were found to be considerably less defective than polycrystalline and thin film technologies, by 65% and 41%, respectively. The inspected thin-film modules were purportedly more susceptive to physical damage such as cracking, delamination, and warping. They showed three times more physical damage than polycrystalline and 12 times more than monocrystalline. Hot spots were also found much more frequently in thin-film modules than in the other two technologies.
“The report underscores the need for asset owners and managers to monitor equipment performance over time, proactively identifying maintenance issues and warranty claim opportunities,” said Raptor Maps.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/08/five-actions-for-effective-renewables-finance-risk-management/,"INSURANCE,MARKETS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 8, 2023",Five actions for effective renewables finance risk management,"From pv magazine USA
As the renewable energy sector matures, headwinds remain in the ability of project sponsors to identify and analyse risks related to their own projects and present them to their lenders. Insurance broker Marsh shared this view in a whitepaper, explaining that assessments in renewables do not consistently reflect the risks that might be reasonably insured or retained. 
Marsh said that proper risk assessment can reduce the cost and time required to get to financial close while simultaneously lowering a project’s cost of risk over its lifecycle. 
Often, lenders’ insurance requirements do not match risk realities. Marsh said a lack of acknowledged standards in the space leads to inconsistency and undermining project value. It said that new entrants to the market cause issues, as well. 
“Lenders must often prioritise requirements that are ‘customary,’ ‘market,’ or ‘similar’ for the type of project,” wrote Marsh. “However … they frequently fail to account for critical differences in risk identification and analysis methods employed by project sponsors that have a mature risk management approach. This means that they may inadvertently impede efforts to professionally manage insurable risk; or worse, divert investment capital from projects where risk has been effectively managed to those where it has not.” 
Marsh said that in some instances, cost of insurance could exceed 25% of annual operating and maintenance expenses. Lack of proper modelling and a “one-size-fits-all” approach can lead developers to deploy excessive conservatism in insurance, such as applying the 150% of 1-in-500 year loss standard. The firm offers five ways to more properly evaluate risk for renewable project finance. 
1. Identify credible risk identification and risk analysis techniques 
Changing the scope of lender requirements for insurance limits should start with a list of expected documentation that can demonstrate a standard for insurance limit purchasing. Marsh recommends developers put together a list of secondary characteristics as part of their data-gathering process and leverage the additional information to more accurately model the exposure. 
Marsh also recommended multiple GPS coordinates for large-scale operations to map out actual exposure to catastrophic weather events. And developers should leverage an agent’s or broker’s in-house modelling and analytics team to strengthen the argument for more appropriate insurance limits based on actual exposure instead of relying on peer benchmarking. 
2. Employ an internal certified risk management professional 
Risk managers can support your team internally by offering credible risk identification and risk analysis techniques for the project sponsor to carry out. It allows for better collaboration with independent third parties in the deployment of risk assessment techniques. An internal risk manager can provide an increased level of risk management confidence for all involved during the project financing process by implementing more advanced evaluation models. 
3. Reflect on possible conflicts of interest 
Agent or broker conflicts of interest should be considered in risk management strategy. Marsh said developers should consider the trade-offs of different approaches to remuneration and how each method aligns with the company’s values, goals, and practices. Developers should understand, assess and monitor the perspectives and incentives of each risk advisor on remuneration. Peer feedback and credentials reviews can help in this process. 
4. Consider the importance of insurance sufficiency assessments 
Over the past two years as project volumes have ramped up, there have been significant changes in ownership, staffing levels, and the complexity of risk assessment undertaken by project sponsors. Marsh recommends exploring the increasingly diverse and competitive field of independent and broker-affiliated options. It suggests regularly considering the pro’s and con’s of each and monitoring changes. 
5. Perform annual sensitivity analyses 
Buying more insurance with deductible buy-downs, excess catastrophic risk coverage, and other specialty coverages can make the difference between finding project financiers and having them walk away. Insurance products can improve a project’s attractiveness, when used correctly. The length of a renewable project’s life cycle often means that regular sensitivity reviews will be needed to assess whether the coverage remains adequate and efficient. 
“The way forward depends on creating a roadmap that allows for education, open dialogue, and willingness to change, allowing all stakeholders in renewable energy project financing to close deals more efficiently and with the right amount of insurance being purchased on a per-risk, merit basis,” concluded Marsh in the whitepaper.
