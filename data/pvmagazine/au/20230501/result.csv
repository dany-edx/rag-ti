An independent subsidiary of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), AEMO Services said the successful projects include the planned 720 MW New England Solar Farm being built by the Australian arm of Philippines-based clean energy company AC Energy (ACEN) in northern NSW and the company’s proposed 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm, being developed near Dubbo in the state’s central west. Goldwind Australia’s 275 MW Coppabella Wind Farm in the southern Tablelands region was also successful.
German energy giant RWE Renewables has also secured support to build a long-duration lithium-ion battery energy storage system with at least eight hours of storage capacity. The 50 MW/400 MWh big battery is to be built beside the company’s existing 249 MW Limondale Solar Farm near Balranald in the state’s southwest.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said that together, the successful projects would deliver enough electricity to power 700,000 homes and represent more than $2.5 billion in total investment in NSW’s renewable energy infrastructure.
Verschuer said the tender was due to support about 950 MW of new generation, with an output of about 2,500 GWh but the total was exceeded “due to the quality and value of the bids.”
In all, 1,395 MW of capacity will be supported under the tender, involving 4,009 GWh of generation, as well as the eight-hour battery.
“There is clearly a strong appetite for private sector investment in generation, storage and firming assets which capture the enormous economic opportunity of the energy transition, and we’re incentivising that investment through this tender process,” he said, adding that all the projects “have comprehensively demonstrated their financial value to NSW electricity consumers and benefits to their host communities.”

The successful projects have been awarded long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) that will provide revenue certainty for the developers, helping to accelerate a new wave of new large-scale energy infrastructure as the NSW government looks to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
The Roadmap, launched in 2020, sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by 2030 as the state prepares for the exit of its ageing coal-fired generators. Auctions are to be held twice a year until 2030 at least to ensure enough renewables capacity is built to support the transformation of the state’s energy system.
ACEN Australia Chief Executive Officer Anton Rohner said the LTESA’s will allow for greater investment certainty for businesses like ACEN.
“The LTESAs will help encourage investment in the renewables and storage capacity necessary to accelerate the transition to clean, reliable and more importantly, affordable power for Australians”, he said.
“The LTESAs offer the rights to access a minimum price for generation projects over a 20-year timeframe, which protects investors like us from the risk of unexpectedly low wholesale electricity prices.”
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the new generation supported by this tender process meant NSW had now locked in 4.1 GW of its legislated 12 GW of renewables target by 2030, so was one-third of the way there.
“The transition to clean renewable energy in NSW is essential and underway,” she said. “These projects will fill the gap that will be left with the planned closures of coal-fired power stations in the coming decade.”
AEMO Services expects the selected projects to be operational and connected to the grid by as early as 2025.
AEMO Services said the projects remain subject to normal planning approval processes, including community consultation, but social licence criteria – including community benefit sharing, employment and workforce development, local supply chain development, and land use – formed part of the tender assessment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/01/budget-to-deliver-314-million-tax-cuts-to-help-drive-energy-transition/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 1, 2023",Budget to deliver $314 million tax cuts to help drive energy transition,"Australia’s small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) will get a tax break of up to $20,000 for making investments like installing solar panels, batteries and heat pumps, and electrifying their heating and cooling systems under a new policy announced ahead of the release of the Federal Budget later this month.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced the Small Business Energy Incentive at the weekend, saying up to 3.8 million SMEs would benefit from the tax cuts for small businesses that invest in electrification and energy efficiency.
Under the budget policy, businesses with turnover of up to $50 million would be entitled to a bonus 20% tax deduction on solar panels, batteries and other electrical devices when they invest up to $100,000 to swap out fossil fuel energy and technology.
The maximum bonus tax deduction is $20,000 per business, with the initiative expected to cost $314 million over the forward estimates for the next four years.
Eligible assets or upgrades will need to be first used or installed ready for use between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024.

Rewiring Australia co-founder and chief scientist Dr Saul Griffith welcomed the initiative, saying the scheme would help accelerate electrification among Australia’s SMEs and lock in years of benefit for those who seized the opportunity.
Griffith said swapping out fossil-fuelled devices and energy sources for renewable-backed electrification is the fastest, most cost-effective way to decarbonise our domestic economy but will also “permanently lower the cost of business.”
“It embeds thousands of dollars’ worth of annual savings into the annual operations of small businesses, savings that accrue over the long term,” he said.
“Once a business has switched to solar-backed electrification, they never look back.”
Griffith said switching to rooftop solar and electric devices also gives businesses certainty.
“They know their operating costs won’t suddenly surge due to something beyond their control,” he said.
The Federal Budget is due to be delivered on 9 May, 2023.

Meyer Burger said the products available in Australia will be the White, Black and Glass modules, all of which contain heterojunction half-cell solar cells. The manufacturer said the modules achieve efficiencies of up to 21.8% and have an output of up to 400 W.
The White panel measures 1767 x 1041 x 35 mm and weighs 19.7 kg. It is available with wattages ranging from 380 to 400 W and efficiencies between 20.7% and 21.7%. Its temperature coefficient is -0.23% per degree Celsius and the maximum system voltage is 1,000 V. It is made with 120 monocrystalline heterojunction half-cells and 3.2mm antireflective glass.
The Black product has the same weight and dimensions as the white module, as well as its components and electric performance data. It is available in five versions with power ratings between 375 and 395 W and efficiency ranging from 20.4% to 21.5%.
As for the glass-glass version, the module weighs 24.4 kg and measures 1722 x 1041 x 35 mm, its power rating ranges between 370 and 390 W, efficiency up to 21.8%, and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The White and Black products come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. Their average annual degradation is 0.25% for 25 years and 2% in the first year of its lifetime. The output warranty for the glass-glass panel is 30 years and at least 93% of initial performance is guaranteed.
Meyer Burger Australia/New Zealand Country Manager Brendan Kay said Australia, which a new International Energy Agency report confirms has the highest installed PV capacity per capita in the world, provides significant growth opportunities for the manufacturer.
“The Australian solar market, with its high demand for sustainable products manufactured to high social and ethical standards, offers an excellent opportunity for Meyer Burger,” he said.
“With our solar panels, the customer can harvest more solar energy from the rooftop – even at very high temperatures. This advantage is even larger with the glass-glass product, which, when installed appropriately, converts sun into electricity even on the back side with a bifacial efficiency of over 90%.”
The Australian arm of German-headquartered renewable energy developer and solar wholesaler BayWa r.e will serve as the initial distributor of the Meyer Burger panels in Australia.
BayWa Australia Managing Director Durmus Yildiz said he expects the Swiss-designed and German-made panels will “fill an important gap in the Australian market.”
“For us it is particularly important that Meyer Burger is adhering to sustainable manufacturing and sourcing practices, aiming to continuously reduce the carbon footprint of its high-performance modules,” he said.
Meyer Burger will launch its products in the Australian market at the Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition in Sydney commencing Wednesday.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/01/goodwe-to-debut-ultra-lightweight-solar-panel-for-rooftop-installs/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 1, 2023",GoodWe to debut ‘ultra lightweight’ solar panel for rooftop installs,"Chinese manufacturer Goodwe said the new lightweight Galaxy 335 W panel has been developed for rooftops that are unable to support traditional PV and racking, making it possible to install solar on roofs with a low load-bearing capacity.
The Galaxy 335 W solar panels, which will be unveiled at the 2023 Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition in Sydney this week, measure 2,116 mm × 777 mm × 4 mm and weigh 9 kg, or 5.6 kg per m2. The frameless panel is reinforced by 1.6 mm ultra-thin glass which GoodWe said “not only improves the product’s ability to resist strong impact from hail or high winds, but also brings durability and safety to buildings with all-weather protection.”
The new Galaxy panel has a power output of 335 W and a power conversion efficiency of 20.4. The open-circuit voltage is between 29.65 V and the short-circuit current is 13.95 A. The panels have a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius, the operating ambient temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C and the maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
GoodWe offers a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year power output guarantee. It said the panels are able to operate at 82% of their original performance after 25 years and at 80% after 30 years.
The manufacturer said the panels can be installed on a variety of materials, including single ply, concrete and corrugated metal roofing using industry standard silicon-based adhesives and hot-air welding. A bracket is also available that can be used in certain applications, providing an alternative fixing solution and removing the need for intrusive racking.
Goodwe Australia Marketing Manager Apollo Chai PVBM Solutions said the new Galaxy panel, which will be available in the Australian market in the “near future”, provides an ultra-lightweight and weatherproof solution that will allow the install of solar on more rooftops.
“Over 25% of rooftops in Australia cannot be installed with traditional solar panels and mounting systems, due to the risk of weather damage and structural integrity being compromised,” he said. “The Galaxy series of panels is the ideal solution for these scenarios, especially for commercial property owners who are looking for solar solutions to reduce operational costs at a time when energy prices are increasing.”
The new 335 W panel is to be launched at the 2023 Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition to be staged in Sydney this week. The two-day event will commence at the International Convention Centre on Wednesday.
GoodWe Australia Country Manager Dean Williamson said in addition to the debut of the Galaxy series, the company will showcase a range of residential and commercial-scale energy storage solutions at the exhibition.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/01/fraunhofer-ise-produces-hydrogen-via-pem-electrolyser-with-seawater/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"MAY 1, 2023",Fraunhofer ISE produces hydrogen via PEM electrolyser with seawater,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have developed a technical concept and design for a hydrogen generation plant optimised for use at sea. The “OffsH2ore” project aims to define a technically and economically optimised design for an integrated offshore hydrogen production plant using proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, including the transport of the compressed hydrogen gas to land.
The power supply for the electrolysis comes from an offshore wind farm directly connected to a 500 MW electrolysis platform. The platform can produce up to 50,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. Fresh water for the PEM electrolyser is obtained by desalinating seawater using residual heat from electrolysis.
The produced hydrogen is purified and dried, compressed to 500 bar, and transferred to a transport vessel that can carry up to 400 tons of hydrogen from the platform to the mainland. This concept is independent of the hydrogen transport pipeline and offers flexibility in the choice of location.
“The results show that the production of hydrogen directly in the sea with a PEM electrolyser is technically and economically feasible,” explained the scientists.
The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection.
“With the concept presented by the consortium, rapid and large-scale implementation is realistic,” said the researchers.
The concept guarantees the production of hydrogen without territorial competition.
“Offshore hydrogen production offers the opportunity to cover the entire value chain at the national level while decoupling the expansion of offshore wind energy and the expansion of the grid,” said Marius Holst, the project coordinator.
To determine the costs of hydrogen production, the first step was to determine the cost-optimal capacity of the offshore wind farm based on the electrolysis capacity of 500 MW. The minimum hydrogen production costs result from a wind power of 602 MW. In this case, they amount to €5.92/kg ($9.88) with just under 5,000 full charge hours of electrolysis.

Hydrogen production costs increase and full charge hours decrease with lower wind capacity. For example, a wind farm with a capacity of 490 MW results in hydrogen production costs of €6.37 ($10.63)/kg and full load hours of around 4,225 h/a. As a result of the lower wind capacity, the 500 MW electrolysis is significantly oversized and can no longer operate at a nominal load.
The consortium that worked on the project included Fraunhofer ISE, PNE AG as project coordinator, SILICA Verfahrenstechnik GmbH, KONGSTEIN GmbH, and Wystrach GmbH.
Scientists from Australia’s University of Adelaide recently discovered a way to produce hydrogen directly from untreated seawater. For this, they introduced an acid layer on the catalysts in situ.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/01/study-shows-n-type-bifacial-topcon-cells-more-prone-to-degradation-than-p-type/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 1, 2023",Study shows n-type bifacial TOPCon cells more prone to degradation than p-type,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) have conducted a series of damp heat tests to assess the impact, in terms of moisture degradation, of different encapsulation materials on performance losses in bifacial PV modules.
“The purpose of this research was to find an explanation for degradation phenomena observed in small laboratory bifacial module samples after extended damp heat testing,” the research’s lead author, Paul Sommeling, told pv magazine.
In the study “Corrosion effects in bifacial crystalline silicon PV modules; interactions between metallisation and encapsulation,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the scientists made a comparison between three encapsulant materials used in PV module production: ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyolefin elastomers (POE) and thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO).
The research group said it observed in previous studies that POE and TPO, unlike EVA, do not release any acidic components, which means they may perform better than EVA with respect to acid-induced corrosion. However, there is no proven evidence yet that these materials may actually result in increased module durability in the field, as it takes a long time before relevant field degradation can be observed.
Through damp heat testing with a duration of up to 2,500 h, the academics compared the performance of the three materials in glass-encapsulant-cell-encapsulant-glass-based laminates without the use of an edge sealant.
“Commercially available n- or p-type bifacial cells (TOPCON and PERC respectively) have been used to build these laminates, which have subsequently been tested in a climate chamber under damp heat conditions (85 C/85% relative humidity),” they explained. “Current-voltage (IV) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements have been conducted at 500 h intervals to follow the change of laminate characteristics over time.”
They used a technique known as “coring” to enable post-mortem analyses of all samples tested. For this, they used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to analyse the effects of the tests on the solar cell surface. All encapsulants were tested according to the IEC 61215 PV standard and beyond, with extended testing time.
According to the research group, the testing showed that hydrophobic and chemically inert TPO encapsulants provided the highest degree of protection against moisture-induced degradation compared to EVA and POE. It also indicated that front-side metallisation of the n-type TOPCon cells tested is more prone to acid- or moisture-induced degradation than their p-type counterparts.
“This front-side metallisation of TOPCon cells degraded faster than the rear-side metallisation and also faster than the metallisation of PERC cells in EVA-based laminates,” the scientists emphasised. “We attribute those differences to the different compositions of the cell metallisation applied.”
They concluded that the main factor causing delamination of the metal grid is the degradation of lead glass probably, which they said is part of the cell metallisation grid and contains lead oxide (PbO). 
“These results are partly surprising,” Sommeling said. “Corrosion effects in PV are known and have been reported in the literature studying both the effects after field exposure and after accelerated testing in the laboratory.”
He also explained that the most severe corrosion problems are to a large extent related to the release of acetic acid from EVA, the most widely used encapsulating material in PV panels. The acid causes corrosion of cell metallisation and/or tabbing material or solder joints. Currently, EVA is being replaced by alternatives that do not release any acidic compounds and this helps to prevent a lot of problems related to corrosion.
“The surprising or ‘new’ aspects described in our paper consider the quite striking differences observed between different types of metallisation and different solar cells with respect to corrosion behaviour, which can be correlated to different compositions of the cell metallisation,” Sommeling added. “Also without acids present, corrosion still can occur just by the influence of moisture and again this is widely varying between the different types of metallisation applied.”
“It can be concluded that the specific combination of the n-type TOPCon solar cells studied in our paper in combination with EVA is probably a higher risk one, compared to other combinations of cell types and encapsulants,” Sommeling affirmed. “Application of EVA in combination with relatively high corrosion susceptible metallisation should and can actually be avoided. Alternatively, if the more corrosion-resistant metallisation types identified can be applied to TOPCon solar cells, this should also help in building more corrosion-resistant n-type PV panels.”
