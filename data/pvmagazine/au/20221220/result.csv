The substation is to help support the operations of FFI’s manufacturing centre, on which construction commenced in February.
At the time, FFI said stage one of the $114 million electrolyser facility will be expanded as demand indications crystallise, though there are already several stages planned with a vision to manufacture not only electrolysers but cables, batteries, wind turbines and solar panels. Billionaire Andrew Forrest is behind FFI, which is vying to become a global leader in the burgeoning green hydrogen industry.
The electrolyser facility will have an initial capacity of 2 GW per annum, and will help FFI reach its staggering target of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030.
FFI previously said: “The first electrolysers manufactured at the facility in early 2023 are earmarked to be used in Queensland at FFI’s proposed green hydrogen to ammonia project at Gibson Island” – but with early 2023 just weeks away, it doesn’t seem the facility is going to hit those manufacturing timeframes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/20/australias-largest-electrified-bus-depot-goes-into-operation-in-sydneys-west/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EV,SUSTAINABILITY,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 20, 2022",Australia’s largest electrified bus depot goes into operation in Sydney’s west,"With 55 electric buses, a sizeable rooftop solar array, an onsite battery and decent charging infrastructure, Leichhardt in Sydney’s inner west is now home to a “blueprint” bus depot.
Public transport company Transit Systems, along with partners Zenobē Energy, a UK-based battery storage group, and network operator TransGrid, say the depot is an Australian-first at this scale.
The $36 million (USD 24 million) project illustrates that an electric bus fleet requires less charging than was forecast. “With regenerative braking, the buses often come back to the depot with a significant amount of charge still available – this is obviously fantastic as it reduces the load on the recharging infrastructure,” Transit Systems COO Greg Balkin said. 
“It also means less downtime for the buses and we can adopt changes within our network planning to maximise route and energy efficiencies,” he said. 
As part of the electric depot project, a 388 kW rooftop solar array has been commissioned alongside a 1.25 MW / 2.5 MWh Tesla battery system.
The depot boasts five 120 kW DC fast chargers and 31 AC 80 kW chargers. The depot has also been fitted out with smart charging software to monitor the buses, charging rates, solar consumption, battery discharge and overall electricity flows.
“This is by far Australia’s largest electrified depot and paves the way for Transport for NSW to reach their target and electrify all 8,000 buses across the network, using the latest technology,” Balkin said. 
The depot received $24.5 million from Australia’s government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation and a further $5 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.
In mid-December, the NSW Transport Minister David Elliott announced the state government would open $3 billion in funding to help 11 existing depots across Sydney to be converted for electric charging.
With the funding, the government is moving towards its vision of having more than 1,200 new buses manufactured under its zero-emission buses program, as it eventually seeks to replace its entire fleet with electric vehicles.
Given the announcement, where NSW stands on hydrogen buses is somewhat unclear. In 2021, Tim Stock, project director of hydrogen and clean energy at the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, said a “good portion” of the state’s bus fleet would be powered by green hydrogen by 2030.

The official honour – and Guinness World Record certificate – will be conferred once timing information and car telemetry data has been analysed and confirmed by a team of experts.

The car, designed and built by students involved in UNSW’s Sunswift program, posted a time of 11 hours 53.32 minutes for the 1,000 km distance at the Australian Automotive Research Centre in Wensleydale, Victoria.
Th Sunswift Racing team is headed up by Richard Hopkins, who won four F1 world titles at his former post as Head of Operations at Red Bull, and has a big vision for the Sunswift program at UNSW. Intent on bringing research into broad and commercial applications, the Sunswift program today has a host of partnerships and sub-projects.
Hopkins says this world record shows what is possible and what can be achieved, albeit with a significant weight advantage over road legal cars which require features like airbags and air conditioning – components the Sunswift 7 car, built to race, has done away with.

The Sunswift 7 car weighs just 500 kg, about one quarter that of a Tesla, and boasts high efficiencies because of its aerodynamic design, motors and drive chain.
“During this record, the energy consumption was just 3.8 kWh/100km, whereas even the most efficient EVs on the road today only achieve a rating of 15kWh/100km and the average is around 20kWh/100km,” Hopkins added.

Five of those are in operation, three under construction, and three in detailed design and procurement, the companies say, with Yes Group adding it has identified a further 70 MW to 100 MW of projects to deliver across SA, NSW and Victoria in the coming three years.
The companies are focusing on the mid-scale sector, particularly projects around the 5 MW mark, which dodges some of the major risks the utility-scale segment is prone to. In Australia, renewable projects smaller than 5 MW pass through a different approval process, and can avoid a more protracted and precarious grid connection process. 
“These small projects enable us to get assets into the market faster and it provides us with a diversified and scalable platform,” Patrizia’s head of infrastructure for Australia and Asia, Saji Anantakrishnan, said.
Over the last five years, Yes Group says it has developed and constructed over 120 solar farms in the sub-5 MW market, though it would appear it has just contracted on these projects rather than owning and operating the assets as it does with the joint SEI portfolio.

This sub-5 MW strategy is growing in traction, and has been deployed by companies like Green Gold Energy. Speaking during the 2022 All Energy Conference in Melbourne, the team at Green Gold said it can take just six to 12 months to develop and realise these mid-scale projects, with the company noting the ease of development makes them valuable assets.
The play revolves around owning many small assets which can be developed easily and quickly instead of reaching capacity through big utility-scale projects, a path unfortunately littered with collapsed contractors and developers left with massively blown out projects.
The Woods Point solar-plus-storage project near Murray Bridge was opened by South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas. 
The project comprises 9,000 bi-facial Risen Solar panels on a Nextracker framing system, coupled with a 2.5 MWh battery storage system.
The project is one of three solar-plus-storage projects opening in South Australia in December, with the other two being commissioned in Port Wakefield and Padthaway.

These three projects will generate 27 GWh of solar and store 3 GWh of energy, the companies say.
In two years of partnership, SEI and Yes Group have invested $90 million (USD 60 million) for 50 MW of projects across SA and NSW. Five of those projects with 20 MW of capacity are now in operation, and another two projects in SA and four projects in NSW are slated for completion in 2023.
The partners plan to invest a further $200 million to develop 70 MW to 100 MW of projects across Australia’s east in the coming years.
SEI was established in 2018 by German-headquartered Patrizia on behalf of institutional investors who purchased a portfolio of established energy assets from AGL.

LiTime has developed a new lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery storage system for residential rooftop PV projects.
“The 12 V 100 Ah Smart battery is an all-in-one LiFePO4 battery specifically designed for home solar energy storage, trolling motors, RVs, and more off-grid applications,” said the Chinese battery manufacturer.
The system has a nominal voltage of 12.8 V and a capacity of 100 Ah. It measures 274 mm x 206.5 mm x 205 mm. It comes with a five-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 4,000 cycles.
“The low-temperature cutoff charging feature adds extra protection over the battery under freezing temperatures for a longer lifespan while allowing users to force charging for emergency use,” said LiTime.
The device features one-touch control battery (OTCB) technology. The company says this can provide turn-on and turn-off functionality, as well as sleep mode activation and low-temp force charging. It is selling the devices for USD 479.99 ($715).
“It is one of the rare LiFePO4 lithium batteries that support both series and parallel connections on the market, so users can have more flexibility to customise power banks of different capacities,” it said.

EIL said it has secured a contract from Adani’s Mundra Solar Technology unit to serve as owner’s engineer for the group’s new polysilicon and monosilane (SiH4) project in the Indian state of Gujarat.
Polysilicon is the primary component to make photovoltaic panels. Globally, polysilicon production is concentrated in China and the United States. Monosilane is a gaseous compound used to produce polysilicon.
India’s ambitious solar power generation target implies that the country will need significant capacity to make PV components, in order to meet demand. However, the nation still lacks polysilicon manufacturing capacity and is dependent on imports.
As part of its strategic plan, Adani aims to have 10 GW of polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing capacity up and running by 2025. The group, which already manufactures cells and modules, recently unveiled its India-made silicon ingots.
“[Polysilicon production] would be a step toward realizing the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” said EIL. “This would also contribute towards nation’s target of net zero by 2070.”
