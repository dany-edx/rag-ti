Contracted by Lendlease, the two projects use a specialised ‘Capacity Forecasting System’ which the company says allows the solar farms to make 30 minute forecasts with 99% accuracy.
That is, the system promises “scheduled solar” by combining new energy management technology with environmental monitoring and a battery that need only be a fraction of the solar farm’s capacity.
“We think we’ve cracked the problem to make solar investible in the NT [Northern Territory],” Proa Managing Director, Victor Depoorter, tells pv magazine Australia. “This is the most advanced solution that has been developed to date, as far as we know… to manage the variability and uncertainty of solar at the generator level.”
Since the amount of time spent on real life testing in the commissioning of the two NT solar remains limited, Depoorter adds: “We want to have a little bit of caution still, but the results we’ve been seeing in recent months have been really, really exciting.”
Three years ago, Proa began building on its experience in solar forecasting, management and monitoring to enable solar farms to meet the strict export rules set out in the Northern Territory’s Generator Performance Standard.
This standard came into effect in 2020, introduced by the Power and Water Corporation, the Territory’s government-owned utility and primary electricity distributor.
These rules, specifically section 3.3.5.17, basically require solar farms in NT to operate like scheduled generators would in Australia’s grid, the National Electricity Market (NEM). That is, whatever a solar farm commits to generate in the next 30 minute dispatch interval, they actually have to satisfy. 
“It’s not like for semi-scheduled generators in the NEM where you can go above or below your dispatch target… depending on cloud cover,” Depoorter explains. In the NT, “whatever you promised, you have to do. And if you don’t, then you are not conforming with the rules.”
“It’s putting the bar really high for solar,” Depoorter says. Such a high bar that numerous solar farms like Batchelor 1 and 2, and Manton have been sitting idle for over three years, exporting nothing to the NT’s two islanded grids. Thanks to sizeable battery storage additions, other solar farms have been able to officially connect, but are reportedly still not dispatching.
The reason NT solar farms are not given the same flexibility as those connected into the national grid comes down to size. “The grid in the Northern Territory is a lot smaller than the NEM and a single generator could cause some serious instability to that grid. So the relative responsibility of single generators in that grid is a lot more significant and that responsibility has kind of been put on the generator’s side,” Depoorter says.
This is especially problematic because the Territory seriously lags behind the rest of Australia in terms of the share of renewable energy in its grids. According to the Clean Energy Council’s 2022 Clean Energy Australia Report, renewables are set to account for just 23% of consumption on the Darwin Katherine grid and 14% in Alice Springs by 2030, if current trends continue – well short of the Territory’s 50% target.
Proa has long worked in the space of solar forecasting, developing a system that relies on four different technologies, including skycams, satellites, live data and numerical simulations, to make predictions.
Its Capacity Forecasting System, however, builds significantly on this original technology – basically wrapping this system into an energy management platform that is capable of making bidding decisions. 
This system needs to be combined with some firming capacity, like a battery, because the nature of solar energy is heavily weather-dependent. However, the battery need only have 20% to 40% of the solar farm’s capacity, Depoorter says, with just half an hour of storage duration.
“At the end of the day, we are replacing lithium with smarts,” Depoorter says. Proa’s system relies on intelligent decision making to generate bids dynamically as function of the weather conditions and the batteries firming capacity.
“There is always a little bit of spillage if you have a small battery,” Depoorter notes. If there are really big ramps, solar farms need to pre-curtail to a level they will be able to satisfy as per the capacity forecasts. “So the peak in the solar price will get shaves, if you will,” Depoorter says.
“But even with the sort of proposal I was mentioning before [batteries sized to 20% of solar capacity], you can achieve very high solar utilisation rates, in the order of 85 to 95%.”
The company is currently in the process of making its Capacity Forecasting System solution commercially available to the market.
Depoorter says Proa’s tool changes the paradigm around forecasting by creating certainty. “It’s not about being accurate anymore, it’s just about being certain.”
Using the technology, solar projects can commit to their generation with a really high degree of certainty. “When you do that, then you can really start making operational decisions on that [information],” Depoorter says.
“Solar forecasting is the art of trying to be the least wrong possible, or trying to provide the best guess of what the future looks like in different timescales… there is always uncertainty attached to those forecasts which mean that, in an operational context, it has always been treated with a touch of caution.”
Basically, forecasting has predominantly been seen as useful, but has had only a moderate impact on decision making by generators and market operators.
“But in the case of the NT, our system is basically the heart of the solar farm,” Depoorter says. “If the Capacity Forecasting Systems stops, the whole plant stops.”
“This project we’ve been working on is really kind of changing the role of forecasting, at least for solar generators.”
Depoorter believes the technology could have applications well beyond the Northern Territory as well. Microgrids are definitely a space the company will eventually investigate, he said. 
As solar penetration increases throughout the globe, the need for generation certainty will also grow, Depoorter predicts. At one stage, all solar farms in Australia were non-scheduled. Now, projects above 30 MW have to be semi-scheduled. The renewably-driven future, he says, may require more scheduling again.
“Scheduled solar sounds like quite a good idea in general terms.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/06/urgent-action-required-to-become-green-hydrogen-superpower/,"HYDROGEN,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",Urgent action required to become green hydrogen superpower,"It’s an investment of at least $500 billion (USD 370 billion) in electrification, renewable hydrogen and smart energy manufacturing and innovation.
Just as it’s a fillip for climate action in the US, it’s also a major barrier to smart energy manufacturing in our country, Australia. It is a direct threat to Australia’s green hydrogen hopes because it is directing investment away from Australia to the US.
Australia must counter the Inflation Reduction Act if it wants to become a green hydrogen superpower.
The 2019 National Hydrogen Strategy made the big, bold, audacious goal that Australia should become ‘a global leader in clean hydrogen by 2030’. The Strategy is currently under review and there is no less ambition from the federal, state and territory governments.
Rightly so, when there is a $1.4 trillion market by 2050 at stake, according to recent analysis by Deloitte. Clean hydrogen capacity can grow to “170 megatonnes of hydrogen equivalent in 2030 and 600 Mt H2eq in 2050,” said Deloitte in its 2023 Global Green Hydrogen Outlook. Australia’s 2022 State of Hydrogen Report identified over 100 local projects in the pipeline, including eight gigawatt-scale projects. Even conservative analysis focusing on replacing fossil gas with renewable hydrogen to make green ammonia in Australia still means potentially hundreds of billions of new clean energy investment.
Sadly, Australia’s green hydrogen ambition is not being matched with real action. Australia’s largest renewable hydrogen plant is the Tonsley $14.5 million, 1.25 MW hydrogen project in South Australia. Only a single project with a capacity of 10 MW has reached financial close. Australia is not on the path to be a global leader.
The Biden administration passed the US Inflation Reduction Act (IR Act) last year. It includes more than USD 370 billion ($570 billion) in direct assistance and will drive trillions of dollars in new investment into the US. The IR Act is providing tradable tax credits for hydrogen production that can be combined with tax credits for related renewable energy production and end use cases. Importantly, it creates a system of cascading incentives along the supply chain to substantially reduce the costs and make the US a global clean energy manufacturing superpower.
The IR Act is welcome and critical to decarbonising one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world. Literally trillions of US dollars, are being crowded into the US economy as direct result of the IR Act. “Simply put, the IRA is a game changer for Bloom,” said KR Sridhar, Founder and Chairman of the leading electrolyser company Bloom Energy. It is also having a tremendous impact around the globe as countries including China, Canada, South Korea, India and the EU scramble to put in response measures to stop capital leaving their countries and going to the US.
Australia’s own rush to build renewable energy fast enough to replace tired, old, failing power stations is being hamstrung by the US clean energy push. “It’s a material threat to us,” said Dr Guy Debelle, recently departed Fortescue Future Industries executive.
Talent, especially Australian leading engineers, is being lured to America. “We need 60,000 more graduate engineers in the next 10 years to just replace those that we think will retire,” said Jane MacMaster of Engineers Australia. “Local universities now only produce about 7,500 graduates annually,” MacMaster said. 
On behalf of its green hydrogen members, Zero Carbon Hydrogen Australia (a division of the Smart Energy Council) released a detailed response to the IR Act at the Smart Energy Queensland Conference on 5 September 2023. 
“Australia cannot rest on what has been started in the last 18 months when it comes to building and sustaining a renewable hydrogen industry,” CEO John Grimes said. “We need bold, urgent and dramatic action to raise our collective efforts to respond to the US IR Act and not miss this fantastic opportunity for our country,” he added.

The $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program being focused on only supporting renewable hydrogen and its derivatives is very welcome. “A down payment of our response to the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Minister Chris Bowen earlier this year.
Australia now needs supporting policy measures to ensure we build momentum and get our green hydrogen sector thriving. We need tax credits, similar to the US, for production of renewable hydrogen and derivatives including green ammonia and green iron. 
A critical advantage of US-style tax credit approach is that it provides and immediate investment incentive. Government grant programs and auctions such as the Headstart program invariably take years of design, consultation and tender processes – usually prior to the time taken for a specific project to then reach financial close.
We’ve had the down payment, now it’s time for a renewable hydrogen tax credit scheme.

It is the first time the range from 6.3 kW and 8 kW has been dethroned on price.
Managing director of solar and storage analyst, Warwick Johnston, told pv magazine Australia the shift is likely down to increased competition. That is, 6.6 kW solar systems have traditionally been the mainstay for solar installers in Australia, so those selling different sized systems had less competition.
“Now people have cottoned on, finally, to the [10+ kW] market being as almost as large as the 6.6 kW market,” Johnston said. Now with significantly more installers selling in this 10 kW plus market, competitive pressure has increased, he added. “Plus, people have got more experience in how to install those jobs.”
Another noteworthy trend emerging from Australia’s solar market is that leads continue to spike despite less customers proactively seeking out installations.
“Customers aren’t going out and searching for solar anymore than they used to, but there are definitely lots more leads flowing through,” Johnston said.
“I haven’t seen such a strongly defined difference before,” he added. That is, a significant spike in leads and no corresponding upturn in say, Google searches and other interest indicators. 
As Johnston noted:  “Put an ad in front of them, and they’ll respond.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/06/global-flow-battery-market-to-grow-at-22-8-annually/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2023",Global flow battery market to grow at 22.8% annually,"From pv magazine Global
The global flow battery market will expand from USD 289 million ($453 million) in 2023 to USD 805 million ($1.26 billion) by 2028, growing at around 22.8% annually during this period, according to a new report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.
The report said the market will be driven by increasing investments in renewable energy and flow batteries’ advantages over conventional products. Flow batteries are gaining traction across various applications due to their unique benefits.
The report forecasts the hybrid flow battery segment to grow significantly during the forecast period. “The zinc-bromine hybrid battery stands out for its higher energy density than other flow battery designs. Hybrid designs are gaining prominence due to the elevated cost of vanadium material extraction. Research initiatives have focused on developing compact and cost-effective hybrid systems, with some players commercialising these batteries for utilities, commercial, residential, and other applications,” it added.
The utilities application is projected to dominate the market throughout the forecast period. Flow batteries are the preferred energy storage technology for utility-based storage due to their cost-effective ability to store renewable energy for future grid usage. The utility sector leads in operational flow battery projects globally.
The market in Asia Pacific is expected to grow the fastest during the forecast period. Nations like China, Japan, India, and Australia are striving to enhance large-scale energy storage capacities, boosting electric stability. Regulatory reforms, modernisation initiatives, and robust demand for efficient battery technologies are driving this growth.
