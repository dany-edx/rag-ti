It will do so by aggregating a fleet of residential renewable energy assets into a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) which will be coordinated with network capacity to help grid stability while also providing returns for participants.
The pilot will involve around 500 customers with over 900 distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar, battery storage and major appliances like air conditioners and electric hot water systems. It is expected to run until June 2023.
State-owned retailer Synergy has begun recruiting eligible customers in Southern River and its neighbouring Piara Waters and Harrisdale suburbs, which have been chosen to host the trial because rooftop solar penetrations in the districts are close to 50%.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has pitched in $8.6 million for Project Symphony, with AEMO contributing $7.6 million, and Western Australia’s McGowan government fronting $19.3 million. The “pre-commercial” pilot will unfold in two stages, the later of which will see “additional DER assets… brought online through the involvement of third-party aggregators,” the government’s statement somewhat opaquely said. 
It added that the funding for Project Symphony “will go towards the development, integration and testing of software systems that manage energy distribution, market operation and market aggregation. Together, these will underpin the effective monitoring and coordination of a high volume of mostly customer DER assets.”
The launch of the trial comes just a day after the state became the second in Australia to give network operators the capacity to remotely switch off residential solar systems as an emergency grid stability mechanism.
From February of next year, all new and upgraded solar PV systems with an inverter capacity of 5kW or less will need to have the capacity to be remotely turned down or off in emergency situations, which the government said would be a measure of  “last resort” for when electricity demand reaches critically low levels and affects the stability of the South West Interconnected System, Western Australia’s main island grid. 
Faced with an already high and rapidly growing fleet of distributed resources, the Western Australian government is clearly looking for ways to manage its assets so they don’t need to be curtailed – with VPP aggregation possibly part of this solution. 
Virtual Power Plants, or VPPs, are essentially software platforms that connect the capacity of distributed home batteries  and join their forces so they have enough power to meaningfully engage in lucrative spot and services markets. Through a VPP, a home battery goes from being a solar shifting device to an electron trading platform that can generate a profit for its owners.
As seems to be the focus of the West Australian government though, VPPs also help balance electricity supply and demand by storing excess energy and adjusting how much energy is being used in real time.
“Without appropriate coordination of DER, network operators may be required to curtail DER output to manage constraints. Project Symphony aims to address these issues and highlight the benefits that orchestration can provide to consumers and the energy system,” ARENA CEO Darren Miller said.
“Virtual Power Plants could be the future for electricity in WA,” WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston added.
“We currently have power stations, at the edge of our networks, with lots of wires carrying high voltages hundreds of kilometres. But in the future, houses will become the power station through their rooftop solar,” the minister said.
Project Symphony will build on previous trials run by Western Power and Synergy. It will also build on knowledge gathered from eastern Australian states, where VPP programs are already fairly well established, especially in South Australia. The West Australian government has previously said it intends adapt this know-how for “local conditions.”

Since the majority of C&I spaces are rented, their vast rooftops are often left untapped with landlords unwilling to fork out for solar which primarily benefits tenants. 
Green Peak Energy’s model then is to itself fund the installation, operation and maintenance costs for renewable energy systems and sell the electricity they generate behind the meter to the space’s tenant, often offering the building’s landlord rent for its rooftop.
The model has drawn the attention of U.S. company CBRE Investment Management (CBRE IM) which has a whopping US$133.1 billion (AU$186.3 billion) under management and advice. Precisely how much of its portfolio the global giant plans to invest in Green Peak Energy has not been disclosed, and is unlikely to be made public due to confidentiality agreements, pv magazine Australia has been told. Nonetheless, the deal – which will see CBRE IM invest in the company’s Australian behind-the-meter renewable energy platform, provide it with credit for projects, as well as become a shareholder (though this aspect of the deal remains subject to further regulatory approvals) – was described by Green Peak’s CEO Myles Carrucan as “a huge moment”.
“CBRE IM’s investment in the business brings on board both a financial and strategic partner that will help accelerate the rollout of Green Peak Energy’s high quality on-site clean energy projects across Australia and the region,” Carrucan said.
For CBRE IM, Green Peak Energy provides an avenue into both the Asia Pacific region and into Australian corporates’ push towards sustainability fuelled by increased importance of ESG reporting. “The investment in Green Peak Energy provides an attractive opportunity to invest in the burgeoning behind-the-meter solar space for commercial & industrial clients in Australia and the broader APAC region,” Asif Hussain, a Managing Director with CBRE IM in its Toronto office, said. 
“We see strong tailwinds in this sector with C&I customers increasing their focus on lowering their carbon footprint and adopting behind-the-meter renewable energy solutions. The Green Peak Energy team has built a strong business delivering PPA solutions to help lower the energy costs of their customers,” Hussain added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/01/most-australian-households-are-well-positioned-for-electric-vehicles-and-an-emissions-ceiling-would-help/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 1, 2021",Most Australian households are well-positioned for electric vehicles – and an emissions ceiling would help,"We found most car-owning households will be able to charge their cars in their garage or driveway. Electric vehicles are also getting more attractive as purchase costs fall and battery range rises.
Australia’s world-beating solar uptake is another plus. Many of our three million solar households would be able to effectively charge their cars for free at daytime.
Surveys have found 56% of Australians would consider going electric with their next car purchase, while the share of consumers who would not purchase an electric car is declining quickly.
The shift will not be sudden and disruptive but gradual, as people trade in their old petrol clunkers for sleek new electric vehicles. Many will buy an electric car for everyday driving, while holding onto a petrol or diesel SUV for longer trips. No weekends need be sacrificed.
About half of Australia’s car-owning households live in houses with off-street parking and own more than one car. These households will be the first to shift to electric cars.
Almost all owners charge their electric vehicles at home. For most houses with off-street parking, charging a vehicle is as simple as getting an electrician to check your wiring and install an outlet in your garage or near your driveway. In most cases installation isn’t expensive.

Some households will install a small charger on the wall of their garage to speed up the charging process, which will mean they can completely charge their electric vehicle overnight.
But what about range anxiety and sticker shock, two issues many consumers cite?
While surveys still show drivers worry about battery range for electric vehicles, the underlying technology is improving year by year. As batteries get better and cheaper, these issues will fade into memory. Technology isn’t standing still.
 
This year, for instance, electric vehicles came on market in Australia with a battery range of up to 650km, and on average 400km. That’s more than enough for common weekend round trips, such as Melbourne to Phillip Island (280km), Sydney to Kiama (260km), or Brisbane to Sunshine Coast (200km).
While everyone knows running an electric vehicle is cheaper than petrol or diesel – due to much cheaper energy and vastly reduced maintenance costs – the upfront cost has to date been a deterrent. That, too, is changing.
The cost of an electric car is falling. Price parity in many market segments should be reached by the mid 2020s. That means one-car households who currently rely on utes or 4WDs for weekend trips will be able to easily switch in time to contribute to our target of net-zero by 2050 target.
Not only that, but our research has found the number of public electric vehicle chargers has soared to more than 2500 standard chargers. There are now almost 500 fast chargers, which can get your electric vehicle back to 80% charged in under an hour.

For us to reach net zero by 2050, we need electric vehicles to make up an increasing share of Australia’s cars. The federal government is belatedly embracing the technology as part of the new 2050 target.
While Australia is increasingly ready to shift, at present electric vehicles still make up less than 1% of new car sales. By contrast, Norway will sell its last fossil fuel-powered car next year if current trends hold.
At present, many manufacturers have skipped Australia entirely to focus on more attractive markets, leaving us with a limited range and older models.
So what needs to happen? As our report explains, the best way to bring down prices and increase the variety of electric vehicles is for the federal government to introduce an “emissions ceiling” on new vehicles.
This ceiling would limit the average emissions from vehicles and encourage manufacturers to bring Australia’s electric vehicle range up to par with the rest of the world.
Do these policies work? In a word, yes. Countries with emissions ceilings in place have a much wider range of electric vehicles for sale. Last year there were only 31 zero-emissions vehicles for sale in Australia, compared to more than 130 in the United Kingdom.
If we had an emissions ceiling in place, drivers would find it easier to switch to electric vehicles, as more choice brings cheaper cars and a wider range. Of course, no one would be forced to shift. Those who want to wait for an electric ute or SUV will be able to.

While people who own detached homes with off-street parking will find it easier to switch to electric cars, Australians who rent or live in apartments may find it harder or more expensive to get a charger installed at home.
Once homeowners with offstreet parking begin to shift to electric vehicles, charging will get easier for everyone else. Why? Because the increase in electric vehicles will prompt commercial operators to add more and more public chargers in accessible locations. The federal government’s Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy also has plans to close gaps in the network.
If you want a glimpse of the future, look at South Korea. There, companies are building ultra-fast charging stations as a replacement for petrol stations, offering recharging in under 20 minutes and a cafe to fill the time. In the near future we’ll use clean, fume-free charging stations like these in the same way we use petrol stations today.
As a bonus for switching, the air in our cities will become ever cleaner, and traffic noise will plummet.
Even if our leaders drag their feet on electric cars, we don’t need to. Australians are ready to swap petrol for electric. And we’ll never look back.

The lithium-iron-phosphate battery is sonnen’s first outdoor home battery solution and has 10 kWh of usable storage capacity, includes backup power, a black start feature, and boasts easy installation.
Nathan Dunn, who has been the CEO and Managing Director of sonnen Australia since 2018, last year took on the global position of Chief Commercial Officer at sonnenGroup, meaning one of the German company’s highest ranking executives is now based Sydney, Australia. Dunn said with the Evo battery, sonnen is shifting towards a more responsive product development strategy and moving away from its earlier centralised approach. 
“The fact we’re talking sonnenBatterie Evo is the influence the team has been able to have over the global development process,” Dunn told pv magazine Australia. “Instead of designing products which we think will work, what we should be doing is asking markets and people who will be using the products: ’what do you need?’”
“Thinking about the development of our products going forward, there is a distinct possibility that sonnenBatterie Evo will be the basis by which new devices get designed,” Dunn added.

Unlike Europe, Australian standards mean many residential batteries installed here are mounted outside the home. Until now though, sonnen has only offered indoor rated devices – obviously limiting its potential.
“The market has been telling us for a while now that the European designed devices that we’ve been selling in the marketplace may not be the best suited for the environment,” Dunn said. “It’s important that we actually look at the market requirements for Australia and develop products that better fit.” Its new Evo battery addresses this key issue, adhering to the IP56 outdoor rating so the battery can be installed both outdoors or indoors, also complying with the AS/NZS 5139 standard.
“The other piece of feedback we’ve been getting is that it would be nice for sonnen to have a higher output from a backup perspective, so we’ve shifted to 5 kW continuous and 7 kW surge [capacity],” Dunn said. “The device fits in the sweet spot from a kilowatt hours perspective, so it’s 11 kWh and 10 useable kWh.” 
Given that energy insecurity is among the leading reasons Australians install home batteries, Evo also features a ‘black start’ function, meaning it can reboot an AC coupled PV system in case of a blackout. “Black start is not a new development for sonnen, but we made sure we got it into sonnenBatterie Evo because… we wanted people to be able to take full advantage [if] the grid goes down,” Dunn said.
The Evo battery has also been designed with installation in mind. Its integrated power unit gets shipped inside the battery cabinet “so all the installer has to do is run a few cables to connect it and then install the battery modules,” Dunn said. This, he added, also makes the batteries easier to service, should anything go wrong. 
Dunn said sonnen plans to “hold market price” for its new Evo battery, keeping it “relatively the same” as older generations. 
While retail prices vary between installers and states, he said customers should be looking at something between $12,000 to $14,000 for the fully installed battery which comes with a 10 year warranty.

With decades of experience under his belt including roles at Enphase, LG Electronics, and General Electric (GE), Dunn echoed a widely-shared sentiment that Australia is an ideal launchpad for fresh products. “Australia was always seen as a great test market for new products,” he said.
Beta installs of the sonnenBatterie Evo have been happening in Adelaide, Dunn said, during which  time the city has weathered massive storms preceded by temperatures of 36°C. “The conditions of the environment down here definitely do a good job of testing the sturdiness of products you want to launch.”
Beyond physicality though, Evo’s launch is consequential for sonnen conceptually. The company has pulled on its considerable resources in the development of the battery. “We as a business here in Australia didn’t do it in isolation,” Dunn said. “We’ve got an R&D facility in the U.S. who have had a big hand in pulling this together. We’ve then leveraged the R&D and production team in Germany and the team locally have been very focused on providing the design and for the requirements for the market for it to be a successful product.”
Which is to say the company has poured considerable effort into bringing Evo into a market where only a fraction of residential solar systems installed today are coupled with batteries. “Regardless of the size of the market, Sonnen still believes [Australia] is an important market and it’s worthwhile us taking this step in the development of our generational products,” Dunn said.
It seems the battery launch is itself a trial of a new approach. “[The company] is pushing more towards a key focus of mine which is essentially that as a business we drive customer-centricity,” Dunn said. With offices in Germany, Italy, Australia, the UK and the USA, sonnen could be on the precipice of offering region-specific products and will be no doubt be keenly watching the reception of the sonnenBatterie Evo here in Australia.
The new Evo battery is available for preorder now and will be entering the Australian market in earnest “sometime” in Q1, 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/01/micro-inverters-vs-string-inverters/,"INVERTERS,RESEARCH,FRANCE",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 1, 2021",Micro-inverters vs. string inverters,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers from the University of Limoges has compared the performance ratio (PR) of PV systems equipped with micro-inverters to that of installations relying on central or string inverters at several locations across France. Surprisingly, the study finds that micro-inverters do not perform better.
The PR is a parameter that defines the relationship between the actual and expected power production of a PV system, and is largely unrelated to an installation’s location or orientation. This value is used to understand how efficiently the PV system is operating.
The researchers initially analysed all advantages and disadvantages of an installation with micro-inverters or central/string inverters, and said that micro-inverters should offer an advantage on many points, including price. “We must also consider the lifespans of this equipment, which is a little less than 10 years for a central inverter and can reach 30 years for a micro-inverter,” they further explained. “Micro-inverters also appear to be better suited to reducing the impact of losses that can occur in solar panels whether due to shading or panel malfunction.”
These assumptions were evaluated by analysing 200 PV installations located in France. The work considered their actual production of solar energy, as well as the orientation, the inclination, the peak power, the geographical area, and other factors. “In order to carry out a statistical study on the PR, 200 data sets were recovered: 100 for installations with Enphase M210, M215, M250 and IQ7 microinverters and 100 with installations using SMA SunnyBoy 3000, SunnyBoy 5000 inverters and Sunny Tripower STP 8000,” the academics explained. “Of the 100 systems, 50 are SunnyBoy 3000 (input power 3.2 kW), 25 are SunnyBoy 5000 (input power 5.2 kW) and 25 are Sunny Tripower STP 8000 (input power 8, 2 kW).”
The average capacity of the installations relying on micro-inverters was 3.8 kW and that of the second category was 5 kW.
The analysis showed that micro-inverters are more sensitive to environmental factors. Furthermore, the scientists found that the size of a PV system doesn’t have an influence on the performance of either micro-inverters or inverters.
“According to the production data, the performance ratio is ultimately almost identical for installations with inverters or micro-inverters,” the French group emphasised. “The PR is around 79% for both the average facility equipped with micro-inverters and the average for other facilities.” It also reported slight growth in the PR with lower irradiance for both micro-inverter and central/string devices, which could depend on the inclination and orientation of the panels or the geographical area.
“Finally, the results show a homogeneity of the performance ratio between the two technologies despite different operations,” the academics concluded. “However, even if the performance ratio is identical between inverters and micro-inverters, micro-inverters are still to be favored because of their lifespans and their prices.” They go on to explain that microinverters may not be replaced for an entire 25 year module lifetime, and that they allow stakeholders to better guarantee the safety of the installation even in the event of fire.
Their findings were presented in the paper Performance ratio of photovoltaic installations in France Comparison between inverters and micro-inverters, which was recently published in the Journal of King Saud University – Engineering Sciences.

Reaching the commissioning phase is no small feat given current grid constraints, but to achieve this point of a project during a global pandemic and well-documented supply chain issues is all the more impressive.
Having completed its testing phase to allow the project to continually export solar energy into the grid, the solar farm, built by Beon Energy Solutions (Beon), is expected to reach full commercial operations in the next few months. 
The project took Beon 11 months to construct, with general manager, Glen Thompson, commending FRV Australia, and local workers and businesses from Junee, Temora and Wagga Wagga for helping “to complete the project on time in the middle of a global pandemic and significant Covid-19 outbreaks in NSW and Victoria (VIC), with an outstanding safety performance throughout highlighting the commitment and skills of all the workers and businesses involved.”

According to Thompson, of the 200 workers the construction required, 73 positions were filled by locals. What is more, Thompson said that Sebastopol proves that renewable projects will continue to see deployment in regional areas as the energy transition can provide significant benefits to regional communities. 
FRV’s managing director, Carlo Frigerio, described the news as “a great milestone for Sebastopol Solar Farm and we would like to congratulate Beon for this achievement and ability to reach this stage of the project maintaining high work and safety standards during these challenging Covid-19 times. We now look forward to see the plant at full generation in the coming months.”
FRV’s Australian portfolio includes the 125 MW Lilyvale Solar Farm in Queensland, the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria, and the 69.75 MW Goonumbla Solar Farm in New South Wales (NSW). The company has also achieved financial close on the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm and continues to develop the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm, all in NSW.
