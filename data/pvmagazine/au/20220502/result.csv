Maoneng co-founder and chief executive officer Morris Zhou said the $1.6 billion energy hub, to be built just south of Merriwa, about 180 kilometres north-west of Newcastle, had been designed to address the regional energy supply and grid stability needs of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“This project will support the NSW Government’s large-scale solar generation and battery storage strategies as the state moves towards increasing use of clean energy,” he said.
“The Merriwa Energy Hub would be one of the largest renewable energy hubs in the country and, while it’s still early days, we expect the construction process to support hundreds of direct and indirect jobs, as well as significant investment into communities experiencing a shift away from fossil fuel.”
Maoneng said the solar farm will comprise about 1.3 million bifacial solar panels mounted on single-axis trackers installed across 780 hectares. The project will also involve the construction of a new substation which will connect to the NEM via TransGrid’s existing 500kV transmission line that runs along the south of the site.
“We have deliberately chosen the site based upon its robust connection to the existing grid, making efficient use of the infrastructure that exists today,” Zhou said, adding the solar farm and battery would each have a connection into the substation.
“We wanted to make the battery flexible, so it can operate independently of the solar farm,” he said. “The best value for money is a battery directly connected to the network, where it can still do arbitrage but also all the other functions that the network needs.”

Maoneng said a development application for the Merriwa Energy Hub is expected to be lodged with the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment in the coming weeks.
The company is aiming to achieve financial close by the December quarter of 2023 with Maoneng targeting completion of the project in 2025. Construction of the solar farm and battery is expected to take 18 months with an estimated 500 full-time equivalent jobs to be created.
Zhou said the project has already attracted interest from infrastructure investors and construction groups and both the solar farm and battery energy storage system would be backed by power purchase agreements.
The proposed Merriwa Energy Hub is the latest addition to Maoneng’s pipeline of renewable energy projects.
The company, which retains an interest in the 200MW Sunraysia Solar Farm being developed in southwest NSW, is also developing the 240MW/480MWh Mornington battery project in Victoria and the 225MW/450MWh Gould Creek storage project in near Adelaide in South Australia.
Maoneng also has three other standalone battery projects on the go, with 450MW/900MWh of energy storage spread between sites at Lismore, Tamworth and Armidale in regional NSW.

Indian utility NTPC Ltd. wants to deploy Switzerland-based Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions to support its clean energy initiatives.
The two parties recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to forge a long-term strategic partnership. NTPC will deploy Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions based on the outcome of a joint feasibility study.
Energy Vault’s EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-ton blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy. 
The NTPC and Energy Vault collaboration will also see the beneficial use of coal ash to manufacture composite blocks for Energy Vault’s gravity-based energy storage system.
“Energy Vault’s mission is to make sustainable, carbon-free energy a reality, and this announcement marks further advancement towards that goal with the expansion into one of the largest global markets for energy,” Robert Piconi, the chairman, co-founder and CEO of Energy Vault. “Our collaboration with NTPC builds upon previously announced commercial expansions across multiple continents as we transitioned to a public company earlier this year.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/02/vast-solar-pushes-ahead-with-world-class-solar-thermal-project/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 2, 2022",Vast Solar pushes ahead with ‘world-class’ solar thermal project,"Australian renewable energy developer Vast Solar has confirmed it will build a 20MW concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) plant near the regional South Australian township of Port Augusta after securing up to $110 million in concessional finance from the federal government.
The finance was announced on Friday by federal energy minister Angus Taylor. Taylor said the Morrison Government had through its 2022-23 Budget process agreed to negotiate with Vast Solar the terms of concessional finance of up to $110 million to support the development of the 20MW CSP project.
Vast Solar chief executive officer Craig Wood said the “world-leading facility” will generate clean, low-cost, reliable power, and catalyse an export-focussed renewables manufacturing industry.
“This announcement is great news for South Australia and the country’s transition to net zero. We’ll be working closely with the state and commonwealth governments, the local community and businesses, to ensure this project delivers for South Australians,” he said.
“Alongside our Mt Isa project, this is another step forward for solar thermal technology in Australia. It complements wind and solar as it can generate low-cost, clean electricity for 12-plus hours when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing, meaning solar thermal has a huge role to play in the energy transition.
“What’s more, our technology is attracting international attention, and we are committed to seizing the opportunity to create a solar thermal export industry that brings jobs, billions of dollars in export revenue, and helps Australia become a clean energy superpower.”

Sydney-based Vast Solar, which is also developing a 50MW hybrid solar thermal project at Mount Isa in western Queensland, said the South Australian project will feature the same modular tower CSP technology that the company has deployed at Jemalong in New South Wales (NSW). The 1MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.
Unlike traditional CSP technology which uses molten salt both as a heat transfer and for storage, Vast Solar has developed technology that uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine. The technology allows plants to be configured with 4-16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500MW.
Wood said the Port Augusta project would produce dispatchable renewable electricity “available on demand for eight hours or more”, aligning with the federal government’s Technology Investment Roadmap.
The Roadmap identifies CSP as a key technology to achieve net zero by 2050 and Wood said the technology has already deployed at scale overseas with the International Energy Agency forecasting it will increase 10-fold to 73GW globally by 2030.
Wood said Vast Solar’s technology will help resolve intermittency challenges associated with variable renewable energy sources as they deliver increasingly more ‘bulk’ renewable energy to the world’s power grids.
“Our CSP technology delivers utility scale renewable energy generation with scalable, thermal storage,” he said. “This delivers the ability to generate renewable energy during the day and to dispatch renewable energy 24 hours – during the day and night.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/02/analysis-shows-solar-leads-way-in-employment-stakes/,"EMPLOYMENT,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 2, 2022",Analysis shows solar leads way in employment stakes,"When it comes to jobs creation, a new analysis from the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) shows renewable energy is the real winner for regional communities that are reliant on coal-fired power stations that are fast approaching their use-by dates.
The analysis, overseen by Green Energy Markets’ director of analysis Tristan Edis, shows that replacing the energy output of the 2,880MW Eraring coal-fired power station, which is scheduled to close in 2025, with renewables would create thousands more construction jobs than replacing it with gas or coal-fired alternatives.
Origin Energy recently announced it is accelerating the shutdown of Australia’s largest coal-fired power station, attributing the early closure to the rapidly changing conditions in the National Electricity Market (NEM), which are “increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations and challenging their viability”.
The Eraring power plant at Lake Macquarie in the Hunter region of New South Wales (NSW) was originally scheduled to close in 2032 but Origin now plans to shut it down in 2025.
Edis said his analysis, using the ‘energy construction jobs tool’ which utilises historical data combined with survey estimates developed by the University of Technology Sydney to provide estimates of the number of jobs created from constructing different power plants relative to their electricity generation, shows replacing the coal-fired power plant with renewables would generate thousands more jobs than replacing it with fossil-fuel alternatives.
The analysis reveals that building enough solar PV farms to replace the 2,880MW black coal plant would create 14,415 jobs, while building wind farms with similar capacity would create 13,339 jobs. Replacing it through the installation of rooftop solar PV would generate an incredible 63,562 jobs.

In contrast, construction jobs for new coal-fired power stations would create just 8,576 roles, while gas plants that made that much power would deliver just 1,566 jobs.
The tool can also be used to provide household comparisons. If Australia chose to power one million homes with new rooftop solar systems, it would create 26,484 construction jobs. The next biggest jobs creator for this task would be solar farms, which would create 6,006 construction jobs. That much power generated by wind farms would create 5,558 jobs while the equivalent power from new coal would create just 3,573 jobs and new gas would create only 652 jobs.
The analysis concludes that a ‘gas-led recovery’ is “not in the best interests of the many thousands of construction workers who are looking to futureproof their income” and that “supply chain jobs associated with the construction of gas plants ranks the lowest in every energy example”.
“Renewable energy is the winning option for communities that have for decades relied on coal-fired power stations which are now on their last legs,” ACF chief executive officer Kelly O’Shanassy said.
“In the Hunter Valley in NSW, the Latrobe Valley in Victoria and Gladstone in Queensland, locals have for many years depended on jobs linked to coal mines and power stations. Replacing old coal-fired generators with renewables will bring a jobs boom to those regions.
“The numbers show replacing the energy output of a coal-fired power station with rooftop solar plus batteries is the best way to create construction jobs, with solar farms second best and wind farms third.
“Replacing old coal with new coal comes a distant fourth in construction jobs, while new gas is the worst creator of energy construction jobs.”

The findings directly contradict the claims of Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who at the weekend declared that there are “no jobs in the energy transition” and transitioning from coal to cleaner energy “equals unemployment” in the regions.
Speaking on the ABC’s Insiders program, broadcast from Gladstone, Joyce reaffirmed his belief that coal remains critical for Australia’s future.
“If you want to talk about jobs and growth then you need to be talking about coal because that is what our economy has been built on,” he said.
“We are standing by the jobs they’ve got and we’re investing billions towards hydrogen but we’re not going to be saying to people the word ‘transition’ because that equals unemployment.”
O’Shannassy said Joyce was mired in the past, saying the analysis shows that renewable energy is the most beneficial path forward for coal communities.
“Clinging to fossil fuels, makes climate change worse, creates fewer jobs and leads to higher electricity bills. That is not what Australians want,” she said. “Renewables are cheaper, more reliable and create lots of jobs.”
