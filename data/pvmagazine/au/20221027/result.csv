Volt, the first solar roof tile capable of generating energy equivalent to that produced by a standard solar panel roof tile, has been launched, with Clean Energy Council certification, at the CEC’s All-Energy conference and exhibition.
Hundreds of solar installers came to touch, feel and appreciate this new opportunity to crack the home market at build stage, and deliver what many customers have been asking for: solar PV that integrates seamlessly with the roof profile.
Volt has partnered with Bristile Roofing (part of the ASX-listed Brickworks group of companies) and Spain-based global roof tile provider La Escandella, to market its two high-efficiency tiles: the 115W Planum with an 18.8% solar-conversion efficiency, and the 105W Lodge tile offering 19.4% efficiency.
pv magazine Australia caught Peter Leeson, Managing Director, of Volt parent company, Leeson Group, proudly wedged between his roof tile displays in a booth at All-Energy, to learn a little more about this passion project, which took eight years to bring to fruition and is now poised for distribution and installation in some 86 countries including Australia.

pv magazine: What made you pursue the solar roof tile?
Peter Leeson: I’ve been in solar for 14 years. I’ve built a lot of homes and property developments and I saw the integration of PV into the roof structure as a critical part of the process in future. We’d done installations in Australia and in Southeast Asia and we quickly realised that facade solar doesn’t make sense. It’s inaccessible because it’s really high cost. Roof is the real estate. Some people are happy with panels, but we believe that in four to six years the majority of new homes will have integrated rooftop solar. It’s gaining traction globally and the Tesla Solar Roof has had a lot of attention. 
We’ve now been developing our product for eight years, designing and redesigning it and getting it right. We also develop solar farms and as the revenue came from those projects we decided to get going. This week we installed our first Volt roof in Victoria. In coming weeks we’re installing in South Australia and Western Australia, and we’re about to install in Spain, in Barcelona.
Where are you manufacturing?
Right now we’re made in China on a 2GW fully automated manufacturing line. Later next year we’re going to set up a manufacturing plant for the frame extrusions, cutting and assembly in Australia, which is about 50% of the volume of the product, and about 50% of cost because it’s a really technical frame — that’s where all the IP is. Then in 2024 we’ll look at financial flows on building a local manufacturing line. That would allow us to produce a fully Australian-made solar tile from 2025.
So the solar panel is the roof tile. How does it work?
The solar tile is seven times as wide as the La Escandella terracotta roof tile, for example. So you start laying the roof tiles, then in any position that a solar tile will fit, you lay the solar tile, and then you frame the solar section with more roof tiles. So it’s fully integrated.
What’s the lifetime of the product?
Volt solar tiles have a 30-year performance warranty — the longest performance warranty of any solar tile product — and a 15-year product warranty, which is also the longest in this product category.
What gives you confidence in offering such long warranties?
Our manufacturing line. We’re using a 2GW fully automated line for MWT cells. These cells have a circuit board on the back; they’re placed onto a conductive back sheet; and it’s fully laminated in that process. There’s no manual handling. 
Most other tile products are of an obscure size, but they’re produced on a standard line that typically makes 400W panels, so they have to go through a different process because manufacturers are not going to shut down the line, rebuild it to just do a small run of three megawatts of one product, and then run it back into the normal size of the laminant. 
Having a dedicated line for this actual cell type, it’s all programmed. The machines place our 38 half-cut cells on the right-size glass — everything runs automatically. And we’ve got really good quality assurance. These factors allow us to give the long warranties.
And when the panel reaches the end of its life, can it stay on the roof as a roof tile?
It can. When you say at the end of its life, we’ve yet to see what a quality panel does at the end of its life. You could just leave ours in place, but that may not be the best solution. If you no longer want to generate electricity, you could replace Volt tiles with roof tiles. But if you want to upgrade, this size module now is 115 watts; in 30 years time, it’s probably going be 250 watts. There’ll be completely different technology, offering other opportunities.
What kind of demand are you anticipating for Volt?
Globally, we’re looking at about 6.6 MW in 2023. We’re distributing to 85 countries with La Escandella, and we also have our partnership program in Australia. We are partnering exclusively with 100 quality solar companies, and we’re going to train them in selling this solar. It’s the first opportunity any solar company in the country has had to sell BIPV.
As a solar company, you don’t need to have a roof license. For building you do. In our case, Bristile will come in and certify the roof as fully compliant, because they’ll be on site with the installation of the tiles. It’s a great opportunity for solar companies to be able to reach that new-build market and have a unique selling proposition. We think we’re going to scale really well. 
The other key thing is that in the build process, generally speaking, you sell the solar tile system and it can be six months before you’re installing because they’ve got to put the slab down and build the frame to get it ready for the roof. Our software allows our partners, the solar companies, to click a button in our portal that will reserve that spot in the production process, lock in the price, and that automatically feeds into our manufacturing system.
Are the actual roof tiles only available in black?
The roof tiles are available in various colours but the solar tiles only come in black.
New South Wales now has a requirement that new builds have to have light-coloured roofs, to help reduce the heat island effect of high-density housing with many dark coloured roofs. How will this play out for Volt?
You can still do a light-coloured roof with our solar tiles. There’ve been a lot of queries about whether we can do white solar tiles, or orange solar tiles. The technology’s there and the cells are there, but they’re less efficient than the black solar tiles. So to get high performance for a mass market at an accessible price, we need to go with a standard product that can be manufactured in bulk. Changing colours messes with the volumes. In time, we will do colour. That’ll be the next generation, when we’re doing the printing ourselves.
What is Volt’s accessible price?
We’re a quarter the cost of the Tesla Roof, and half the price of the other competitors in the market. A 5kW Volt system costs $12,000 fully installed after STC rebates.

AGGN seeks to advance regional green grids, that is carbon-free grids composed of renewable resources. The white paper forecasts that by achieving 15% grid interconnection by 2040 an estimated 3,335 TWh could be traded in the Asia Pacific annually. That trading estimate translates to $760 billion (USD 493 billion) and would abate 3,070 MT of carbon dioxide every year.
“Cross-border trade of renewable electricity and grid integration is the cornerstone of a successful clean energy transition in Asia,” says Sun Cable Founder and Chief Strategy Officer Fraser Thompson. “Our vision for the Asia Green Grid Network is for this network to play a leading role in supporting the innovation to make this happen.”
AGGN brings together partners and collaborators including Surbana Jurong, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, the National University of Singapore Faculty of Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), Singapore Institute of Technology, the University of New South Wales, the University of Adelaide, James Cook University and Charles Darwin University.
Surbana Jurong’s Energy and Industrial Managing Director Tan Wooi Leong says “the energy transition is rapidly gathering momentum across ASEAN,” and noted that the AGGN would facilitate the deep knowledge sharing needed for an integrated and stronger green grid.
According to the white paper there is no shortage of technical challenges facing the cross-border green electricity grid that could transform Asia. These challenges include “voltage improvements to minimise transmission losses in high voltage direct current (HVDC) cable through finding ways to support dispatchability and energy security through high density energy storage systems.”
The AGGN has assigned itself three core roles, to educate, to collaborate, and to innovate. According to Renate Egan, CEO of the UNSW Energy Institute at the University of New South Wales, an institution storied in innovation, “Access to renewable energy through reliable transmission infrastructure will be key to facilitating the energy transition in Asia. The goal of the AGGN is to drive innovation and solutions connecting systems across borders to accelerate Asia’s transition to renewable energy.”
AGGN plans to expand its network of research institutions and corporations from other parts of Asia.
Sun Cable’s AAPowerLink project has had a series of promising progressions in 2022, with the Australian government’s independent infrastructure advisory body, Infrastructure Australia, giving the project’s economic credentials the tick of approval in June. In May, the Territory government passed legislation to streamline existing processes and increase certainty for Sun Cable developers.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/27/space-based-solar-power-for-terrestrial-energy-needs/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED KINGDOM",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"OCTOBER 27, 2022",Space-based solar power for terrestrial energy needs,"From pv magazine Spain
UK-based engineering solution firm IECL has developed a project called Cassiopeia to generate solar power in space for terrestrial energy needs.
The project takes its name from a 2,000-tonne satellite located 36,000 kilometres above Earth. The satellite would collect solar energy using large, lightweight mirrors, each up to 1,700 m in diameter, positioned at 45° to a helical array of up to 60,000 solar panels that produce electricity.
“Space-based solar power has two huge advantages over traditional methods: on the one hand, placing a sunlight-capturing satellite in space means we wouldn’t need to cover large tracts of land with solar panels,” said Ian Cash, IECL chief engineer and author of “CASSIOPeiA – A new paradigm for space solar power,” published in the journal Acta Astronautica. “On the other, we would not be dependent on local weather conditions or whether it is day or night.”
The study concluded that it was feasible to deploy a system consisting of a Cassiopeia satellite in geostationary orbit, which would generate about 3.4 GW of electricity on the satellite. This would be converted to radio frequency microwave radiation, with an efficiency of 85%. A net power of 2.9 GW would then be transmitted to a receiving antenna located at a fixed point on the ground. The antenna would convert the electromagnetic energy into direct current electricity and then, through an inverter, supply a net power of 2 GW of alternating current to the grid.
It would cost $28.7 billion (USD 18.7 billion) to develop and launch the project. Considering a minimum rate of return on investment of 20% per year, the report concludes that a space-based solar power system could, over its lifetime of approximately 100 years, generate power at $73.75 (USD 48)/MWh. If the project were scaled up, it could supply more than 150% of all global electricity demand.
The project envisions a 40 MW pilot project placed in low-Earth orbit from 2027 to 2031. Between 2036 and 2039, a 2 GW production prototype would be in orbit.
In early 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) commissioned two independent cost-benefit studies of space-based solar power for terrestrial energy needs from UK and Germany-based consulting firms Frazer-Nash and Roland Berger, respectively.
The studies were completed in August 2022 and both concluded that it is possible to provide competitively priced electricity to European homes and businesses by 2040. The total estimated costs of a pilot development, which would generate 2 GW, have been estimated at up to $5.4 billion.

Sweden-based start-up Swedish Algae Factory has developed a new material, called Algica, to improve the efficiency of silicon and thin film solar panels. As part of their Sunalgae Life project, the team cultivates single-celled photosynthesising algae called diatoms to extract their shells, which reportedly have unique light-manipulating properties, including blocking ultraviolet (UV) light.
The shells are then added to the encapsulant of silicon modules or to the anti-reflective coating on the glass of thin film modules, which the Swedish team claims could boost their efficiency by 4% and 36%, respectively. These enhancements were “measured in indicative flash tests performed by external institutes,” including the Chalmers University of Technology, according to the team’s website.
The algae shells should also reduce the degradation of solar panels over time caused by UV radiation. The team estimates the resulting modules would be 3.9% cheaper compared to currently commercialised panels.
The Sunalgae Life project required a  $6.13 million (USD 3.99 million) investment, partly awarded by the European Union. One of its goals is to commercialise the algae material for use in solar panels. The team has now inaugurated a pilot facility in Sweden to mass produce the material. The new facility is expected to cultivate 500 kg per year and subsequently 1,000 kg per year. Until now, the team has cultivated 30 kg per year in a greenhouse.
“Material produced from the facility will [be] tested for repeatable efficiency enhancement in solar panels,” the project website says. The team claims the production process is circular. “The material is produced in an environmentally friendly process where water is cleaned, valuable nutrients are recycled, carbon dioxide is absorbed, and a valuable sustainable organic biomass is also produced.”

Much more complex is the abatement of the built environment, for which we have the necessary abatement technologies — rooftop solar, batteries, digital management of electricity in buildings large and small — but which is hard to communicate with because it is dispersed and in the hands of individuals and organisations that are subject to other pressures.
pv magazine Australia is at the Clean Energy Council’s All-Energy Conference in Melbourne. Back after a three-year Covid-induced hiatus, the conference on its first day revisited the importance of energy efficiency in the global transition to renewables. “There’s no point,” said Gareth O’Reilly, Pacific Zone President of Schneider Electric, during the opening plenary panel on demand-side management of energy, “creating additional supply if you’re pouring it into a leaky bucket.”
The panel noted that in recent years, Australians have been told that gas, the famously touted transition fuel of the former Liberal-National coalition government, is the way forward. So householders are now inclined to forestall electrifying their stoves, and water and home heating.
Businesses, on the other hand, are battling energy price rises caused by a confluence of global conditions, and many can’t contemplate spending to electrify processes, or on efficiency measures, despite paybacks in the medium term.
Mixed messages and lack of clear intent to decarbonise before the Labor Party won power earlier this year have muddied the motivation of many people to start or continue their journey towards net zero. 
The policy vacuum created by the former government has not yet been filled and the All-Energy plenary sessions, which sought to balance renewable energy generation with demand, called for more incentives that will encourage wholesale change. Helping disadvantaged households tap into energy efficiency and access solar’s cheap bounty was high on the agenda.
In support of driving energy efficiency, Anna Malos, Country Lead in Australia for the Climateworks Centre, said, “Every unit of energy that we don’t use, we don’t have to generate, and that makes the whole system cheaper.”
O’Reilly described how industrial companies could apply continuous-improvement thinking to process efficiency and optimisation in order to better “compete and win”.
He said “Building onsite renewables is super important,” and gave the example of a Victorian food processing business that installed a behind-the-meter solar-and-battery microgrid: “When they found they had excess electricity generation during the day, they electrified part of their [previously gas driven] heated drying process, and they’re now insulated from imported-energy inflation.”
The effect on energy-challenged households of better insulation that helps maintain even slightly higher indoor temperatures in winter can also be dramatic. Menzel referred to the Victorian Healthy Homes Research Findings  report released in September, which assessed the outcomes of upgrading the thermal efficiency of 1,000 homes occupied by the state’s elderly and most vulnerable citizens.
The upgrades cost an average of $2,809 per household, and their first winter delivered healthcare savings of $887 per person — calculated against what people would have required in medications and hospitalisation over the period. As importantly, recipients reported reduced breathlessness and improved quality of life. 
“Australia has the leakiest homes in the world”, says Fiona Grey, CEO of RENEW, an independent group providing governments, households and industry with expert advice on solutions to household sustainability.
But there are also beacons of innovation in the built environment, providing use cases of what works and what’s possible, and informing how emerging and established digital technologies might be shaped to support best deployment of current and future energy.
An All-Energy session, Building a better future: Renewable energy in the built environment, explored the work of property developer Mirvac; “lifestyle” purveyor Ingenia (which envisions and creates communities for different markets, from holiday parks to retirement living); Brimbank City Council in Victoria: and Breathe sustainable architects, which works in various built sectors including hospitality.
All consistently apply rooftop solar, combined with fuel switching from gas to electricity and energy efficiency measures to buildings with outcomes that are helping to change minds and influence people.
For example, Breathe Director of Architecture and Sustainability, Bonnie Herring, has found in her work with cafe and restaurant businesses that, “Hospitality operators think gas is more efficient than electricity, but induction is much more efficient than gas,” because it only heats the pot or pan, rather than the surrounding air. Operating cost savings, she says, quickly offset the higher capital costs of installing induction cooktops. “Electric kitchens,” she adds, are also “cooler, with better air quality” than gas-powered kitchens.
Ross Kingston, Acting Sustainability coordinator at Brimbank council explained that although councils are largely at the forefront of decarbonisation efforts, and implementing building design  standards, there is one common holdout for local governments in the form of neighbourhood aquatic and leisure centres, which can be responsible for up to 90% of council gas use.
“The incumbent technology model for aquatic centres in Victoria,” he explains, “is a unitary gas boiler to do all the heating that an aquatic centre needs, and separate chillers and air conditioning units for all the cooling needs.”
Brimbank’s St Albans Leisure Centre was in a state of disrepair, and Council worked on upgrading it to become the Brimbank Aquatic and Wellness Centre.
That is, says Kingston, “We switched to a four-pipe heat pump technology powered by onsite (500 kW of solar) and offsite renewables,” to provide simultaneous heating and cooling, a combined solution which he says delivered considerable efficiencies. “And the third component of our technology model was thermal energy storage to store excess solar production.”
In the meantime, Mirvac has begun construction of its fourth build-to-rent development as part of its LIV Future Portfolio pipeline of 2,200 apartments. The aim of the portfolio is to provide long-term homes for renters only, which are financed by institutional investors.
Says Angela Buckley, General Manager of Mirvac’s Build To Rent initiative, “We fundamentally believe it’s one of the few opportunities to really drive fantastic ESG outcomes and objectives in the living space.” She cites in-house customer research that says “92% of Australians want to live more sustainable lives, but only 16% are actually doing it. We think we have the platform to make it easier to live more sustainable lives.”
The portfolio’s buildings are all completely powered by renewable energy and target a 7.5-star average on the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERs). Mirvac chooses and provides the most sustainable white goods for its apartments, and helps its largely (70%) millennial customer base understand what their decision to live in its apartments contributes to decarbonisation of Australian home life.
“We do that in a fun, almost gamified way,” says Buckley. “Through the embedded network that we have within the building, and the energy monitoring systems, we almost challenge our residents to think about who’s using the most and the least, which adds to the community element and bands people together as a whole.” The attendant aim is to co-create next-level energy solutions with the residents.
Such projects demonstrate that decarbonising Australia’s built environment is possible and delivers myriad benefits. Building a better future panellists agree that strengthened rating systems for buildings — such as NatHERs and the Green Building Council of Australia’s Green Star system — will help finance providers understand what defines a green building and thereby help developers and organisations access finance to upgrade or get greener greenfield developments up and sustainably running.
