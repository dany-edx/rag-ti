Its National Survey of PV Power Applications in Australia report, prepared in partnership with the International Energy Agency and published on Monday, tells a decidedly rosy story about solar’s progress in Australia, which it says is showing no signs of slowing. In fact, at 22.3 GW of installed solar as of mid 2021,  Australia has nearly tripled its capacity since 2017.

In 2020, total rooftop installations hit a new high of 3 GW, with 1.8 GW installed on residential roofs and 1.2 GW on commercial and industrial roofs – which, while still smaller than the residential segment, saw the greatest year-on-year growth.
In total, Australia’s solar capacity grew 28% in 2020 despite the global pandemic. While the residential and C&I segments broke records, the utility-scale solar segment contracted after peaking in 2019. Be that as it may, the amount of utility-scale solar connected to the grid has increased ten-fold in the last three years, growing from 740 MW in 2017 to 7.4 GW in 2020.
“The Australian market is very different to most world markets as it has been dominated by rooftop PV. The demand for rooftop solar has kept Australia in the top ten markets for photovoltaics by annual installs and total installed capacity for over ten years, a remarkable outcome for a country of only 25.7 million people,” the report said.

Australia has retained its status as global per capita solar leader, with 160 watts on our closest competitor, Germany, which has 650 watts per person. “2021 looks set to extend this lead,” the Australian PV Institute’s report concluded.
Over 31% of free-standing households across the nation are now fitted with a PV system, the report outlined. In Queensland and South Australia, the average is closer to 40%, with a significant number of localities have densities of rooftop solar over 50%.
“Solar accounts for 25,340 full time equivalent jobs in Australia, and an additional 250 roles in solar research,” the report said. The institute estimates the total value of solar businesses in Australia to sit around $7 billion.
On average, Australians paid about $1.52 per kW for their systems before subsidies. It’s no wonder given the price decline that average rooftop system size continue to grow, coming in at over 8 kW in 2020.

“The Australian Energy Market Operator expects rooftop solar, alone, to account for up to 75% of national grid demand by 2026 and we are seeing new records for minimum demand broken each week as we move through spring, with increasing solar generation met with low demand for heating and cooling due to mild conditions,” the report said.
“In contrast to other areas of global leadership, very little building-integrated PV (BIPV) was added in 2020, and no vehicle-integrated PV was known to occur. No additional ‘Floatovoltaics’ have been recorded beyond the single 100kW installation in 2017.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/02/integrating-solar-into-lng-facilities-could-reduce-emissions-by-up-to-21/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Integrating solar into LNG facilities could reduce emissions by up to 21%,"The integration of solar energy into Australia’s liquid natural gas (LNG) industry could dramatically reduce Australia’s carbon footprint and create thousands of jobs, a report from the Charles Darwin University and federally-funded NERA concluded.
The research focussed on the gas facilities in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia, finding a “considerable amount of solar PV power” could be integrated into LNG plants through retrofitting. “If the maximum amount of technically feasible changes identified through this approach are enacted, it is estimated that the onshore LNG plants in the [Northern Territory] would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 19%, Queensland by 18% and [Western Australia] by 21% from the emissions arising due to their electricity and stationary energy demand,” the report read.
“That equates to around 96 exajoules per year of natural gas that could be freed up from the liquefaction process chain and emissions reductions of about 5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year at existing production capacities, which amounts to about 1% of Australia’s current total emissions,” it added.

The report, produced with support from Santos, Sun Cable and the Northern Territory government, used the Santos-operated Darwin LNG facility as a technical case study to examine the potential to decarbonise gas facilities. 
The report’s authors concluded solar energy integration was potentially economically viable to offset up to 50% of the plant’s emissions from electricity generation. Additional savings of nearly three times that amount could be offset with solar energy by retro-fitting ‘helper motors’ to partially electrify the plant’s compression turbines which currently run on gas.
“With net zero goals being set globally, the LNG industry must explore all opportunities to decarbonise if it wants to stay relevant and sustainable for the decades to come,” NERA’s CEO, Miranda Taylor, said.
The report also found the integration of solar energy into the industry could increase the nation’s energy security by saving over 97 million gigajoules of gas a year — equivalent to more than 10% of domestic demand — and create over 1,000 construction jobs and 868 ongoing jobs.

The offer values AusNet, which owns and operates Victoria’s electricity transmission network, as well as electricity and gas distribution networks, at more than $10 billion.
AusNet is already majority foreign-owned, with 32% of the company controlled by the Singapore government’s investment fund Temasek through its company Singapore Power, while another 19.9% stake is owned by China’s State Grid Corporation.
Australia gas giant APA Group had tried to outbid the Brookfield consortium, seeking to rally support for its takeover on the promise of preventing Victoria’s power grid becoming completely foreign-owned. It seems APA’s proposition, however, failed to compel, with the company putting out a statement saying that while it still considers AusNet to be a “highly attractive” asset, it will “continue to remain financially disciplined”.
On Monday, Brookfield upped its all-cash offer from $2.50 a share to $2.65, winning the unanimous support of AusNet’s board of directors.
The Brookfield consortium, which includes pension funds Sunsuper, Alberta Investment Management Corp., the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, has said it sees AusNet as a multi-decade investment pivotal to Australia’s clean energy transition.

The project is underpinned by a 15 year solar offtake agreement with existing APA customer, zinc miner MMG Dugald River (MMG).
The first stage of the solar farm is expected to be operational by early 2023, with APA saying it is in “advanced discussions” with a number of customers to commit to the development of stage two, which would double the project’s capacity to 88 MW.
APA said it had also entered into a 32-year lease agreement with the Queensland government to locate the solar farm on a site near APA’s Diamantina Power Station Complex. The power station will continue to provide what the company described as “firming gas” to MMG, under APA’s existing contract with the zinc miner.
APA, which operates Australia’s largest gas pipeline, recently tried to acquire AusNet, which owns and operates Victoria’s electricity transmission network, as well as an electricity distribution network and gas distribution network in the state. The company seems to have all but officially lost its bidding war for AusNet to Canadian asset management group Brookfield. Brookfield yesterday upped its all-cash offer from $2.50 a share to $2.65 and having already won the support of AusNet’s major shareholder, Singapore Power, its takeover is looking like a done deal.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/02/maonengs-450mwh-battery-south-australias-biggest-approved-without-significant-changes/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021","Maoneng’s 450MWh battery, South Australia’s biggest, approved without significant changes","Australian renewable energy developer Maoneng has obtained planning approval from the South Australian government for its Gould Creek battery in the northeast of Adelaide. Construction set to begin on the battery in late 2022, with the project expected to be fully commissioned by the end of 2023.
The 225MWp / 450MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) has secured the approval without any significant changes to its proposal, Maoneng said.
Once built, the Gould Creek battery will be the state’s largest, with more than double the storage capacity of Neoen’s Hornsdale Power Reserve, which can store up to 194MWh. Maoneng’s battery is to be located next to the Para transmission substation, just over 20km from the state capital’s CBD.
Maoneng started out in Australia’s residential solar segment, but it is understood the company will increasingly focus on battery storage projects over the next few years. Maoneng has said, however, that it is still open to and actively exploring pv opportunities in the country.
Maoneng
In July, Maoneng made public its plan to build a 240 MWp/480 MWh big battery in Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, with a proposed location also adjacent to an existing substation. The company is currently undertaking a competitive tender process to select its contractor for the project, and says it’s aiming to have the big battery completed by late 2022.
Australia’s pipeline of grid-scale battery storage projects has bulged in the past year, with the technology increasingly understood as the key to managing the country’s massive penetrations of rooftop solar and other variable and distributed energy resources.
“South Australia has high levels of renewable energy generation, which is a positive development but can create challenges balancing supply and demand due to the intermittency of renewables. Our proposed battery storage will help manage this, supporting local energy reliability and security while also promoting greater uptake of renewables as a whole,” Morris Zhou, Maoneng’s co-founder and CEO, said.
“We can now progress with more detailed work on our funding arrangements and supply chain, which will provide many opportunities for local businesses to get involved.”
South Australia’s Minister for Trade and Investment, Stephen Patterson, welcomed the development approval. “This is a significant $150 million investment by Maoneng Australia into South Australia’s sustainable future, and I’m delighted to see an Australian-owned company that is so committed to the development of projects that are critical for powering a sustainable world,” the minister said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/02/choc-a-block-with-energy-how-an-aussie-startup-plans-to-charge-the-energy-transition-brick-by-brick/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE",BLAKE MATICH,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Chock-a-block with energy: How an Aussie startup plans to charge the energy transition brick by brick,"A team of Engineers from Australia’s Newcastle University have developed and patented a thermal energy storage block, approximately the size of a large brick, which its inventors say is ideal for large-scale solar storage and repurposing coal-fired power plants.
The blocks, made largely from aluminium and graphite, are said to have a life expectancy in excess of that of PV without any degradation. One of the thermal block’s inventors, Erich Kisi, told pv magazine Australia that the idea for this new class of thermal energy storage materials called Miscibility Gap Alloys (MGA) came approximately ten years ago when the team at Newcastle University were working on a thermionic converter (TIC), which generates electricity from the heat of concentrated sunlight when they “had the realisation that without thermal energy storage, the device would not generate at night, much the same as PV.”
The aluminium particles, given structural integrity by powdered graphite, provide the latent heat which melts and solidifies for many thousands of cycles. Though, not only aluminium particles, says Kisi, “We have many systems that operate at different temperatures. Aluminium is part of our core product that gives a concentration of energy release at 660°C. Other systems are available for temperatures of 420°C, 577°C, or even 1085°C.”
Each block weighs around 6 kgs and can store approximately 1 kWh of energy, so it is not a technology geared for domestic use. “It is most efficient when used at a very large scale,” continued Kisi, “for example, a good size for a pilot plant is between 20-50 MWh of stored energy. One area where it will be deployed is with solar to capture power that can’t otherwise be generated or dispatched due to inverter, grid or demand limitations when generation is at its peak (between 9am and 3pm)…Other areas include turning retired power stations into grid scale energy storage and dispatch facilities and the enabling of renewably generated power to be used 24/7 for industrial process heat.”
Kisi is also the CEO of MGA Thermal, the company with the patent which is now manufacturing these blocks with its Swiss partner E2S Power AG for piloting programs to repurpose European coal-fired power plants.
“Our partners E2S are working closely with European power utilities to undertake large scale piloting,” said Kisi, who was tight-lipped about project specifics and the cost of individual energy storage blocks.

Materials and recycling
Graphite has the highest strength of any natural material, and its mining has been increasing in recent times in particular thanks to its use in lithium-ion batteries.
While Australia is not particularly known for its natural graphite reserves, Kisi says Australia does have good stores, but that what is more exciting is that “many new green technologies emerging have graphite of sufficient quality for our needs as a by-product of another process.”
What is more, Kisi told pv magazine Australia that not only are the MGA blocks able to be crushed and recycled, it is possible use recycled graphite and metal particles from various sources in the production process, meaning the graphite segment of the coming tsunami of lithium-ion battery waste could be repurposed into this thermal energy storage solution.
Currently MGA Thermal is manufacturing 100 blocks a day, though Kisi believes the company will be producing 1,000 blocks a day within the next nine months, and has ambitions for 10,000 blocks a day “shortly thereafter and so on.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/02/fortescue-capitalises-on-woodside-and-mcgowans-hydrogen-greenwashing-embarressment/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",Fortescue capitalises on Woodside and McGowan’s hydrogen greenwashing embarressment,"The Western Australian government’s support for Woodside’s ‘vague’ hydrogen plans, which seem about as green as a red-faced Premier Mark McGowan, has thrown the McGowan government under scrutiny as more details come to light. Meanwhile, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest capitalised on the debacle by announcing a massive green hydrogen deal at COP26 in Glasgow. 
Last week, pv magazine Australia reported on oil and gas company Woodside Petroleum Limited’s surprise ‘H2Perth’ announcement, which will see the company construct a $1 billion hydrogen and ammonia plant in Kwinana on Western Australia’s south coast. Woodside, and the greenwashing McGowan government, claim the facility will produce both green and blue hydrogen, but the response to Woodside’s surprise announcement has been, unsurprisingly, a resounding “That’s suss!” 
WAtoday‘s Peter Milne said WA Premier Mark McGowan “should be red-faced after greenwashing Woodside’s hydrogen plan”, after a press conference in which McGowan and three of his ministers failed to use the word “gas”, for what is patently a two-thirds gas-fuelled project. 
Woodside said it won’t make a final decision on the makeup of the project until 2024, though McGowan seemed pretty eager to tell the Western Australian people that the facility will be producing hydrogen “using a range of measures but in particular, using electricity off the grid that is produced by people’s solar panels.” 
What McGowan means is that one-third of the project will utilise electrolysers feeding off the WA grid, which includes residential PV, but which also includes a lot of coal and gas, indeed, 78% of the grid’s power came from coal and gas over the last year. 
“So much for the Premier’s people’s power” continued Milne, “If the plant just used surplus solar power, it would only run a few hours a day…Either the Premier has been played by Woodside to support this project, or he is playing us at Woodside’s bidding. Neither is a good look. In fact, it is pretty weak.” 
Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), which plans to use green hydrogen and ammonia to make its iron ore business net-zero by 2040, and set itself the ambition to generate 15 million tonnes per year of green hydrogen by 2030, got in on the act with a bit of quick editing on a Woodside print advertisement for its H2Perth project.
We fixed this for you @WoodsideEnergy. FACT: Burning blue hydrogen emits more greenhouse gas than burning fossil fuels themselves. Green hydrogen is the solution that the world needs now. #FFI #ThePowerOfNow pic.twitter.com/hKjMKhn4Wk

Speaking from COP26 in Glasgow to the ABC, Forrest added: “I think solutions talk. Basically we need a solution to oil, gas and coal. We need a solution to a cooking planet. Anything which comes from fossil fuel, like blue or grey hydrogen, is still a fossil fuel, that is still a charade. I would say to every leader, including us, absolutely no new coal mines. To even think about a new coal mine or even a new oil and gas field is really not to take global warming seriously.”
Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also got in on the act: 
Talk about “economical with the truth” this ad from @WoodsideEnergy claims hydrogen “when used produces no CO2 emissions” BUT fails to say that when made from natural gas produces over 9x as much CO2 as hydrogen.The only clean hydrogen is #GreenHydrogen @FortescueFuture @gh2org pic.twitter.com/Tt1L3BHY5r

In what looks to be, from a communications perspective, the equivalent of an intercept pass, Fortescue are capitalising on Woodside’s bundled announcement. Fortescue’s ‘hijacking’ of Woodside’s greenwashed hydrogen announcement come in tandem with its own announcement that it will become the biggest supplier of green hydrogen to the United Kingdom (UK) after signing a multi-billion pound memorandum of understanding (MoU) with JC Bamford Excavators Ltd (JCB), a construction equipment company, and distributor Ryze Hydrogen.
JCB agreed to buy 10% of FFI’s global green hydrogen production, a deal Forrest described as a “landmark, first of its kind partnership” that “will help the UK to achieve net zero, particularly in the hard to electrify sectors.”
“Our agreement signals the first major shift in the global commercial landscape from fossil fuels towards the real, practical, implementable solution that is green hydrogen,” continued Forrest. “We are delighted to announce this groundbreaking initiative at the critical climate forum of COP26.”
JCB Chairman Lord Bamford said the deal was a “major advance”, “a monumental deal, not just for us but for the UK as a whole. We have chosen to partner with the global leaders in green hydrogen and it is fabulous that two countries, the UK and Australia, can come together to create a brighter future.”
“This agreement demonstrates that green hydrogen does not need to be ‘transitioned’ via fossil fuel hydrogen” Bamford concluded, “production of it can commence at once, to meet the needs of all mobility. I have asked Andrew to deliver to me immediately that he has the capacity, and he has agreed.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/02/new-tech-to-recover-pure-silicon-from-end-of-life-solar-cells/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 2, 2021",New tech to recover pure silicon from end-of-life solar cells,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from India’s KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology have developed a new technique to recycle pure silicon from solar cells at the end of their lifecycle.
Unlike other conventional methods to recycle silicon from PV devices, the new technique is not based on the use of highly toxic chemical hydrofluoric acid, which is commonly utilised in the PV industry for both quartz cleaning and wafer etching. In solar module recycling, the corrosive acid is used for separating silicon from the cell by removing the antireflecting coating, silver, lead, and p-n junction.
The corrosive acid was replaced by the Indian group with three different chemicals: a 10 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was applied to the aluminium layer for five minutes at 63 degrees Celsius; a 6 M solution of nitric acid (HNO3) was utilised to remove the silver electrodes and lead; and a solution of 90% phosphoric acid was used to remove the antireflecting coating based on silicon nitride (Si3NA4) for 45 minutes at 70 degrees Celsius.
The outer parts of a solar panel such as glass, ethylene-vinyl acetate glass, copper, steel, aluminium, and plastic were previously removed through thermal degradation.
According to the scientists, the proposed technique is able to deliver recycled silicon with a purity of up to 99.9984%. The recycling cost for 1 kg solar cell with this process is estimated at $68.9 and the total profit after recycling a 1 kg solar cell is calculated to be $185.4. The recovered silicon can be used to manufacture new solar cells or electronic components such as diodes, transistors, and microchips, they explained.
The recycling technique is also said to enable the recovery of aluminium, silver, and lead as aluminium hydroxide, silver chloride, and lead oxide, respectively. It is described in the paper “Recovery of Pure Silicon and Other Materials from Disposed Solar Cells,” published in the International Journal of Photoenergy.
