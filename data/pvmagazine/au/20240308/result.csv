DAH Solar’s ‘Full Screen’ modules have a lowered frame, meaning water is able to run freely off the panel’s surface. The point of the design is to allow dusty residue to wash off the module easily unimpeded by the frame. Theoretically, this should allow the modules to be cleaned naturally by rain, leading to the claim they are ‘self-cleaning.’
It is a similar concept to Longi’s new Hi-MO X6 Guardian panel, which was launched at the same event in the adjacent booth. The key differences are that DAH Solar’s ‘Full Screen’ modules have lowered frames on all sides, rather than simply the short side – as is the case with Longi. 
DAH also has residential 440W and 475W panels, as well as commercial and industrial (C&I) sized panels at 585W and 595W.

The DAH panels are secured with a special rubber clamp, which is able to withstand temperatures up to 110°C, company representatives said.
DAH Solar is a newcomer to the Australian market, although the company was established back in 2009. The manufacturer is headquartered in China, with branches across the USA, Brazil, Germany, and Japan.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/08/state-of-charge-a-peek-into-economics-and-performances-within-nems-battery-fleet/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,2024-03-08,State-of-charge: a peek into economics and performances within NEM’s battery fleet,"The team at Global-Roam has had a growing interest in batteries since the beginning of the current development boom – a surge that can be traced back to that infamous Elon Musk tweet. With the 2023 edition of Generator Statistical Digest published a little over three weeks ago, its release provided me with the opportunity to dissect what the market data is revealing about the battery storage boom.
To begin, I’ve charted the long-term monthly revenue for all batteries in the National Electricity Market (NEM), breaking down ‘market revenue’ by source. The chart begins with the first output of Hornsdale Power Reserve back in November 2017.
Image: WattClarity, source GSD2023 Data Extract
Looking at the chart above, three key long-term trends stand out to me:
I also see that the last two bars in the chart demonstrate the early returns from the new 1 Sec Contingency markets since their introduction last October – but the sample size is too small to conclusively determine whether its introduction has contributed to a material uplift in total battery market revenue.
Here, I’ll discuss revenue in three parts:
But before looking into individual financial performance through these three streams, it’s worth first reminding our readers how the design characteristics of each battery, and contracted financial positions, play a role in revenue strategy.
Firstly, duration can play a significant role in how the operators bid their volume between the energy market and FCAS market as the fleet itself is made up of batteries of different shapes and sizes.
Image: WattClarity
In the chart below, we can see that being designed with a very short duration in the two most extreme examples (Dalrymple and Ballarat) plays a significant role in how their energy and FCAS bids are targeted.
Image: WattClarity
We can see a range of Spot-FCAS revenue splits for 2023. I’ve faded those batteries that spent time in commissioning throughout 2023 as it’s common for batteries to trade in energy before FCAS during their commissioning phase. Hence those revenue splits are unlikely to be indicative of long-term strategy.
It’s also worth noting that we are yet to see any batteries enter the market with more than two hours of duration. All current batteries are considered to be relatively ‘shallow’, which largely confines them to arbitrage intraday price spreads only. I’ve previously written on WattClarity about this, and the weak price signal for duration in the NEM’s current energy-only market design.
Of course, arbitrage and FCAS are not the only revenue sources for some batteries, as I will discuss below. Unfortunately, however, they are the only two where we have transparency. Another aspect that we don’t have full transparency over is any revenue protections that would insulate revenue below a certain baseline, for example:
Below is a simple plot of arbitrage revenue for each battery per MW of installed (maximum) capacity, ranked highest to lowest.
Image: WattClarity
By this simple metric, the 25MW Lake Bonney BESS came out on top by a fair margin. But also notably, I must highlight the relative underperformance of batteries in Victoria.
One significant contributing factor was the lack of ‘high-high’ prices in the region throughout 2023. We’ve extracted data from our GSD to put together the chart below which shows how effective each battery was at discharging during periods of extremely high prices. The column on the right shows the total time that the battery was exposed to a price above $10,000/MWh. For batteries that entered the market part-way through the year, the time shown is measured since the interval of first bid, hence factors are relative to time spent in the market.
Image: WattClarity
So whilst Bulgana and Hazelwood were relatively effective at capturing these ‘high-high’ prices, VIC only experienced 15 minutes of such prices throughout 2023. Meanwhile, SA experienced 4 hours and 50 minutes of the same extreme prices in 2023, of which Lake Bonney BESS was able to discharge more than half of its maximum capacity during these periods. This would be one of the significant factors in starting to explain the battery’s arbitrage overperformance.
In the chart above I’d also note that a low availability factor suggests that each of these batteries was not in a position to discharge during these price spikes. This could be for a number of reasons such as: being capped by duration, commissioning, FCAS enablements, auto-bidding algorithm, pre-IESS dispatch limitations, or capacity obligations such as those faced by the VIC Big Battery and Hornsdale Power Reserve (as will be discussed later).
Below we see FCAS revenue combined for these 10 markets for each battery, per MW of maximum capacity.
Image: WattClarity
The smaller batteries were at the top of this list with Ballarat, Queanbeyan, and Lake Bonney in the ‘top 3’ – noting that the latter two batteries also achieved the third highest and highest arbitrage revenue per MW of capacity, respectively.
As we generally see less price separation between regions for FCAS prices (in normal times) – there was not the same regional divide for FCAS revenue throughout 2023 as what we saw in Arbitrage revenue.
The chart below provides further context, showing a breakdown of this FCAS revenue into the three main categories.
Image: WattClarity
Interestingly, we can see that lower contingency revenue was fairly low across the board. This was due, at least in part, to relatively less volatile and softer prices (particularly in June and July) for these FCAS services across the NEM.
With the lack of a formal capacity mechanism in the NEM, we only get small glances at how batteries can use their capacity to generate revenue (or add portfolio value). This often comes via press releases or news articles, which are rarely heavy on details or contract terms. But it’s thought that this revenue source can be material. As an example, three weeks ago I noted that AGL’s half-year results presentation suggested that somewhere near 70% to 80% of the apparent revenue derived from their Torrens Island BESS  in FY24H1 was attributed to ‘capacity and portfolio benefits’.
For completeness, it’s worth a quick review of what these revenue sources may include, with some known examples.
Support agreements
These are agreements between the owner/operator of the battery with the transmission service provider, government, and/or the AEMO – such as the System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) or the Wide Area Protection Scheme (WAPS).
There are at least three batteries that have reportedly been contracted under SIPS or WAPS – the Hornsdale Power Reserve, the Dalrypme BESS, and the Victorian Big Battery. The service delivered is specific to each of those contracts – but in return, a fixed revenue is paid for reserving some amount of the battery’s capacity. In the case of the Victorian Big Battery, 250MW of its 300MW capacity is contracted to be reserved between November 1st to March 31st every summer from 2021 to 2032. They are paid $12.5 million per year (adjusted for inflation) for this service. And this obligation limits their ability to generate energy or FCAS revenue during those periods.
Image: WattClarity
From using ez2view to review rebid explanations, I can see that the battery undertook a brief  ‘Dynamic SIPS trial’ in late Feb 2023 for one week where their capacity available to the energy market temporarily increased. Curiously, I have also noted the load component of the battery doesn’t appear to be capacity-limited for summer 2023/24 thus far. But we have yet to have the time to fully investigate this.
Hornsdale originally signed a 10-year/$40m contract in 2017 under SIPS, but it was reported that this was superseded by an undisclosed contract in late 2020.
Virtual caps
Particularly for a generator with retail exposure, a battery can be utilised in place of a traditional cap contract. Hence the owner can potentially attribute the value of this foregone cost as capacity revenue.  In early 2020, UQ ran (and documented) a case study experimenting with this concept, albeit on a 1.1MW scale.
As Andrew Wilson noted in that WattClairty article, a ‘virtual cap’ is not a pure like-for-like replacement for a traditional cap as a battery can face physical limitations (e.g. being limited by duration, network constraints, etc.) whereas a financial derivative does not. It’s less clear how this additional risk is managed in practice.
Other
There are many other ways a battery can generate revenue or add value to a portfolio, to name just a few more:
This article is just a brief skim on the surface of generator performance – believe us, we just published an 1,180-page book of statistics about each one. However, there should be a couple of high-level takeaways from this review:

Energizer’s particularly high brand recognition means it has been slower off the mark to launch, with the company’s Head of Sales for the Australian Pacific Region, Gavin Owen, explaining it wanted to be careful to ensure its customer and installer experiences with the new hybrid product suite would uphold the brand’s established reputation.
Unlike most solar companies, Energizer is a household name – albeit for its consumer appliance batteries rather than renewable energy products. Energizer Solar has had solar panels and a string inverter on the Australian market for about two years now, but during the Smart Energy Expo in Sydney this week launched its new hybrid inverter and stackable home battery – which integrate with panels to complete its residential energy ‘ecosystem.’
Energizer Solar’s Powerstack hybrid battery can be made up of 2.9kWh units, stackable for durations between 5.7kWh to 20.16kWh. The range also includes 4.8kWh modules, stackable for durations between 9.32kWh to 33.24kWh. It is a lithium iron phosphate, or LIFeP, chemistry and includes a 10 year warranty.
In terms of its new hybrid solar inverters, the Force Series, the company has released a single phase 3kW – 6kW option and a three phase 5kW – 12 kW version.
Energizer Solar’s panels are 440W, with Owen pointing out that figure has a positive tolerance, meaning the panel’s wattage should never dip below 440W, only above. It expects to launch its electric vehicle (EV) charger in Australia in the coming six to 12 months.
Owen said the company is targeting the “mid to upper” bracket in the Australian market, priced below premium brands. He also noted that it has paid particular attention to ease of installation, limiting cables and focussing on simple integration. 
Owen said Energizer Solar, which is based in Australia, launched its full home ‘ecosystem’ here first because of Australia’s “solid solar residential market.” It is currently in the process of moving into the US market and already has select products in the European market, and will continue to expand there. Energizer Solar manufactures in China.
Owen also noted the company is currently “in talks” to integrate into Virtual Power Plant platforms.

Speaking at the Smart Energy Council conference in Sydney this week, Scully said the government is prioritising the development of renewable energy projects and will continue to work closely with industry and impacted communities to strike the right balance between supporting renewable energy projects and responsible development.
“The NSW planning system has been criticised for being too slow,” he said. “I confess, when we approved the Yanco Delta wind farm late last year, I was pretty surprised that it was the first wind farm to be approved in NSW in nearly three years.”
Scully said the government is aiming for almost 50 large-scale solar, wind, and battery storage projects to be approved in NSW this year.
“We have got a further 29 projects in the planning stage with an additional 20 projects expected to be submitted to the department or the coming months,” he said. “Most of these are expected to be determined this year.”
Jacqui Mumford, chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, welcomed Scully’s commitment to speed up the approvals process, saying renewable investors in NSW have been languishing while states like Victoria and Queensland have approved impressive amounts of renewable energy.
“We’ve been hearing for a long time that the approvals process in NSW isn’t fit for purpose,” she said.
“The process sounds almost Kafkaesque, with department officials unable to tell renewable development proponents what information they will need to provide in order to see a project approved.”
“Instead of standardised questions, applications are drip fed back and forth between investors and various agencies, leading to duplication and huge delays as different departments seem unable to talk to each other and work out if an application meets their various criteria.”
Scully’s commitment comes after the NSW government released data showing that 17 large-scale renewable energy projects were approved, either by the Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure (DPHI) or the Independent Planning Commission (IPC), in 2023.
The projects include three wind farms, six solar farms and nine large-scale battery projects with a combined capacity to generate and store 7.6 GW of renewable energy.
The approved solar farms include Terrain Solar’s 152 MW Marulan project at Carrick, X-Elio’s 90 MW Forest Glen at Minore, Blind Creek Solar’s 350 MW facility at Bungendore, Trina Solar’s 200 MW Glenallen project at Albury, Elgin Energy’s 60 MW Glanmire near Bathurst, and Oxley Solar’s 215 MW solar farm being developed in the state’s New England region.
The battery projects include Akaysha Energy’s 400 MW / 1,600 MWh Orana battery energy storage system (BESS), Acenergy’s 120 MW / 240 MWh Apsley BESS, and the 500 MW / 1000 MWh Wellington South BESS being developed jointly by Shell and Empyr Energy.
Firm Power secured approval for three big battery projects: the 150 MW / 300 MWh Muswellbrook and 50 MW / 100 MWh Awaba projects in the Hunter region, and the 170 MW / 340 MWh Beresfield battery.
Risen Energy’s 100 MW / 400 MWh Coleambally BESS, Neoen’s 500 MW / 1,000 MWh Great Western BESS at Wallerawang, and the 850 MW / 1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery being developed by Akaysha at Munmorah, on the state’s central coast, round out the nine battery approvals.
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the state is now almost halfway towards achieving it’s 2030 renewable generation target which is to supply 33 TWh within in the next six years, and over a quarter of the way to the 2 GW long-duration storage target.
“These approvals represent the NSW government’s commitment to accelerate the transition to renewables, so households and businesses have reliable access to clean and affordable electricity,” she said.
Sharpe said NSW is now home to approximately 13.5 GW of renewable energy generation capacity, about 53% of total generation in the state, and 574 MW of long-duration storage.

The Territory government attributed the widespread adoption to the Home and Businesses and Battery Scheme (HBBS), which offers grants of up to $5000 to eligible homeowners and businesses to install solar and battery storage, or a battery if a PV system is already installed.
Since its launch in 2020, the HBBS has provided more the $12 million in funding for the purchase and installation of batteries to complement rooftop solar systems and has directly contributed more than $45 million of works to the Territory economy.
The government said the number of applications received has grown each year with 970 applications submitted in 2022-23.
In 2023-24, the program has $3 million dedicated towards it to help more Territorians install a solar and battery system.
NT Energy Minister Kate Worden said the rollout of battery energy storage systems for households and businesses has widespread benefits, including improving the reliability and security of the electricity system by smoothing out demand from the grid.
“The Northern Territory climate is conducive to producing reliable solar energy, and this scheme helps for this natural asset to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and eases cost-of-living pressures,” she said.
“This scheme is one way we are building towards meeting our target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.”
The government said the HBBS program has also created much-needed economic stimulus, contributing more than $45 million to the Territory economy.

Four people were inside the townhouse at Lake Macquarie when the fire broke out last Thursday. FRNSW said two occupants escaped but two died. The tragedy is understood to be the first fatal fire involving a lithium-ion battery in NSW.
An FRNSW spokesperson told pv magazine that a report will be prepared for the NSW Coroner who will formally decide the cause of the deaths.
With the case before the Coroner, both FRNSW and NSW Police declined to publicly identify the manufacturer of the battery involved in the incident.
FRNSW Commissioner Jeremy Fewtrell said lithium-ion batteries as they can be dangerous when overheated, damaged or compromised, warning that lithium-ion battery-related fires can be “extremely intense and volatile” and challenging for firefighters to extinguish because of the high heat.
FRNSW is leading a cross-industry research program examining best-practice response to lithium-ion battery related fires, end-of-life lithium-ion battery hazard management, electric vehicle fires, and fire propagation in battery energy storage systems.
An outline of the Safety of Alternative and Renewable Energy Technologies (SARET) notes “there is a general lack of guidance and provisions in building codes, standards, and legislation in relation to safety to address the potential risks from these emerging technologies and part of the problem is that we do not yet know enough about their probability of failure, their mechanisms of failure and potential consequences of failure.”
In a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Lithium-ion batteries and Consumer Product Safety report in October 2023, the Australian Battery Industry Association (ABIA) said developing an industry-wide platform of data and information sharing on lithium batteries needs to be a priority.
ABIA Chair Stuart Hamilton told pv magazine that without the common platform of data sharing, it will be hard to create legislation, guidelines, education, and training.
“Because of the lithium battery industry’s infancy one of our priorities is the collation and sharing of information through all peak bodies, because there is a significant lack of understanding about lithium batteries which are very complex due to their chemistry variety,” he said.
