https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/03/us-lithium-giant-doubles-down-on-australian-production-plans/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,EV,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 3, 2023",US lithium giant doubles down on Australian production plans,"United States-headquartered Albemarle has unveiled expansion plans for its lithium hydroxide processing plant at Kemerton in the southwest of Western Australia, confirming it will build two new processing trains that will boost production capacity at the facility to 100,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium a year.
Albemarle said it will build two additional processing trains at its Kemerton plant to process spodumene ore concentrate from the Greenbushes mine in the WA’s southwest where it has a 49% stake alongside Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia, a joint venture between Australian miner IGO and China’s Tianqi Lithium.
When combined with recently completed trains one and two, the additional processing trains would increase the facility’s output by 50,000 tonnes a year, taking production capacity at the plant to 100,000 tonnes of battery grade lithium hydroxide per annum.
Albemarle said once completed, the expansion will make the plant the biggest lithium hydroxide processing facility outside of China with the plant capable of delivering enough battery-grade lithium to produce batteries for an estimated 2.4 million electric vehicles (EVs) each year.
It is estimated the capital expenditure for trains three and four will be more than $1.5 billion, building on the capital expenditure for trains one and two, which was also more than $1.5 billion.
Albemarle Chief Executive Officer Kent Masters said the decision to expand was driven by confidence in future demand with the high-value lithium products produced at the plant in demand from some of the world’s top manufacturers of electric vehicles (EVs), and electronic and energy storage products.
Masters said the worldwide push to reduce carbon emissions and the boom in lithium storage and EV manufacturing has boosted demand for high-quality lithium and refined products from safe and reliable free-trade status sources like Australia.
“Australia is essential to the global supply chain for energy storage and an important part of our diverse portfolio,” he said.
“Our decision to expand was driven by our confidence in future demand and allows us to offer customers additional supply from Greenbushes, well known as one of the world’s best lithium mines.”
Construction is expected to begin immediately, with the first product from the expansion expected in 2026.
Albemarle’s Country Manager Australia, Beverley East, said the expansion decision confirmed Australia’s critical role in the global lithium supply chain and would be a boon for local jobs and businesses, and the broader state and national economies for years to come.
The announcement comes as Albemarle continues its pursuit of Perth-based miner Liontown Resources in the hopes of snaring its Kathleen Valley spodumene mine in WA’s Goldfields region.
Liontown earlier this year rejected a $5.5 billion buyout offer from Albermarle, valued at $2.50 per share. It is understood Liontown is seeking $3 a share.
The Kathleen Valley project, being developed near Leinster, about 680 kilometres north-east of Perth, is expected to initially produce about 500,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate per annum, but Liontown hopes to expand production to 700,000 tonnes by 2029.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/03/why-green-ammonia-may-not-be-that-green/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 3, 2023",Why green ammonia may not be that green,"For a given volume, ammonia – a molecule made up of three hydrogen atoms and one nitrogen atom – carries about 50% more hydrogen atoms than hydrogen itself.
As ammonia contains only hydrogen and nitrogen, it does not emit carbon dioxide when used. If made using green hydrogen (produced with renewable energy), its production also does not emit carbon dioxide. Therefore, green ammonia could help achieve a net-zero world, particularly as a fuel for long-haul transport and heavy industry.

Australia is well placed to develop a major renewable hydrogen export industry, potentially using green ammonia. Proposed projects include Cape Hardy, Collinsville, Australian Renewable Energy Hub, HyNQ, H2Tas and Gibson Island.
Unfortunately, just because ammonia doesn’t contain carbon, that doesn’t make it good for the environment. It’s a source of nitrogen pollution, which has many damaging environmental impacts. Despite Australia’s natural advantage in producing green ammonia, we ironically have the biggest per capita nitrogen footprint in the world.
Rarely, though, do green ammonia proponents critically assess its environmental sustainability beyond net zero claims.
 
The Stockholm Resilience Centre defines nine processes that regulate Earth to support life as we know it. The boundaries of a “safe operating space” have been defined for each process.
You probably won’t be surprised to know climate change is one of the boundaries we have exceeded. You could be forgiven for thinking it has been our biggest impact on the planet. But that “honour” goes to biogeochemical flows of nutrients, mostly as a result of nitrogen fertilisers.
Why? Well it comes back to ammonia.

Nitrogen makes up 78% of our atmosphere as dinitrogen gas (N₂). However, in this form it is inaccessible to living organisms.
To support life, nitrogen must be converted into reactive forms such as ammonia. Once it reaches ecosystems, ammonia undergoes a series of chemical transformations. Eventually it breaks up again into N₂, and the cycle can start over again.
For millions of years, the processes in each step of the cycle have been in balance. However, industrial fertiliser production in the 20th century has thrown this cycle out of balance.
On the upside, ammonia has been a miracle chemical for growing food. An estimated 3.5 billion people are being fed thanks to chemical fertilisers. This means almost half of the world’s population would go hungry if not for synthetic ammonia.
The downside is too much reactive nitrogen is ending up in the environment – more than twice as much as the recommended planetary boundary.
In the case of excess nitrogen, crossing its planetary boundary has already had huge consequences. It has led to deterioration of ecosystems, photochemical smog, acid rain and health problems such as respiratory illnesses and cancer, algal blooms leading to fish kills such as the recent one at Menindee Lakes, damage to the Great Barrier Reef, and greenhouse gases much more potent than carbon dioxide.
Producing additional ammonia as a renewable energy carrier could make these problems even worse.
Some estimate ammonia supply chains leak it into the environment at rates as high as 6%. However, research is limited. More widely understood natural gas supply chains may provide a ballpark figure of around 2.6%.
Replacing fossil fuels with ammonia for long-haul trucks and shipping might reduce the carbon footprint of transport (which accounts for 37% of total carbon dioxide emissions). Yet, if 2.6% of ammonia leaked from the supply chain, we estimate this could triple the reactive nitrogen flux, further overshooting the planetary boundary. At a 6% leakage rate, it could be four times.
We all know how climate change has been changing our world – and that is at “only” 1.2 times the carbon planetary boundary. Using green ammonia as a renewable energy carrier could have an even greater impact on the nitrogen planetary boundary.
Another renewable energy carrier can be made from green hydrogen: methanol. It’s a molecule of four hydrogen atoms and single carbon and oxygen atoms.
Like ammonia, methanol can be used as a fuel. It could replace petrochemical feedstocks used in industrial processes and manufacturing. Our research shows methanol could also enable biotechnology to better integrate with industrial processes.
More significantly, methanol doesn’t affect the nitrogen cycle. As long as it is made using a renewable source of carbon, such as carbon dioxide from direct air capture, there is a net zero impact on the environment. International Energy Agency projections show the United States has a greater emphasis on green methanol, while Australia and Europe are more focused on green ammonia.
Environmental sustainability means more than net zero. In the case of green ammonia, holistic thinking is needed so we don’t solve one problem only to make another worse.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/03/snowy-2-0-pumped-hydro-project-faces-another-two-year-delay/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 3, 2023",Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project faces another two-year delay,"Federal government-owned utility Snowy Hydro has confirmed that the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project is facing up to another two years of delays that would push expected electricity production beyond its already delayed date of completion to December 2029.
The expansion of the existing 4.1G W Snowy pumped hydro scheme, originally forecast to provide 2 GW of on-demand generation and 350 GWh of long-duration energy storage to the National Electricity Market (NEM), was first announced in 2017.
The project, which involves linking the Tantangara and Talbingo dams via 27 kilometres of tunnels, was originally due to be operational by 2021 and was expected to cost about $2 billion but it has been plagued by time and budget blowouts. The last estimates had the cost of the project at close to $6 billion with some estimating that the all-up cost has now blown out to $10 billion-plus while the project was previously expected to come online in 2027.
In a statement on Wednesday, Snowy Hydro said it anticipates that the timeline for full commercial operation has been “delayed by a further 12-24 months” from the current publicly released dates, with likely “cost impacts beyond the contingency allowed.”
“A combination of factors have meant that it’s pretty clear that the schedule will go out by between one and two years,” Snowy Hydro Chief Executive Officer Dennis Barnes told Radio National. “Over the next few months, we’ll work through what the cost implications are.”

Snowy Hydro said its management team is working towards “resetting” the project’s delivery timeline and budget with principal contractor Future Generation – a joint venture between Italy’s Webuild and US-based Lane Construction.
Barnes, who took on the CEO roll earlier this year, said he wanted to place the project on a “realistic and sustainable footing while maintaining construction progress.”
“This project is critically important to the transition of Australia’s electricity grid and it’s crucial that we are working to a safe, efficient and realistically achievable timeframe to enable orderly planning for all our stakeholders,” he said.
“I am committed to being transparent about our progress and how we are proactively managing the inevitable issues and challenges that arise in a complex project like this.”
Barnes attributed the latest delays and cost increases to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, inflation and design changes sparked by the complexity of the project.
The developers have also encountered geological issues with tunnelling on the project taking longer than expected.
The latest difficulty has seen Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Florence, one of three machines drilling tunnels to connect the project, at a standstill for four months after becoming stuck in soft soil.
Barnes said the machine had only dug about 150 metres of the 15-kilometre tunnel since starting in November but expected the issue to soon be rectified.
“When the machine gets moving, which we’re expecting in weeks not months, then we do expect that the machine will move at the rate of more than 10 metres a day,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/03/alinta-pushes-ahead-with-wa-solar-and-battery-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 3, 2023",Alinta pushes ahead with WA solar and battery project,"Alinta Energy has awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for its $180 million Port Hedland Solar Battery Hybrid project which will see an initial 45 MW solar farm and 35 MW, one-hour battery energy storage system installed alongside its existing gas-fired power station site near Port Hedland on Western Australia’s north coast.
Engineering firm UGL, part of the Sydney-headquartered Cimic Group, has been appointed to deliver the battery energy storage system while SEPD Monford, a collaboration between Chinese engineering firm Shanghai Electric Power Design Institute and Perth-based construction specialist Monford Group, will deliver the solar component.
The solar farm will comprise an estimated 100,000 PV panels to be installed on a 100-hectare site about 500 metres east of Alinta’s existing gas-fired Port Hedland Power Station, located about 14 kilometres southwest of the Pilbara tow. The battery will be built adjacent to the existing power station.
Alinta said it expects contractors will be on site from July with the facility predicted to be operational by late 2024.
“We’re excited to bring these EPC partners on board to help us deliver the project for BHP and look forward to a safe and successful construction phase,” Alinta Chief Development Officer Ken Woolley said.
The large-scale solar and battery hybrid project underpins a power purchase agreement with BHP that’s expected to halve emissions from the generation of electricity used to power the mining giant’s iron ore port facilities in Port Hedland.
Once completed, the solar farm is expected to supply 100% of the average daytime energy requirements for BHP’s iron-ore operations in Port Hedland, with the remaining power requirements to be met through the integrated battery system and Alinta’s existing gas-fuelled power station.
The 45 MW solar farm and 35 MW battery is expected to form the foundation for a much larger renewable energy generation and storage facility at Port Hedland with Alinta having already secured development approvals for the sites that could facilitate a future expansion to a 60 MW two-hour battery storage system and 90 MW solar array.
Alinta’s strategy is to use the new solar farm and the big battery to respond to demand from its corporate customers for cleaner energy.

The appointment of EPC contractors for the Port Hedland project comes as Alinta continues to assess the sell-down of its WA operations.
The Sydney-headquartered company, owned by Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, is reportedly seeking to offload an 80% stake in its generation and transmission assets in WA with bankers Goldman Sachs appointed to oversee the transaction.
Alinta’s Pilbara assets include the existing Port Hedland Power Station, the 60 MW Chichester Solar Farm, and the 178 MW dual fuel (gas and distillate) Newman Power Station and associated 35 MW/11 MWh battery energy storage system. Alinta also owns and operates transmission infrastructure in the region including high-voltage power lines and gas pipelines.
It is expected a formal auction for the assets will be launched later this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/03/low-cost-portable-sun-tracker-for-offgrid-solar/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MAURITIUS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 3, 2023","Low-cost, portable sun-tracker for offgrid solar","From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Mauritius have designed a tracking system that can be used with portable, lightweight PV systems for use in remote areas in tropical climates.
The scientists describe the tracker as a low-cost device using a simplified and mechanically driven tracking mechanism. It can be connected to one solar panel and is able to orientate its linear displacement at each of the four corners of the module itself and make it rotate along the three principal axes. A power screw arrangement driven by DC motors enables the movement of the tracker.
“A motor coupler was used as a connector between the DC motors and lead screw,” they said. “The lead screw had pitch and diameter specifications of 1 mm and 8 mm respectively.”
Through the direction and rotational speed of the motors, PV system owners can achieve their desired tilt angles by precisely adjusting each corner of the solar panel.
“For smooth operation of the solar tracker, the four linear actuators were linked to the main stage by considering a ball-joint system based on aluminium balls of 18 mm in diameter,” they said. “To protect the motor components and electronic circuit from adverse weather conditions, a lightweight protective casing made from aluminium composite panel (ACP) namely, alucobond was used. The protective casing had cross-sectional area and height dimensions of 25 by 25 cm and 20 cm respectively.”
The system moves the panel in accordance with the positioning of the sun based on the sensor data transmitted and processed by the Arduino Uno open-source microcontroller, which follows a voltage difference observed in the corresponding paired sensors due to variation in light intensity.
“The paired motors operate in synchronisation but in the opposite direction in order to induce a tilting effect to the solar panels,” they said. “To achieve an optimised orientation in the three principle axes, the remaining two motors also operate in a similar fashion to compensate for tilting of the solar panel in accordance with variation in light intensity as detected by the two additional sensors.”
The academics built a system prototype with a solar module measuring 450 mm x 170 mm with a power output of 22.5 W. The research group said the system was able to generate 37% more current than a reference panel without the tracker.
“The proposed device is projected to produce a total energy output of up to 8100 Wh if operated for 12 h over a 30-day period and if meeting the set target of maximum power output of 22.5 W,” it concluded.
The team described the device in “Low-cost solar tracker to maximise the capture of solar energy in tropical countries,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.
“The cost analysis and portability test showed that the final designed system met the initially set targets in this study,” they said.
