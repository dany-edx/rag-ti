The project, built adjacent to the 275 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm in the state’s Riverina region, comprises the 60 MW/120 MWh Riverina 1, the 65 MW/130 MWh Riverina 2 and the 25 MW/50 MWh Darlington Point battery energy storage systems. The battery system’s output is sufficient to supply 240,000 homes with two hours of electricity at peak times.
Edify Chief Executive John Cole said the grid-forming battery system “elevates the playing field” with the firming technology helping to iron out the variable output of wind and solar.
“The potential for battery storage technology is immense,” he said. “It is a key part of the clean energy transition and goes hand in glove with harnessing and firming Australia’s abundant renewable resources.”
The Riverina battery system utilises Tesla Megapacks fitted with grid-forming inverters, operating in a ‘virtual synchronous generator’ mode. This allows the storage system to function in a manner similar to a traditional generator, providing crucial system strength services to help facilitate the connection of future clean energy power plants in the region.
“Advanced power electronics technology is key to addressing our energy challenges,” Cole said.
Edify designed and developed the battery but in June sold a 90% stake in the project to Federation Asset Management.
Stephen Panizza, co-founder and head of renewable energy at the Sydney-based private equity firm said the need for large-scale energy storage is becoming increasingly important as the nation’s aging coal plants retire.
“Advanced grid-forming batteries like the Riverina BESS are critical to extracting the maximum capacity from our existing grid infrastructure, allowing timely integration of additional wind and solar generation into the NEM while our grid infrastructure is upgraded,” he said.
The Riverina battery system is the largest battery energy storage system yet connected to the National Electricity Market in NSW, having overtaken the 50 MW/75 MWh Wallgrove Grid Battery in western Sydney.
Both batteries are however set to be relegated with a plethora of mega-scale batteries planned for NSW.
Origin Energy has commenced construction of the first stage of a planned 700 MW/2,800 MWh battery at its coal-fired power plant site at Eraring in the NSW Hunter region. Stage one of the Eraring battery involves construction of a 460 MW battery storage system with a dispatch duration of two hours. French energy giant Neoen has announced plans to build a 500 MW/1,000 MWh big battery at the site of the former Wallerawang coal power station site in the Central Tablelands region. Shell Energy is also seeking to develop a 500 MW/1,000 MWh battery at that site while electricity gen-tailer EnergyAustralia is planning to build a 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery energy storage system adjacent to its Mount Piper coal-fired power station in the state’s central west.
These batteries will however all be overshadowed by the proposed Waratah Super Battery Project that is being built by BlackRock battery offshoot Akaysha Energy on the state’s Central Coast.
The 850 MW/1,680 MWh battery, being installed at the site of the decommissioned Munmorah coal-fired power station near Doyalson north of Sydney, will be the largest standby network battery in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the biggest in the world.
Construction of the WSB began in May and is targeted for completion before August 2025.

The deal provides for the offtake of up to 337.5 MW of solar energy and renewable generation certificates at an undisclosed fixed price over the 25-year term of the agreement. Genex said the PPA enables it and development partner J-Power to confirm solar as first stage of the Bulli Creek project.
Genex Chief Executive Officer Craig Francis said the Sydney-headquartered developer had acquired the Bulli Creek project in 2022, initially envisioning a stand-alone battery energy storage system as the first stage.
“However, securing this long-term 25-year offtake agreement with Fortescue for 337.5 MW of solar capacity at Bulli Creek has reshaped the first stage of the project into a large-scale solar farm,” he said.
Francis said he expects the agreement with Fortescue, which provides a 75% contracted revenue stream, will underpin a solar farm capacity of 450 MW, with the long-term nature of the agreement “highly attractive for prospective project financiers.”
“Discussions are continuing with external parties for further offtake to support a solar farm capacity of up to 775 MW for this first stage of the project,” he said, noting that this would position the Bulli Creek solar farm as the largest solar farm connected to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Genex is developing the Bulli Creek solar and battery project in partnership with Japanese electric utility J-Power on a 5,000-heactare site about 150 kilometres southwest of Toowoomba in Queensland’s Western Downs region.
Genex said the initial solar farm stage will be followed by a battery energy storage system of up to 400 MW/1,600 MWh capacity, with the potential for further solar and/or energy storage stages to follow up to the full 2 GW capacity at the project site.
The first stage of the project is targeted to reach a final investment decision in late 2024, with first energy production targeted in 2026.
Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson said the solar energy procured under the Bulli Creek PPA would meet a portion of the renewable energy requirements for a proposed 70,000-tonne green hydrogen production facility at Gibson Island near Brisbane.
The Gibson Island proposal includes the construction of a 550 MW electrolysis plant capable of producing up to 70,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually, which would then be converted into green ammonia for Australian and export markets. It is expected the project will need about 1 GW of renewable energy contracts.
“It is the first PPA for the project and finalising it is an important milestone in our pursuit of a targeted final investment decision this calendar year,” Hutchinson said.
“We’re also helping Genex and J-Power to deliver their project and bring new renewable energy capacity online in Queensland – close to 115 MW from this first stage is surplus to our contracted share and will therefore flow back into the electricity grid.”
Fortescue said the PPA is conditional on it reaching a final investment decision on Gibson Island by December 31 this year, and Genex achieving financial close on the first stage of its Bulli Creek Solar Project by 31 December 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/09/humelink-report-casts-shadow-on-transgrids-underground-costings/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",HumeLink report casts shadow on Transgrid’s underground costings,"Community advocacy group Stop, Rethink Humelink, said a new report shows that putting the proposed 360-kilometre transmission project underground instead of overhead could be done on a like-for-like basis for $7.3 billion (USD 4.65 billion). New South Wales (NSW) transmission network operator Transgrid has previously stated that undergrounding would be 57.5% higher in costs at $11.5 billion.
The HumeLink project is to deliver about 360 kilometres of 500 kV double-circuit transmission lines, connecting Wagga Wagga, Bannaby and Maragle in southern NSW. It will also connect the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project to the grid.
Transgrid has said the overhead option is expected to cost $5 billion, up by about 30% since the original $3.3 billion budget was submitted to the regulator three years ago.
Rethink HumeLink spokesperson and cattle grazier Michael Katz said the new report, completed by Brisbane-based energy consultant Amplitude, shows that Transgrid’s estimates – detailed in a feasibility report prepared by engineering consultant GHD – are based on incorrect costings, even in light of recent cost increases in both cable supply and installation.
“This report makes a complete nonsense of claims that undergrounding is too expensive and will add significant costs to energy consumers,” he said.
“It is now time for the government to rethink Rewiring the Nation and implement undergrounding as a default like other countries such as Germany. Then we can get on with the job of making renewable energy a reality in this country – with community support.”
HumeLink is one of five transmission projects labelled critical for the energy transition by the Australian Energy Market Operator but faces ongoing opposition from communities along the route. Landowners along the study corridor have raised serious concerns about the social, economic and environmental costs of overhead transmission line impacting their regions.
The report from Amplitude comes after a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the feasibilty of burying the transmission infrastructure found putting them underground would be too costly and would put the energy grid under pressure.
Labor MLC and inquiry chairperson Emily Suvaal said in August that despite significant community outcry, there were multiple hurdles to putting the lines underground.
“Cost was a factor. We acknowledge it’s not what many in the local community are calling for,” she said.
“Given the push to net zero [and] we’ve got coal fired power stations coming offline … we heard evidence that [undergrounding] would not be workable in today’s energy climate.”
Amplitude however said it had uncovered significant shortcomings in previous cost estimates.
“The main concerns with the GHD report is in the costing of the HVDC underground cables,” the report reads. “Comparing the cost per kilometre presented by GHD for the HVDC underground options with our own estimates and other benchmarks … it is clear that even within the range of accuracy and considering current market cost pressures, the cost per kilometre used by GHD is excessive.”
Amplitude also said that building the transmission cables underground provided other advantages, including reducing fire risk and lowering maintenance costs and energy losses, compared to overhead wires.

Stanwell is already working with ESI to establish a 1 MW/10 MWh iron flow battery pilot project near Rockhampton on Queensland’s central coast and now the state government has penned an agreement that could deliver a 150 MW battery with up to 14 hours of storage capacity.
The agreement, announced by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk during her recent State of the State address, also provides Stanwell with rights to purchase up to 200 MW of iron flow battery energy storage a year from 2026.
“Stanwell has now entered into a partnership with Energy Storage Industries Asia Pacific to secure the first large-scale deployment of locally made flow batteries in Australia,” Palaszczuk said.
“Stanwell and Energy Storage Industries are now working on an initial 150 MW battery project with the ongoing rights to purchase up to 200 MW per annum.”
The announcement comes with work having already started on the pilot project that will deliver a 10 MWh iron flow battery storage system. The battery, the first technology to be tested at Stanwell’s Future Energy and Innovation Training Hub being built at the coal-fired Stanwell Power Station site near Rockhampton, is expected to be operational by September 2024.
ESI Managing Director Stuart Parry said the pilot project will confirm the viability of iron flow batteries for medium- and long-duration energy storage and the viability of deploying the technology at scale.
Parry said the company’s iron flow batteries can provide up to 14 hours of energy storage capacity, making them ideal for supporting and firming the electricity network during high demand and low renewable energy generation.
“The battery at Stanwell Clean Energy Hub is the first of many that will be deployed across the state to help stabilise energy supply from renewables and provide energy at night or when the sun doesn’t shine,” he said.
“We look forward to working with Stanwell to deliver this and future projects, which are critical to supplying Queensland’s long-term energy needs.”
EIS batteries are to be manufactured in a new facility being built at Maryborough with the centre expected to be operational in 2024. The company said its batteries have a lifecycle of 25 years, are entirely recyclable and made with environmentally friendly electrolytes produced in Townsville.
Parry said the company plans to expand its operations so that, by the end of 2026, it will be capable of delivering up to 400 MW of battery energy storage systems annually.
Stanwell Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Rourke said the agreement with ESI forms part of the corporation’s energy transition with the state government identifying large-scale energy storage as fundamental to achieving its renewable energy targets.
“To deliver the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, Stanwell is building a renewable energy portfolio of at least 9 to 10 GW by 2035, and at least 3 to 3.5 GW of energy storage,” he said.

China’s JinkoSolar has developed a new all-in-one energy storage system, including 215 kWh lithium-ion batteries with liquid cooling.
The product, which comes as an outdoor cabinet, integrates battery packs, a battery management system (BMS), a power conversion system (PCS), and fire-fighting equipment. It also has a maximum input voltage of 1,000 V.
The SunGiga JKS-215KLAA-100PLAA system’s battery has rated AC power of up to 100 KW.
It holds a non-uniform flow channel design to control cell temperature differences of up to 2 C. In addition, it offers several liquid control options to reduce power consumption.
“Due to the liquid cooling technology, the system comes with a lower battery temperature difference, extending the lifetime of batteries and significantly improving the charging and discharging efficiency,” JinkoSolar said. “The automatic state of charge calibration and the automated coolant refilling considerably reduce operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.”
The system offers cabinet expandability and modular design. It also has temperature, smoke and combustible gas sensors for the suppression of thermal runaway. According to its product sheet, the JKS-215KLAA-100PLAA also contains a cloud-based monitoring and operating platform.
“This solution simplifies the transportation, installation, and O&M processes associated with energy storage solutions through a combination of several components,” the company added. “It streamlines the transportation, installation, and O&M.”

Fortunately, the 2022 Integrated System Plan (ISP) from the AEMO provides a guide to get there.
Unsurprisingly, a significant buildout of variable renewable energy (solar and wind) will be required to reach the 82% by 2030 target. The ISP has a VRE installed capacity requirement of 44GW by 2030, requiring 23GW of VRE to be installed over the next 6 years[1], or roughly 4GW of VRE annually from now to 2030.
To date, the VRE buildout has (roughly) seen equal growth of utility-scale solar and wind (9GW solar and 11GW wind) in the NEM. Assuming a similar growth profile for the two technologies would mean around 2GW of solar needs to be built year on year over the next 6 years. For context, over the last 5 years in the NEM, utility-scale solar has been added at an annual average annual rate of 1.2GW.
Despite this step change in utility solar investment required over the next 6 years, it is becoming increasingly difficult to envisage that, given the current policy settings, these targets will be met. Some current headwinds to utility solar investment include:
This Chart of the week highlights the current issues facing utility solar investment in the NEM by looking at the generation outcomes in NSW on Sunday, 1 October. The chart shows the volume of utility-scale solar that was self-curtailed due to the wholesale price available being below the price the solar farm can break even (on a wholesale price plus large-scale generation certificate price basis). Between 9am-2pm around 2GW, or half of the NSW’s utility-solar capacity, was self-curtailed. Interestingly, this was also the minimum generation volume of the NSW’s black coal assets throughout the day which are required to continue operating at a minimum available capacity to meet the evening peak.
The results above are not an isolated event, with a third of solar generation for the month of September exposed to negative prices. This will be exacerbated by the continued march of rooftop solar, which is forecast to add another 4.5GW over the next 6 years[2] in NSW. To be clear, some curtailment is to be expected as the NEM transitions to the target of 82% renewables, as there will have to be enough renewable generation through the winter months to meet targets.
However, if across the NEM to 2030, around 2GW per year of utility-scale solar is required and 2.1GW of rooftop solar is forecast, it seems likely that the market will be oversupplied more often over the coming years[3].
Whilst extending the RET is an option to improve the economics of utility-scale solar and is being promoted within the industry (Extend the RET), the position of the NSW Government to subsidise the extension of coal generation is also a decision that will do nothing to improve the economics of utility-scale solar as illustrated in the chart above.
In the 2023 ESOO, AEMO outlined several combinations of dispatchable capacity that would result in sufficient capacity across all the scenarios modelled. These are outlined in the table below:
If the purported figure of $3b to extend Eraring’s retirement date by two years is accurate, then the NSW Government should be considering if any of the combinations above might be a more efficient use of money, particularly as the investments will remain available for a duration greater than two years. In addition, the prolonged presence of coal generation and the lower daytime prices that are a consequence also increase the risk in NSW that the LTESA contract options will be triggered by investors, which will mean NSW customers are paying for both the extension of Eraring and the topping up of solar contracts due to periods of low prices.
Speculatively, a combination of utility-scale and residential two-hour BESS (2,305MW in total) installed at $1,300/kW would result in the same total costs as the Eraring extension whilst still meeting the stringent Interim Reliability Measure and adding daytime load to the system to support daytime solar prices.
Focusing on residential battery uptake in particular would also resolve a number of the risks AEMO have highlighted in the 2023 ESOO, such as:
Using numbers from the 2023 IASR, an additional 800MW of residential storage is expected from FY24 to FY27. With a $3b push and given the success of subsidies in turbo-charging rooftop PV, it seems a missed opportunity to rely on the residential battery market to grow organically when an escalation of residential battery capacity could reduce many of the issues facing the grid throughout the transition. Increasing daytime load would also support the continued integration of utility-scale variable renewable energy in the grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/09/new-method-to-take-pv-plant-measurements-in-the-field/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"OCTOBER 9, 2023",New method to take PV plant measurements in the field,"From pv magazine Global
A Spanish research team developed a measurement method to measure standard test condition (STC) of PV module power in the field with lower levels of uncertainty compared to conventional methods, which may have implications to improve productivity for operations and maintenance (O&M) teams performing quality control assessments.
The new approach eliminates the need for removing and reinstalling the tested PV modules from their operating positions, which the scientists describe as a “cumbersome and expensive task and represents a risk for the physical integrity of the modules.”
The procedure entails using a reference module and taking into consideration the temperature differences between the reference and the tested module. It involves two radio-linked I-V tracers to simultaneously measure I-V curves and temperature measurements at the centres of both the reference and the tested modules.
The scientists conducted seven testing campaigns at commercial PV plants. Measurements were carried out on over 7000 I-V curves on 600 PV modules. The resulting estimated uncertainties are slightly higher than those corresponding to high-quality solar simulators, but still low enough to meet strict quality control requirements, according to the researchers.
“We are able to apply very low-uncertainty measurements of PV modules in the field, which paves the way for accomplishing degradation measurements directly by the O&M teams of PV plants and on a regular basis,” Rodrigo Moretón, CEO of Spanish photovoltaic engineering and consultancy firm Qualifying Photovoltaics (QPV), told pv magazine.
The results from these testing campaigns suggested that four testing rounds, delayed at least 2 hours, resulted in average expanded uncertainties in STC power of about 1.3% for the average power of a sample of modules, according to the researchers.  The uncertainty in single module values was twice as large but still sufficient to detect anomalous defective or underrated modules.
“The results have been validated against those obtained by an accredited lab with a mobile flash, obtaining similar standard deviation values (<1%), which entails a further confirmation of the procedure validity,” said the research team.
The researchers also claimed the instrumentation allowed over 500 measurements to be taken per day, provided the modules were previously cleaned and disconnected from the PV array so that terminals could be easily accessed. “This represents more than twice the numbers currently achieved with mobile solar simulators,” stated the researchers.
The research team comprised scientists from QPV, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and Spanish renewable energy company Acciona Energia. Its findings are available in the paper “On outdoor testing procedures of large samples of PV modules,” published in Progress in Photovoltaics.
