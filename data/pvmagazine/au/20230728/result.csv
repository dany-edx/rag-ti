Horizon Chief Executive Officer Stephanie Unwin said the pilot program will support the organisation’s focus on solving the technical challenges associated with establishing long-duration energy storage solutions in harsh conditions.
“The VFB is specifically designed to deliver large amounts of energy over a long period of time and is temperature resilient, which is critical for our unique regional and remote networks,” she said.
“This is an exciting trial which will allow us to increase our understanding of the technology in a regional energy system and its ability to provide long periods of 100% renewable energy.”
VSUN Energy, a subsidiary of Perth-based mining company Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), will supply, install and commission the battery energy storage system for Horizon at Kununurra.
The 220 kWh battery, which will be capable of delivering up to 78 kW of power, will be sourced from United Kingdom-based manufacturer Invinity Energy Systems.
Vanadium redox flow battery technology was first developed at the University of New South Wales in 1980s but it has failed to reach the same levels of acceptance that lithium-ion technology has achieved.
This is surprising for advocates of the technology who say VFBs can be charged and completely or partially discharged hundreds of thousands of times without degradation; and the electrolyte remains unchanged – it can be recycled into another battery or used in other applications when the first installation reaches its end of life. VFBs are also non-flammable, and scalable but these batteries suffer from comparatively low energy densities.
Invinity Chief Commercial Officer Matt Harper said the technology provides a “proven and commercialised” alternative to the lithium-ion battery technology which currently dominates stationary energy storage applications.
“Due to their durability, safety and reliability, vanadium flow batteries have a vital role to play in reducing the use of fossil fuels in power generation, particularly in remote communities,” he said.
Site planning and development work for the Kununurra battery is already underway, with the VFB to be delivered and installed later this year.
AVL Chief Executive Officer Graham Arvidson said the deal with Horizon is the first with an Australian energy utility and a sign of growing interest for VFB technology.
“VSUN Energy has been actively pursuing opportunities for VFB deployments and is seeing an increased interest from all energy sectors,” he said, noting Horizon’s support of the technology will also the company’s planned vertical integration ‘pit to battery’ strategy.
AVL’s flagship Australian Vanadium Project includes the mining, concentrating and processing of vanadium for use in electrolyte production. The project includes the extraction of high-grade vanadium from AVL’s mine near Meekatharra in the state’s mid-west and transporting to its Tenindewa plant for processing.
“Future VFB projects in Australia will not only be deployed locally, but have significant local content, including AVL’s vanadium electrolyte from its plant which is currently under construction in Wangara,” Arvidson said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/28/victoria-pushes-switch-from-gas-to-all-electric/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 28, 2023",Victoria pushes switch from gas to all electric,"Victorian Environment Minister Lily D’Ambrosio has announced that from 1 January 2024 planning permits for new homes and residential subdivisions will only connect to all electric networks, reducing the state’s dependency on fossil gas.
The state government said the changes will apply to all new homes requiring a planning permit, including new public and social housing delivered by Homes Victoria while any future state government building will also be gas free. The state said commencing immediately, all new public buildings that haven’t reached design stage will also be all electric. This includes new schools, hospitals, police stations and other government-owned buildings.
D’Ambrosio said Victorians have been at the mercy of private gas companies for too long and the transition to renewable alternatives will help the state achieve its renewable energy and emissions targets.
“Reducing our reliance on gas is critical to meeting our ambitious emission reduction target of net zero by 2045 and getting more Victorians on more efficient electric appliances will save them money on their bills,” she said.
Victorians use more gas in their homes and businesses than people in any other state or territory with about 80% of homes connected. The fossil fuel contributes about 17% to the state’s net greenhouse gas emissions.
Going all electric is expected to slash about $1,000 per year off household energy bills while those households with rooftop solar installed are expected to save about $2,200 annually.
“We know that with every bill that arrives, gas is only going to get more expensive,” D’Ambrosio said. “That’s why we’re stepping in to help even more Victorians get the best deal on their energy bills.”
As part of the all-electric initiative, the Victorian government has announced a new $10 million Residential Electrification Grants program. The grants will be made available to volume home builders, developers and others to provide bulk rebates for solar panels, solar hot water and heat pumps to new home buyers up front.
The government will also invest $1 million in targeted training across the construction industry. D’Ambrosio said this will complement Solar Victoria’s $11 million training and workforce development package that was announced to upskill plumbers and electricians to take advantage of the renewable energy transition.
The announcement follows the lead of the Australian Capital Territory, which will have new regulations in place by the end of the year prohibiting new gas connections in new suburb or new infill developments.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/28/pv-meets-miner-expectations-to-power-mineral-resources-wa-site/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",CHAD BENNETT,"JULY 28, 2023",PV meets miner expectations to power Mineral Resources’ WA site,"Diesel use has been quickly reduced at the remote Wonmunna mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Innovative mounting structure provider 5B deployed the 2.1 MW system in just two weeks, using five workers on site. The solar array is comprised of 45 preassembled 5B Mavericks comprising more than 4,000 solar panels.
The Wonmunna project was deployed in partnership with Western Australian integrated energy specialist UON.
The solar-plus-storage system features a 1 MWh battery and will underpin more than 30% of the mine’s power requirements per year, cutting annual diesel consumption by approximately 760,000 litres. Mineral Resources said the array will reduce the site’s carbon emissions by approximately 2,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.
In summer months, the system is forecast to produce up to 1.5 times its current daily output, which would provide more than 40% of the site’s daily energy needs.
The iron-ore crusher at the site will be 100% powered by the system in the middle of the day, when renewable output meets peak plant load.
Net zero driver
Mineral Resources, which is also involved in lithium ore extraction, implemented its roadmap to net zero strategy in 2021, with the displacement of diesel fuels a key part of that strategy. Projects like Wonmunna will be integral in accelerating that process.
“MinRes is committed to pursuing renewable energy opportunities where we can and our team has been working hard to deliver a solar array and battery solution that delivers optimum output at Wonmunna,” Mineral Resources Chief Executive Darren Hardy said.
“Together with natural gas, renewables will play an important role in our energy future, and MinRes continues to pursue off-grid solar power and energy storage solutions to support our remote locations.”
While Mineral Resources operates a number of other facilities, Wonmunna is the miner’s first integrated solar microgrid system.
Mineral Resources’ upcoming Onslow Iron project, which is also located in the Pilbara region, will include renewable energy and battery storage systems.
The exact details of the types and scope of the technology to be deployed at Onslow are yet to be finalised, the company told pv magazine Australia.
Flexibility the key for 5B
The Wonmunna site was purchased by Mineral Resources in 2021 and is expected to be operational for 10 years. The company opted for the 5B Maverick technology because it can be deployed to other mine sites without the need for new mounting structures.
The 5B Maverick picked up the 2020 pv magazine BoS Award, with the judges pointing to the potential for redeployment as having value in some sectors.

It’s a trend that Greg Fyffe, 5B’s global head of delivery, has seen across the mining industry with at least 12 mines in Western Australia currently utilising the 5B Maverick solar system. In 2022, 5B signed a framework agreement with Zenith Energy to deliver solar systems to the miners operations in WA.
“That the 5B Maverick can be easily removed and redeployed is attractive to miners that are accounting for closure and site rehabilitation as part of feasibility studies,” he said.
“The decommissioning of renewables is front of mind for miners – they don’t want to see megawatts of renewables being junked 10-years into what should be a 35-year-plus design life. It’s nice to see 5B aligned with the leaders in net zero mining, a competition that is playing out domestically and around the world.”
Fyffe said demand from off-grid miners has “exploded” in the last six to eight months. 5B currently has four projects in delivery with a total capacity of nearly 60 MW.
“Just this week, the last of 342, 50 kW 5B Maverick arrays left our Adelaide facility bound for the Kathleen Valley on schedule,” he said. “This is a significant milestone for 5B’s local manufacturing capability and a sign of what’s possible for the broader Australian manufacturing sector in this arduous clean energy transition.”

Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the project will play a key role in helping the state achieve its energy storage and renewable energy targets.
“Grid-scale big batteries like this one are crucial in helping Victoria achieve our energy storage targets of at least 2.6 GW of capacity by 2030 and at least 6.3 GW by 2035 to ensure we can deliver the benefits of cheaper, renewable energy across the state,” she said.
The Rangebank Battery is part of a 1 GWh portfolio of energy storage projects Eku has is delivery in Australia. The portfolio also includes the recently commissioned 150 MW/150 MWh battery built at the site of the retired Hazelwood power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, and the 250 MW/500 MWh Big Canberra Battery being developed at Williamsdale in the Australian Capital Territory.

“Alpha150 offers up to 70% more capacity for its size and 30% more capacity per kg when compared to equivalent lithium batteries,” the company claims. “With a lifespan of over 5,000 charge cycles, the Alpha150 offers double the lifespan of most lithium batteries and ten times that of equivalent deep-cycle absorbent glass mat (MAT) batteries.”
Redarc says that the 150 Ah device has a continuous discharge rating of 200 A. It measures 353 mm x 175 mm x 190 mm and weighs 15.5 kg. The device can be charged from as low as -30 C to 45 C and discharged from -20 C to 60 C. Redarc also claims that the device can be recharged up to 80% faster than competitors with a maximum charge rate of 135 A, which reduces charging time to just 1.1 hours.
“When coupled with an appropriate inverter, is enough to power any household appliance from a single battery,” it said.
The Alpha150 Lithium Batteries come with an IP55 protection level and a five-year product warranty. They are being manufactured at an unspecified location in the Netherlands.
