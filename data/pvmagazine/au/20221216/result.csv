https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/16/sa-calls-for-proposals-to-build-593-million-green-hydrogen-power-plant/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",SA calls for proposals to build $593 million green hydrogen power plant,"The South Australian government has released an international request for proposals (RFP) from industry partners to help deliver a 250 MW green hydrogen production facility, 200 MW hydrogen power plant and associated storage infrastructure.
The government said the green hydrogen power plant, which will provide firming capacity in the state grid, is to be operational by December 2025.
The call focuses on the supply, construction and operation of the hydrogen plant and equipment as well as seeking interest in purchasing hydrogen produced at the facility.
State Energy Minister Koutsantonis said South Australia is already a leader in clean energy production, with renewables accounting for 69% of its energy generation in 2022, and it now wants to become a global leader in green hydrogen.
Koutsantonis said the hydrogen power plant will play a major role in the state as a significant global player in green hydrogen production and give it an early advantage in attracting associated supply chain jobs, ongoing maintenance and potentially manufacturing.
“As the world looks to decarbonise, South Australia is making a once-in-a-generation investment in green hydrogen, an investment that places the Upper Spencer Gulf region at the epicentre of a renewable energy revolution,” he said. “Local power, local jobs, global exports, global leadership – we will seize this opportunity to transform not just the energy sector but potentially the state’s economic future,” Koustantonis continued, citing South Australia’s global reputation as a renewable energy generation leader with a prime solar advantage.

The government has already secured land options near Whyalla for the power plant and associated green hydrogen production and storage facilities, saying that by securing exclusivity over land options it “can expedite the design process and de-risk the project by ensuring that appropriate land is available on time.”
The sites are within a 15km radius to the northeast of the city and close to critical infrastructure, transport links and existing and planned economic development.
They include a 238-hectare parcel of land in the Whyalla industrial estate and 8.7 hectares in the Cultana Industrial Estate which are the preferred locations for the hydrogen production facility and hydrogen power station. A third site adjacent to the Cultana industrial estate provides the opportunity for power generation and other infrastructure for the project.
The government said the scale of the sites allow for future expansion of the scope and size of operations.
The request for proposal will remain open until Feb. 21, 2023, with contracts expected to be awarded in July 2023.
The state government’s hydrogen power plant underpins an estimated $18 billion worth of hydrogen processing investments planned for Whyalla.
Others planning to establish renewable hydrogen facilities in the industrial city include Fortescue Future Industries, Origin Energy, H2U – the Hydrogen Utility, Neoen, Chiyoda Corporation, ENEOS Australia, Mitsubishi Australia, and AMP Energy, while GFG Alliance has plans for green steel production.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/16/the-questions-still-holding-back-broader-ev-adoption-in-australia/,"EV,FINANCE,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",The questions still holding back broader EV adoption in Australia,"There’s some hope for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles with the federal government finally reaching an agreement to cut the fringe benefits taxes on the sale of new high-end EVs.
It’s progress, but we know that more needs to be done. The range of EVs in Australia needs to improve. We know that all EV prices need to drop. We also know that without fuel standards in place, Australia will become a dumping ground for excess combustion engine cars.
But there’s some blindspots in the debate around EV adoption in Australia. I’ve been driving a Tesla for some time now, and I still can’t unequivocally recommend one to everyone just yet.  And I feel that some of the small wrinkles I’ve noticed may be playing on the mind of would-be adopters.
With the new federal government still ironing out its full national EV policy, my hope is that by discussing these points now, they factor into its decision making.
Back in 2019, Scott Morrison famously claimed that EVs would “ruin the weekend” because you couldn’t drive great distances. After years of driving an EV, I can confirm that this definitely isn’t the case. But a more local form of range anxiety still plays on my mind. 
I live in the South Eastern suburbs of Melbourne. There’s plenty of charging points near my area, many have been introduced in the past few years. Yet, there’s only one fast charging station near me and its two suburbs away. I ended up installing a wall charger to ensure I was never caught short of battery life. But those without off street parking or the funds to have this installed may not be so lucky.
It’s limitations like this that mean EV drivers still don’t quite have the freedom of a combustion engine car. If they are low on fuel, I can take 10 minutes to top up ahead of a trip. Even on a fast charger, it can take up to 40 minutes to fully recharge my car, and I have to make a trip several kilometres away to do it. Running an EV without a home charging kit would be significantly more difficult. 
Fast charging is on the rise. The latest State of EV report found that there was a 22% increase in the number of stations installed since 2021, with there now being over 350 across the country. 
But contrast this to petrol stations. As of March 2021, there are 3,459 petrol stations across Australia, hundreds in each state, most with multiple bowsers. Aside from driving across Australia’s red centre, it would be rare that you would be in a situation where you are out of fuel and can’t find a petrol station.
There are plenty of initiatives tackling this, including curbside charging and introduction of more public fast-chargers. But as it stands, were you to purchase and drive an EV today, without a home-charger, you’d have to be more strategic than usual with how you drive.
EVs have held their value remarkably well in Australia. For instance, while you can expect to see depreciation of around 50% within three years, Redbook estimates that a 2019 Tesla Model 3 will only lose around 10% of its value within the same period. This cushions the financial blow of purchasing an EV, as the cheapest car still sits around the $45,000 mark.
But as a player in the auto industry, I’m acutely aware of just how fast technology is moving, and I’m sure other consumers are too.
I’m keeping a close eye on the progress of hydrogen fuel cell technology, and I’m curious as to whether it will overtake EVs within the near future. My reasoning: Whereas EVs require new infrastructure — in the form of charging points — hydrogen fuelling stations can be installed by retrofitting existing petrol stations. 
What happens if hydrogen cars become the new norm? Will the EV market collapse? This sounds extreme, but we saw a similar circumstance in Japan with diesel engines. Diesel cars initially took off in Japan with a push from government for their adoption due to their fuel economy. 
After it was revealed they were worse for the environment than their petrol counterparts, the market for these cars caved-in. It would help if there was government support for the early adoption of this trend, which would hedge the risk early adopters are taking… but that then leads me on to my last point. 
Aside from this latest federal government tax cut, there just isn’t that much incentive to swap over right now, even with petrol prices hitting the new records this year. That’s especially the case in Victoria where EV drivers are subject to a usage-based road tax — which increased this year.
This isn’t an argument against tax. EVs need to be taxed effectively in order to ensure the quality of our roads. But this tax-first-drive-adoption-later approach seems boggling when the overall idea is to phase combustion engine cars off the road and encourage broader uptake of EVs.
Regardless of how you frame it, buying a car is a financial decision. While the political haze is clearing, the uncertainty to date would make it tough to justify such an investment from your everyday consumer.
Let me reiterate, I’m happy with my EV. But considering the points I’ve just outlined, in addition to the broader issues around the range of EVs on the market and their purchase prices, it’s plain to see why they aren’t flying off the shelves.
There is more interest than we can keep up with to try an EV on subscription, but we know that consumers are still wary about purchasing one.
I want Australia to move faster with the uptake of EVs. There’s no reason we can’t be among the global leaders in their adoption. We may never surpass Europe or China; we are a totally different market with different driving habits. But there’s no reason why we can’t aim to at least keep pace with the US, which has similarities in terms of cars per capita and how they use their vehicles.
Yes, we need solutions for the big problems facing EV adoption regarding supply, policy and price points. But until we shift our perspective, and also consider the circumstances and problems affecting the individuals owning an EV, then I don’t believe we’ll turn the dial on this trend as quickly as we need to.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/16/qpm-granted-approvals-for-2-1-billion-battery-materials-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",QPM granted approvals for $2.1 billion battery materials plant,"Queensland Pacific Metals (QPM) said it has received development approval to construct its Townsville Energy Chemicals Hub (TECH) project that would refine approximately 1.6 million tonnes of ore annually to produce critical materials to support the growing battery and electric vehicle (EV) industries.
The company said it had been received development approval from Townsville City Council (TCC) and environmental authority under the Environmental Protection Act. Coupled with the approval received in November from the federal government, QPM now has all primary approvals required to begin construction of the TECH project at the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct, approximately 40km south of Townsville.
“I’m delighted that all key permits have now been received for the TECH project, which is a major milestone for QPM,” QPM Managing Director and Chief Executive Dr Stephen Grocott said.
The development permit and environmental authority allow QPM to operate Stage 1 of the TECH project, notionally processing about 1.6 million tonnes of ore annually to produce approximately 16,000 tonnes of nickel sulphate and 1,750 tonnes of cobalt sulphate, as well as other valuable co-products including high-purity alumina, which are sought after chemicals for use in the emerging EV battery manufacture.
QPM said the project, which the advanced feasibility study estimated would require a capital investment of $2.1 billion, is backed by world-class shareholders including US automotive giant General Motors which has committed up to $108 million toward sourcing nickel and cobalt to power their EVs.
QPM also has offtake agreements in place to sell product to Korean companies LG Energy Solutions, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, and POSCO.
“The TECH project was developed in response to the growing demand for battery materials for electric vehicles, particularly nickel and cobalt,” Grocott said. “Once operational the project will be a world-leading zero waste, carbon negative, sustainable, clean and green production facility.”

This is the second development application to be approved over land within the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct with Edify Energy’s plans for a 1 GW green hydrogen production plant, as well as a behind-the-meter solar and battery storage facility, receiving approval in late 2021.
Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill said the approval for the TECH project is a key step in the council’s ambition to create northern Australia’s first environmentally sustainable advanced manufacturing precinct.
“Townsville is ready to go to the next level when it comes to developing an advanced manufacturing, hydrogen and renewable energy hub, and Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct is key to this,” she said.
“As well as QPM, that confidence has been backed by companies such as Edify, RTE Energy, Solquartz, Origin Energy Future Fuels and North Queensland Gas Pipeline, all signing on to operate at the precinct.”
As part of developing the precinct, TCC will construct key supporting infrastructure including access roads and water supply with the state and federal governments tipping in $74 million to build the infrastructure.
Council has already started construction of an access road that connects to QPM’s Lansdown site. Work on the access road is expected to be completed in early 2023.
QPM said completion of this access road would allow for preliminary site establishment works to begin. These are expected to commence in March or April of 2023.

The investment will be managed on behalf of Infratil and CSC by New Zealand-based asset manager Morrison & Co.
Infratil, which owns a 73% interest in Mint Renewables, said the platform will invest in the development of wind, solar, and energy storage solutions across Australia and complements the company’s existing renewable energy vehicles including US-focused Longroad, Europe-based Galileo, Singapore-headquartered Gurin Energy, and Manawa Energy in NZ.
Infratil Chief Executive Jason Boyes said Mint Renewables will seek to replicate the platform model of wind farm operator Tilt Renewables, which was bought out by Powering Australian Renewables Fund last year with Infratil selling its 65% stake in the for NZ$2 billion.
“We have shown that a long-term approach to value creation can deliver outsized returns, and that is the objective with Mint Renewables,” Boyle said. “It is pleasing to be teaming up with CSC again, this time in their home market.”
Peter Cowling, the current chair of the Clean Energy Council, will be Mint’s head of Australia while former Tilt Renewables General Manager of Renewables Development Clayton Delmarter has been named a director.
The board will be chaired by Morrison & Co Operating Partner and former Tilt Renewables CEO Deion Campbell, who said he is looking forward to reentering the Australian renewables market with highly aligned shareholders, a flexible approach, deep experience, and very strong credentials.
“One thing we know is that Australia’s energy transition will not be straightforward,” he said. “Being nimble and disciplined as we deploy the capital at our disposal will be important and give us an advantage over less agile, larger players.”
“We are confident that, given the calibre of the team we have already secured, we can once again build a significant and leading Australian renewables development platform.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/16/australian-researchers-reveal-new-pathways-for-perovskite-cells/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Australian researchers reveal new pathways for perovskite cells,"Researchers from the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science, based at Melbourne’s Monash University, say they have demonstrated a new way to create stable perovskite solar cells that last much longer than their predecessors, helping make the technology commercially relevant.
The making of perovskite cells generally relies on the use of lead halides and requires the inclusion of strong solvents to control the crystallisation process, a process that can lead to defects in the thin films, which causes the resulting device to rapidly lose efficiency. It’s also hard to control.
The researchers, together with colleagues from Wuhan University of Technology in China, said the chemical compound lead acetate has emerged as a promising alternative precursor, because it can create ultrasmooth thin films with fewer defects.
Until now, lead acetate had only been used to make methylammonium or cesium-based perovskites, which are relatively unstable and not suitable for real-world applications. The research team said a better candidate for commercial use can be found in perovskites made using formamidinium and caesium, thanks to their superior stability.
Previous attempts to synthesise them using lead acetate as the precursor failed but Dr Sebastian Fürer from Monash University said to solve this issue, the researchers had used ammonium as a volatile cation (positively charged ion) at a critical stage.
“The presence of ammonium served to drive away the residual acetate during annealing, without forming unwanted side products,” he said.

The researchers said the cells recorded a conversion efficiency of 21%, the best results yet recorded for a device made from a non-halide lead source. A mini prototype solar panel featuring the cells achieved 18.8% efficiency.
Monash University PhD student Jie Zhao said the test devices also showed strong thermal stability, continuing to function with no efficiency loss after 3,300 hours running at 65°C.
“We’ve been able to use lead acetate in a one-step, spin-coating process to get the perfect, high-quality formamidinium-caesium perovskite thin film,” he said. “And because we don’t need an anti-solvent agent, we can do this via large-scale techniques, such as blade coating, which means it’s viable at industrial scale.”
The results have been published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science.
In a corresponding work, another team of researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science have demonstrated a new way to improve the stability of perovskite cells, leading to thin films which they said are of greater quality, with reduced defects and enhanced stability.
The researchers said by removing the solvent dimethyl-sulfoxide and introducing dimethylammonium chloride as a crystallisation agent, they were able to better control the intermediate phases of the perovskite crystallisation process.

The researchers, working with scientists from Oxford University in the UK, said groups of up to 138 sample devices were subjected to an accelerated ageing and testing process at high temperatures and in real-world conditions. The formamidinium-caesium perovskite cells created using the new synthesis process significantly outperformed the control group and demonstrated resistance to thermal, humidity and light degradation.
During testing, the best device operated above the T80 threshold for more than 1,400 hours under simulated sunlight at 65°C. (T80 is the time it takes for a solar cell to reduce to 80% of its initial efficiency).
Beyond 1,600 hours, the control device fabricated using the conventional dimethyl-sulfoxide approach stopped functioning, while devices fabricated with the new, improved design retained 70% of their original efficiency.
The same degradation study was performed on a group of devices at 85°C, with the new cells again outperforming the control group.
The researchers calculated that the new cells age by a factor of 1.7 for each 10°C increase in the temperature they are exposed to, which is close to the two-fold increase expected of commercial silicon devices.
Oxford University PhD student Philippe Holzhey said the work, published in the journal Nature Materials, is a strong step forward to matching commercial silicon’s stability and makes perovskite-silicon tandem devices a much more realistic candidate for becoming the dominant next-generation solar cell.
“It’s really important that people start shifting to realise there is no value in performance if it’s not a stable performance,” he said. “If the device lasts for a day or a week or something, there’s not so much value in it. It has to last for years.”

Princeton University researchers have quantified the response of atmospheric methane (CH4) to rising hydrogen production. They claim that a hydrogen-based economy would reduce CO2 emissions and improve air quality, but would also increase hydrogen (H2) emissions due to leaks, venting, purging, and incomplete combustion. The increase in the concentration of tropospheric H2 could reduce the availability of hydroxyl group (OH), which is the dominant sink for methane and hydrogen. “Green H2 can mitigate atmospheric methane if hydrogen losses throughout the value chain are below 9 ± 3%,” the researchers wrote in a new study in Nature Communications. “Blue H2 can reduce methane emissions only if methane losses are below 1%.
The American Bureau of Shipping has reviewed, verified and approved the design of the H2Neo, a 26,000-cubic-meter compressed H2 carrier. It claimed that H2Neo is “the first of its kind to receive this level of approval,” following the completion of the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) by Australia’s Provaris Energy. The Perth-based developer will now build and test a prototype hydrogen tank, while preparing for ship construction “with a selected shipyard.” It will take the H2Neo to construction-ready status in 2023, with a bigger green compressed hydrogen carrier to follow in 2026.
Hyundai Motor’s fuel cell unit, HTWO, has signed a partnership with Faun Group’s Enginius subsidiary to supply fuel cell systems for the mass production of hydrogen-powered commercial trucks. “HTWO’s 90 kW fuel cell system will be paired with Enginius chases to provide zero-emission power for waste collection trucks and medium cargo trucks for intra-city goods delivery,” said the two companies. They expect to start field testing in 2024 and series production in 2025.
CWP Global has reached an agreement with the government of Djibouti to develop a 10 GW renewable energy and green hydrogen hub in the Horn of Africa. They said the project will provide secure potable water supplies to local communities and open the door to emerging international markets for green hydrogen and derivatives, including green ammonia. Djibouti wants to promote hydrogen collaboration with regional neighbours, including Ethiopia.
Germany has pledged at least €112 million ($177 million) to expand renewable energy, the power grid, and hydrogen production in Kenya. The agreement comes after the two countries signed a climate and development partnership in Sharm El-Sheik, during the COP27. 
The UK government has agreed to provide GBP 25 million ($45 million) to support technologies that could produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass and waste. “Funding will go directly towards progressing BECCS [bioenergy with carbon capture and storage] projects from the design stage to demonstration,” said the government.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/16/solar-electric-camper-boat/,"EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"DECEMBER 16, 2022",Solar electric camper boat,"From pv magazine USA
Swedish startup POL has announced the POL Lux, a solar electric catamaran camper boat that will start at USD 135,000 ($200,000). The 25-foot craft is designed for up to 13 passengers.
The catamaran design creates a canopy space for integrated PV. The boat can operate purely on solar power at a reduced speed of about 4 knots.
On a full charge of the 18 kWh battery, the craft can travel about 70 miles. The dual electric motors can propel the craft at a max speed of about 13 miles per hour, and cruising speed tops out at about 8 miles per hour. The company said the dual motors are much quieter than their gas-powered counterparts, making for a more serene nature exploration experience.
The eight foot wide POL Lux has a modular, adaptable design that can readily convert from a day-cruiser with ample seating to a tented, private area with multiple beds and a raised hammock. The boat also contains a large net that can be released out of the bow for passengers who want to lounge in the water.
The lightweight craft features a twin-hull design and large front and rear bumpers for safety. It is designed with a large overlapping deck with cork flooring and chamfered intersecting edges to frame out the living area.
“We created a flexible space, with modular components to allow for multiple configurations, encouraging you to use the space how you wish. Bring on board what you need, leave behind what you don’t,” said POL.
The boat is undergoing prototype testing this year, and the company is currently accepting waitlist applications to be first in line for the new technology when it is released.
Electric shipping
Electric boats are unconventional, but may serve a larger role than recreational vehicles like the POL Lux. Battery-powered electric boats are now being seriously considered for large-scale shipping.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have released a study which examines “the technical outlook, economic feasibility, and environmental impact of battery-electric containerships.”
Breaking from previous studies, the researchers have classified the volume of space housing the batteries as an opportunity cost, rather than a fixed technical constraint. After modelling a wide variety of containership sizes, as well as 13 major world trade routes, the research suggests that more than 40% of the world’s fleet of containerships could be electrified “cost-effectively and with current technology,” by the end of this decade.
