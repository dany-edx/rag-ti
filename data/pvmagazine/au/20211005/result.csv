This new minimum operational demand meant there was little need for our coal generators to dispatch their energy on Sunday, further diminishing their profitability and sounding the death knell.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) announced the news in a tweet, saying “the NEM broke through the 14,000 MW minimum operational demand level for the first time since Tasmania joined in 2006, setting a new record of 13,972 MW on Sunday, 221 MW below the August 2021 record.”

The August record it refers to happened on the 22th, also a Sunday, in which solar generated more electricity than coal for the first time in the history of our national energy market, providing 41.4% of demand. 
This Sunday solar accounted for a little less at 34%, with the total renewable share at 55%.
But Saturday wasn’t going to let Sunday steal all the weekend’s glory, with South Australia setting its own record. Shortly after 11am, solar reached 106.1% of the state’s electricity demand, with the excess exported to Victoria.
Rooftop solar in particular that day met more than 88% of states electricity needs, another landmark whereby distributed systems on suburban homes output a remarkable 1134 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/05/households-could-save-5443-a-year-and-a-third-of-national-emissions-by-electrifying-report-says/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 5, 2021","Households could save $5,443 a year and a third of national emissions by electrifying, report says","Australian households, if supported by governments and the private sector, could be the vanguard of decarbonisation. Castles and Cars, published today by Rewiring Australia, posits that despite Australia’s federal foot dragging and coal-intensive grid, the country has all the tools it needs to rapidly cut emissions and save individual households thousands along the way.
The average Australian household uses 102 kWh of energy a day at a cost of $5,248 a year, according to the report, much of which comes down to the operational expenditure on emissions-heavy fuels like petrol and gas, typically used to power cars, stoves, and heaters.
But replacing these fossil-fuel powered appliances and vehicles with versions which can run on electricity generated by solar systems could save the households $5,443 a year and cut their emissions to zero, the report finds.

“There is nothing but good news stories if we apply enough optimism and enough ingenuity,” Saul Griffith said at the report’s launch today, which came in the form of a webinar featuring Lily D’Ambrosio, Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, and Richie Merzian from the Australia Institute. New South Wales’ Minister for Energy and Environment, Matt Kean, was also supposed to be joining the online talk, but instead spent the day being sworn in as the state’s treasurer, a position he will hold alongside the environment portfolio, following premier Gladys Berejiklian’s shock resignation last week.
Griffith, who has advised the Biden administration on its energy policy, is cognisant that while the necessary technology is already here, new levels of cooperation will still need to be established. “This is not going to be solved without a public-private partnership like we’ve never seen before,” Griffith said.

“Government has to make the regulatory costs go away… and banks and individual households need to come to the table to finance it because it’s beyond a single government.”
“We need to get in it together as communities, as households, as nations and we need to solve these problems and look creatively.”
While electrifying everything sounds like a simple and neat solution, it hits a major snag right out the gate – capital expenditure. Households with solar systems might not have to pay any operational costs once they have the appliances (if they use them wisely), but as it stands most electric things aren’t cheap to buy or install.
Which is where governments come in, with the report saying rebates and financing to low income households during the transition should “be a national priority”.

“If we begin electrifying our homes with roughly 3% in 2022, 15% in 2024, and 40% in 2026, the spending required to pay for the capital cost difference (or break even point) is predicted to be around $12 billion in total,” the report reads.
“For context, that’s just roughly ~9% of what we are predicted to have spent on the Covid-19 response in the last two financial years, or roughly ~18% of our defence spending in those two years.”
Moreover, the report estimates the cumulative savings will be more than $300 billion by 2035.

Heat pumps
Interestingly, the report hones in on heat pump technology in particular, saying: “water heaters or space heaters burning natural gas use about three times as much energy as a heat pump for the same result. 
“A heat pump is the technology that makes your refrigerator and your air conditioning work, and can be run in a reversible or mini-split system to also heat your home or water. Heat pumps use electricity to separate out the heat and the cold from air. They typically need only 1 unit of electricity to make 3-4 units of heat.”


 
Pv magazine has been focussing heavily on heat pumps over the past few months, examining the prediction the technology could be one of the decade’s most significant turns in energy efficiency and therefore decarbonisation.
“We have the ideas, we have the creativity. We’ve got to loosen the grip on some of the things we hold a little bit too dear and actually realise there are better solutions and they are right here right now,” Griffith said.

Victoria’s Minister for Public Transport, Ben Carroll, on the weekend announced Kinetic had been award a $2.3 billion contract to operate and subsequently electrify the Metropolitan Bus Franchise, which operates about a third of the city’s public bus services.
Kinetic will deliver five fully electric buses into the network by the middle of next year, with that number expanding to 36 electric buses by mid-2025. In 2031, when the contract ends, 341 out of 537 buses in the Metropolitan Bus Franchise fleet should be low or zero-emissions vehicles.
The new buses will reportedly come from bus maker Volgren’s manufacturing facility in Dandenong, in Melbourne’s south-east.
Kinetic is also working with Queensland’s government to introduce electric buses to Cairns and the Gold Coast. It already operates electric fleets in New Zealand and is planning to electrify Adelaide airport’s airside and landside shuttle buses.
It is not clear whether Kinetic is looking at other technologies like hydrogen-powered buses – which are very much on the cards for neighbouring New South Wales, though clarification has been sought.
Kinetic will take over the bus contract from Transdev, which currently operates the Melbourne fleet.

There was a job we installed just nine months prior to the freak hailstorm, a real beauty, the customer wanted a high-quality system. The solar system had beautiful LG Neon2 Solar panels.
LG Solar panels are undoubtedly high-quality, but these panels had portholes punched in them. The didn’t stand a chance. The hailstones in this particular storm were the size of cricket balls. Hail went through roof tiles straight into people’s living rooms.
If I had to nominate a particular solar panel that would be the most ‘hail-resistant’, I’d suggest the German made SolarWatt panels. Their 40mm frames are basically unparalleled in the Australian solar industry at present. By comparison, cheaper panels usually have 35mm frames, with some going down to just 30mms.
SolarWatt panels also have a ‘double-glass’ build, meaning not only is glass on top of the panel, bu underneath too. They’re made to be as durable and long-lasting (hence the 30-year product warranty) as I’d imagine any solar panel could be.
However, I’m not suggesting these panels would have survived a hailstorm as freakish as the recent Ipswich one – hailstorms that big are next-level, monstrous. I’m simply suggesting there are panels which can tolerate smaller hail better than others.
Daniel Jarrett/Queensland Solar and Lighting
Naturally, the next day and over the following weeks we had residents of the hailstorm hit suburbs of Brisbane and Ipswich call us asking for replacement solar system quotes because of the damage. Solar companies like ours can get inundated during these periods.
If people are worried about finding themselves in the unfortunate situation of having hail-damaged solar panels, this storm season they will need to contact their home insurance provider.
The home insurance company will let them know if they have their own solar electrical contractors who will come out to assess and, if needed, install a replacement solar system.
Another option could possibly be a cash settlement, where the insurance company and homeowner come up with an amount based on current market value of the damaged solar system.
Sometimes home insurance companies also ask solar households to source their own solar installer, agreeing to pay for the solar system on their behalf.
Let’s hope this summer has great solar production, rather than great hailstorms. That being said, it’s certainly worthwhile checking up on home insurance policies. Believe me, no one wants to be caught out the way some of my customers were.

An international research team led by the University of Cambridge, in the United Kingdom, claims to have prevented charge recombination under open-circuit conditions in organic solar cells based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which are the most powerful organic PV devices ever developed to date, with efficiencies exceeding 18% in some cases.
Non-radiative charge recombination is a major loss process in most organic solar cells based on NFAs, that occurs when a hole and electron that originate from the same photon recombine before separating into free charges. “As there is a stronger attraction between the electron and hole in carbon-based materials than in silicon, organic solar cells are more prone to recombination, which in turn affects their efficiency,” the scientists explained. “This necessitates the use of two components to stop the electron and hole from recombining rapidly: An electron ‘donor’ material and an electron ‘acceptor’ material.”
The academics claim that, through spectroscopy and computer modelling, they were able to see how the majority of charge recombination under open-circuit conditions proceeded via the formation of non-emissive NFA triplet excitons, which are quasi-particles that carry energy but no charge. In order to prevent recombination into triplet excitons from occurring, they engineered strong molecular interactions between the electron donor and electron acceptor materials, which made it possible to keep the electron and hole further apart.
“Modelling suggests that the rate of back charge transfer from spin-triplet charge-transfer excitons to molecular triplet excitons may be reduced by an order of magnitude, enabling re-dissociation of the spin-triplet charge-transfer exciton,” the researchers stated, referring to the molecular tuning of the donor and acceptor materials. “The fact that we can use the interactions between components in a solar cell to turn off the triplet exciton loss pathway was really surprising,” added researcher Alexander Gillett. “Our method shows how you can manipulate molecules to stop recombination from happening.”
The group said its research showed a pathway to develop new materials which block recombination into triplet excitons and have the potential to make organic solar cells achieve efficiency of over 20%, thus approaching those of non-organic PV.
The findings of the research can be found in the paper The role of charge recombination to triplet excitons in organic solar cells, which was recently published in nature. The research team also comprises scientists from Oxford University, the Université de Mons, in Belgium, the University of California, Santa Barbara, in the U.S., and Linköping University, in Sweden.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/05/5-reasons-why-the-morrison-government-needs-a-net-zero-target-not-just-a-flimsy-plan/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 5, 2021","Five reasons why the Morrison government needs a net-zero target, not just a flimsy plan","From The Conversation
Should Morrison fail to get the policy over the line, he will no doubt point to the government’s low-emissions technology roadmap as evidence the government still has a climate plan.
But a vague plan is not enough. That was confirmed by a recent analysis showing Australia’s climate policies are insufficient and have inevitably led to investment in new fossil fuel projects.
Reaching net-zero emissions will require intense policy focus, private investment and clear accountability – conditions only a firm numerical target can provide. Here are five reasons the Morrison government must, at a minimum, set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
Image: EnergyAustralia
Australia’s business community has been urging a national net-zero target to create certainty for investors.
In just one example, the A$2 trillion Investor Group on Climate Change recently called on the Morrison government to adopt a stronger climate policy. As chief executive Rebecca Mikula-Wright, told The Australian: We have to be able to invest with certainty for the long term if we’re going to invest billions of dollars in capital.
The New South Wales Coalition government has set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050, with an interim target of 50% emissions reduction by 2030. It expects those targets will stimulate up to $37 billion in private-sector investment.
Research into emissions reduction in South Australia shows how setting a strong emissions-reduction target provides a framework for government policy.
In 2002, the state’s then Labor government adopted a target of 26% renewables generation by 2020. It marked the beginning of consistent and coordinated climate policy, making the state more attractive to investors than other states with weaker policies.
The target was backed by government action. New laws encouraged wind farms in areas away from towns and homes, and the projects were underwritten by state government supply contracts. And as coal generators closed, the state government funded new employment opportunities for affected workers.
The state now has a target of 100% electricity from renewables by 2030 – one that has been embraced by the current Liberal government. It continues to create the market conditions for increased investment in renewables technology.
Likewise, in NSW the net-zero target has triggered supportive government policy, such as seeking private investment in pumped hydro storage schemes and planning for massive investment in solar and wind.

A numerical emissions target means a government can be held to account. When targets are accompanied by the appropriate reporting mechanisms, it’s clear if they’re being met.
This accountability can be seen in the United Kingdom. There, a group of climate scientists recently warned the nation risked missing its 2035 emissions-reduction target by a long way because government policies were insufficient, and new commitments too slow.
The UK has set a target of net-zero by 2050, and missing its interim targets would put that longer-term goal at risk.
Such targets acts as a gauge against which government progress can be evaluated. In Australia, this happens in other policy areas such as regular Closing the Gap reports, which measure progress towards targets in areas such as health, education, employment and life expectancy.
And following delays in getting people vaccinated against COVID-19, Australia’s vaccination targets now establish benchmarks against which governments are being assessed.
If Australia continues to lag the world on climate policy, we will suffer a real economic cost.
From 2026, the European Union will apply border charges to carbon-intensive goods from countries such as Australia without a carbon price or a 2050 net-zero emissions target. Other nations are considering similar measures.
Australia already has a poor reputation on climate action, dating back to the 1997 Kyoto conference where the Howard government demanded special treatment. Among the demands were a uniquely generous target whereby our national emissions would actually increase by 8% above 1990 levels.
Our international reputation as a climate pariah has only worsened in the decades since. Now, even key allies such as the United States and UK are calling on Australia to lift its game.
Australia must urgently change the way it’s perceived on the world stage, by setting a net-zero target that shows we’re making a serious contribution to the global climate effort.
Image: Linkedin
Setting a net-zero target would give the Morrison government some chance of restoring its credibility on climate policy before the next election.
At the 2019 general election, the loss of Tony Abbott’s seat of Warringah to pro-climate independent Zali Steggall sent a warning to Liberal MPs, even those in blue-ribbon seats, that they’re vulnerable on climate policy.
The 2019-20 bushfire season was a brutal reminder to Australian voters that climate change is happening now. The federal government is yet to show the community it understands the need to respond.
Even if Australia adopts a 2050 target, however, it’s not enough. The timeline is so long, today’s politicians can get away with doing very little now. And by the time 2050 rolls around, it will be all but impossible to hold them to account for today’s failures. Very few will still be in public life, if they’re alive at all.
So if the Morrison government does want to show it takes climate policy seriously, it must set a credible 2030 target. The current goal – a 26-28% emissions reduction based on 2005 levels – is totally inadequate.
A responsible target, with a finish line just eight years away, would give the Morrison government the laser focus it needs to get Australia on the path to net-zero.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/05/aussie-scientists-champion-closed-loop-pumped-hydro/,"MARKETS,PUMPED HYDRO,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 5, 2021",Aussie scientists champion closed-loop pumped hydro,"From pv magazine Global
Closed-loop pumped hydro storage projects are seeing growing interest compared to open-loop systems, as they provide more environmental benefits and find more acceptance among residents, administrations, and governments.
This is one of the main conclusions of the paper “Drivers and barriers to the deployment of pumped hydro energy storage applications: Systematic literature review,” published by researchers of Australia’s Griffith University in Cleaner Engineering and Technology.
In the study, the scientists explained that compared to open-loop pumped hydro facilities, closed-loop projects offer more environmental benefits and overcome the problem of finding suitable sites. The latter, in fact, are located away from rivers and do not involve connection to a natural water source to create a lower reservoir. The former, by contrast, has an ongoing hydrologic connection to a natural body of water like a river or a lake.
“This study also discovered that there was a growing interest in the closed-loop system due to greater certainty in gaining an operating license, since closed systems don’t interfere with water supply security and typically have a lower environmental impact,” the researchers stated. On the other hand, the paper identifies landscape topology and land acquisition among the main techno-environmental barriers that prevent pumped hydro to gain more market shares.
“Land acquisition challenges, such as land use, vegetation clearing and land ownership, are environmental complications of pumped hydro development,” the paper noted. “There must be no interference in protected lands or forests, river systems, urban or rural settlements or intensive agriculture, national parks, or areas of historical or cultural value.”  Violating these principles may complicate significantly the development of a project, according to the Australian group.
According to another study published last year by scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the number of preliminary permits and licensing applications for closed-loop systems has considerably increased in recent years.
The U.S. team analysed, in particular, the U.S. Energy Regulatory Commission’s licensing record to assess the potential environmental effects of six closed-loop projects and compare these data with those four existing open-loop systems. Their analysis showed that closed-loop systems offer more opportunities to minimise environmental effects to aquatic and terrestrial habitats. “The aquatic resources evaluated included surface water quality and quantity, groundwater quality and quantity, and aquatic ecology,” the group specified. “Terrestrial resources included geology and soils, terrestrial ecology, land use, recreation, visual resources, and cultural resources.”
“For the most part, our study confirmed the conventional wisdom that closed-loop pumped hydro projects generally have fewer and less widespread environmental impacts than open-loop projects because they’re located offstream and have greater siting flexibility,” said PNNL researcher Bo Saulsbury.
The academics, however, warned that some closed-loop systems may utilise groundwater to fill and replenish their reservoirs, which is not without environmental effects on geology, soils, and groundwater quantity. Closed-loop projects using groundwater as the source for initial filling of their reservoirs and replacing evaporative and seepage losses may impact groundwater quality due to the effects on groundwater circulation patterns and chemistry,” the paper notes. “Impacts to groundwater quantity resulting from the large quantities of water necessary for reservoir fill and refill could reduce the availability of groundwater for other uses.
Another group of researchers from Australia recently identified 616,818 locations throughout the world that could be suitable sites for 23.1 million GWh of closed-loop pumped-hydro storage capacity. The academics stated that “off-river” pumped-hydro projects are able to overcome the typical topographical issues of conventional pumped-hydro, as the size of reservoirs is relatively small, ranging from tens to hundreds of hectares. This limited size also reduces the need to manage large flood events and ensures considerably lower construction costs.
