The BREZ, to be established near Barcaldine, will provide zero carbon low-cost energy for industrial users, as well as access to water, land, transport and communications and other services necessary for new industrial activities.
Sunshot Industries, chaired by eminent energy economist Ross Garnaut, said the “BREZ will pioneer sophisticated zero-emissions production of hydrogen, ammonia and urea, processing of minerals and intensive horticulture.”
Sunshot and its sister company Zen Energy will be responsible for supplying renewable energy to the tenants with a feasibility study outlining plans for 80 MW of wind and 90 MW of solar energy to be developed as demand increases and the industrial park grows.
Garnaut said the BREZ will provide a model for industrial development in regional areas across the country, generating industrial activity, employment and incomes, as well as inputs for agriculture and other local industries, all based on some of the world’s best combinations of renewable energy potential.
“Queensland has immense opportunities to use its rich renewable energy resources to underwrite the state’s greatest era of economic development,” he said. “The new zero-emissions industry can bring full employment and rising incomes for a growing population for as far ahead as we can see.”
Shotshot estimates that the precinct could create 500 permanent jobs and deliver $2.1 billion in economic benefits to the central-west region over 10 years and about $5.4 billion over 20 years.

Barcaldine has been chosen as the site for the industrial zone because of what Garnaut describes as the best grid-connected solar resource in the country, existing energy infrastructure, including a 132 kV transmission line connecting to the NEM, access to rail and road transport, and strong support from local and state government.
Garnaut said a number of companies have already expressed interest in establishing a presence in the proposed precinct.
Among the first business activities proposed are a commercial-scale green hydrogen, ammonia, and urea plant, and a minerals processing facility for the manufacture of vanadium electrolyte for use in vanadium flow batteries.
“There is active interest in a number of projects of various scale,” he said. “The budget decision will accelerate movement from active interest to real activity on the ground.”
The government funding will go towards the costs of the common user infrastructure, including road access, water and sewage infrastructure to support the establishment of the precinct.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the investment is hard evidence the state government is serious about investing in new industries and making sure every inch of Queensland gets a bite at the renewable energy cherry.
“Barcaldine is ideally located, with solar and wind resources, and the Barcaldine Renewable Energy Zone precinct will support jobs in regional Queensland,” he said. “Crucially, the establishment of BREZ provides an opportunity for the region to capture the economic benefit of this renewable energy resource and create employment in the region.”

CWP’s green hydrogen hub portfolio has a planned combined renewable power generation capacity of nearly 220 GW. This includes the 50 GW Western Green Energy Hub planned for Western Australia’s southern coastline and the 26 GW Australian Renewable Energy Hub being developed in the state’s Pilbara region. CWP is a key player in both projects which are expected to produce millions of tonnes of green hydrogen or its derivative, green ammonia, each year for domestic and export markets.
CIP Partner Felix Pahl said the investment in CWP’s green hydrogen business would allow the company to expand its participation in the development of gigawatt-scale power-to-X (PtX) projects.
“CWP has a proven track record in delivering onshore renewables and has already built a strong pipeline of PtX development projects,” he said. “And we expect CWP to become a global leader in developing ultra gigawatt-scale PtX projects and contribute significantly to decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors.”
CIP has focused much of its development efforts in recent times on renewable hydrogen projects with the production and use of green hydrogen and derivatives emerging as a critical tool to decarbonise a variety of energy intensive but hard-to-abate sectors, such as mining, steel and fertiliser production, as well as long-range transport, including maritime shipping.
The company has identified Australia as key to a green energy future in the broader Asia region and one of the few countries with very substantial green hydrogen and green ammonia production potential.
The investment in CWP comes less than one month after CIP revealed plans to build a gigawatt-scale green hydrogen production hub near the steelmaking city of Whyalla on South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula.
The Evergreen project is set to have an impressive capacity of approximately 14 GW, comprising 4 GW of solar energy, 10 GW of onshore wind energy, and 7 GW of hydrogen electrolysis capacity.
The project adds to CIP’s rapidly growing development pipeline of renewable energy projects in Australia which the company said now stands at a combined 30 GW.
This includes the 5.2 GW Murchison Hydrogen Renewables project being developed near the Western Australian coastal town of Kalbarri and the almost 3 GW Capricornia Energy Hub being developed near Mackay in central Queensland.

WA Treasurer Rita Saffioti said the “use-of-proceeds” bond will go to financing state investments in major projects geared towards decarbonisation of the electricity grid. This includes wind farms, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and rebates, standalone power systems, and batteries.
Among the projects in line for funding is the 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery energy storage system to be built by state-owned power provider Synergy near the coal town of Collie in the state’s southwest and a 200 MW/800 MWh battery to be built at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana power station south of Perth.
The government bond issue, which matures in July 2033, attracted widespread attention with Saffioti confirming that more than $6 billion in bids were received from more than 60 domestic and international investors.
“The green bond issue was heavily oversubscribed, highlighting the confidence investors have in our commitment to deliver projects with positive environmental outcomes and our strong financial performance,” she said.
Saffioti said the bond issue followed two years of work by the Western Australian Treasury Corporation (WATC) to demonstrate the state’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials to an expanding pool of investors.
Global investors are increasingly aware and interested in ESG performance and the WATC’s efforts will assist in keeping the state’s cost of borrowing lower by expanding the pool of potential investors, the treasurer said.

“The successful issue of the state’s inaugural green bond is a key milestone in the evolution of our borrowing program,” she said. “It reflects the state government’s significant investments in initiatives that deliver positive environment, social and governance outcomes.”
The WATC said the growing popularity of green bonds reflects a global shift towards more sustainable investment practices and the increasing recognition of the importance of addressing environmental challenges.
Victoria was the first Australian jurisdiction to issue a sovereign green bond, raising $300 million through its first in 2016.
The Australian government has announced it will launch the nation’s first sovereign green bond in mid-2024 in a bid to prompt private investors to finance its own decarbonisation efforts.

US-based thin-film PV manufacturer First Solar is showcasing fully functional, pre-commercial, bifacial thin-film PV modules at Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany. It has announced a limited production run of what it calls “the world’s first bifacial solar panel utilising an advanced thin film semiconductor.” The cells feature thin-film CdTe for the semiconductor.
The bifacial product line is now undergoing field and laboratory testing. It builds on the company’s Series 6 Plus monofacial modules, which were first launched in 2019.
First Solar’s R&D teams have reportedly developed a transparent back contact for the module. This innovative feature allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through the back of the module instead of being absorbed as heat. It also enables bifacial energy generation. The manufacturer said that this technology will reduce the operational temperature of the module and increase its specific energy yield.
“This module combines the quality, sustainability, reliability, and long-term performance of our Series 6 Plus platform with our first increment of bifaciality,” said Pat Buehler, chief product officer at First Solar. “Once commercialised, we expect Series 6 Plus Bifacial to represent the first real alternative to crystalline silicon-based bifacial technology, effectively combining bifaciality with the industry’s best warranted degradation rate, CdTe thin film’s ability to deliver more energy per nameplate watt, best-in-class reliability and durability, and innovative module design.”
The monofacial series 6 Plus modules have power ratings from 455 W to 480 W and up to 19.0% efficiency. They offer a 0.3% warranted degradation rate, spectral response, shading behavior, and an anti-reflective coating to enhance energy production.
“Moreover, unlike crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels, First Solar’s Series 6 Plus module does not experience losses from Light Induced Degradation (LID) and Light and elevated Temperature Induced Degradation (LeTID),” said First Solar.
In October 2022, First Solar said that it would build a new R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio. The facility will be completed in 2024 with a pilot manufacturing line to produce full-sized prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/16/us-green-hydrogen-market-set-to-surge-to-2-trillion-by-2050-says-deloitte/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 16, 2023","US green hydrogen market set to surge to $2 trillion by 2050, says Deloitte","From pv magazine USA
A new report from the Deloitte Center for Sustainable Progress (DCSP) outlines the potential of green hydrogen, or hydrogen fuel produced by renewable energy sources, to meet the demands of heavy industry. 
The report set global market milestones of USD 642 billion by 2030, USD 980 billion by 2040, and USD 1.4 trillion ($2.06 trillion) by 2050, with growth in the industry split among the major global economies relatively evenly by mid-century, as seen below. This level of investment would represent a cumulative USD 9 trillion push by the global economy by 2050. 
Hard-to-abate sectors like steelmaking, chemical manufacturing, aviation and global shipping require high amounts of energy dispatch, something that can be difficult for electrochemical batteries to achieve. While batteries may serve mobile devices, electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage, hydrogen may present a viable path forward for decarbonising these high-dispatch use cases.
The report said that these sectors may drive hydrogen demand and use six-fold by 2050, leading to nearly 600 million tons of hydrogen fuel use. While hydrogen electrolysis requires large amounts of electricity, the only byproduct of burning hydrogen fuel is water, making it an emissions-free source when created by renewable sources.
However, based on current green hydrogen project announcements, the global community could only provide a collective production capacity to meet one quarter of the projected demand in 2030, said Deloitte.
It estimates that green hydrogen could abate 85 gigatonnes of cumulative emissions by 2050, which equates to more than twice the annual total emissions in the year 2021.
Deloitte said that decisive climate action can help push the competitiveness of green hydrogen. After about 10 years, green hydrogen can become cost-competitive, said Deloitte, leading to the creation of 2 million jobs per year between 2030 and 2050. The firm said that as much as 70% of this job growth could occur in developing countries.
“Money is not the problem – though the average annual investment over the time period is significantly less than the USD 417 billion that was spent on oil and gas production in 2022 globally,” said Bernhard Lorentz, the founding chair of the DCSP. “It’s just a question of redirecting the investment to clean energy sources, and Deloitte sees that the global finance industry has an increasing appetite for major investments.”
The projections come from Deloitte’s Hydrogen Pathway Explorer (HyPE) model, which delivers analysis of the global hydrogen supply. Deloitte’s outlook provides extensive detail into the cost, production, and market of hydrogen, even analysing the business challenges facing the successful implementation of clean hydrogen, and providing insights into various market dynamics, such as optimal infrastructure sizing, investment needs, and technology choices.
“This analysis reveals a compelling opportunity for private and public leaders to accelerate the green energy transition,” said Joe Ucuzoglu, global chief executive officer of Deloitte. “While wind, solar, and other more traditional forms of renewable power are essential to a net-zero future, Deloitte’s research demonstrates how clean hydrogen can help tackle decarbonisation of some of the world’s most emissions intensive and hardest-to-abate sectors, further mitigating the effects of climate change while fuelling economic growth, particularly in developing countries.”
Deloitte said that interregional trade and diversified transport infrastructure could become a key driver in green hydrogen development adoption.
“Regions that are currently able to produce cost-competitive hydrogen in quantities that exceed domestic needs are already positioning themselves as future hydrogen exporters – supplying other less-competitive regions and helping to smoothly facilitate the energy transition,” said the report.
Deloitte has also launched the Deloitte Global Hydrogen Center of Excellence, which helps hydrogen developers scale up their businesses through advisory, implementation, and operational guidance services.
