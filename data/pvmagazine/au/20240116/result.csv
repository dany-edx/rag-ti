Gridcog, which provides software to plan, track and optimise distributed energy projects, created two scenarios in the simulation, one using conventional solar and one using a solar fence configuration. It then modelled sites in London and Sydney against both scenarios and ran a one-year model against typical irradiance data for each location.
The conventional solar utilised 100 kWdc / 100 kWac systems for both sites using mono-facial panels. London was oriented 180° south and Sydney 0° north, both with a tilt of 40°.
The solar fence scenario comprised 100 kWdc / 100kWac of bifacial panels. The systems were oriented 90° east/180° west at a tilt of 90°, so perpendicular to the ground.

Unsurprisingly the yield curve for the solar fence was different to ground-mount solar, with a dip in the middle of the day, but on an annual basis, overall yields were slightly higher for the solar fence than for the conventional system.
“We’re seeing a 10% total uplift in yield in London and a 3% increase in Sydney,” Gridcog said, noting that while the physical performance more or less aligned with what was expected, the commercial story provided some interesting results.
The generation pattern of the solar fence allowed it to avoid those lower value periods of the day when lower demand and higher solar generation impact wholesale prices.
Gridcog said this was particularly the case for Sydney where middle-of-the-day prices are on average much lower than prices earlier and later in the day.

“When these wholesale prices interact with our solar yield curves the solar fence really starts to stand out,” the company said, adding that the vertical install is consistently able to capture much higher prices in the market on each side of the middle-of-the-day lows.
“On an annual basis the advantage of the solar fence is even more obvious,” Gridcog said. “The increase in revenue is significantly higher than the underlying increase in yield; in the case of Sydney a 3% increase in yield has translated into a 30% increase in revenue.”
While capex and opex costs were ignored for the simulation exercise, Gridcog finished by saying that solar fences, which use about 10% of the land compared to conventional ground-mount solar, are “a pretty neat concept.”

The Community Engagement Review, headed by Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner (AEIC) Andrew Dyer, was launched in July 2023 with the final report from the review presented to the federal government in late December.
The National Farmer’s Federation (NFF) is now calling for the release of the findings with President David Jochinke saying the review was a step in the right direction toward ensuring community engagement and social license as the federal government seeks to achieve its target of 82% renewables by 2030.
“The government has the review outcomes in their hands so we urge them to get moving on it to make things fairer for farmers,” Jochinke said.
“We want to work with government on this important issue and the findings of this report are a good place to start that collaboration.”
A spokesperson for Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the government had received the findings of the review in late 2023 and the report will be released “once the government has considered the report findings.
“The Opposition spent 10 years trying to stall the transformation to a cheaper, cleaner, more reliable energy system and failed to make the necessary reforms to improve how our nation building energy projects are rolled out in communities,” the spokesperson said.
“The Albanese Government is taking a different approach by working with communities, jurisdictions and the sector to get it right.”
Securing a social license to build transmission lines is among the most pressing issues facing Australia’s energy transition with many of the proposed transmission lines identified as essential by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for the transition to renewables facing community opposition.
The Community Engagement Review is intended to establish national guidelines for renewable energy businesses and suppliers on community engagement and impact evaluation and provide advice on the best way to maximise engagement when planning, developing and operating renewable energy infrastructure projects.
Jochinke said the review presents a real opportunity for the government to dispel the uncertainty hanging over the heads of landholders, claiming farmers are often the last to find out about these projects to be rolled out across their land.
“It’s the right thing to do to consult with landholders in the early stages of these projects that directly impact their livelihoods,” he said.
“This isn’t a NIMBY [not in my backyard] situation. Farmers support the transition to renewable energy, but they don’t want to see these projects being prioritised over growing food and fibre.”
“Often there are far better solutions, like taking projects along fence lines or in unproductive paddocks but the energy companies rarely stop to listen to these smart solutions.”
The review’s consultation period closed in October after 71 stakeholder, landholder, and community group meetings. The review received 509 written submissions and 251 online survey responses.

Researchers at the University of Lisbon in Portugal have developed a machine learning algorithm that classifies and predicts inverter failures in utility scale PV plants.
The new algorithm monitors, in particular, the inverter subsystems and sends alarms when maximum and minimum values are reached. It analyses data and categorises variables according to historic values.
The scientists identified the types of failures according to the errors obtained in the inverters and the description of occurrences. Failures include grid faults, grid overvoltage, temporary grid overvoltage, grid undervoltage, low voltage, temporary AC overcurrent, grid overfrequency, grid underfrequency, grid power failure, excessive stray current, supply grid fault, 10-minute grid overvoltage, output overload, and unbalanced load of grid device fault.
The group tested the proposed approach on two ground-mounted PV systems with capacities of 140 kW and 590 kW. Both installations rely on inverters provided by German manufacturer SMA.
“The variables of each inverter were analysed, and the following types of failure were verified in the case of the variable yield, due to the inverter errors,” it explained.
The data were characterised via fine tree, medium tree, and coarse tree prediction models. In tree-based models, a set of splitting rules actively divides the feature space into multiple smaller, non-overlapping regions with similar response values.
The academics claim the proposed algorithm is able to identify seasonal variations in inverter failures and that the results it provides can be used for reliability analysis.
“The data-driven evaluation developed in this study indicates that inverters subsystems emerge for categorising failure modes,” they stressed.
They also suggested protecting inverters from inrush and overcurrent automatically by using clamp circuits to the resonant capacitance in parallel.
“High power-conversion efficiency can be achieved by regenerating the clamp current to the input voltage source,” they concluded.
The novel algorithm was presented in the study “Machine learning for monitoring and classification in inverters from solar photovoltaic energy plants,” published in Compass in Solar.
