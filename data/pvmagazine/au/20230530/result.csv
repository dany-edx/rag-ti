The facility will only be temporarily housed in Gladstone, however, with construction on the permanent facility to begin in 2024.
State-owned transmission company Powerlink, which will run the facility, is currently finalising the acquisition of a permanent site for the training centre, though where it will be located has not been made public.
Powerlink expects to upskill 500 energy workers each year at the facility, including providing high voltage technical training.
Staffing is one of the major challenges facing the renewables industry today, with industry frequently pointing to challenges finding staff despite the fact Australia’s renewable construction push has barely begun.
With the facility, Powerlink is also looking to “strengthen its regional presence.” The Queensland government says the training centre will also help support “the changing focus in the Gladstone area.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/30/resort-style-retirement-villages-set-up-own-vpp-program/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 30, 2023",‘Resort’ style retirement villages set up own VPP program,"The developer of premium retirement villages, GemLife, has begun its internal rollout of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), with the support of technology partners Evergen, a software developer, and Evo Power, a Victorian battery company.
GemLife will invest more than $75 million (USD 49 million) over the next six years to develop VPPs across its portfolio of 11 existing and new communities in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The aim is to connect the 10,000+ houses in the company’s portfolio.
In terms of how it works, it seems GemLife residences are already fitted with rooftop solar, and commercial-scale batteries have been installed at its villages. Through the VPP, which effectively aggregates, monitors and controls the flow of renewable energy, GemLife says its communities will be able to achieve 90% onsite renewable energy generation and storage. The program is also expected to save residents around 60% on their power bills. 
The rollout follows a successful trial at GemLife’s Palmwoods community, in the Sunshine Coast hinterland in Queensland. During the trial, GemLife says the the average power bill was reduced to just $8 during the six-month testing period.

Evergen will serve as the overarching Energy Management System (EMS) for GemLife’s VPPs. “The portfolio of residential homes and common areas will be run as a virtual power plant, with Evergen taking and displaying telemetry from all residential PV systems and optimising the C&I-scale batteries at each site,” Evergen said of the project.
While the VPPs will have the capacity to sell excess energy into the grid, it seems the main thrust of the rollout is to enable as much onsite renewable use as possible. The investment follows a larger trend of companies, like property developers, deploying green energy across sites to bolster environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting.
VPPs hold much promise not only for increasing the share of renewables and decreasing bills, but also in terms of grid stabilisation. However, convincing individual households to sign up has proven tricky to date.
According to solar and energy analyst Sunwiz, the VPP adoption rate among battery owners appears to be just 14%. “It seems early adopters of energy storage systems aren’t willing to hand back to retailers their expensively-purchased independence,” managing director Warwick Johnston recently told pv magazine Australia.
GemLife’s scheme effectively bypasses this issue, since the developer owns both the solar systems and batteries at its property sites.

The 30 kWh zinc-bromine flow battery project was deployed with Redflow’s new integration partner, Bright Spark Group, and includes two Deye hybrid inverters to allow for a solar system to be added in future.
The Willawong Animal Rehoming Centre site is the first in the Brisbane City Council’s broader plan to boost resiliency at government sites across the city, dubbed the ‘Better Brisbane Proposals’ initiative. The Redflow battery system was funded through the program.

The Willawong Animal Rehoming Centre was selected for the initial site due to its ongoing issues with grid outages, which were impacting the storage of vaccines and medications.
Flow batteries are an intrinsically different beast to the predominant lithium-ion batteries, the domain of giants like Tesla. Lithium-ion batteries are what’s known as solid-state batteries, storing energy in metal. Flow batteries, on the other hand, store energy in electrolyte liquids. They are usually designed to have two tanks, one containing a positively-charged anode and the other with a negatively-charged cathode, separated by a membrane.
Using liquids allows flow batteries to produce electrical currents without degradation, giving the batteries a longer cycle life and allowing them to store charge for longer periods compared to lithium-ion batteries. Flow batteries can also be fully discharged without damage, and are easily scaleable – able to be fitted to one another to increase capacity.

Flow batteries also lend themselves to recycling, which is an aspect Redflow CEO and Managing Director Tim Harris thinks will become increasingly relevant for Redflow’s overall offering – especially given just 2% of Australia’s lithium-ion battery waste is currently recycled.
Flow batteries pitfall? Size. Tanks of fluid can, by nature, only be made so small. Which is part of the reason lithium-ion batteries have been far quicker out the gate – we’ve needed small, high-powered batteries a lot longer than we have utility-scale ones. Despite being arguably less well suited for larger scale applications, lithium-ion batteries have benefited massively from their ubiquity and visibility, having been used for decades in our phones, laptop chargers and now in our EVs.
After years of predictions around the dawning of the flow battery age, it appears the decades-old technology is finally capturing some of the storage market. In the last year, Redflow has expanded into the US market and has integrated its systems with a wide array of inverters.

There are a number of flow battery companies and projects gearing up in Australia, including Energy Storage Industries’ $70 million manufacturing plant in Maryborough, Queensland, where it will assemble iron-flow batteries from its “deep tech partner” ESS Inc. Sydney startup Gelion, and VSUN Energy, a subsidiary of Perth-based mining company Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), are also seeking to expand both the manufacturing and deployments of flow batteries in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/30/regulator-seeks-to-disqualify-installer-from-sres-prosecutes-queensland-company/,"LEGAL,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 30, 2023","Regulator seeks to disqualify installer from SRES, prosecutes Queensland company","Australia’s clean energy watchdog, the Clean Energy Regulator, has issued a notice of intention to disqualify a solar installer from participating in the small-scale renewable energy scheme. It is the first time the agency has sought to exercise its disqualification powers since it was granted that capacity in 2021.
No information has yet been made public about who the installer is, aside from the fact they have been given 28 days to respond to the disqualification notice before a final decision is made.
The Regulator has also began prosecutions against E Connect Solar & Electrical Pty Ltd and both the company’s former and current directors. The Regulator claims the company and directions provided false information about who had completed 38 solar PV installations in late 2019 and early 2020, which subsequently led to the improper creation of a number of small-scale technology certificates. Again, these certificates are effectively Australia’s rooftop solar rebate.
The penalty hearing took place in Brisbane’s Federal Court on March 23, though the judge, Justice Derrington, has reserved his decision.
The business has traded under several names, including E Connect Solar, Home Grown Energy, and EConnect Country.
While the company was prosecuted and registered in Queensland, its main place of business appears to have been New South Wales. The Australian Business Register has the main location listed as Newcastle, while another register names Mullumbimby.
E Connect Solar went into voluntary administration early this year. Aaron Lucan of Worrells was listed as appointed liquidator in February, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) website lists the liquidation date as March 10.
In 2021, the Clean Energy Regulator stepped up both its powers and its pursuit of prosecutions after taking over as sole regulator of the SRES scheme. At the time, the Regulator told pv magazine Australia, it would begin proactively and directly going after rule-flouting installers.
Since then, legal proceedings have certainly stepped up with the Regulator taking companies across the country to court, mostly for providing false information and generating improper STCs.
The Regulator’s increased powers came into effect from December 2021, though many changes have been rolled out in waves over the subsequent years. These changes were the result of amendments to the  Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001. The amendments were made in response to the Integrity Review of the Rooftop Solar PV Sector which was published in September 2021.

Agrivoltaics can mitigate the effects of drought on plant-based food production, according to a new study. While shading often reduces crop yields when there is sufficient water, it can actually lead to increased yields during dry phases, as plants benefit from less evaporation, according to “How to reconcile renewable energy and agricultural production in a drying world,” which was recently published in Plants, People, Planet.
The stabilising effect of agrivoltaics on crop yields has been deemed promising by researchers, particularly in regions with population growth and pronounced droughts like India or Africa, as well as in Europe, where longer dry periods are expected due to climate change. However, additional research is needed to determine the most suitable plants for different systems.
Current studies indicate that most crops tolerate shading up to 15% without significant yield loss, with berries, fruiting crops, and some vegetables benefiting from shading. Leafy vegetables, tubers, root crops, and certain cereals experience minimal yield reduction.
In addition, investigating plant-based stress signals for real-time control of panel orientation and shading could contribute to the development of intelligent agrivoltaic systems, according to the scientists.

Established energy utilities are increasingly dominating the ownership and development of utility-scale solar plants. Only six renewable specialists now make the list of the world’s top 20 project developers, and only two appear among the top 20 utility-scale solar plant owners, according to the data compiled by UK research outfit Wiki-Solar.
NextEra Energy now tops both lists. According to Wiki-Solar’s Philip Wolfe, this is “thanks especially to the recent intense “solarisation” of its subsidiary Florida Power & Light. Just six years ago, NextEra was down at No. 6, but it has moved up one place each year since then.”
Independent renewables developers are led by Canadian Solar and First Solar, which rank fifth and sixth. India’s ACME Solar follows at ninth place, with US-focused Cypress Creek at 14th.
Wiki-Solar counts Lightsource, which ranks 17th, as a renewables company, but BP now has a major stake in it. The last of the six is the legacy of projects left by the now-defunct SunEdison.
Five other pure-play renewable companies made it into the top 30 – China’s JinkoSolar and Europe’s BayWa r.e, In addition, Neoen, FRV, and X-Elio each have at least 2 GW (AC) of cumulative capacity under their belts.
On the list of utility-scale PV owners, China’s State Power Investment Corp. (SPIC) holds the second spot, with five other Chinese companies in the top 20.
Europe is led by Enel, which ranked third, but EDF, Engie, and Iberdrola are also all high on the list. India comes in with Adani at No. 4, and NTPC and Azure are also listed. AES, Dominion, and Duke Energy represent the United States, alongside NextEra.
“Utility-scale solar projects are getting ever larger, with the biggest now measured in gigawatts,” said Wolfe. “Few but the major multinationals have the financial muscle to take on projects at that scale, so we expect their dominance to continue.”
The only renewables companies among the top 20 IPPs/owners are JinkoSolar and Lightsource BP. Three infrastructure investors also feature, led by Global Infrastructure Partners at No. 19, with D.E. Shaw Renewable Investment (DESRI) and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway lower down.
