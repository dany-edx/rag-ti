The 2.6 MW project is spread across a winery rooftop and carport structure and uses nearly 6,000 solar panels. It is expected the system will generate more than 5,500 MWh of solar energy annually.
“Installing solar panels is the most significant contribution we can make to move closer to our ambition of net zero direct emissions,” said Kerrin Petty, TWE’s chief supply and sustainability officer.
“Unveiling the solar system here in the Barossa complements the other systems that are already operational, or scheduled to be completed in the coming year, at our sites in Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, and the U.S.”
“It’s all part of TWE’s broader goal to make wine sustainably.”
TWE is also installing a PV system at its facility in Karadoc in north-west Victoria with the ground-mounted, rooftop and carpark instal comprising about 2,000 solar panels. The company said 75% of the Karadoc system is already operational, with the remainder expected to be completed next week.
The Barossa and Karadoc installations follow other systems already online at TWE wineries in Victoria and South Australia, including including a 1 MW array at Coldstream Hills in Victoria’s Yarra Valley, a 200 kW system at Penfolds in South Australia’s Magill, and a 100 kw Wynns in Coonawarra, South Australia.
The Australian sites are part of a global plan for TWE to produce its wine using 100% renewable energy by the end of 2024, which will include the installation of more than almost 30,000 solar panels worldwide, including 4.5 MW of PV to be installed across its Australian operations.
Wider trends
In California’s Napa Valley, TWE is in the process of installing 13,000 solar panels. Petty said it will be the largest winery solar system in the U.S., generating half of the electricity required for its entire U.S. operation. In addition to its solar installations, TWE will turn its attention to batteries and electric vehicle chargers for fleet, employee and visitor cars to improve its energy efficiency.
TWE’s investment in on-site solar marks a change in the Australian wine industry’s approach to sustainability.
Fellow winemaking giants such as Pernod Ricard and Australian Vintage have previously relied on a combination of on-site solar and power purchase agreements (PPA) to help achieve their net zero plans.
PPAs remain in favour for other Australian beverage producers. Last week Asahi Beverages announced it would source 40,000MWh per year in a deal with Queensland-based Clermont Solar Farm, while Lion-owned XXXX set out similar plans earlier in the year.

The company said the battery has a nominal voltage of 48 V and can deliver 4.86 kW of continuous power. It operates in temperatures ranging from -20 C to 55 C. The battery measures 933 mm high x 357 mm wide x 251 mm deep and weighs less than 55 kilograms.
Engineered and assembled at Vaulta’s Brisbane facility, the battery features the company’s patented no-weld battery case which allows for internal cells to be removed, recycled and reused, and for new cells to be added as battery technology continues to evolve.
The launch of the residential battery follows the recent announcement that Queensland-based clean energy investment firm ReNu Energy had completed its third tranche investment in Vaulta.
Valued at $250,000, the tranche follows two earlier rounds of funding in January and April that form part of an investment worth up to $1 million in total.
Vaulta has also attracted support from international investors with Turkish-based Niocycle, which is focused on making lithium-ion batteries more circular, investing in the company.
Vaulta said the latest investments will enable it to scale its manufacturing capability and target further sales domestically and into the Asia Pacific and North American markets.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/26/neoen-boosts-western-downs-battery-capacity-to-540-mwh/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 26, 2023",Neoen boosts Western Downs Battery capacity to 540 MWh,"Initially planned at 200 MW/400 MWh and currently under construction, the Western Downs Battery will now have an installed capacity of 270 MW/540 MWh battery with Neoen saying the greater capacity will ensure the battery is capable of providing a wider range of services and solutions.
The battery, being delivered by construction contractor UGL and featuring Tesla Megapack 2XL units, will leverage the existing infrastructure of Neoen’s Western Downs Green Power Hub being developed on a 1500-hectare site near Chinchilla in Queensland’s southwest.
The battery’s primary function will be firming renewables, notably Neoen’s recently commissioned 400 MW Western Downs Solar Farm, in addition to providing frequency services and transmission network support.
Neoen said the expansion of the battery’s installed capacity will allow it to play an “even more central role in Queensland’s rapidly accelerating energy transition which is resulting in a growing need for storage and related network services.”
“Western Downs Battery will be capable of performing a range of network services to the Queensland grid, including firming renewables, providing frequency services and transmission network support,” the company said, noting the asset will eventually be equipped “with grid-forming inverter technology allowing it to provide essential system stability services.”
It is expected the big battery will commence operating late next year or early 2025.
Queensland state-owned transmission network operator Powerlink will deliver the project’s connection works and a dedicated high-voltage line into the existing Western Downs substation which links to the nearby Queensland/New South Wales interconnector.
Powerlink Chief Executive Officer Paul Simshauser said large-scale batteries will continue play a critical role in supporting Australia’s shift from centralised, scheduled generation to decentralised, variable sources.
In its latest blueprint for Australia’s grid of the future, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has highlighted between 6 GW and 19 GW of storage capacity will be required by 2040 to support the rapid growth in renewables entering the grid.
“Increasing the capacity of Neoen’s Western Downs Battery to store Queensland’s valuable wind and solar resources will help keep the grid in a secure operating state and offer greater stability to Queenslanders,” he said.
The France-headquartered Neoen has emerged as one of the most prolific developers of large-scale storage facilities in Australia with big batteries operating or under construction in five Australian states and territories.”
The company already owns and operates the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery in Geelong, as well as the 150 MW/193.5 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia. It has a further three batteries under construction including the four-hour duration 219 MW/877 MWh Collie Battery in Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/26/gold-hydrogen-green-lights-drilling-for-natural-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 26, 2023",Gold Hydrogen green lights drilling for natural hydrogen,"Gold Hydrogen said tests conducted by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) detected naturally occurring hydrogen in multiple soil samples taken from its Ramsay project site on the Yorke Peninsula.
Naturally occurring hydrogen – dubbed ‘white’ or ‘gold’ hydrogen – is attracting increasing attention as a potential new renewable energy source with proponents confident the resource could be exploited at a lower cost than producing the gas from fossil fuels or electrolysis.
Gold Hydrogen, which has been awarded petroleum exploration licence (PEL) 687 — which covers 7,820 square kilometres across South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula and Kangaroo Island — said the CSIRO stage one soil survey indicates potential natural hydrogen seeps which are near geological faults that extend to basement rocks across the mainland component of the site.
The Queensland-headquartered company said the survey results are “encouraging” but acknowledged the only sure way to determine if there is a hydrogen accumulation in the area is to drill one or more wells.
“Exploration wells need to be drilled, evaluated and tested to determine the presence and producibility of natural hydrogen,” it said in a statement.
Gold Hydrogen said it plans to drill the first of those wells in October 2023 with the findings to be integrated with the soil test results to assist with further exploration planning.
A second stage soil-gas survey has been tentatively scheduled for late 2023 – early 2024.
The Gold Hydrogen announcement comes after West Australian natural hydrogen startup H2EX received a federal government grant of $863,000 (USD 585,600) as a partner on a project intended to develop green and passive exploration techniques to accelerate the discovery and extraction of renewable natural hydrogen.
H2EX, which is partnering with the University of Adelaide, Australian National University, and engineering consultancy Black & Veatch on the $2.1 million project, said it will provide a clear pathway to harvest natural hydrogen, which it expects could be up to 75% cheaper than manufacturing hydrogen.
“The project will establish an exploration blueprint in this nascent industry,” H2EX Chairman Peter Coleman said. “Accelerating the discovery of natural hydrogen will assist Australia in retaining its global competitive advantage as a low-cost energy producer, for domestic and export markets.”
The project will be undertaken on H2EX’s exploration licence PEL 691, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres on South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula.
The funding was provided as part of the federal government’s Cooperative Research Centres Projects (CRC-P) Grants scheme.

The group – which also includes Dredging, Environmental and Marine Engineering NV (DEME), marine offshore specialist Jan De Nul and Ghent University – said the project’s main contractor, Equans, is now carrying out final assembly.
The group says it built the array’s floater with an unspecified type of lightweight carbon fibre material, which presents potential benefits for offshore use, but is not often used in harsh marine conditions. Optical embedded fibres and sensors attached to the structure will assess whether the material’s structural integrity (vibrations/fatigue) is in line with the numerical models and results obtained from the ocean wave tank and wind tunnel tests.
The consortium, which also has the support of Ghent University, plans to collect data from the floating plant for a year to advance the development of offshore photovoltaics on a large scale.
“It is important not only to minimize the attachment of excessive marine growth to the floater to maintain its buoyancy,” the group said. “Specific tests will be conducted to assess combining the floater systems with mussel cultivation and oyster farming, which present specific challenges.”
The project will collect data on the impact of waves, rain and salt spray on various solar module technologies with different configurations. The companies also want to assess the effects of different angles of inclination caused by waves and wind on energy yield. They also want to evaluate the effectiveness of necessary protective measures for the solar modules against seawater and bird droppings.
Tractebel is also testing another offshore solar project in the North Sea. The group, which includes DEME, solar installer Soltech NV and Ghent University, installed a $3.26 million (€2 million) array near an aquaculture farm and offshore wind project.
Expectations for this new application are high. Offshore PV in combination with wind farms on the high seas could enable the use of multiple locations and existing infrastructure for electricity.
In a study published in 2020, scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands claimed that offshore PV plants could be more productive than ground-mounted arrays, after running a simulation comparing a North Sea project to a conventional system at the Utrecht Photovoltaic Outdoor Test field. The Dutch government says it plans to commission 3 GW of offshore PV by 2030.
