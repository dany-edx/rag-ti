Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk last week launched the state’s Energy and Jobs Plan – a massive change of pace for one of the country’s more conservative states and final coal holdouts. 
With the plan, the state government announced it would be aiming to supply 70% of the state’s energy demands from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035.
It plans to reach these soon-to-be legislated targets by constructing what it’s calling the “Queensland SuperGrid” – an interconnected and massive fit out of solar, wind, battery and hydrogen generators.

Unlike New South Wales and Victoria, many of Queensland’s energy assets like power plants and transmission infrastructure are still publicly owned. The state is keen to leverage this ownership to give local manufacturing businesses a decisive leg up, since the government can control the supply chain through its role as a customer.
The government says its Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan – a 10-year vision for the state’s energy transformation – will command $62 billion (USD 40 billion) worth of public and private investment over the next 15 years. Enacting the plan, the government will follow what it’s calling a “Buy Queensland (Buy Qld)” approach. 
“Our Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan and the Buy Qld procurement approach means the publicly owned power companies will work with businesses to seize this opportunity and build entire new manufacturing supply chains to deliver this transformational infrastructure,” Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni said.
The state estimates it will need more than 2,000 wind towers and nacelles, more than 7,000 wind tower blades, almost 25 million solar modules and nearly 7,000 batteries over the coming 13 years.
“We want to seize this opportunity by manufacturing as much of this renewable energy equipment as possible right here in Queensland,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.
“$62 billion means a step change investment in wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, pumped hydro equipment and transmission lines.
“And because so much of it will be procured by Queensland Government Owned Corporations, we get the chance to use our purchasing power to drive local manufacturing, which means even more local jobs.”
“Instead of importing the wind tower blades, we could be manufacturing them in Queensland and using them to build our SuperGrid and exporting them to the world,” Deputy Premier Steven Miles added.

While this strategy seeks to use public funds to prioritise local supply chains, it’s important the private sector shares the vision. Fortescue Future Industries, headed up by Andrew ‘Twiggy” Forrest, is already constructing a 2 GW electrolyser manufacturing facility in Gladstone, Queensland – a plan that clearly has much state government involvement.
Interested businesses are being encouraged to register, with that information to be relayed to government in March 2023, with the opening of formal proposals later in the year.

To that end, the company announced on Monday it had entered an Early Works Agreement with Energy Developments Pty Ltd (EDL) to supply an off-grid renewable solution capable of operating on 100% renewable energy.
The hybrid power solution, Bellevue said, will consist of wind and solar generation, as well as a battery and backup gas generation capacity to supply around 13 MW of capacity to the site.
The hybrid solution will be deployed at the Bellevue Gold Project currently being developed in Sir Samuel in Western Australia’s Goldfields-Esperance region.
Bellevue said it has now secured the long-lead items required for the hybrid power station, which will be able to run in an ‘engines off’ mode on 100% renewables. Furthermore, Bellevue said it has designed its processing circuit to timeshift up to 1 MW of power, allowing it to maximise its renewable use.
“This agreement is a key step in Bellevue’s strategy to be powered by a forecast average of 80% renewable energy each year using a wind, solar and battery hybrid power solution,” the company said in its stock exchange (ASX) announcement.
EDL, the company contracted to supply the hybrid power station, has already built and currently operates a similar hybrid solution at the Agnew gold mine about 35km south of the Bellevue Gold Project.
Bellevue and EDL are currently negotiating a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the renewable plant, which will subject to approval by the Boards of both EDL and Bellevue.
Bellevue’s ultimate goal is to produce “carbon-neutral gold,” it says, which it believes will give it a “major competitive advantage in global investment markets.” 
“This also provides potential for the company to seek a premium for the sale of ‘green gold’,” it added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/04/nsw-opens-first-in-a-decade-of-renewable-tenders-targeting-12-gw-of-generation-by-2030/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 4, 2022","NSW opens first in a decade of renewable tenders, targeting 12 GW of generation by 2030","New South Wales officially opened its first auction for renewable energy and long-duration storage contracts on Tuesday, the beginning of a 10-year program which will see auctions held every six months.
NSW Energy Minister and Treasurer Matt Kean said the tenders, and the larger NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, have been designed to replace four of NSW’s remaining five coal power stations, which are scheduled to retire in the next 11 years.
Kean has previously said he expects all coal generators to exit the Australian market within the decade.
The first tender round, which remains open until Oct. 28, focuses on the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), in the region surrounding Dubbo in the state’s north-west.

The tender program is managed by AEMO Services, which noted in an email that “early registrations have demonstrated significant interest in the tender.”
AEMO Services also said it expects “nearly all” of the 3.6 GW of projects committed or anticipated since the enacting of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap would be eligible to participate in the first tender round, suggesting a broader scope than simply the Central-West Orana REZ location.
“Many more projects have also sufficiently progressed through the development pipeline and are likely to be eligible,” AEMO Services added.
“We expect this will deliver strong competition in Tender 1, and competition will only further intensify as REZ access schemes are enlivened over the course of our 10-year tender plan.”

Bidding generation projects will be required to achieve commercial operation by January 2025, while long-duration storage projects have until the beginning of 2027. The tender pack also includes stipulations about community engagement and benefits, regional jobs and land use considerations. 
Successful projects will be able to participate in the state’s “Long-Term Energy Service Agreements” scheme – a mechanism for the government to underwrite projects and provide financial security. 
AEMO Services previously said the desired size of the round one tender would be 2,500 GWh for annual renewable generation and 600 MW of long-duration storage, though it noted at the time that more or less generation and storage will be considered if it is “in the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers to do so.”
The NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap is expected to attract $32 billion (USD 20.7 billion) in private capital and is an enormous undertaking, balancing the massive energy demands of the most populace state with a dramatic U-turn away from coal dependency towards integrated renewables in a tight timeframe.
The NSW roadmap largely hinges on the establishment of five renewable energy zones: Central-West Orana, New England, Illawarra, Hunter-Central Coast, and South-West.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/04/how-long-do-rooftop-residential-solar-panels-last/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"OCTOBER 4, 2022",How long do rooftop residential solar panels last?,"From pv magazine USA
Residential solar panels are often sold with long-term loans or leases, with homeowners entering contracts of 20 years or more. But how long do panels last, and how resilient are they?
Panel life depends on several factors, including climate, module type, and the racking system. While there isn’t a specific “end date” for a panel per se, loss of production over time often forces equipment retirements.
When deciding whether to keep your panel running 20 to 30 years in the future, or to look for an upgrade at that time, monitoring output levels is the best way to make an informed decision. The loss of output over time, called degradation, typically lands at about 0.5% each year, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Manufacturers typically consider 25 to 30 years a point at which enough degradation has occurred where it may be time to consider replacing a panel. The industry standard for manufacturing warranties is 25 years on a solar module, said NREL.
Given the 0.5% benchmark annual degradation rate, a 20-year-old panel is capable of producing about 90% of its original capability.
Panel quality can make some impact on degradation rates. NREL reports premium manufacturers like Panasonic and LG have rates of about 0.3% per year, while some brands degrade at rates as high as 0.80%. After 25 years, these premium panels could still produce 93% of their original output, and the higher-degradation example could produce 82.5%.
A sizeable portion of degradation is attributed to a phenomenon called potential induced degradation (PID), an issue experienced by some, but not all, panels. PID occurs when the panel’s voltage potential and leakage current drive ion mobility within the module between the semiconductor material and other elements of the module, like the glass, mount, or frame. This causes the module’s power output capacity to decline, in some cases significantly.
Some manufacturers build their panels with PID-resistant materials in their glass, encapsulation, and diffusion barriers.
All panels also suffer something called light induced degradation (LID), in which panels lose efficiency within the first hours of being exposed to the sun. LID varies from panel to panel based on the quality of the crystalline silicon wafers, but usually results in a one-time, 1-3% loss in efficiency, said testing laboratory PVEL, PV Evolution Labs.
Exposure to weather conditions is the main driver in panel degradation. Heat is a key factor in both real-time panel performance and degradation over time. Ambient heat negatively affects the performance and efficiency of electrical components, said NREL.
By checking the manufacturer’s data sheet, a panel’s temperature coefficient can be found, which will demonstrate the panel’s ability to perform in higher temperatures.
The coefficient explains how much real-time efficiency is lost by each degree of Celsius increased above the standard temperature of 25 C. For example, a temperature coefficient of -0.353% means that for every degree Celsius above 25, 0.353% of total production capability is lost.
Heat exchange drives panel degradation through a process called thermal cycling. When it is warm, materials expand, and when the temperature lowers, they contract. This movement slowly causes microcracks to form in the panel over time, lowering output.
In its annual Module Score Card study, PVEL analysed 36 operational solar projects in India, and found significant impacts from heat degradation. The average annual degradation of the projects landed at 1.47%, but arrays located in colder, mountainous regions degraded at nearly half that rate, at 0.7%.
Proper installation can help deal with heat related issues. Panels should be installed a few inches above the roof, so that convective air can flow beneath and cool the equipment. Light-coloured materials can be used in panel construction to limit heat absorption. And components like inverters and combiners, whose performance is particularly sensitive to heat, should be located in shaded areas, suggested CED Greentech. 
Wind is another weather condition that can cause some harm to solar panels. Strong wind can cause flexing of the panels, called dynamic mechanical load. This also causes microcracks in the panels, lowering output. Some racking solutions are optimised for high-wind areas, protecting the panels from strong uplift forces and limiting microcracking. Typically, the manufacturer’s datasheet will provide information on the max winds the panel is able to withstand.
The same goes for snow, which can cover panels during heavier storms, limiting output. Snow can also cause a dynamic mechanical load, degrading the panels. Typically, snow will slide off of panels, as they are slick and run warm, but in some cases a homeowner may decide to clear the snow off the panels. This must be done carefully, as scratching the glass surface of the panel would make a negative impact on output.
Degradation is a normal, unavoidable part of a panel’s life. Proper installation, careful snow clearing, and careful panel cleaning can help with output, but ultimately, a solar panel is a technology with no moving parts, requiring very little maintenance.
To ensure a given panel is likely to live a long life and operate as planned, it must undergo standards testing for certification. Panels are subject to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) testing, which apply to both mono- and polycrystalline panels.
EnergySage said panels that achieve IEC 61215 standard are tested for electrical characteristics like wet leakage currents, and insulation resistance. They under go a mechanical load test for both wind and snow, and climate tests that check for weaknesses to hot spots, UV exposure, humidity-freeze, damp heat, hail impact, and other outdoor exposure.
IEC 61215 also determines a panel’s performance metrics at standard test conditions, including temperature coefficient, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power output.
Also commonly seen on a panel spec sheet is the seal of Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which also provides standards and testing. UL runs climactic and ageing tests, as well as the full gamut of safety tests.
Solar panel failure happens at a low rate. NREL conducted a study of over 50,000 systems installed in the United States and 4,500 globally between the years of 2000 and 2015. The study found a median failure rate of 5 panels out of 10,000 annually.
Panel failure has improved markedly over time, as it was found that system installed between 1980 and 2000 demonstrated a failure rate double the post-2000 group.
System downtime is rarely attributed to panel failure. In fact, a study by kWh Analytics found that 80% of all solar plant downtime is a result of failing inverters, the device that converts the panel’s DC current to usable AC. pv magazine will analyse inverter performance in the next edition of this series.
