“The US is now hell bent on creating alternative supply chains all the way through the fundamental critical minerals and raw materials and that includes making finance available for deployment even outside of the United States,” Scaysbrook said. “Support for industry available to the US corporates and even their Australian partners goes beyond anything Australia could even contemplate putting in.”
Tim Buckley, director of Climate Energy Finance, agrees. “We’re seeing a total change in the landscape,” Buckley told pv magazine Australia.
The question then becomes not if the US policy will change Australia’s industries, but whether we’re willing to play the role our ally is pushing for.

“This is the big question mark for the Australian federal government and state governments, particularly in Queensland and WA, and also for the Australian public in terms of where we stand on environmental impact,” Scaysbrook said at a briefing on Tuesday, Nov. 22.
“Onshore processing of critical minerals is fantastic from a job creation perspective, it’s fantastic from a value add economic stimulus point of view, but some of these processes do have significant environmental impacts.”
Scaysbrook added that countries like China are able to embrace “some of the more impactful processes” on the environment, processes which, historically, Australia has baulked at.

As an example, Scaysbrook pointed to the processing of silica sand into polysilicon – something which requires high temperature incineration and produces heavy metal byproducts. These require careful disposal so as not to leach into waterways. For Australians to accept such industries, a lot of protections would need to surround these processes. “And does that extra cost cut into our competitiveness?” Scaysbrook asked.
The answer is yes, but these added costs Scaysbrook believes the US would tolerate because of the security and credibility of an Australian supply chain.
Buckley too believes price alone won’t cut Australia out of the race. Then refining industry’s environmental impacts, however, could. “It will be a constant battle,” Buckley said.
Public opposition has the potential to seriously undercut the burgeoning industry unless governments, namely the federal Albanese government, enforce “sensible regulations” around the whole ecosystem early, including thinking about recycling, processing facility efficiency and carbon standards and pollution, Buckley said.

In Buckley’s eyes, it is possible for Australia to refine critical minerals and rare earths cleanly. “Of course there are warts, but they can be managed.”
“Does Australia’s mining industry have history of doing things badly? Yes,” he said. But if better rules are imposed, we have an opportunity to do better, he added.
“The government needs to step up,” Buckley said.

Australia can also reduce need for refineries if we introduce recycling practices from the start, “rather than ten years down the track,” he added. 
The cold, hard truth is that someone, somewhere, is going to need to do this mining and processing. That is, “unless we start to talk about degrowth,” Buckley said.
Alongside the pollution issue, refining and processing tend to be extremely energy intensive. Buckley pointed to US chemical giant Albemarle’s Kemerton lithium processing plant near Bunbury, south of Perth. 
Opened this year, the plant produces several tonnes of carbon for every tonne of lithium hydroxide it produces, Buckley said. Facilities like this will undoubtedly be impacted by Australia’s safeguard mechanism if federal Labor follows through with its emission reductions targets.

Buckley says there is lots of scope to electrify these processes – but until now, industry hasn’t been mandated to. Some players like Korea Zinc are moving in that direction, but changes are hardly across the board.
While ‘greening’ industry practices obviously involves capital outlay, Buckley suggested such investments could add to Australia’s attraction. Buckley pointed to Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt, which has managed to make its supply chain credibility and transparency a major selling point.
Yes, Buckley said, Australia is going to be more expensive for minerals processing than China and the Congo, but it has more global credibility – which is highly valuable.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s quarter of the price in China if the Teslas, GMs and Fords wont buy from China,” Buckley added, referring to the recent surge in automanufacturers signing contracts for Australian lithium and other materials.
Buckley here alludes to a point that was also on Scaysbrooks’ mind: the growing adversity between China and the US. This is particularly tricky for Australia, indelibly tied to Chinese products, but something of a political ‘lapdog’ for the US.
“There’s a bit of a macro conflict from a thematic perspective, in terms of having our renewables ambitions largely dependent on imported equipment manufactured in China, and having our supply chain hopes and ambitions around critical minerals now increasingly joined at the hip with what is going on in America,” Scaysbrook said.
“I haven’t figured that one out but I can see it plain as day.”

The newly raised capital, the ASX-listed ReNu said, will go towards its Tasmanian and Indonesian green hydrogen projects – which it is primarily pursuing through its wholly owned subsidiary Countrywide Hydrogen, which it acquired in February.
In Tasmania, ReNu is moving to build a modest 5 MW facility at Brighton near Hobart. It also recently announced its plan to work with Australian Pacific Airports to develop another 5 MW facility at Launceston Airport, where the design is set to deploy a solar array on vacant airport land to provide behind-the-meter electricity.
Also in November, ReNu announced its memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Anantara Energy, a partnership between Singapore-based independent power producer Quantum Power Asia and German PV developer ib vogt, to investigate the feasibility of developing a large-scale green hydrogen production facility in Indonesia’s Riau archipelago. The plan features a 10 MW electrolyser supported by at least 100 MW of solar.
“This capital raise improves our balance sheet and strengthens our financial position to progress our various green hydrogen projects to the next stage of development and co-invest alongside HESTA who recently signed a term sheet for up to $100 million investment in our green hydrogen projects,”  ReNu Energy CEO Greg Watson said.
“The raise also allows us to boost our internal team to increase our ability to deliver on our project plans and build our portfolio of strategic renewable & clean energy investments,” Watson added.
The company’s busy November has seen its share price climb 50%, clawing back some of the value it has lost in the past years.

Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the fund will also aim to leverage a further $500 million from the private sector and include a “growth capital” offering for clean energy technology businesses looking to expand.
“While we excel in research, Australia has been losing out for too long when it comes to commercialisation,” Minister Bowen said about the funding boost. “We need to continue developing innovative technologies that will help power Australia, and realising more of their economic benefits here.”
Bowen pointed to ventures like “energy-efficient smart city sensors and innovations in solar arrays and battery technologies” as possible avenues where CEFC’s funding could flow.
The $500 million allocation will be added to CEFC’s so-called “Special Account,” the minister’s statement said, and the details of the fund will be included in CEFC’s investment mandate.
“Through the Powering Australia Technology Fund, Australian businesses will be able to scale up creative projects using clean energy technologies,” Bowen said.
The Powering Australia Technology Fund will be similar to CEFC’s Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which supports early-stage companies developing technology to reduce emissions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/23/interactive-chart-of-solar-cell-efficiency/,"RESEARCH,UNITED STATES,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 23, 2022",Interactive chart of solar cell efficiency updated,"From pv magazine Global
NREL has unveiled a new version of its Best Research-Cell Efficiency Chart. The tool highlights the highest confirmed conversion efficiencies of research cells for a range of PV technologies.
With the new interactive version, users can pull up decades of research data and compare custom charts that focus on specific technologies or time periods, NREL said in a statement. They can now find data on a cell’s current, voltage output, and fill factor, in addition to efficiency. The availability of those details will depend on the information in NREL’s records.
The highest research cell efficiency recorded in the chart is 47.1%, for a four-junction cell. Its interactive nature allows users to visualize the recent jump in conversion efficiencies for emerging technologies like perovskite solar cells. That contrasts with the steady improvement of silicon solar cell efficiency since the 1980s.
“It’s possible that the NREL efficiency chart is the most presented graph that you can find at the annual PV Specialists Conference and similar conferences,” said Sarah Kurtz, senior research fellow at NREL. “But it has gotten so full that it’s difficult to see the data. With the new interactive chart, researchers will be able to still use the data, but present it in a way that communicates better for their talk.”
The cell efficiencies are measured by independent testing centres, including NREL, before earning a spot on the chart. All of the figures are also available as a downloadable file.

China’s Sunova Solar has unveiled a new n-type solar module for commercial and industrial projects, as well as utility-scale PV plants.
“The n-type solar cells of the Sunova Thor modules have no natural light-induced degradation (LID) and a power generation that can be of over 10% compared to conventional p-type modules,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The modules feature 144 half-cut monocrystalline cells and weigh 32.5 kg. Their open-circuit voltage ranges between 50.4 V and 51.2 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.93 A and 14.17 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panels have an IP68 enclosure and 2 mm of anti-reflecting glass. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.31% per degree Celsius, with an operational temperature ranging from -40 C to 85 C.
The new panels come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“The Thor module is fully certified and sales have now commenced,” the spokesperson said. “Sunova’s warranties are also backed up by renowned insurance companies such as Ariel r.e. and Lloyds.”
Sunova Solar is based in Wuxi, in China’s Jiangsu province. It currently runs three factories in China and Vietnam, with an aggregate solar module manufacturing capacity of 3 GW.
