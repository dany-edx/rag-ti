https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/06/diversity-is-power/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 6, 2023",Diversity is power,"In a 2021 report, the ‘Equal by 30’ initiative estimated that women account for 32% of the energy sector. While women make up 39% or roles at the entry level, they represent just 26% or all executives and “C-Suite” leaders. 
In 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that on average, there are 76% fewer women than men working in the energy sector, a significant difference from the average 8% gap seen across the total workforce.
These estimates are hardly groundbreaking, and many women working in the sector will probably shrug their shoulders in agreement with the findings. But what is interesting is the research done to date on why this is the case. 
There is no single issue that shines out, but a gradual and persistent accumulation of small cultural and behavioural factors which over time have a negative impact. 
From my own personal experience, the effect of regularly being the only woman in the room is exhausting. A sense of belonging cannot be underestimated. Looking up and across and seeing no female role models makes it challenging to further a career. 
In addition, “solutions” today tend to be focused on helping women change – they are sent on courses to build confidence; become more assertive or develop leadership traits. In other words, training for women to behave and act more like men. This is not, and never will be, the answer. 
To succeed in any career, not just energy, women need space to be able to develop, they need role models and supporters who actively promote them. They need organisations and employees to recognise that their skills and behaviours are possibly different from the prevailing norm, but this difference is what gives diversity its power. 
Creating a sustainable and innovative future will depend on our ability to harness all possible talent to foster breakthrough ideas, technologies, and solutions that will transform our world.
From my perspective as a woman working at a senior level in the energy sector, the solutions are relatively simple (at least in theory):
There is no lack of talent or energy held by women in the sector and there are clearly some great things going on in many organisations. But the momentum must continue – building to support women in achieving their potential in their chosen careers as through empowering women, the energy industry will flourish.
The Equality Initiative
Australia is one of the 13 member countries who have joined the Equality in Energy Transitions Initiative (Equality Initiative). The Equality in Energy Transitions Initiative is a collaboration between the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), with the aim of advancing women’s participation in clean energy and closing the gender gap in the energy sector. 
In addition, the Australian government has made a committed to achieving gender equality in the energy sector by 2030. On 17 January Australia formalised this commitment by signing up to the equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunity objectives of the global Equal by 30 campaign. 
Due to take place on March 8, 2023, the theme for this year’s International Women’s Day is “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/06/queensland-to-partner-with-sec-on-solar-panel-recycling-pilot/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 6, 2023",Queensland to partner with SEC on solar panel recycling pilot,"Queensland Environment Minister Meaghan Scanlon has unveiled a draft e-products plan featuring a proposal to ban solar panels and other related equipment including batteries from being dumped into landfill within 10 years.
The state government said almost 1,000 tonnes of solar panels and battery energy storage systems was dumped into landfills across Queensland in 2019 and that figure is expected to increase significantly by the end of the decade.
“It is forecast that by 2030, the mix of e-waste generated per annum will change significantly. Solar PV and battery storage waste will grow the fastest to over 17,000 tonnes,” the 28-page draft report reads.
The 10-year plan will be complemented by an industry-led solar panel recycling scheme, with the government investing an initial $250,000 to fund a two-stage pilot program.
The pilot, to be led by the Smart Energy Council (SEC), will firstly identify participants and locations to divert end-of-life solar panels from landfill and recover their useful materials. Victoria-based circular economy specialists The Activ Group will also develop a tracking and information system to log volumes and locations of recovered materials.
The second stage of the pilot will see the collection, recovery and recycling of panels, with the focus on rooftop installations.
“With the highest rooftop solar penetration in the country, we need to explore how we deal with panels when they reach the end of their life,” Scanlon said in a statement.
“We’ve seen industry is keen to get involved, now it’s just a case of how – which is where the pilot led by the Smart Energy Council and Activ Group comes in.”
SEC Acting Chief Executive Officer Wayne Smith said the pilot program will help identify the optimum ways to encourage and incentivise higher quality recovery opportunities to deliver improved outcomes.
“The trial will examine the best ways to address any economic and logistical obstacles preventing the effective collection and disposal of unwanted household solar panels, with an initial focus on regional areas,” he said.
The SEC said it will establish a consultative committee, including PV manufacturers, distributors, retailers, installers and certificate traders; recycling companies; regulators; and local and state government representatives.
“The committee will meet monthly during the trial period to share advice, data and learnings to help inform a possible future solar stewardship scheme,” Smith said.
Peter Newland, Chief Executive Officer of Brisbane-based solar installer Planet Ark Power, welcomed the initiative, saying in addition to the environmental benefits, the proposal has the potential to deliver significant savings.
“Following hailstorms in Brisbane a couple of years ago we had to send damaged solar panels to Sydney for recycling at a cost of $3,000 per pallet,” he said.
“To develop a local recycling industry in a state that has installed more solar panels than any other in Australia is a very welcome addition to the Queensland’s clean technology sector and to the development of a circular economy.”
Scanlon said members of the public, industry and businesses can give feedback on the draft e-products plan until April 17.
“The draft plan shows Queensland is serious about dealing with electronic waste, and now we want to hear from Queenslanders and industry to make sure we get it right,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/06/sims-announces-plan-to-sell-stake-in-lms-energy/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 6, 2023",Sims announces plan to sell stake in LMS Energy,"Sims announced today it has commenced a process to sell its shareholding in LMS Energy after a strategic review of its assets identified that the company would be better served putting more funds into its core business of metal recycling.
Sims Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Alastair Field said Brisbane-based LMS remains a good business but not a core asset and the sale is consistent with the company’s business strategy to recycle capital and grow the core metal business.
“LMS has grown to be a leading bioenergy and methane abatement company in Australia and expanded into new markets including the United States,” he said in a statement. “The business has an experienced, dedicated management team, and I am confident in its continued growth.”
Founded in 1996, LMS was the first Australian company to successfully design and install a solar facility on a landfill site and now owns and operates six PV facilities and 36 plants turning biogas into energy. The facilities, established on landfill sites throughout Australia, collectively generate approximately 600,000 MWh of baseload renewable energy each year.
The company’s solar assets include a 1.5 MW solar system at Albury in New South Wales, a 0.15 MW system at Wollert in Victoria, a 1.15 MW system in the northern suburbs of Adelaide in South Australia and a 0.6 MW array at Seaford Heights in the city’s south.

LMS said its strategy of establishing PV plants on landfill sites helps address land-use concerns associated with the development of large-scale solar farms.
“One of the big knocks against solar panels is how much land they take up compared to how much power they generate,” the company said. “Decommissioned landfill sites can be an excellent platform for generating solar energy as often they can’t be used for other purposes due to potential contamination risks. And they’re already close to electricity grid infrastructure because of electricity generation from landfill biogas.”
LMS chairman John Falzon said the relationship remains strong with Sims and he is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead with a new partner.
“I believe in this business and my family is committed to continuing to grow our business to preserve the planet for future generations,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/06/nsw-announces-1-5-billion-in-concessions-for-green-hydrogen-projects/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 6, 2023",NSW commits $1.5 billion in concessions for green hydrogen projects,"The New South Wales (NSW) government has committed $64 million to help finance green hydrogen hub projects in the Illawarra region, and near Moree in the state’s west. The funding was announced as applications opened for the NSW government’s $1.5 billion in concessions for large-scale green hydrogen producers.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the “globally competitive” funding and concessions, part of the NSW Hydrogen Strategy first announced in 2021, will drive green hydrogen costs down by about 40% to the state government’s target of less than $2.80 per kilogram by 2030.
“Green hydrogen producers across NSW are now able to access $1.5 billion in concessions to reduce costs for large-scale investment, including up to a 90% reduction in their electricity network charges if they connect to parts of the grid with spare network capacity,” he said.
“This policy will see us grow our economy by up to $600 million every single year and see $80 billion invested in NSW by 2050. It’s an absolute gamechanger.”
The funding will support initial development of a 10 MW electrolyser in the Illawarra, which will have an annual green hydrogen production capacity of about 1,400 tonnes, and a 12 MW electrolyser near Moree.
The Moree plant, to be established on Sundown Pastoral Company’s 65,000-hectare Keytah cotton farm, will be used in a project to convert green hydrogen and air-captured hydrogen into green ammonia for use as fertiliser on properties in the region. The project is expected to ramp up to 112 MW of capacity by 2030, and abate an estimated 283,929 tonnes of emissions by 2030.
The 10 MW Illawarra project, being developed as part of gas and engineering firm BOC’s Illawarra Hydrogen Technology Hub at Port Kembla, will be capable of producing four tonnes of green hydrogen daily to be used to help drive decarbonisation in the transport and industrial sectors. The project will initially feature four hydrogen refuelling stations capable of powering up to 40 heavy vehicles per day.
BOC aims to expand electrolyser capacity to 650 MW to support decarbonisation of local steel, glass, and cement production and abate 716,514 tonnes of emissions by 2030.
Kean said the incentives will be pivotal in helping NSW scale up the emerging green hydrogen industry, securing the state’s energy needs into the future while ensuring Australian industry can continue to compete on the global stage.
“These incentives will set us up for success as we compete with the high-profile US Inflation Reduction Act hydrogen incentives, because the NSW concessions can apply to projects finishing well beyond 2030, while the US program finishes in 2032,” he said.
“Green hydrogen can help drive deep decarbonisation in hard-to-abate market segments within the transport, industrial and energy sectors which account for around 18% of NSW’s annual emissions.”
“Providing these hard-to-abate sectors with a pathway to zero emissions is crucial to safeguarding their NSW business operations and employees, and setting them up to thrive in a global low-carbon economy.”

Meanwhile, the push to decarbonise the transport industry reached a new milestone today with the state’s first hydrogen-powered electric bus taking to the streets of the Central Coast in a local trial of the technology.
NSW Regional Transport Minister Sam Farraway said the trial is an important milestone in plans to transition the state’s 8000-strong public transport fleet to zero emissions technology by 2047 and said it will help evaluate how well hydrogen stacks up against electric as a clean energy technology.
The NSW government is now in caretaker mode ahead of the state election on March. 25, 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/06/study-shows-payback-times-for-heat-pumps-could-plunge-by-2030/,"FINANCE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,EUROPE,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MARCH 6, 2023",Study shows payback times for heat pumps could plunge by 2030,"From pv magazine Global
By 2030, the payback period for heat pumps and rooftop solar could fall by periods of several years, according to a new report by McKinsey & Company.
“Attractiveness of each investment (as measured by the payback period) is likely to increase as EU industries scale and reduce production and installation costs,” said the global management consulting firm .
The analysis considers three price scenarios, using a German single-family home as an example. A “high commodity price” scenario, a “high gas but average power price” scenario, and a low-commodity price scenario, where gas prices return to historical averages and power prices reach new lows.
Heat pumps and rooftop solar both have the longest payback periods in the low power price scenario, but it also has the high decreases in payback periods between 2022 and 2030. The payback periods for heat pumps could fall by 38%, from 17.1 years in 2022 to 10.6 years in 2030. The payback period for rooftop solar could fall by 31%, from 12.6 years in 2022 to 8.7 years in 2030.
Heat pumps have the shortest payback periods under the “average power price” scenario. The payback period could decrease by 28% in this time frame, from 12.5 years in 2022 to nine years in 2030. For rooftop solar, average payback periods could fall from 9.2 years in 2022 to 5.8 years in 2030.
Rooftop solar has the shortest payback periods under the “high-power price” scenario. It could fall 34% from 8.2 years in 2022 to 5.4 years in 2030. The payback period for heat pumps could go from 15.1 years in 2022 to 10.3 years in 2030, down 32%.
“These payback periods (and therefore household energy costs) could lower further due to decreasing electricity costs as the power system decarbonises and decentralises (reducing costs at peak times),” said McKinsey & Company.
The new study focuses on three initiatives that reportedly have the largest potential to substantially improve the energy efficiency of EU buildings: the ramping up of rooftop solar and heat pump installations, and the improvement of the insulation of buildings.
It finds that the yearly deployment of rooftop solar will need to be around 33 GW to reach the EU’s Fit-for-55 and Repower EU targets, compared with the record rate of 22 GW in 2022 and the 10 GW average of the last four years.
“Heat pump deployment will also need to keep growing at 12.5% a year through to 2030 to reach RePowerEU’s target of 54 million heat pumps by 2030,” the authors say. At the end of 2021, Europe had reportedly installed 15 million heat pumps, with McKinsey estimating an additional 2.5 million installations in 2022.
The consultancy firm suggests five key drivers to help catalyse these changes: upskilling the workforce, setting up appropriate incentive mechanisms, attracting financing and private capital, investing in grid infrastructure, and creating net-zero and circular supply chains.
The forthcoming March edition of pv magazine features an extended article from the McKinsey report authors about the outlook and competitiveness of the European solar production industry.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/06/baywa-re-to-sell-pv-product-distribution-business/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,GERMANY,WORLD",ROLAND ERNST,"MARCH 6, 2023",BayWa re to sell PV product distribution business,"From pv magazine Germany
BayWa AG says it wants to sell the PV product distribution business of its BayWa re subsidiary. It aims to use the sales proceeds to expand the unit’s portfolio as an IPP to 3 GW, with the aim of tripling the size of its renewable energy project business by 2026. The German conglomerate said BayWa re’s project pipeline currently comprises 24 GW of projects.
BayWa re’s solar trade division has 20 distribution companies and more than 1,400 employees throughout the world. It says it has the potential to increase annual sales of solar modules and inverters to more than 10 GW. However, the Munich-based group did not provide details about the expected sales proceeds.
“With a powerful buyer, we have the opportunity to continue the extraordinary success story of the group that began in 2008,” said Klaus Josef Lutz, CEO of Baywa AG and chairman of the BayWa re supervisory board. “Today we are an important pacesetter in the energy transition. We generate more than half of our consolidated earnings with renewable energies.”
The strategic realignment is related to a capital increase launched at the end of 2020, according to a BayWa spokeswoman. Since then, Swiss investor Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP) has taken a 49% stake in BayWa re, with parent BayWa AG holding a 51% stake. BayWa re has received €530 million ($830 million) as an equity contribution.
