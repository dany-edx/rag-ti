The wide-spread destruction of infrastructure by Indonesian militias in 1999 and prior has severely impeded Timor-Leste’s human and economic development for more than two decades.
Despite progress, a significant proportion of the country’s population continues to live in abject poverty. A lack of access to proper nutrition, basic sanitation, health services, safe drinking water, and reliable energy are still evident throughout the country.
Meanwhile, the country’s fledgling economy relies heavily on fleeting offshore oil and gas reserves – with one large untapped field in the Timor Sea at the centre of an international tug-of-war. Aware of the current climate of … climate (pun intended), the country’s President and former Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Jose Ramos-Horta has publicly stated that he would happily leave their fossil fuels under the seafloor if high-income nations increased foreign aid to support the country’s development.
Over seven days in the country our group met with 15 different stakeholders – from the president of the country’s petroleum authority, to the villagers who walk hours to load $5 on to their electricity accounts. We did this in order to understand the dynamics of how the energy transition is affecting one of our closest neighbours.

Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) sits just an 80-minute flight from Darwin. Once a Portuguese colony in the 16th century, the territory remained under Portuguese rule until 1975, when it was occupied by Indonesian forces. The East Timorese resistance, led by the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN), fought against Indonesian rule for 24 years, during which time as many as 200,000 East Timorese were killed.
In 1999, a UN-supervised referendum was held in which its people voted overwhelmingly for independence. After the announcement of the results, pro-Indonesian militias engaged in a campaign of violence and mass destruction, resulting in the deaths of thousands, and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. Some estimate that more than 80% of the country’s infrastructure was destroyed during this final act of carnage – including hospitals, water facilities and large parts of the country’s electricity network.
The eventual intervention of an international peacekeeping force helped restore order and pave the way for Timor-Leste’s independence. In 2002, the country officially declared independence and remains Asia’s newest sovereign state.
Today Timor-Leste has a population of 1.3 million with a median age of just 19.6 years. The Asian Development Bank reports that 41.8% of the country live below the national poverty line, and 22.6% of its employed population earn below USD 1.90 per day.

For me the most salient takeaway from the trip was the ubiquitous impact that a lack reliable electricity has on quality-of-life outcomes.
Our group (of relatively privileged Australians) became acutely aware of this upon spending two nights in homestays on the island of Atauro. The island’s diesel-fuelled electricity grid runs only from 8am to 12pm and then again from 2pm until 10pm. Our homestay families provided incredibly warm and generous hospitality, but unfortunately there was little they could do to ensure we could achieve a good night’s sleep. Many of the houses on the island are made of concrete and are unventilated – and a lack of electricity means that the very humid and hot conditions cannot be alleviated by fans or any other form of cooling.
But a couple of nights of restless sleep are a minor quibble to more pressing issues.
The island’s maritime police only have access to the main grid. When the grid is not running, the police station in the north cannot radio to the station on the south of the island as there is also no mobile phone reception. The main hospital for the island also does not have a working backup generator. If you’re in need of medical help on the island after 10pm, the doctors and nurses can only do their work under the light of their phone torches and without any medical equipment that requires electricity.
Back on the mainland, the country’s main electricity grid runs 24 hours a day, except when it doesn’t. Several locals in the mountain town of Maubisse explained that blackouts are common but especially during rain – perhaps the result of a poorly insulated distribution network. Power quality is also an issue. One hotel owner complained of six broken fridges as a result of voltage surges.
Electricity was free in most areas until last year, when the rollout of electrification increased and led the government to install power meters within homes and businesses. The system is prepaid. Residents provide their meter number with payment, and in return receive a code which they then punch into their power meter. Many locals do not have a bank account and some are without internet, which forces them to top-up their meters manually – one man we met walks two to three hours to the nearest town to purchase $5 worth of electricity every month.
While its people struggle with access to energy, the country’s economy is reliant on it. The headline stat is that offshore oil and gas accounts for 90% of the country’s GDP.
The Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea is currently the government’s main source of revenue but is slowly winding down production. The Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was established in 2005 as an attempt to provide a long-term source of revenue for the country after its reserves are fully depleted, intended to replicate the design of Norway’s sovereign wealth fund. The Petroleum Fund’s most recent report from September 2022 showed its balance to be $16.91b, down 11.79% year-on-year – stating that $404m was transferred out of the fund to finance the national budget in Q3 2022 alone.
The Greater Sunrise project is one of the country’s remaining untapped oil and gas fields. Estimated to contain over 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 225 million barrels of condensate, it’s thought to have a $50b resource valuation. The project has been locked in a 20-year standoff between Timor-Leste and Australia because of debate over which country the pipeline should lead to and where the gas should be processed. Timor does not currently have the onshore refinery facilities for the project, but the biggest roadblock is a 3000-metre-deep trench (the ‘Timor Trough’) that sits in between the field and its shorelines. The trough poses a major engineering challenge for any pipeline that would lead to Timor’s south coast.
Our meeting with ANPM (the national petroleum authority) reiterated the Timorese desire to overcome these difficult engineering and commercial challenges in order to boost local jobs and broaden economic benefits. Until now, the prevailing view of their Australian counterparts is that a pipeline to Darwin is the only viable option. A floating LNG plant was a third option previously favoured by operator Woodside but that proposal has also not been pursued thus far.

Last September, the IMF warned that the country faced “the risk of a fiscal cliff” if the Greater Sunrise project was further delayed or if reforms to the country’s petroleum fund were not made. La’o Hamutuk – a Dili-based NGO we visited, monitors the country’s economic progress and also reported concerns over recent and planned withdrawals from the fund to underwrite subsequent budget announcements.
Several humanitarian organisations and other NGOs have funded small-scale solar projects to reduce some communities’ reliance on the electricity grid, and in some rural areas, have provided electricity access for the first time. However, a lack of capital and the skilled workforce needed are obvious barriers to a material uptake for residents and business owners to do so on their own accord.
Efforts are also being made to diversify the country’s economic pathways. Two industries with significant potential are tourism and coffee production. The country boasts a rich cultural heritage and unspoiled coral reefs, providing great opportunities for growth for international tourism. Its coffee industry is more mature on the other hand, and dates back to the colonial era when Portuguese settlers introduced coffee trees to the island. Not-for-profit cooperatives such as PARCIC Coffee are actively assisting family-owned coffee farms in processing and exporting their raw coffee beans to the Asian market.
The story of a resource-dependent economy attempting to progressively navigate away from mining fossil fuels might sound familiar to Australians. For Timor-Leste however, the consequences seem much more dire if done unsuccessfully.

Wirsol, which entered the Australian market in 2017, owns and operates renewable energy and storage projects across New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Queensland. Its portfolio includes 422 MW of operational solar and storage projects and nearly double that in development.
Gentari’s purchase of the portfolio, understood to have been priced at just under $1 billion (USD 705 million), marks the company’s entry into the Australian renewable energy market.
It is also the latest milestone in the path towards Gentari achieving its target of 30 to 40 GW in renewable energy capacity by 2030, increasing its overall renewables portfolio to approximately 1.6 GW of installed capacity in Malaysia, India, UAE and Australia.
The company said its plans to grow its solar capacity and battery energy storage capability, and to position itself as a green hydrogen producer, with Australia as a strategic market to achieve these goals.
Gentari Chief Executive Officer Sushil Purohit said the acquisition of Wirsol is a key building block for Gentari in Australia.
“Australia offers strong market potential, underpinned by supportive government policies and a robust financing ecosystem, making the investment into Wirsol Energy a natural choice for Gentari,” he said.
“This addition to Gentari’s portfolio will enable us to continue our efforts in building capacity for delivering integrated sustainable energy solutions, to help customers make the journey to net zero emissions.”
Wirsol’s Australian assets include the 90 MW Clermont Solar Farm in Queensland and the 110 MW Wemen Solar Farm in north-western Victoria. Its development pipeline includes the 445 MW Maryvale Solar and Energy Storage project being developed in western NSW, and has acquired the land rights to develop the 75-85 MW Barnawartha Solar Farm in Victoria.

The NSW government is planning to conduct a competitive process to partner with the private sector to test cost effective ways to upgrade to zero emissions homes in an urban, regional and remote community.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the falling price of clean technologies like rooftop solar, batteries and heat pumps is making it easier for households to save money on their energy bills while lowering their carbon footprint.
“This trial will focus on finding the best ways to save households money on their energy bills by installing zero emissions appliances and technologies,” he said. “This is all about using the latest technology to give people more control of their energy bills, while contributing to NSW’s target to reduce emissions by 70% by 2035.”
The pilot program will launch in the second half of 2023 and will be voluntary for households in the selected communities to join. The government did not identify the selected communities, simply saying it is important to trial the technologies across different communities.

Independent research organisation Rewiring Australia has strongly endorsed the program, saying it will provide the proof of concept for community electrification.
Rewiring Australia co-founder and chief scientist, Dr Saul Griffith, said electrification using clean technologies that are already available is the fastest, cheapest way to combat inflation and decarbonise the economy.
Griffith said a pilot program would help Australian industry better understand and make the most of the technology transition and prepare the electricity network for future needs.
“The Australian people have the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world, and they know that a small push from the government will allow them to go further by installing the batteries, electric cooktops, heaters and water systems that free them of fossil fuel emissions and bills,” he said. “Committing to this trial allows governments to foster the technology breakthroughs we know the world will need to dramatically reduce emissions by 2030.”
Dan Cass, executive director and co-founder of Rewiring Australia said he hoped the federal government would take inspiration from the NSW announcement and include funding for more community electrification pilots in the next budget.

The funding round was led by Toyota Ventures, the almost $220 million (USD 150 million) investment arm of the world’s biggest car maker. US-based deep tech venture firm Creative Ventures also joined Relectrify as a new investor while existing shareholders, including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the venture arms of South Korean industrial company GS and European power company EDP continued their support for Relectrify’s technology.
Melbourne-based Relectrify has developed battery technology that combines granular cell-level control software with a novel integrated battery management system (BMS) and inverter hardware solution. The patented hybrid system replaces conventional BMS and inverters with a single electronic solution that controls individual cells to generate grid-compliant alternating current (AC) directly from a battery pack.
The company said the technology revolutionises battery storage, increasing the cycle life of a lithium-ion battery by as much as a third, and reducing power electronic costs by up to 30% compared to traditional battery systems.

Having previously proven its technology in its own ReVolve battery energy storage product – which combines the BMS+Inverter technology with nine second-life EV batteries to store over 120 kWh of energy – Relectify plans to scale up operations by working with partners to integrate its electronics components and co-develop products via licensing agreements.
“Our team at Relectrify is helping the world transition to renewable energy by making battery energy storage a more compelling commercial proposition,” Relectrify Chief Executive Officer Valentin Muenzel said.
“We are excited to be joined by Toyota Ventures and Creative Ventures as we move into high-volume battery storage systems including using non-lithium and particularly new Li-ion cells.”
Relectrify’s technology, which can be used across residential, industrial and grid storage, using either new or second-life batteries, has already been demonstrated in numerous technical pilots projects around the world, including with major US utility American Electric Power, Nissan North America and New Zealand-based electricity provider Counties Energy.
Toyota Ventures Climate Fund Partner Lisa Coca said the technology has the potential to unlock significant cost, lifetime, safety and resilience benefits for battery systems, whether they are repurposed EV batteries or new stationary energy storage systems.
“Robust energy storage solutions are key to reaching net zero,” she said.  “We look forward to supporting the team as they contribute to decarbonization by reinventing the battery management system and inverter technology.”

The state government said up to $3.75 million is available in the first round of the Charge Up Workplace Grant Program which targets not for-profit organisations, small and medium businesses, and local government authorities.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the grants will meet about half the costs of buying and installing charging stations and associated software, making it easier and more cost-effective for successful applicants to install EV charging equipment.
“The program will fund EV chargers in the workplace and at destinations where people typically spend time during the day, for example carparks, hospitality businesses, tourist attractions, parks and beaches,” he said.
“The program prioritises daytime charging, which will enable EV owners to charge up from the abundant solar energy that powers the grid when the sun is shining.”
Round one grants will fund:-
A maximum grant value of $50,000 per approved applicant will apply in metropolitan areas, with a maximum value of $75,000 in regional and remote areas in recognition of the higher installation costs.
Round one grant applications close on 12 May 2023 and WA Climate Action Minister Reece Whitby encouraged businesses and councils to apply for funding to support the EV switch, adding that as well as expanding EV charging infrastructure, the grants are expected to support the conversion of organisation fleets to EVs and stimulate a second-hand EV market.
“We want Western Australians to embrace this transition, and the grant funding is an important step to drive the uptake of electric vehicles across our state,” he said.
The program is part of the WA government’s almost $60 million Clean Energy Car Fun announced as part of the 2022-23 State Budget.

Longi Hydrogen, a subsidiary of Chinese module manufacturer Longi, said on Tuesday that it has released a new line of alkaline electrolysers.
It said the standard ALK Hi1 electrolyser can achieve an energy content of 4.3 kWh per normal cubic meter (Nm3) with a full-load DC power source. It claimed that its ALK Hi1 Plus version can achieve an energy content of 4.1 kWh/Nm3, or even as low as 4.0 kWh/Nm3, at a current density of 2500 A/m2.
Li Can, a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that electrolysers now on the market can achieve an average energy content of 4.5-4.6 kWh/Nm3.
“If renewable energy can deliver power at around CNY0.2 ($0.042)/kWh, Longi’s electrolyser can produce hydrogen at CNY1 per cubic meter which is close to hydrogen from coal,” he said.
Longi Hydrogen said the new ALK Hi1 series can directly reduce 10% of DC electricity use in hydrogen generation, for a levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) reduction of between 1.8% to 2.2%.
“This compensates for between 10% to 25% of the initial investment,” the company said.
Longi Hydrogen said its ALK Hi1 line has been tested and certified by third-party authorities such as Det Norske Veritas and Dekra. Representatives from Wanhua Chemical and China National Energy (CHN Energy) participated in the new product release.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/17/how-safe-are-second-life-ev-batteries-as-home-energy-storage-devices/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,QUALITY,RESEARCH,UNITED KINGDOM,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 17, 2023",How safe are second-life EV batteries as home energy storage devices?,"From pv magazine Global
A UK government study has revealed opposing views on the safety of second-life EV batteries in home energy storage applications. Some stakeholders argue that an enabling framework is possible, while others contend that the safety of such devices “can never be guaranteed.”
The independent research report, “A Study on the Safety of Second-life Batteries in Battery Energy Storage Systems,” was commissioned by the UK Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) and was produced by academics at Newcastle University’s School of Engineering.
As part of the project, the researchers consulted around 40 organisations and companies, including global safety and certification organisation UL, major manufacturers such as Siemens and Varta, and automakers such as Nissan and Jaguar. While a number of these stakeholders use second-life LiBs, predominantly for industrial applications, “evidence suggests there is currently limited use in domestic systems,” according to the report.
However, extensive discussions have shown that a number of respondents believe that a safety framework can be put in place to allow the use of second-life LiBs in home battery storage applications, so long as the full history of the batteries in their first-life applications is known and/or they can be tested effectively.
A second, more radical view shared by some stakeholders is simply that the safety of such cells can never be guaranteed, “and hence that second-life LiBs should not be employed under any circumstances in such applications.”
In the concluding remarks, the report adds that consideration should also be given to whether stricter requirements are needed for home-built energy storage systems which use second-life batteries.
This is explained by the lack of knowledge around age-related failures and their effects. Namely, whereas the hazards associated with second-life LiBs are broadly the same, the probability of failure may be higher with the former due to the effects of aging and unknown stress, or abuse during an LiB’s first-life application.
Specifically, the capacity loss of LiBs is generally considered to be linear, with end of life typically around 75% to 80% state of health (SoH) and the final end-of-life stage around 50% to 60% SoH. However, at some point a severe and potentially dangerous deterioration can occur and lead to an increased ageing rate. The time at which this occurs, referred to as the “knee,” is difficult to predict. It can occur at a higher SoH than expected, thereby increasing the risk of thermal runaway, internal short circuits, and joule heating, according to the report.
The report goes on to state that there is currently no widely accepted testing methodology to assess the safety of second-life LiBs, leaving a major gap in international standards.
“It is currently both costly and labor intensive to test and triage end of life batteries due to a lack of standardisation among EV OEMs,” reads the report. “In addition, the falling cost of new LiBs means the economic incentive for reuse and repurposing may become less attractive.”
