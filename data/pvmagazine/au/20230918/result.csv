According to the government energy advisor, its analysis has revealed that price settings in the wholesale electricity market are not high enough to ensure enough generation and battery storage to keep the electricity system reliable as it moves off polluting and finite energy sources.
By July 1, 2027, the organisation advising the government on energy market regulations is proposing that the wholesale Market Price Cap should be raised from where it is now, at $16,600/MWh (USD 10,700), up to $22,800/MWh over the next four years. Over the same period, the Cumulative Price Threshold, which is designed to kick in to end a sustained seven-day period of extreme high prices, would be increased from the equivalent of 7.5 hours at the Market Price Cap to 8.5 hours at the Market Price Cap.
With increases over a shorter period, introduced later, the Administered Price Cap, which caps the price in the wholesale electricity market once the Cumulative Price Threshold has been reached, would be set at $600/MWh from 1 July 2025 onwards.
The Australian Energy Market Commission said in a statement that the proposed price settings would have no impact on wholesale electricity prices over 99% of the time “but should deliver additional capacity that will have substantial benefits in reducing the risk of outages and ensuring our electricity system remains reliable for households and businesses.”
“Importantly, this proposal is designed to have no bearing on electricity prices under typical market conditions. Rather, it enables price fluctuations to encourage new market entrants, thus fostering competition to the benefit of all consumers,” Chair Anna Collyer explained.
She also made assurances that in the event the proposal is accepted after the consultation period closing on 26 October 2023, “the Reliability Panel will continue to monitor, review and report on the safety, security and reliability of the electricity system to assess whether any further changes are needed to maintain a stable and reliable system for households and businesses into the future.”

In the first part of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of solar panels, which are quite resilient. In this part, we look at residential solar inverters in their various forms, how long they last, and how resilient they are.
Inverters, which convert the DC power produced by solar panels into usable AC power, come in a few different configurations.  The two main types of inverters in residential applications are string inverters and microinverters.
In some applications, string inverters are equipped with module-level power electronics (MLPE) called DC optimisers. Microinverters and DC optimisers are generally used for roofs with shading conditions or sub-optimal orientation (not south-facing).
In applications where the rooftop has a preferable azimuth (orientation to the sun) and little no shading issues, a string inverter can be a good solution.
String inverters generally come with simplified wiring and a centralised location for easier repairs by solar technicians. Typically they are less expensive, according to Solar Reviews. Inverters can typically cost 10% to 20% of a total solar panel installation, so choosing the right one is important.
While solar panels can last 25 to 30 years or more, inverters generally have a shorter life, due to more rapidly ageing components. A common source of failure in inverters is the electro-mechanical wear on the capacitor in the inverter. The electrolyte capacitors have a shorter lifetime and age faster than dry components, said Solar Harmonics.
EnergySage said that a typical centralised residential string inverter will last about 10 to 15 years, and thus will need to be replaced at some point during the panels’ life.
String inverters generally have standard warranties ranging from 5-10 years, many with the option to extend to 20 years. Some solar contracts include free maintenance and monitoring through the term of the contract, so it is wise to evaluate this when selecting inverters.
Microinverters have a longer life, EnergySage said they can often last 25 years, nearly as long as their panel counterparts. Roth Capital Partners said its industry contacts generally report microinverter failures at a substantially lower rate than string inverters, though the upfront cost is generally a bit higher in microinverters.
Microinverters typically have a 20 to 25-year standard warranty included. It should be noted that while microinverters have a long warranty, they are still a relatively new technology from the past ten years or so, and it remains to be seen if the equipment will fulfil its 20+ year promise.
The same goes for DC optimisers, which are typically paired with a centralised string inverter. These components are designed to last for 20 to 25 years and have a warranty to match that time period.

The USD 2 billion ($3.11b) ‘Project Coyote’ would need 1,000 MW of power from BC Hydro to create the green hydrogen by electrolysis, which would then be processed into green ammonia. The company has also begun the environmental approval process required by the provincial government.
The project has taken considerable planning with local and regional leaders. In the latter part of 2021, Fortescue signed Memoranda of Understandings (MoUs) with three Indigenous Nations in Canada, laying the ground for the conglomerate to plan green hydrogen projects across Canada. This included, among others, the Lheidli T’enneh First Nation in British Columbia, with whom the company has negotiated a benefit-sharing agreement.
Billionaire Andrew Forrest, who founded FFI and is currently executive chairman at parent company Fortescue Metals Group (FMG), travelled to Prince George to announce the project proposal. Forrest met with Lheidli T’enneh First Nation Chief Dolleen Logan during his visit.
“[Prince George has] got clean air. It’s got heaps of water. It’s got heaps of electricity. It’s got everything going for it, and so this first 1,000 MW facility sounds really big, but it’s a stepping stone to what could be built out here in this beautiful part of the world,” said Forrest, who spoke about the proposed facility during a presentation at the House of Ancestors on 13 September.
Earlier this year, the British Columbian government offered the city of Prince George funding over two years to support the city becoming a regional hub for hydrogen. The provincial government has identified Prince George as an ideal location given the industry’s foothold and promise in the region.
In 2022, Hydra Energy built what they claim is the world’s largest hydrogen refuelling station for heavy-duty trucks that have been converted to run on both hydrogen and diesel using Hydra’s conversion kits. The city has key infrastructure for distribution across the province. This includes its airport, highway intersection, and direct rail connections to the ports of Prince Rupert and Vancouver.
According to the local news outlet, Victoria News, Forrest has been vocal about exploring the potential of hydrogen production and export development in Canada and has been lobbying several other governments, including the US and UK governments, to set up renewable energy projects there. During the course of the hydrogen summit held in Newfoundland in 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also agreed to look into possible hydrogen exports from Canada to Germany, as well as agreements on battery materials for German production.
Fortescue is gaging similar projects in Canada, eyeing potential in Labrador, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Manitoba. Besides the MoU with Lheidli T’enneh First Nation in British Columbia, Fortescue has also made agreements with members of the Homeguard Cree First Nations in northern Manitoba and the Innu Nation in Newfoundland and Labrador.
Last year, Fortescue said it aims to be a global exporter of green hydrogen, with a goal to produce 15 million tonnes a year by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/18/tesla-makes-strategic-entry-into-the-australias-retail-market/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",TRISTAN RAYNER,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2023",Tesla makes strategic entry into the Australia’s retail market,"Electric vehicle juggernaut Tesla has officially registered with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) as a “Market Customer,” a major step towards becoming an energy retailer.
Distributed energy expert and consultant at enX in Australia, Jon Sibley, discovered the registration, following Tesla’s groundwork in Australia which included the launch of “Tesla Electric” last year, allowing Tesla Powerwall owners to buy and sell electricity automatically, mitigating peak prices. Tesla also operates a virtual power plant in South Australia.
Sibley notes the move indicates one of two options – including Tesla’s potential role as a Financially Responsible Market Participant (FRMP) with AEMO – possibly for its batteries and charging infrastructure – or Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) or Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) models:
One option is Tesla becoming the FRMP for its large-scale battery and public charging assets. Tesla would need to also register as a scheduled generator for large-scale battery purposes (noting IRP changes could change AEMO’s registration definitions).
Another more interesting option is Tesla becoming an electricity retailer to sell energy services directly to end customers, potentially with a EaaS/MaaS angle. Tesla Energy Ventures was the name used for retail registration in Texas. There is no information yet on a AER retailer authorisation or exemption process for Tesla.
Tesla’s entry into the Australian energy market would be both strategic and timely, given challenges related to energy security and the transition to renewable energy sources. Tesla has exacted a model in Texas which targets those who have a Tesla Powerwall at home, a Tesla EV, or both.
Whether Tesla assumes the role of an energy retailer or opts for a more specialised position as a Financially Responsible Market Participant, the prospects of Tesla Electric could reshape the local energy market and add new innovations to old ideas of the grid. Others may see a chance to join as well, especially those who have reached significant penetration in Australia with both retail and commercial batteries, a list that could include brands like Sungrow, Sonnen, BYD, and others.

The basic principle of all li-ion batteries is: li-ions on the run.
In a fully charged battery cell, billions of lithium (Li) atoms are trapped in the “anode” porous reservoir, typically a thin sheet of a particular material. The anode and the opposite side, the “cathode,” are conductively connected to the positive and negative terminals of the battery cell. Hundreds or thousands of cells are assembled into a battery system. In the anode, lithium atoms, or ions, are ready to travel to the opposite reservoir, the cathode.
This cumbersome parkour is triggered by externally connecting the anode and cathode to the rest of the asset, for example inverters, motors, and power sources. Once the circuit is closed, the ions queue to exit the anode for the cathode, each releasing an electron which travels a long tour, via the external circuit, to power the asset – the stream of electrons leaving batteries is the electric current. Each ion and electron will reunite on the other side until the battery is charged again.
Released ions force their way through an intermediate medium designed for swift transport while keeping anode and cathode separate – a distance of only micrometers – to avoid short circuiting, with catastrophic results. This intermediate material must be permeable, light, and thin, but insulating and robust, causing headaches for engineers and reducing battery capacity per volume and weight. Low-viscosity chemical liquids or polymers – the electrolyte – are submerged in a matrix, or “separator” in the current mainstream approach. Another option is solid-state li-ion batteries, with liquid electrolyte and separator replaced by a solid material, often exotic ceramics. The topic of solid-state batteries, however, is an article all on its own.
After passing through electrolyte and separator, lithium ions slow to avoid crowding upon entry to the cathode and, one-by-one, migrate slowly into their new host material, finding energetically advantageous positions in the cathode lattice. Think of passengers boarding an empty train: the first find numerous free seats and rapidly occupy them, making space for queueing followers. The more seats that are taken, however, the slower the boarding process becomes. Macroscopically speaking, battery charging is quick initially but the longer you charge, the slower it gets. In electric cars, the final 20% of charge can take as long as the initial 80%.
The whole process is somewhat more complex than boarding a train, however. It involves ion interaction with a multitude of different materials, at different speeds, temperatures, stress levels, and in different processes. Battery degradation issues hinge on factors such as the effect of temperature on electrolyte viscosity, and thus the process speed of this crucial voyage. Also, as the “best seats” are taken, step by step, the host materials slightly expand, adding mechanical expansion stress and potentially leading to internal cracks and fissures. It is obvious that the way of charging, discharging, and operating a battery will dramatically affect the magnitude and rate of degradation processes that lead to the well-known loss of capacity, and also to safety-critical side processes.
In terms of different battery chemistries and the abbreviations mentioned above, the anode reservoir is traditionally made of graphite, albeit with a myriad of secret additives, manufacturing, and processing variations. LTO batteries are an exception which will be considered shortly.
For cathodes, things become more complicated. Cathode materials made of varying amounts of nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), controversial cobalt (Co) – and sometimes also aluminium (Al) – plus other secret additives, are referred to as NMC or NCA (nickel-cobalt-aluminium) devices. Such cathodes typically have high energy density, meaning they can accommodate a high number of lithium ions per volume but have shorter lifetimes, lower safety margins, and a bigger price tag than rival chemistries as a result.
To satisfy the automotive industry’s hunger for energy density and range, engineers crank up the nickel content – the first NMC batteries had equal parts of the three components, were dubbed NMC 1-1-1, and offered decent energy density and robust safety characteristics. Nowadays, industry adds eight times more Ni than manganese and cobalt, for NMC 811 batteries. These offer much greater range but significantly shorter lifetime and safety characteristics. That’s right, average li-ion NMC lifetimes and safety are decreasing.
By contrast, the second dominant cathode type is lithium iron-phosphate, also known as LiFePO4 or lithium ferro-phosphate. These cathodes feature lower energy density than NMC devices but are more robust and – at least traditionally – more affordable. Increasingly popular, LFP-based batteries are almost entirely manufactured by Chinese producers. LFP systems are handicapped by the fact their voltage varies little over a wide range of battery state-of-charge levels. State of charge, or SOC, is the amount of charge, or energy, in a battery. Less flexible voltage makes balancing and control of systems, as well as determining SOC, difficult and renders LFP applications generally prone to unexpected operational problems and downtime, further aggravating their lower energy density.
As mentioned, there is an exotic battery variant which uses lithium-titanate (lithium titan oxide, or LTO) for the anode, rather than graphite, sometimes paired with an LFP cathode. These devices offer very low energy density (even lower than legacy nickel-metal hydride, NiMH, chemistry) and can cost 50% to 150% as much as NMC cells because they offer between 10 times and 30 times better safety and longevity performance than LFP and NMC systems.
These are broad brush strokes, however, and the terrific variety of li-ion chemistries available offers cell manufacturers the opportunity to push performance in one direction or another. While characteristics can vary as a result, though, a giant leap in energy density for li-ion, without negative effects on aspects such as lifetime, cannot realistically be expected in the near future.
