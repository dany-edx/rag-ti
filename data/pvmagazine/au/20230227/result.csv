Powercor Chief Executive Officer Tim Rourke said the $1.3 million (USD 870,000) battery energy storage system, charged by both network electricity and local rooftop solar generation, will help alleviate solar power export constraints and share renewable energy across the entire sub network, not just homes with rooftop solar.
“As more Victorians choose to electrify their homes, we expect batteries will become important assets on our network to help meet the demands of our customers at peak times,” he said. “Batteries also play a role in supporting growing communities and their solar connections, while minimising the cost of network upgrades.”
Powercor said Tarneit, along with neighbouring suburbs Hoppers Crossing and Truganina, has the highest penetration of rooftop solar in Victoria, with almost 14,000 households, or about 42% of all customers, having already installed solar on their roofs.
“In Tarneit and the surrounding suburbs, almost one in two homes has rooftop solar, making this an ideal location for our first neighbourhood battery,” Rourke said.
It’s expected the new battery will enable an additional 129,600 kWh of solar exports per annum in the area – enough for an additional 30 solar customers to export their excess energy back into the network.
The Tarneit neighbourhood battery, developed under Powercor’s Electric Avenue project, was funded in part by the state government which provided $800,000 as part of its $10.9 million Neighbourhood Battery Initiative.
Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said neighbourhood batteries are a vital step towards the state meeting its renewable energy storage targets of 2.6 GW by 2030 and 6.3 GW by 2035 – enough renewable energy to power about half of Victoria’s current homes at their peak energy use and reduce emissions by 75% to 80% by 2035.
“Neighbourhood batteries are helping Victorians be part of the renewable energy revolution by storing power from rooftop solar during the day and deploying in the evening,” she said.
The government launched the first inner-city neighbourhood battery in Australia in Fitzroy North in 2022, and D’Ambrosio said two more energy storage systems are on the way, including a 120 kW/390 kWh battery and off-street EV charge-point installed outside a community centre in Richmond, and a 150 kW/300 kWh system at Library at the Dock in the city centre.
The government is also investing a further $42 million to install 100 more neighbourhood batteries across Victoria, tripling the number of homes with access to renewable energy storage.

The Illawarra REZ, centred around the steel city of Wollongong south of Sydney, is the last of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
REZs are also being developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, New England and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of energy storage online by 2030, replacing the state’s ageing coal-fired power generators.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the declaration of the Illawarra REZ is part of the state government’s long-term plan to modernise the electricity grid with renewable energy and storage, helping to keep the system reliable.
Kean said the Illawarra is ideally positioned to host a REZ, thanks to its “existing energy, port and transport infrastructure, its highly skilled workforce and strong demand from existing industries to decarbonise.”
“The Illawarra has a proud history of manufacturing and the REZ will only build on this legacy, powering existing and emerging industries such as offshore wind, green hydrogen and green steel production,” he said.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), which has been tasked with implementing the government’s REZs, said the declaration is the first step in formalising the REZ under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020. It sets out the intended size, location and infrastructure that will make up the Illawarra REZ which runs down the coastline from Wollongong to Shellharbour and west to Dapto capturing existing infrastructure such as Port Kembla, Dapto Substation and the Tallawarra Power Station.

EnergyCo, which will be the infrastructure planner and will coordinate generation, firming, storage and transmission projects in all five of the NSW REZs, said the Illawarra REZ will deliver at least 1 GW of new network capacity.
“This will provide sufficient transfer capacity for existing and committed generation in southern NSW and the Illawarra to dispatch into the electricity grid,” it said, adding that “the capacity of the Illawarra REZ may increase over time with the growth of emerging industries such as offshore wind, green hydrogen and green steel manufacturing.”
The REZ has already attracted strong commercial interest with a recent call for expressions of interest receiving plans for 44 projects, including wind, solar, energy storage, pumped hydro and green hydrogen production totalling 17 GW of capacity.
EnergyCo said the proposals include five large-scale solar projects, 16 energy storage projects, including 11 batteries, and four pumped-hydro projects. Investors have also proposed eight offshore and two onshore wind energy projects, and three new “load projects” including green steel manufacturing.
“These projects have the potential to deliver thousands of jobs in the Illawarra as the region moves to a clean energy future,” Kean said, suggesting the projects will generate more than 8,300 jobs, “not including the huge employment potential of offshore wind.”
EnergyCo said it will now begin the next phase of development, including continuing to engage closely with the local community, industry, councils and other stakeholders.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/27/victoria-offers-cash-incentives-to-smooth-transmission-development/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 27, 2023",Victoria offers cash incentives to smooth transmission development,"As Victoria’s ageing coal-fired power stations retire and are replaced by renewables, the state government has announced it will pay landholders who host new transmission infrastructure $8,000 per kilometre per year for 25 years.
Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the payments, which will be in addition to any easement payments from network companies, acknowledge the critical role landholders who host transmission infrastructure will play in the state’s energy transition.
“These new payments acknowledge the hugely important role landholders play in hosting critical energy infrastructure – a key part of Victoria’s renewables revolution,” she said. “We want to get the process for planning and approving new infrastructure right, so we can make sure the renewables revolution is a shared, equitable legacy for all Victorians.”
D’Ambrosio said the first of the annual $8,000 payments will go to landholders who host transmission lines along the Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector West (VNI West) and Western Renewables Link transmission corridors.
The VNI West project will likely connect Ballarat in central Victoria with Kerang in the north and across to NSW, while the Western Renewables Link corridor will stretch from the Melbourne suburb of Sydenham to near Stawell in the state’s west.
The scheme will also apply to the Victoria-Tasmania Marinus Link project and transmission links connecting Victoria’s Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) and future offshore wind projects.
This scheme follows in the footsteps of the NSW government who announced in 2022 a payment plan of $200,000 per kilometre of new transmission infrastructure for landowners, paid out in annual instalments over 20 years.
The Victorian government’s payment scheme has been broadly welcomed by advocacy groups but Community Power Agency (CPA) said more needs to be done to address landowners’ concerns about devaluation of property, visual impacts, and compensation.
“It’s a step in the right direction in that the Victorian government is acknowledging that the community and the landholders really do have an important role to play in enabling this climate critical infrastructure,” said CPA Director Kim Mallee. “But it is essential that the community has a genuine seat at the table when we’re designing these kinds of policies and the way that we roll out infrastructure like transmission lines for the energy transition.”
Farmers for Climate Action, an organisation representing more than 7,500 farmers nationally, agreed that the scheme is “a step in the right direction.”
“If transmission uses a farmers’ land, farmers should be paid for it. It’s only fair,” Farmers for Climate Action Strategy Director Cam Klose said. “While we are still waiting to see more detail, it is definitely a step in the right direction and we hope will help ease community concerns over the build-out of transmission infrastructure.”
“We know we need transmission lines to connect renewable energy to consumers … farmers need to be respected and rewarded for transmission on their land and this policy recognises it.”

If approved, Spark says the Wattle Creek Energy Hub could generate up to 500 MW of electricity from solar and wind, providing enough clean energy to power about 170,000 households per year. The proposal also includes the installation of a large-scale battery energy storage system with a capacity of up to 500 MWh which could be dispatched on command to provide a range of network support services.
The project is to be built on the university’s 6,200-hectare Arthursleigh property, about 12 kilometres northeast of Marulan, approximately two hours’ drive southwest of Sydney.
Spark, which owns 49% stakes in electricity distribution networks in Victoria, South Australia, and 15% of NSW transmission company TransGrid, said the proposed site is strategically positioned to make use of an existing high voltage substation located adjacent to deliver clean, renewable energy from the energy hub to the university, local electricity users and the rest of NSW.
Spark Renewables Chief Executive Officer Anthony Marriner said the proposed project is in the early stages of planning with work to commence on preliminary studies and consultation in the coming weeks.

A key element of the proposed energy hub is a two-acre “test-bed facility,” which would enable the university to undertake research on new and emerging technologies, including further testing of battery systems developed by Gelion, a company spun out from the university in 2015.
University of Sydney Pro-Vice Chancellor Julie Cairney said the university and Spark have also agreed to an ongoing research agreement throughout the life of the energy hub, collaborating on initiatives related to clean energy in the fields of science, engineering, business and economics.
“This long-term partnership with Spark Renewables will support a research program and infrastructure for the translation of research into innovative renewable energy technologies,” she said.
Spark said the design of the project will also ensure that the university’s existing commercial research and teaching activities can continue on the Arthursleigh farm, with the wind turbines to occupy only a small proportion of the property and the solar farm designed to allow sheep to graze underneath the solar panels.

The Wattle Creek Energy Hub is part of a major push into the renewable generation and storage sector for Spark Infrastructure which was recently acquired by a consortium led by United States-based global investment company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP) in a deal valued at $5.2 billion (USD 3.7 billion).
Determined to capitalise on growth opportunities presented by the transition of Australia’s electricity market to renewable energy sources, Spark is targeting more than $1 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by 2025.
The company’s operational portfolio comprises the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm near Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW, while its development portfolio includes a number of wind, solar and storage projects in the National Electricity Market.
This includes the proposed 2.5 GW Dinawan Energy Hub, a hybrid wind, solar and battery storage energy project it is progressing in in southwest NSW.
The Riverina region is also the site for the company’s proposed 160 MW Mates Gully Solar Farm and 1 GW Mallee Wind Farm. Spark is also planning to develop the Yorke Peninsula Energy Hub (formerly known as the Ceres Wind Farm), an up to 850 MW hybrid wind, solar, and battery storage project proposed for South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula.

Origin will offer the SimbleSense platform, an integrated hardware and real-time software solution that enables businesses to track and analyse energy usage, to its commercial and industrial customers via its Origin Zero unit which provides services to help large business customers decarbonise their energy supply.
Simble said those customers will be able to use the platform to monitor their behind-the-meter energy usage at a device or circuit level. The company said customers will be able to access a breakdown of their energy consumption in real time, allowing them to identify trends and potential savings opportunities.
Simble said the platform will also assist companies in the measurement and verification of energy efficiency and carbon reduction projects.
Simble Chief Revenue Officer Fadi Geha said the deal with Origin is further validation of the company’s energy management technology and builds on the success of its sales channel strategy.
“This approach opens access to a substantial customer base, and we are confident that this strategic agreement will drive strong sales and engagement for both companies,” he said.
Geha said Simble, founded in 2009, has grown rapidly in the past 12 months, taking advantage of the global push for carbon management and reporting, particularly in the United Kingdom where the company said businesses are facing energy costs up to six times higher than they were a year ago.
Simble said it now has 600 customers across Australia and the UK including property group Mirvac, retail heavyweight Best&Less, UK grocery giant Tesco and Italian chocolate maker Ferrero.
The company also recently signed a contract with PEP and Brookfield-backed smart meter business Intellihub to deploy the SimbleSense platform across its network of more than a million meters in Australia and New Zealand.

Most energy storage devices use toxic and expensive transition metals as their electrode materials. Lithium-ion batteries are based on metals such as cobalt and nickel, which are known to cause skin irritation, allergies, and even cancer.
Worldwide Universities Network scientists have embarked on a research project to develop conductive electrode materials with very low amounts of toxic metals. They have synthesised polymeric porous materials based on abundant and environmentally friendly components as battery electrodes. They have also designed ionic-conductor functional materials as solid-state electrolytes for improved electrochemical performance.
Their key result was the development of a small-molecule organic electrode material hexaazatrianthranylene (HATA) embedded quinone (HATAQ). By introducing conjugated quinone moieties into the electron-deficient hexaazatriphenylene-derivative core, HATAQ with highly extended π-conjugation showed potential to yield extra-high capacity for metal-ion storage.
“Organic electrode materials possess many advantages, such as low cost and environmental friendliness,” said Professor Watchareeya Kaveevivitchai of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan. “They also contain a large number of redox active sites capable of undergoing a multi-electron-transfer process at a redox potential, which, if properly fine-tuned, can lead to a high energy density.”
Inspired by the excellent electrochemical performance of HATAQ in lithium-ion batteries, the researchers have investigated the compound as cathode in other rechargeable battery systems that are known as safer and cheaper such as sodium-, zinc-, and other multivalent-based systems.
Specifically, in rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries with 1 M ZnSO4 solution as electrolyte, the large number of redox active sites and extended conjugation allowed HATAQ to deliver ultra-high capacity of 492 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and excellent rate capability up to 20 A g−1 with 199 mAh g−1 reversible capacity corresponding to 99% retention after 1,000 cycles.
The researchers say that the performance from HATAQ is among the best ever reported for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. They discussed their findings in “Proton-enabled biomimetic stabilization of  small-molecule organic cathode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries” which was recently published in Journal of Materials Chemistry A.
