“Almost every Australian has felt the bite of power prices rising, and we’ve also seen more homeowners embrace batteries as these costs have surged,” Managing Director of Qcells Australia, Jin Han, said.
The company appears to be pinning its sales boost on the surging prices, though it’s worth noting the company has also managed to neatly coincide the launch of its third generation energy storage system with the crisis.
It’s Q.Home Core boasts longer warranties at 15 years and cheaper pricing than Australia’s sweetheart, the Tesla Powerwall – offering customers a battery and inverter system for around $12,000 versus Tesla’s $14,650 for the battery only.
The company’s Q.Home Core has also been added to the approved product list for Solar Victoria’s virtual power plant (VPP) pilot. 
While Victoria’s solar battery-rebate dropped from $3,500 to $2,950 in July, eligible households who join the VPP program can still access the full $4,174 rebate.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/23/2-8-gw-tiwi-island-green-hydrogen-project-granted-major-project-status/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NORTHERN TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 23, 2022",2.8 GW Tiwi Island green hydrogen proposal granted Major Project Status,"The Northern Territory government has deemed the Tiwi H2 project to have “substantial economic and social benefits,” awarding it Major Project Status, meaning the project will now benefit from the support of the Territory’s Major Projects Commissioner to guide the development through approvals and engagement with the federal government.
The project is owned by West Australian compressed hydrogen shipmaker cum renewables developer Provaris Energy, previously called Global Energy Ventures.
The company’s proposal involves developing massive green hydrogen production facility on the Tiwi Islands off the coast of the Northern Territory for export into the Asia-Pacific region.
Provaris is developing the green hydrogen production and export facilities on Melville Island, where the hydrogen will be manufactured through the electrolysis of purified sea water and powered by solar PV energy. The initial development will see about 500 MW solar of solar generation installed on the island but Provaris says it could be expanded to 2.8 GW as the renewable hydrogen market expands.
“The award of Major Project Status by our government is recognition to the substantial economic and social benefits expected to be delivered by the Tiwi H2 project and its potential strategic significance to the Northern Territory and Australia in developing a hydrogen production and export industry,” Northern Territory Chief Minister, Natasha Fyles, said.

The Tiwi H2 Project is targeting an annual green hydrogen production of 100,000 tonnes, which will be exported to the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China.
Green hydrogen produced at the facility will be compressed and loaded onto Provaris’ own fleet of hydrogen-powered and compressed hydrogen carrying ships.
Construction of the project is targeted to commence in 2024 with first hydrogen production expected in Q1 2027.

Since the initial funding call last year, the New Zealand-Germany Green Hydrogen research programme has selected three projects to each receive NZ$2 million (AU$1.8m) over three years, with the NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the German Ministry of Education and Research jointly investing.
One of the projects, which will see researchers from NZ’s universities of Canterbury, Auckland and Wellington work with Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials as well as the University of Bayreuth, is focused on developing a cost-effective and resource-savvy process for water electrolysis that uses nickel and manganese as catalyst materials.
“Currently the best electrolysers are about 75% efficient, but they cost a lot to build and use expensive noble metals [metallic elements known for their ability to control the rates of chemical reactions],” the collaborative’s project’s lead Professor Aaron Marshall, from the University of Canterbury, said.
“Anion exchange membrane electrolysers (AEM) use much cheaper and abundant materials, but their performance is currently very low. We aim to dramatically increase the efficiency of these low-cost electrolysers by developing more active catalysts.”
The German and New Zealand research partners want to develop catalysts which guarantee a rapid and reliable course of the oxygen evolution reaction during electrolysis.These catalysts will not contain rare precious metals such as iridium, but work with the more readily available nickel and manganese.
The other two projects include the development of an integrated energy system model for New Zealand that could provide sustainable transport, heating, and electricity. The project’s lead, Jannik Haas also from the University of Canterbury, says the project will provide scientific evidence to inform a comprehensive green hydrogen strategy for the country.
The final project will focus on developing safe, large scale, long term hydrogen storage using TiFe (Titanium iron) metal alloys. The project will be led by NZ’s University of Otago and Germany’s Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon.
It will see new synthetic methods developed to produce novel cubic-TiFe materials with good hydrogen uptake characteristics and cycling durability, the partners say.

After finding itself in the now highly undesirable position of being dependent on Russian gas, Germany has been making serious moves in the antipodeans regarding green hydrogen.
With a massive amount of industry and manufacturing in the country, green hydrogen appears a major focus for Europe’s largest economy.
In the last 12 months, Germany also launched its green hydrogen partnership with Australia, known as HyGATE. Australia and Germany have committed up to $50 million and €50 million, respectively, with the joint fund launching in March and seeking seeking applications from projects across the value chain of renewable hydrogen.
Also in March, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) signed a massive deal with E.ON, one of Europe’s largest energy network operators, which will see the Australian company deliver five million tonnes of green hydrogen to Germany, the Netherlands and other European cities by 2030. 
“For us, it’s a minimum $50 billion expenditure,” Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest said at press conference in Berlin at the time.
If all goes to plan, FFI is on a path to deliver approximately one third of the calorific energy intake Germany currently imports from Russia.

While working at IBM, Julian de Hoog, Peter Ilfrich and Maneesha Perera – cofounders of startup Solstice AI, saw industry were crying out for accurate numbers on particular area’s solar systems and, more importantly, their expected generation over any given day.
It is this need Solstice AI hopes to fill. “We’ve developed this AI [artificial intelligence] model where, with very high accuracy, you can go and find all the solar on the rooftops,” de Hoog says.
Image: Solstice AI
To be specific, the accuracy sits at over 97%, with the model able to differentiate between exporting solar systems and solar hot water systems. It also integrates whether the systems are north or east facing – revealing whether they will capture the morning or afternoon sun.
With that model already built and working, the team is now integrating it with real-time cloud movement from satellite images. Currently working with one hour forecasts, the model uses the information from these two datasets, along with some other minor metrics, to create a forecast of the output of all solar systems across a region, as well as individually.
“The reason we got involved in this is that I’m not aware of anyone doing both together,” de Hoog says.
The most promising use case for such forecasting will happen when distributed storage becomes more widely integrated, de Hoog says. “Then you can start to manage your scheduling of your energy storage in response to your forecasts.”

In other words, once more community and household batteries are installed on low voltage networks, many of the issues surrounding the unpredictability of rooftop solar fleets can actually be managed locally by integrating forecasts with energy management software and AI technologies, rather than needing to call to centralised generators.
“In a way, some of the solutions we’re building right now, we’re aware that it will take a year or two before they’re needed – but at that point we’re hoping they’ll be proven,” de Hoog says.
The company is currently looking at creating one hour forecasting, but de Hoog acknowledges it is probably more valuable to go up to three, six, and 24 hours so energy markets have more time to respond.
“We’re actually still working on answering that question [of forecasting timeframes] and figuring out what we should be targeting to add the most value and create the most useful solution,” de Hoog says.

“The reason we’re looking at this short term forecast is that it might be enough to prepare gas-fired peakers to respond to that, it would help to keep the market from going all over the place. But another part of it may be that we’re still developing the solar imagery forecasts and one hour ahead is pretty good but once you start getting to 24 hours ahead, forecasting the clouds becomes quite difficult,” de Hoog says.
Both de Hoog and his cofounders have previously worked on day ahead forecasting. Far from overjoyed with that meteorological data, the company is currently using data from stationary satellites which take images of their regions every 10 minutes.
While developing the technology, de Hoog says the team realised that just knowing where solar is can be quite valuable. For instance, that data can be used for electric vehicle uptake, since householders with solar are more likely to invest in an EV.
In terms of the forecast solution though, de Hoog says it is really for anyone exposed to wholesale prices, including generators, retailers with buying flexibility, and network operators. 

 
It could also be useful for companies involved in aggregating solar and storage fleets through virtual power plants (VPPs).
“If you can forecast [solar’s part] of the energy mix better, it helps you forecast price better, which helps you bid more strategically – which, I believe, helps everyone start bidding a bit more intelligently and forecasting total net demand more accurately and the whole thing becomes more stable.”
Currently, the company is looking at using a subscription based model for its products, though this is still to be finalised.
Australia leads the world in the rollout of rooftop solar, which means many of the issues already being encountered here – including problems around voltage control and two-way energy flows in local networks – are still some years away for the rest of the world.

“If we can solve these problems in Australia today, we’ll be ready for all these other markets when they start to have these issues,” de Hoog says.
The CEO recently relocated back to his home country, Canada, after living in Australia for many years. While his co-founders remain in Melbourne, the move, he says, helps open the startup up to its ultimate target markets in the US and North America – which have far greater populations.
“Solar is the fastest growing form of energy generation and anybody who looks at the projection of where solar is going, is going to realise there’s going to be so much of it and we’re going to have so many challenges to integrate it all and we need to address these now. And there are also real opportunities there from a business point of view.”
Solstice AI is currently working with a cohort of other companies on the ARENA-funded Project EDGE (Energy Demand and Generation Exchange). The project is developing a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Marketplace which operates assets like rooftop solar and batteries to provide both wholesale and local network services, using different metrics from a VPP.

Solstice AI is working on the forecasting side of the project, controlling fleets to respond to constraints of the local transformers and feeders.  
The company was also recently selected as one of ten startups in EnergyLab’s 2022 cohort for its Climate Solutions Accelerator program.

India’s installed base of “open-access” renewables capacity grew to 10 GW by the end of fiscal 2021-22, from around 300 MW in 2009. Two-thirds of the 10 GW capacity was commissioned within the last five years (fiscal 2018–22), with nearly 1.9 GW added in fiscal 2022 alone, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research and Analytics.
Open access is a mechanism under which consumers can buy electricity directly from power producers, rather than electricity distribution companies (discoms). The report states that the open-access renewables market has been expanding in almost all key renewables-rich states. And it will continue to overcome policy hurdles to grow organically in the coming years, according to the report.
“The growth of the open access market in India depends on policies and the regulatory environment at both the central and state level. Last year saw some positive developments in terms of regulations even as a few hurdles persist,” said the report’s co-author, Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at IEEFA. 
“The Green OA Policy, issued in June 2022, has the potential to completely reform the renewable energy OA market landscape,” Garg added, noting its timely and efficient implementation by states.
The report attributed the growth of the open-access market to rising awareness and growing demand from commercial & industrial (C&I) customers.
“Falling costs of clean power and the decarbonisation goals of C&I consumers have helped increase the uptake of renewable energy OA power,” said co-author Jyoti Gulia, the founder of JMK Research and Analytics. “Lately, several independent power producers (IPP) active in the utility-scale renewable energy market are vying to enter the [open-access] market. Key reasons for their emergence include maturity of [open-access] financing and slowing central- and state-level tender activity.”
The report shows that several regulatory challenges continue to impede the growth of renewable energy open access at the state level. 
“Hurdles such as delays in the approval process for group-captive projects are hampering the growth of the renewable energy [open-access] market. Other roadblocks include unfavourable electricity banking provisions and increased penalties for deviation in power schedule,” said co-author Prabhakar Sharma, a senior research associate at JMK Research. 
The report said states should not impose further restrictive measures on electricity banking until they achieve the central government’s renewable energy target. It also urges states to implement a multi-year tariff structure to provide better long-term clarity to developers and investors. 
Besides regulatory challenges, recent supply-side constraints pose significant headwinds for the renewable energy open-access market. For example, solar module prices have risen in the past 18 to 20 months due to supply chain constraints and increasing prices of raw materials such as polysilicon, thus affecting the project viability. 
“India-specific challenges, such as the imposition of basic customs duty of 40% on imported modules and paucity in domestic manufacturing capacity of high-wattage modules, are exacerbating an already worrying situation. An added risk is the forthcoming implementation of the approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) for [open-access] developers from October 2022,” said co-author Akhil Thayillam, a senior research associate at JMK Research. 
The report calls for the postponement of the ALMM implementation on open-access projects until the nation develops a significant domestic manufacturing base.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/23/pv-with-gravity-storage-redox-flow-batteries-in-buildings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 23, 2022","PV with gravity storage, redox flow batteries in buildings","From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Jadavpur University Salt Lake Campus in India have proposed a new way to combine gravity storage and redox flow batteries with PV generation in a multi-level buildings.
“Our hybrid system can be implemented in any kind of building but the energy content of the gravity storage system increases with the height of the building, which means high buildings offer the largest potential for its development,” researcher Mayurakshi Mondal told pv magazine.
The hybrid system consists of a conventional rooftop PV system, a solar tree, two gravity power modules for building (GPMBs), and a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), with the three storage systems being charged exclusively by the two solar installations. “The proposed system emphasises on supplying the essential load demand of a building through renewable energy as much as possible, especially focusing on the reduction of the demand from the grid at peak hours,” the scientists explained. “The system is also focused to flatten the load demand curve of the grid.”
They estimated the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of the redox flow battery at US$0.424/kWh and that of the GPM at US$0.148/kWh. Due to this difference, the battery is used only as a secondary storage system, the said. During the charging phase, the GPMBs work via a motor that drives a pump to push water from the top of a piston in a larger pipe into a smaller one. It then pushes it back to the larger pipe below the piston.
“This pushes the piston upward and the operation terminates when the piston reaches the topmost position of the larger pipe, thereby storing energy in the mechanical form,” the Indian group said, noting that both GPMBs should have a diameter of 1.5 meters each for the larger pipe.
In the discharging phase, the piston in the larger pipe comes down and pushes the water downward, into the smaller pipe. The water flows through the pump/turbine unit operating in the turbine mode and generates electricity with the electrical device operating in the generator mode, the academics said. “The discharging operation ends when the piston reaches the bottom-most point in the larger pipe.”
They considered a 110-meter building with 39 floors and a total floor area of 750 square meters. The two GPMBs have a storage capacity of 96.2 kWh each and the redox flow battery is able to store 300 kWh. The 75.4 kW PV system occupies a surface of 450 square meters, which corresponds to around 60% of the roof area, and five solar trees totalling 57.7 kW are installed in the exterior open-air space of the building.
“After meeting the residential load demand and charging both GPMBs, any extra generated energy is used to charge the VRFB. Thereafter, any remaining energy generated is sold to the grid,” they said.
In the proposed system configuration, two GPMBs only supply electricity within the peak hours 6 pm to 9 pm and 9 pm to 12 pm, in order to reduce the burden of peak hours over the grid.
“The proposed system is able to supply 47.77% of renewable energy to the building as a yearly average and is capable of injecting 48.89% renewable energy to the building along with grid,” the researchers said.
They described the hybrid system in “Solar PV driven hybrid gravity power module—Vanadium redox flow battery energy storage for an energy efficient multi-storied building,” which was recently published in the International Journal of Energy Research.
“Further studies on GPMB are required before practical implementation, like the effect of high starting current devices such as an air-conditioner, water pump and so on over its operation,” the scientists said. “The system also requires a cost optimisation analysis.”
