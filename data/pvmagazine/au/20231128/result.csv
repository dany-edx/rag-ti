Cue’s 259 kW of solar farm and 336 kWh battery is now operational following the successful completion of reliability testing, Horizon Power has said. Similar, though differently sized, systems are already in operations in Wiluna, Yalgoo and Sandstone.

The program is expected to reduce 2,100 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and save around $900,000 per annum.*
Norseman in the state’s Goldfield region and Meekatharra in the state’s midwest are expected to have similar systems installed in early 2024.
The Cue project was delivered in partnership with contractor Pacific Energy. Pacific have been working with the state’s other government-owned utility Western Power to roll out standalone power systems.

Both Western and Horizon Power have been working with standalone power systems (SPS) within the state’s islanded grids to decrease maintenance costs and increase rural power reliability. These systems primarily run on solar and batteries, and although they also still include backup diesel generators. However, the systems are sized to maximise renewables generation, with Western Power targeting 90% and Horizon Power 80% to 90%. The SPS are owned, monitored, and serviced by utility, which sells the electricity back to customers at their previous grid rate.
These standalone systems are mainly delivered to individual farms, but Horizon Power’s Midwest Solar Program, along with other microgrid projects, illustrate that the company is looking to scale similar concept systems up to encompass regional towns.
The state’s standalone power system rollout has, to date, been highly successful in terms of overall costs, decarbonisation, and customer satisfaction. 
It is hoped that the rollout will completely reconfigure the state’s unruly grid over the next decade. That is, instead of a vulnerable and hard to manage interconnected system, the state will move towards thousands of decentralised off-grid systems based on renewable generation and storage.

The deal was first proposed by Tony and Ash Martens, founders of Australian Training Works Group, an awarded First Nations business which has been working on Genex’s Kidston pumped hydro project in far north Queensland. Presumably because these two projects are founded on a pumped hydro cornerstone, Tony and Ash Martens approached Sunshine Hydro proposing to acquire an equity stake in the Djandori Gung-i Superhybrid project.

“The Sunshine Hydro Board embraced the initiative and First Nations Greentime Energy Group (FNGEG) was established to hold an option agreement for 20% shareholding of the project,” the company said in a LinkedIn article.
“While Indigenous ownership of renewable energy projects is commonplace in Canada, where typically 20% of the clean energy developments are owned by First Nations people, in Australia such arrangement is trailblazing,” it added.
The project, which is being developed by Sunshine Hydro and partner Energy Estate, was unveiled in 2022 and originally called Flavian. It was then renamed in Gurang language as Djandori Gung-i, meaning “Spirit in the Water.”

Located in central Queensland’s Miriam Vale, the project is seeking to create a pumped hydro project with upper and lower water storage governed by its automated AESOP, Advanced Energy storage Optimising Program, technology. The AESOP technology “automates the pumped hydro system, deciding when to pump the water to the high reservoir, release water to the lower reservoir and what mix of the energy produced is provided to the grid or used to produce other energy project, such as hydrogen,” the company says.
Interesting, Sunshine Hydro is pursuing green or e-methanol production, a more novel green hydrogen derivative than, for example, ammonia.

Sunshine Hydro is currently midway through its $500,000 crowdfunding exercise through platform Birchal.

The company is seeking to develop what it hopes will be “next generation green hydrogen technology.”
An alternative to making green hydrogen via electrolysis, photocatalytic water splitting instead relies directly on sunlight, water and a photocatalyst. Sparc Hydrogen is developing a photocatalytic reactor, patent pending, which seeks to efficiently take hydrogen from water molecules using concentrated solar.

Australian government science agency, the CSIRO, has been operating a concentrated solar thermal plant known as the CSIRO Energy Centre in Newcastle, where Sparc Hydrogen recently completed its initial testing. “The data and learnings from the repeated on-sun trials are invaluable and will improve reactor design as we continue to scale the technology towards a pilot plant,” Sparc Technologies Executive Chair, Stephen Hunt, said.
Alongside the prototype testing, the company announced it had been working with an unnamed external consultant to complete a pilot plant pre-FEED (Preliminary-Front End Engineering and Design) study. 
It said that study will completed before the year is out and is based on a site location “proximal to Adelaide.” It will incorporate a concept flowsheet design, equipment selection, costs, risks and opportunities for a pilot plant which will enable continuous on-sun testing of the technology, the company said, noting the plant’s commissioning would be the next stage in its technology’s readiness.

“The study will provide valuable information for grant applications and will form the basis for detailed design and engineering in 2024,” Sparc Hydrogen said, with its Annual General Meeting notice saying this was expected in the first half of the year.
Sparc Hydrogen believes photocatalytic water splitting can deliver cost and flexibility advantages over electrolysis because of its lowered infrastructure and electricity requirements. The company has been awarded almost $500,000 (USD 315,000) by the Australian government to support the development of its photocatalytic technology
Sparc Technologies, the majority stakeholder in Sparc Hydrogen, is developing two other product streams: sodium-ion battery technology, which it is pursuing in partnership with Queensland University of Technology (QUT); as well as a graphene based additive to fight corrosion on steel.
Earlier this year, Sparc and QUT said their multiple trials had produced anodes averaging about 45% higher reversible capacities compared to commercial hard carbon anode materials.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/28/with-china-pv-modules-reaching-record-low-prices-is-there-a-chance-for-local-pv-manufacturing-elsewhere/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 28, 2023","With China PV modules reaching record low prices, is there a chance for local PV manufacturing elsewhere?","From pv magazine Global
As China PV modules reach record-low prices, having dropped from USD 0.23/W in January 2023 to USD 0.13/W in November 2023, PV manufacturing efforts in Australia, Europe, India, North and South America seem to make little sense.
In the first half of 2023, despite strong shipments exceeding 252 GW, overall PV production capacity utilisation averaged 56%, with TOPCon and n-type PERC utilisation reaching 80% and 79%, respectively.
With nearly 80% of shipments coming directly from China, 18% from other Southeast Asian countries and less than 2% from the USA and Europe, it is clear that more of the cheap Chinese PV modules can flow to any market that does not impose barriers or taxes to Chinese/Asian PV modules.
This oligopoly raises concerns about the control or influence over the solar supply chain, as well as on the carbon footprint of such PV modules. Economies of scale, supply chain integration, relatively low energy costs and labor productivity make China the most competitive solar module manufacturer worldwide.
The European Parliament is slowly moving towards verifying whether the European financing framework is adequate to achieve European sovereignty of PV module production by 2030, taking into account the entire value chain of the PV industry, which is the only way to achieve the strategic objective of resilient European photovoltaic production.
Solar energy industry associations are present in most countries, with the mandate to represent diverse group interests such as installers, manufacturers and importers of PV modules, inverters, and batteries, as well as retailers, researchers, and lobbyists “who have requested a union of professionals with similar ideas so that all the various interests and concerns of the solar industry could be effectively reflected under one roof.”
In all countries, membership is mainly made up of installers, who are interested in obtaining the cheapest PV equipment possible, regardless of origin, as long as the prices are low, and the quality is acceptable. As the installation of PV systems employs around ten times more people than the entire PV module production value chain, and cheap PV modules are the main driver of the exponential growth in the adoption of PV in most markets, defending local production faces a conflict of interest on the part of these associations.
After a strong move to bring PV production to Europe, the US and India over the past two years, PV module prices in 2023 have made the solar production business in these countries uncompetitive. To reach net-zero emissions, the world will need more diverse supply chains to meet the growing demand for solar modules, and other countries where PV uptake is increasing rapidly, such as Australia and Brazil, have what it takes to be major suppliers.
More than 80% of current global solar PV manufacturing uses technology developed in Australian laboratories. Silicon PV is a very energy-intensive industry: Brazil is a large producer of metallurgical grade silicon, with one of the lowest carbon footprints in electricity production worldwide, which is important for the solar PV image and carbon footprint.
In July 2023, the Australian PV Institute released the study “Silicon to Solar (S2S) Study – Phase 1: Market Assessment Report,” assessing whether parts of, or the entire PV manufacturing value chain can be operational in Australia. The study makes a market assessment of the current PV supply chain and discusses options for increasing manufacturing in Australia. These options must be in line with three guiding principles:
A wide range of industry partners and collaborators has been engaged to ensure that the assessment is as relevant as possible and that the credible future state reflects the conditions under which a rational business would establish manufacturing in Australia.
With tens of thousands of companies employing more than 240 thousand installers and O&M service providers, Brazil has seen more than 1 GW/month of new PV systems coming into operation in 2023. As news about low-cost rooftop PV spread across the more than 80 million consumer units available in the country, and with still “only” around 2 million photovoltaic systems installed on rooftops, there is plenty of room to grow. These installers want the lowest possible prices for PV modules and are lobbying against any measures to protect the small local PV module manufacturing industry that might result in higher PV module prices.
China has gained ground in Brazil, mainly due to the exemption from import taxes, which adds up to a difference of between 30% and 35% in relation to the module manufactured nationally. Brazilian-made PV modules gain competitiveness only in terms of financing, carried out through low-interest credit from the National Bank for Economic and Social Development, but with Chinese modules at USD 0.13/W or less, even low-interest financing is not enough to make local PV module production competitive.
More creative solutions, which go beyond fees, taxes and subsidies, must be created if local PV module manufacturing is to take place in markets that install dozens of GW of PV per year. An example would be public bidding processes, in which governments would prioritise the national market at levels compatible with local production capacity, and the remainder could be acquired abroad.
From the International Solar Energy Society’s perspective, and the vision of a world with 100% renewable energy for everyone used wisely and efficiently, PV module production should not become an oligopoly and should not be concentrated in one corner of the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/28/new-research-claims-pv-outperforms-afforestation-in-combating-climate-change/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,ISRAEL,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"NOVEMBER 28, 2023",New research claims PV outperforms afforestation in combating climate change,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science have compared how ground-mounted PV and land afforestation may compete in fighting climate change and have found the former may have better chances.
For their simulations, the scientists created a new metric that they called “break-even time” (BET). It calculates the time the two technologies may need to have an effect on carbon emissions and offset the warming impacts caused by the darkening of land.
“PV electricity can significantly contribute to decrease anthropogenic carbon emissions. Forest restoration can play an important complementary role in climate change mitigation efforts by providing an immediate means for actively removing atmospheric carbon,” the researchers said, “However, both have a high land area demand, which may lead to competition for land in areas that can support forests.“
To check which land usage is more efficient, the scientists conducted an array of measurements in the south of Israel, which they said is highly representative of drylands. “Drylands represent a large proportion of the Earth’s land surface, of which nearly half is semiarid and has attracted attention for potential afforestation projects. However, they also can potentially host a significant proportion of utility-scale PV fields,” the group explained as its focus.
Findings
As for the PV effect on the surface temperature, the academics have conducted their research on a PV field in a hyperarid region in the Arava Valley in Israel, next to kibbutz Ketura. That field has an area of 75,600 m2 and an installed capacity of 4.9 MW. That was compared to background measurements from the same area.
According to their measurements, the sensible heat at the PV plant was 359 W m-2. In comparison, in the surrounding background, it was 199 W m-2. Albedo levels were 0.2 and 0.37, respectively. However, according to the calculations, the PV plant would suppress carbon emissions of 14.9 kg m2 per year.
As for the effect of the afforestation of heat levels, the scientist made their measurements at the Yatir forest, the northern edge of the Negev desert in Israel. It is located in a 2,800-ha afforestation of mainly Jerusalem pine trees. That data from there was then compared to data collected from the background desert.
In this case, the measurements showed that the sensible heat at the afforestation area was 522 W m2, while in the background, it was 225 W m2. Albedo levels in the afforestation area were 0.12 and in the desert 0.27. According to the calculations, carbon sequestration was at a rate of 0.15 kg m2 per year due to photosynthesis.
“Results show that in drylands, PV fields are over 50 times more efficient than afforestation,” the researchers said, adding that PV fields reach break-even after around 1.4-3.6 years in drylands, while afforestation takes 94–175 years to do so.
Temperate and tropical climates
Furthermore, using their method, researchers then looked to calculate the break-even time of PV and afforestation in other climates, namely temperate and tropical. Data for those were based on previous studies conducted in Germany and Panama, respectively. The results were shown in “Photovoltaic fields largely outperform afforestation efficiency in global climate change mitigation strategies,” published at PNAS Nexus.
“While the relative efficiency of afforestation compared with PV fields significantly increases in more mesic climates, PV field BET is still around 20 times faster than in afforestation,” they added, noting that, in both tropical and temperate climates, PV fields will take less than a year, while in the case of temperate afforestation, it will take 18.5 years, and in tropical afforestation it will take 15.4 years.
“PV electricity generation can prevent much higher carbon emissions than the amount that afforestation can sequester,” they concluded. “However, the active removal of past emitted carbon and the possible long-term storage as biomass and soil organic matter provides an important advantage for afforestation. Forests provide many other ecological benefits compared with this pure climatic perspective.”
