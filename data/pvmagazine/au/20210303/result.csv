Finn Peacock on the industry’s best and worst bits,"For SolarQuotes founder and industry veteran Finn Peacock, transparency is the key to ensuring Australia’s solar industry bucks its bodgy history. “I think it should all be out there,” Peacock tells pv magazine Australia.
While the move from the fringes to the mainstream has, to a large degree, smoothed out the industry’s rough edges, problematic pockets remain.
“Where ever there’s a huge amount of incentives, you start to attract the cowboys,” Peacock says.
The driving force behind the massive uptake of rooftop in this country, the scheme is how solar system owners claim government rebates. It’s success has seen Australia lead the world in rooftop solar penetration, boasting an average of one in five houses. In some states, the average skyrockets to one in two.
In short, the scheme has incentivised Australia’s renewable revolution at all levels, including at the large scale through Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs). The bad news?
“It’s going to attract the good guys, but also the bad guys who think of it like a get rich quick scheme,” Peacock says.
Last year, One Stop Warehouse Finance was found responsible for 49,400 fraudulent STC claims after it failed to pick up false declarations from third parties, including solar retailers and installers. One Stop went on to inadvertently but improperly create thousands of STCs based on the falsified information, leading to an extensive remediation agreement being signed between it and the Regulator.
To combat such events, the Clean Energy Regulator has introduced a number of new compliance measures and told pv magazine Australia it it is now using data analysis to flag potentially fraudulent claims proactively.
Warts and all, Peacock is an unapologetic cheerleader of the scheme. “It’s been a resounding success,” he says, adding that he thinks it’s one of the best schemes the government have ever brought in. “No scheme is going to have zero fraud.”
Peacock is decidedly less impressed with the Clean Energy Council’s Approved Solar Retailer scheme. Promising to showcase solar retailers which adhere to industry best practice, Peacock describes the program as being “full of rouges” in reality.
As SolarQuotes author Ronald Brakels notes, when the Victorian Solar Homes Scheme effectively made the CEC program mandatory, applications skyrocketed. So too did the approval rate. This dramatically decreased the quality of the list, dropping the bar far too low in Peacock’s eyes.
“Some of the people in there… oh my god,” he says. “It’s actually not a filter for avoiding the shonks [anymore].”
Peacock goes so far as to say that he thinks some companies use their listings as Approved Solar Retailers to hoodwink customers, employing the status as a sales tactic to convince customers to use them over companies with better records. “That’s not uncommon these days,” Peacock says.
“I think [the program] does more harm than good.”

Not always a sign of foul play, companies can be resurrected ethically. As Peacock notes, when a company goes broke, administrators are keen to flog all that remains – including company names and logos. An established solar brand may be an attractive asset for some buyers, whose new management can give the failed name a new lease on life. “It’s common,” Peacock says. “Solar companies go broke to and people buy their names and resurrect it.”
Where it really starts to get dodgy though, is when people linked to the original owners buy the company back. “Some people use it as a way to wipe off their debt,” Peacock says. They then promptly reopen with a fresh slate and the same bad practices. “It’s just wrong.”
The sales tactics used by some phoenix companies are the subject of criticism. These tactics can include rock-bottom pricing, and sometimes poor installation quality. Suspected phoenix companies are frequently criticised in quality-focused solar communities such as the Solar Cutters, or the somewhat notorious Crap Solar Facebook page.
While there are laws that prohibit phoenix activity, Peacock says they “don’t seem to be terribly well enforced, in my anecdotal experience.”
“It’s easy to get away with phoenixing – which isn’t just a solar industry issue,” he adds.
“I don’t ever hear about people getting done for phoenixing.”
The illegal, not to mention profoundly unethical, has plagued Australia’s solar industries, and Peacock believes a numbers of trade industries too. “I think it’s easier [to get away with] than it should be.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/03/wa-start-up-prepares-to-be-one-of-the-worlds-first-li-ion-battery-anode-producers-outside-china/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 3, 2021",WA start-up prepares to be one of the world’s first Li-ion battery anode producers outside China,"A town that lists one large letterbox and replica coal mine among its top attractions probably isn’t the setting that springs to mind when you think of the global race to produce a crucial component of the lithium-ion batteries. But Collie, a town with a population of 7000 in the south west of Western Australia, is precisely that.
Soon, Collie may well be home to one of the world’s first battery anode material producers outside of China. The key component of battery anode material, which has the joyous acronym BAM, is graphite. Often overlooked, the mineral is at the heart of the battery anode material which is ultimately responsible for holding and distributing charge in lithium-ion batteries.
Niche as it may sound, BAM is claiming its position in the energy sector’s limelight more by the day. “The opportunity is right now in terms of timing, in terms of demand for the product, and in terms of buyers of the product openly stating in the media and in person that they need to have more than one geographic source of supply,” International Graphite’s CEO Neil Rinaldi told pv magazine Australia.
Which is where his company, International Graphite, comes in. The WA start-up is one of just a handful of companies seeking to diversify BAM production away from Chinese shores in time for the seemingly imminent global battery boom.
Rinaldi admits when he heard the start-up had decided on inland Collie, his first reaction was “Really?! And then the penny dropped, and the penny dropping event was cheap power.”
“We need to be competitive on a world-wide basis and being potentially behind the [meter] in terms of energy supply contracts is an opportunity that presents itself in Collie for us to achieve. That brings our power costs down dramatically.”
In other words, the company sees low energy costs as balancing some of the advantage China has given its cheap labour.
Bloomberg
Currently, China controls 90% of the market for the purified product that goes into BAM, according to Rinaldi. Which is something that he says leaves many in the world of battery production a little uneasy. “It doesn’t take a genius to work out why,” he says. Between trade wars, political risk and the supply chain crisis illustrated at the beginning of the pandemic, Rinaldi says a lot of battery manufacturers are eager to diversify their BAM supply.
“We intend on being one of the first outside of China. We’re sort of in the first wave of producers but I think the industry is going to grow quite dramatically over the coming decades – but you’ve got to start somewhere, right?”
Which brings us back to our unexpected hub: Collie. Why is the power so cheap there? Well, the tiny coal-mining town is in the midst of a pivot, with various levels of government pushing to reposition the region as a clean energy centre, providing incentives, grants and, perhaps most importantly, sustained focus.
The town has even come to be associated with climate guru and respected economist Professor Ross Garnaut. A consortium linked to his company, Sunshot Energy, have invested in Renergi’s Collie-based project which converts landfill waste and other biomass to energy and biochar.
Rinaldi says he’s been in discussions with Garnaut about sourcing renewable energy in the region, and it seems both men have applications for grants for their Collie-based projects in the woodwork. “It’s very collaborative,” Rinaldi says of West Australian and Collie clean energy industry.

Far from just relying on grants, International Graphite in February closed its seed capital round.
Investors pledged $1.5 million, supplying 50% more than the company’s target. “The appetite was higher – we actually cut it off. We want to manage our capital structure to ensure we deliver as much value to existing and new shareholders without over diluting them.”
While the company has received support from new investors, Rinaldi says the capital raising round was primarily supported by people who are familiar with the business – the majority of which have come into the start-up’s orbit through its sister company, BatteryLimits.
Having been in the graphite space for more than a decade, BatteryLimits have conducted studies for many of major graphite companies with a particular focus on Australia and Africa, says Rinaldi.
“So from all of the experience they had in graphite, the opportunity became quite obvious for them to develop plans for a downstream graphite processing business. And here we are – International Graphite.”
Founded in 2018 by several of the same people behind BatteryLimits, International Graphite has spent the last three years on product research and development as well as studies. “It’s an industry that’s not the easiest to get into, it’s relatively opaque so it does take a period of time to get the knowledge base sorted and to understand exactly what you want to be and who you’re going to service as a customer.”
International Graphite
Graphite comes in two forms: synthetic and natural (which is mined). While there are rumblings of graphite mines soon be producing in Australia, Rinaldi says none have products available that fit the company’s needs as of yet. Which means, for now, International Graphite is sourcing their purified, natural graphite from abroad. (Rinaldi says the company is considering investing in a graphite mine to become a fully vertically integrated business, but that decision remains a way off.)
Graphite in hand, the company sets about making its battery anode material, which Rinaldi says is more akin to a technology product and a mineral stew. That is, there are a lot of moving parts. “It becomes quite a high value product.”
Having put in the hard yards figuring out precisely how to get the product to its high value stage, the company is ready to this year make the plunge from thinkers into doers.
“Our focus now is on producing [the battery anode material] and then manufacturing that to be a world-class green product,” Rinaldi says.
International Graphite are not the only company looking to become a BAM producer outside of China – though it’s hardly a flooded market. Off the top of his head, Rinaldi points to groups in Norway, Sweden, Germany expecting bring their products online soon. International Graphite also has a competitor closer to home: Renascor, which is based in South Australia.
“[Those companies are] competitors in a way but not in others,” Rinaldi says. “There’s room of us, there’s room for others. I think the industry only benefits from having more participants.
“The demand is so high that it’s going to drive more production, I think.”
With massive moves afoot in the auto industry, like Land Rover Jaguar’s February announcement that it plans to electrify Jaguar’s entire fleet by 2025, Rinaldi says the battery (and also BAM) buzz is really beginning to boil over.
“You’re starting to see action, you’re starting to see governments, you’re starting to see end-users, you’re starting to see manufacturers of battery products developing the technology and actually building the technology and selling the technology.”

The company expects to have samples of its product to provide to its network of potential buyers in Europe and North America by the end of the year. Far from the end of the road, this actually marks beginning of a validation process – which can sometimes take years.
“So we have a bit of a balancing act,” Rinaldi admits. Before the company orders the equipment necessary to start producing BAM in large quantities, its hoping to get the ball rolling on end-user agreements – minimising the time between massive outputs and when the revenue stream starts to trickle. “The sooner we can start that, the better. Which is why we’re starting it now.”
In the meantime, International Graphite plans to commence production of foils – another downstream graphite products, that are most notably used in mobile phones.
The start-up is also looking to lock in some partnerships over the coming months. “We’re hopeful to form an alliance and possibly a joint venture agreement with potential technology partners that have a foothold in Europe, that’s one thing that’s attractive to us and we’re talking to people about that now.”
Also on the cards is an ASX listing, which Rinaldi hopes will happen in the next four months. “I understand that traditional investors are looking for an investment that they can price on a daily basis via an ASX listing.
“It’s going to be quite an exciting time.”

IDTechEx published research showing that carbon capture and storage (CCS) faces a difficult few years, and with typically immaculate timing, the Hon Angus Taylor MP Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, announced a $50 million investment from the Morrison Government into CCS technology.
One thing is for sure, the Morrison Government has a gift for timing rivalled only by great reggae artists born in the European Middle Ages. IDTechEx’s report, titled “Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage 2021-2040” notes that the United Nations estimates CCS “could mitigate between 1.5 and 6.3 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalents per year by 2050.” In 2020, the global CCS capacity was 40 million tonnes. That’s quite a gap.
Moreover, though the Hon Angus Taylor and the Morrison Government seem to think CCS is a miracle cure rather than a literal sweeping under the rug. The 6.3 gigatonne annual estimate put forward by the UN is still a minuscule proportion of emissions. According to IdTechEx, in 2019 alone, global emissions reached 36 gigatonnes, “and global CO2 emissions are likely to continue growing over the next few years. For carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) to have meaningful impact on emissions in a timely manner, it would need to scale up hundreds of times compared with today’s levels.”
Nevertheless, the Hon Angus Taylor and the Morrison Government have put $50 million towards the Carbon Capture, Use and Storage Development Fund (the Fund). CCS was one of the five priority areas for investment under this government’s Technology Investment Roadmap.

— Angus Taylor MP (@AngusTaylorMP) March 1, 2021

At Newcastle University’s pilot site for Mineral Carbonisation International (MCI) on Monday, the Hon Angus Taylor said CCS technologies would be critical to achieving net zero emissions from power generation, natural gas and hydrogen production as well as process emissions from heavy industries like cement and fertiliser production.
“Australia has the potential to be a world leader in geosequestration. We have the right geology and storage basins,” Taylor said.“The Fund will provide targeted support to a wide array of CCUS opportunities, including carbon recycling, negative emissions/direct air capture, and carbon capture and storage.”
“The Morrison Government’s investment will reduce technical and commercial barriers to deploying these technologies and identifying potential project sites,” continued Taylor, who went on to note that trading partners including Singapore and South Korea were watching Australia’s “potential to permanently and safely store emissions underground”.
The Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said the Fund will help “ensure our premium quality coal will play an important role in Australia, and the world’s, energy needs for decades to come.”
Such words reflect harshly on the Morrison Government’s ambitions for CCS technology, the Fund is an investment in the protraction of a dying fossil fuel industry, not in emission reduction. After all, if the Morrison Government were really trying to curb emissions, it wouldn’t be investing so strongly in technologies that could only ever have minimal impact. In other words, the Morrison Government is delaying the inevitable, and as Shakespeare made clear in Henry IV, Part I: “…delays have dangerous ends.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/03/grid-connection-meeting-the-new-aemo-requirements-for-simulation-model/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 3, 2021",Grid Connection: Meeting the new AEMO requirements for simulation model,"On February 18 2020, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) published a new guidance document that imposes important new obligations for energy project developers in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
This AEMO document, applicable to all utility-scale generation, codifies the acceptance test requirements for simulation models in PSCAD software. Over the last five years, these ‘electromagnetic transient’ models in PSCAD have been increasingly relied upon for detailed studies of the technical performance of grid connection, creating a new compliance challenge and focus on risk for the industry.
Prior to 2016, a PSCAD study for a grid connection was a bespoke exercise, required in unusual circumstances where modelling in the more straightforward PSS/E software did not suffice. Fast forward two years, and by 2018 PSCAD simulation models became required from all project developers, which was cemented by the release of updated Power System Model Guidelines by AEMO in July 2018.
This was seen as a necessary step given instances of new connections where PSCAD modelling had revealed technical compliance issues that the simpler PSS/E models failed to detect.
The South Australia blackout of 2016, whilst it was not caused by any factor linked to the technical difference between PSCAD and PSS/E models, assuredly also played a role in the increased level of vigilance applied to the technical performance of grid connections.
While PSCAD models have been required for all projects since, the pre-qualification requirements on these models have been less explicit, limited to informal checks against the AEMO Guidelines and partial benchmarking against hardware tests or PSS/E model results.
Until recently, there was not a formal acceptance test specification similar to that which had existed for PSS/E models since 2013. On February 18 however, that gap was closed.
Image: Vysus Group
The new model
The new Dynamic Model Acceptance Test Guideline (DMAG) specifies that new test requirements are to be satisfied for pre-qualification of electrical plant models in PSCAD as well as PSS/E before connection studies are undertaken. This further extends the time and effort required at the due diligence and planning stage of all new projects.
The acceptance tests required by the DMAG will involve over 400 simulation cases in the PSCAD software for a single generator model. For BESS technologies, these tests must be repeated for charge and discharge scenarios. Where a project is a hybrid of multiple technologies, the full suite of tests will need to be performed for each model individually, and then again for the combined system. This will result in hundreds, if not thousands, of tests for a new connection. For example, a wind farm with battery storage requires over 2,000 PSCAD tests to be performed – a significant undertaking.
Furthermore, the requirement for PSCAD test results to be benchmarked against PSS/E results has been extended to include all balanced fault scenarios, and all changes in control system setpoints for voltage, reactive power, active power and frequency.
As project developers will appreciate, this number of PSCAD test scenarios will require substantial time and effort to complete and document.
Vysus Group has been anticipating these requirements and as a result has developed a fully automated PSCAD test suite, which is expected to be capable of handling all the tests within the DMAG as published.
Carrying out the required tests in a timely manner will demand speed and accuracy from the simulation tools, ideally automated to achieve 24-hour execution, and with automatic visual presentation of results that will nonetheless require an ongoing review by engineers to assure data quality.
Parallel processing within the PSCAD architecture can be optimised to cut back on simulation time. The required benchmarking of PSCAD results against equivalent results in the PSS/E software can also be fully automated.
Despite the abundance of expertise, technology and tools at our fingertips, the required testing effort under the DMAG will still greatly challenge industry participants who aim to bring new energy sources online in a timely manner. This is due to the extensive time and effort it will take to carry out the sheer number of PSCAD runs required.
The stringency of these new requirements brings into sharper focus the value industry can reap were bodies such as AEMO and the major transmission operators to make a stronger, more explicit technical case for the level of modelling detail now required. This would help set out in clearer fashion the actual purpose driving this technical effort.
Such technical cases are routinely produced when changes are made in most other elements of the NEM governing framework. A change to the market rules or to the technical standards for generators, for example, triggers a formal rule change process run by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC). This includes the consideration of public submissions, a two-stage drafting process, and a published determination that sets out the reasons for the rule as made.
It has been suggested that future changes to the due diligence requirements for simulation models also, could benefit from a process of this nature. This would mean when successfully run, it serves not to delay necessary changes, but to ensure that participants reach a degree of understanding (if not consensus) that changes that go forward are justified and draw on the broadest practicable range of expertise.
Looking ahead, we expect new requirements to arise in the challenging Australian electricity market and welcome the industry consultations that are now underpinning these developments. Understanding the undertaking of the new PSCAD model acceptance procedures is the first step for developers in achieving greater certainty for their projects when it comes to compliance.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/03/how-crowdfunding-can-accelerate-indonesias-renewable-energy-development/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,INDONESIA",,"MARCH 3, 2021",How crowdfunding can accelerate Indonesia’s renewable energy development,"From The Conversation Australia.
Indonesia’s increasing internet penetration is a boost for crowdfunding, which gathers small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture. It’s a powerful tool to gather funds quickly, cheaply and easily from the general public.
A study by Statista estimates the value of crowdfunding transactions in Indonesia will grow by 3.6% to US$7.5 million in 2025.
Given the huge opportunities crowdfunding presents, we argue that Indonesia could resort to this strategy to fund green projects and help overcome the country’s stalled development of renewable energy.
Crowdfunding renewable energy
Renewable energy means less fuel imports and less pollution from coal-powered power plants. More clean energy will come from renewable resources such as solar, wind and hydro.
Sadly, Indonesia is moving slowly towards its target of achieving 23% of its energy use from renewable sources by 2025. This is partly due to low investment in the sector.
The government’s limited budget has prevented the development of renewable energy in Indonesia, while private players are not interested in entering the sector in an unfavourable investment climate.
Crowdfunding can be used to finance all kinds of projects, including renewable energy.
A UNDP crowdfunding project back in 2016 managed to raise more than Rp 350 million (US$24,800) to build a solar-powered water pump in East Sumba.
Another example is a well-known social crowdfunding platform in Indonesia, kitabisa.com. It collected Rp 500 billion (US$35.4 million) in 2018.
Collaboration with a public figure such as a celebrity or influencer helps, as UNDP has done, using social media to spread information about the project to the public.
An early example was the Trillion Fund, the renewable energy crowdfunding platform backed by fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood. It hosted the UK’s first live crowdfunding experience for renewable energy in 2014.
Given the increasing number of retail or individual investors during the COVID-19 pandemic, the public is highly likely to be interested in investing in a green project if given the opportunity.
Support from the government
The Indonesian government should adopt three key strategies to accelerate renewable energy development through crowdfunding.
First, the Finance Ministry should provide fiscal or tax incentives for investors/donors in micro- and small-scale renewable energy projects financed by crowdfunding.
Second, the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry should help with advisory and technical assistance to renewable energy investors and developers. This support is particularly important for projects in remote areas.
Equally important is the need to set up an open and transparent budgeting system to track the collected funds. This means investors know where their funds go.
Lastly, communicating the progress of each renewable energy project is key. In the end, people who are interested need to know what happens as a result of their donation or investment.
Renewable energy projects and the government should collaborate with a well-known figure in social media who has a massive number of followers. They can spread the information about crowdfunding a project in a short time.
Eventually, this approach will increase the potential number of investors or donors for renewable energy projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/03/renewables-need-land-and-lots-of-it-that-poses-tricky-questions-for-regional-australia/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 3, 2021",Renewables need land – and lots of it. That poses tricky questions for regional Australia,"From The Conversation Australia.
Many renewable energy technologies need extensive land area. Wind turbines, for instance, cannot be located too close together, or they won’t work efficiently.
Some land will be in urban areas. But in the transition to 100% renewable energy, land in the regions will also be needed. This presents big challenges, and opportunities, for the farming sector.
Two important factors lie at the heart of a smooth transition. First, we must recognise that building renewable energy infrastructure in rural landscapes is a complex social undertaking. And second, we must plan to ensure renewables are built where they’ll perform best.
Bringing renewables to the regions
My research has examined how much land future energy generation will require, and the best way to locate a 100% renewable electricity sector in Australia.
A National Farmers Federation paper released last week called for a greater policy focus on renewable energy in regional Australia. It said so-called renewable energy zones should “be at the centre of any regionalisation agenda” and that this would give the technology a competitive advantage.
Hosting renewable energy infrastructure gives farmers a second income stream. This can diversify a farming business and help it withstand periods of financial pressure such as drought. An influx of new infrastructure also boosts regional economies.
But successfully integrating renewables into the agricultural landscape is not without challenges.
A wicked problem
Renewable energy enjoys widespread public support. However its development can lead to social conflicts. For example, opposition to wind wind farms, often concentrated at the local level, can be motivated by concerns about:
A proposed A$2 billion wind energy development on Tasmania’s King Island shows the difficulties involved in winning community support. The project was eventually scrapped in 2014, for economic reasons.
Research showed how despite the proponents TasWind using a “best practice” mode of community engagement, the proposal caused much social conflict. For example, the holding of a vote served to further polarise the community, and locals were concerned that the community consultation process was not impartial.
The local context was also significant: the recent closure of an abattoir, and associated job losses, had increased the community’s stress and sense of vulnerability. This led some to frame the new proposal as an attempt by a large corporation to capitalise on the island’s misfortune.
The King Island experience has all the hallmarks of a “wicked problem” – one that is highly complex and hard to resolve. Such problems are common in policy areas such as land-use planning and environmental protection.
Wicked problems typically involve competing perspectives and interests. Often, there is no single, correct solution that works for everyone. For example at King Island, the abattoir closure did not mean all locals considered the wind energy proposal to be the answer.
When seeking to address complex policy problems, such as building renewable energy in regional areas, the best approach involves:
Competition for land is intensifying around the world, especially as the population grows. High consumption levels in the West require ever-more land for resources such as food, and land degradation is rife.
To help alleviate this pressure, renewable energy developments may need to co-exist with other land uses, such as cattle grazing around wind turbines. And in many cases, renewable energy should not be built on the most productive cropping land.
Recipe for success
A successful energy transition will require strategic, long-term planning to determine where renewable generation is best located.
Our research indicates that while many places in Australia have renewable energy potential, some are far better than others. Wind energy is usually best located near the coast, solar farms in arid inland regions and rooftop solar power in densely-populated eastern Australia.
Traditionally, Australia’s electricity grid infrastructure, such as high-voltage transmission lines, has been located around coal-fired generators and large population centres. Locating renewables near this infrastructure might make it cheaper to connect to the grid. But those sites may not be particularly windy or sunny.
Australia’s electricity grid should be upgraded and expanded to ensure renewables generators are located where they can perform best. Such strategic planning is just what the National Farmers Federation is asking for. Improved connectivity will also help make electricity supplies more reliable, allowing electricity to be transferred between regions if needed.
Making renewables do-able
The economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy are well known. But without social acceptance by communities hosting the infrastructure, the clean energy transition will be slowed. There is more work to be done to ensure new renewables projects better respond to the needs of regional communities.
And to ensure Australia best fulfils its renewable energy potential, electricity grid technology must be upgraded and expanded. To date, such planning has not featured prominently enough in public conversation and government policy.
If Australia can overcome these two tricky problems, it will be well on the way to ensuring more reliable electricity, the best return on investment and a low-carbon energy sector.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/03/against-the-odds-south-australia-is-a-renewable-energy-powerhouse-how-on-earth-did-they-do-it/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 3, 2021","Against the odds, South Australia is a renewable energy powerhouse. How on Earth did they do it?","From The Conversation Australia. 
Our research set out to answer this question. We analysed policy documents and interviewed major actors in South Australia’s energy transition, to determine why it worked when so many others fail.
We found governments need enough political power to push through changes despite opposition from established fossil fuel interests. They must also watch the energy market closely to prevent and respond to major disruptions, such as a coal plant closing, and help displaced workers and their towns deal with the change.
South Australia shows how good public policy can enable dramatic emissions reduction, even in a privately owned electricity system. This provides important lessons for other governments in Australia and across the world.
Why is the energy transition so hard?
In decades past, fossil-fuel-dominated energy markets revolved around a few big, powerful players such as electricity generators and retailers. Overhauling such a system inevitably disrupts these incumbents and redistributes benefits, such as commercial returns, to newer entrants.
This can create powerful – and often vocal – losers, and lead to political problems for governments. The changes can also cause hardship for communities, which can be rallied to derail the transition.
The change is even harder in a privatised energy market, such as South Australia’s, where electricity generators and other players must stay profitable to survive. In the renewables shift, fossil fuel businesses can quickly become commercially unviable and close. This risks supply shortages, as well as price increases like those after Victoria’s Hazelwood coal plant closed in 2017.
The obstacles help explain why a wealthy nation such as Australia, with extremely high per capita emissions and cheap, plentiful renewable resources, has struggled to embrace its clean energy potential. Even frontrunners in environmental policy, such as Germany, have struggled to make the switch.
How South Australia did it
South Australia is a dry state – extremely vulnerable to climate change – with abundant wind and solar resources. These factors gave it the motivation and means to transition to renewables.
The South Australian Labor government, elected in 2002, adopted a target for 26% renewables generation by 2020. At the time, wind energy was already a competitive supplier of new generation capacity in Europe, creating an established wind farm industry looking to invest.
Some of South Australia’s best onshore wind potential was located near transmission lines running 300 kilometres from Port Augusta to Adelaide. This greatly reduced the cost of connecting new wind generators to the grid.
South Australia benefited greatly from the federal renewable energy target, established by the Howard government in 2001 and expanded under the Rudd government.
The scheme meant the South Australian government didn’t need to offer its own incentives to meet its renewables target – it just had to be more attractive to private investors than other states. This was a relatively easy task. Under the state Labor government, South Australia’s energy and environment policy was consistent and coordinated, in contrast to the weak and inconsistent policies federally, and in other states.
To attract renewable energy investors, the government made laws to help construct wind farms in rural zones away from towns and homes. New wind farms were regularly underwritten by state government supply contracts.
As the transition progressed, the state’s largest coal generator, at Port Augusta, was wound back and eventually closed. To help workers and the town adjust, the state government supported employment alternatives, including a A$6 million grant towards a solar-powered greenhouse employing 220 people.
The Labor government enjoyed a long incumbency, and the state was not heavily reliant on the export of fossil fuels. This helped give it the political leverage to push through change in the face of opposition from vested interests.
It’s not easy being green
South Australia’s transition was not without controversy. Between 2014 and 2018, the state’s consumer electricity prices rose sharply. While critics sought to blame the increasing renewables share, it was largely due to other factors. These include South Australia’s continued reliance on expensive gas-fired power and the closure of the Hazelwood coal-fired power station in neighbouring Victoria, which fed large amounts of power into South Australia.
And in late 2016, South Australia suffered a statewide blackout. Again, renewables were blamed, when the disaster was in fact due to storm damage and overly sensitive trip switches.
After a second, smaller blackout six months later, the then federal treasurer Scott Morrison brought a lump of coal into parliament and argued South Australia’s renewables transition was:
…switching off jobs, switching off lights and switching off air conditioners and forcing Australian families to boil in the dark as a result of their Dark Ages policies.
In 2018, Labor lost office to a Liberal party highly critical of the renewables transition in opposition. But by then, the transition was well advanced. In our view, specific legislation would have been required to halt it.
The state Liberal government has now firmly embraced the renewables transition, setting a target for 100% renewable electricity by 2030. By 2050, the government says, renewables could generate 500% of the state’s energy needs, with the surplus exported nationally and internationally.
Leading the world
The South Australia experience shows a successful renewables transition requires that governments:
It also highlights the importance of having transmission infrastructure near renewable resources before new generators are built.
As energy markets the world over grapple with making the clean energy transition, South Australia proves it can be done.

Oceanus Energía y Agua de Sudamerica SpA, a unit of US infrastructure developer Oceanus Power & Water, has signed a deal with French energy giant EDF to build the world’s first integrated pumped hydro reverse osmosis clean energy system (IPHROCES).
The project, which will be built at an unspecified location in Chile’s Andes region, will combine a pumped hydro storage station that uses saltwater with a desalination system to be powered by wind and solar. The system will pump seawater into a storage reservoir at an upper level using conventional reversible pump-turbines, based on power produced by on-site renewable energy facilities or grid electricity.
The water in the upper reservoir will be sent back to the shore, where the reverse osmosis system is located, and used to produce freshwater. The water that is not used for desalination purposes will be used to produce hydropower for between eight and 12 hours per day during peak demand periods, with fast response times.
“This hydraulic pressure eliminates the need for additional electricity to be provided to drive the desalination facility, greatly reducing both the capital expenditure and operational expenditure associated with standalone desalination facilities,” Oceanus said.
This process purportedly offers better brine management, as pumped storage outflows dilute desalination waste brine. The system also has a better energy footprint, as it reduces reverse osmosis energy consumption, Oceanus claimed.
“The result is a low salinity concentration mixture that is sent back to the ocean, minimising the impacts on marine life,” the company said.
In a report of the Chilean Ministry of Finance in 2018, Oceanus said that the energy consumption of the system would be the lowest in the market for reverse osmosis. The reverse osmosis process starts with around 400 pounds per square inch (PSI) of pressure, without the need for pumps.
The system will purportedly produce freshwater at a lower cost than other desalination projects that rely on reverse osmosis, due to lower operational costs, Oceanus said. It said that its pumped storage solution will generate power at peak times, with response times of less than five minutes, in order to ensure network stability.
“The integration of these technologies results in significant economic and environmental benefits that cannot be profitably achieved independently,” Oceanus said. “The IPHROCES concept is well suited to helping regions and countries proactively address some of the growing challenges posed by climate change, on a large scale and without the need for new, unproven, expensive technologies.”
Joan Leal, president of Oceanus Sudamerica, said that he has long wanted to deploy IPHROCES in Latin America to address water shortages.
“IPHROCES can significantly benefit the region by providing low-cost clean water and renewable energy, as well as helping to reactivate the local economy and create jobs,” he said.

Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers and Steag are planning to set up a 500 MW hydrogen electrolysis plant at Thyssenkrupp steel production site in Duisburg in western Germany.
The knowledge gained in Duisburg should enable climate-neutral steel production throughout Europe on an industrial scale in the medium and long term and thus keep it competitive over the long term, the two companies said.
They are currently seeking to have the HydrOxy Hub Walsum project recognised as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) and to secure the associated investment funding from federal and state funds. However, the realisation of the project does not depend exclusively on funding from the IPCEI framework.
According to the two companies, HydrOxy Hub Walsum is based on the proximity of the production and consumption of green hydrogen. This means the project does not depend on the construction of a hydrogen network and can be implemented quickly.
If an investment decision is made in spring 2023, the electrolyser will be connected to the grid as early as 2025 . According to the Steag homepage, securing the green electricity supply is an important part of the project. Steag will ensure that the energy used comes from renewable sources and procure the required amount of renewable electricity.
The two companies also explained that part of the electricity needed to power the electrolyser will be provided by rooftop PV systems located on the building where it will be located.
Thyssenkrupp announced in June plans to increase the annual production capacity of its electrolysers to 1 GW. Thyssenkrupp manufactures its electrolysers with De Nora, its strategic supplier and joint venture partner, in premade standard modules. One module is able to generate up to 4,000 cubic meters of hydrogen per hour.
