https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/09/grid-connection-is-key-culprit-as-investor-confidence-wanes/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 9, 2021",Grid connection is key culprit as investor confidence wanes,"A new report from the Clean Energy Council reveals that the grid connection process is the most significant challenge facing large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia, with substantial delays and changes in technical requirements impacting projects and investor confidence.
The Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) latest Clean Energy Outlook – Confidence Index also found that “unhelpful and unpredictable government intervention” has increased risk and undermined confidence for new investment in Australia’s renewable energy market.
“This is the time to be opening the doors to new investment in utility-scale clean energy projects, boosting jobs and regional development and ensuring that sufficient new generation is in place before old fossil-fuel generators retire or are priced out of the market,” CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said.
“Instead, we’ve seen governments backing two gas plants in New South Wales, the surprising decisions from the Federal Government not to support the Kaban Green Power Hub and then reject the world-leading Asian Renewable Energy Hub hydrogen project, on top of moves to change the funding remit of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.
“It’s a concerning series of events and not a particularly welcoming environment if you’re an investor in clean energy.”
The CEC report, based on the results of a survey of Australia’s renewable energy and energy storage industry’s leaders, found that investor confidence has continued to decline in the past 12 months, dropping from 7.3 out of 10 in July 2020 to 6.3 this year, its lowest level since December 2019.

“We have in the past invested in projects that on paper seemed like a safe bet only to be frustrated by red tape, policy indecision, regulatory changes and slow decision making. We are now highly sceptical,” one respondent was quoted as saying.
The decline in investor confidence is supported by figures released by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) which show no major large-scale renewable energy project reached financial close in the March quarter and there was a 76% reduction in the amount of renewable energy completing installation compared to the same quarter in 2020.
The regulator however indicated the pipeline of large-scale projects with a power purchase agreement, which is seen as a leading indicator, had reached a record 3.7 GW over Q1 2021, suggesting that investment in 2021 and beyond should remain strong.
The CER expects between 2 and 3 GW of large-scale renewables capacity to reach financial close in 2021, a similar level to 2020, but conceded the difficulty, time and costs in getting connection approvals may delay some projects.
The CER’s concession echoed the concerns of investors who said the challenges related to the grid connection process and technical requirements remain the greatest barriers to the rollout of renewable energy projects.
“Grid connection certainty is still the greatest dampener when it comes to investment confidence,” one industry figure wrote.
“We have capital ready to deploy and projects ready, but the grid remains the single biggest barrier to investment,” said another.

The nation’s ageing transmission infrastructure also remains a concern for investors who highlighted an under-investment in network capacity to address congestion and constraint issues.
Thornton said it is incumbent upon authorities to deliver on the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Integrated System Plan (ISP) which has identified the highest priority transmission projects with a clear business case to benefit electricity customers concerning the price, security and reliability of the energy system.
The ISP also recognised that new renewable energy projects, including wind and solar will not enter the energy mix as quickly as necessary without adequate investment in transmission infrastructure.
“These transmission projects are nation-building projects that will see us through into the next century,” Thornton said.
“Build the transmission infrastructure, and the renewable energy investors will come, benefitting the entire Australian economy, keeping the lights on, supporting low emissions technologies and delivering low-cost energy to consumers.
“Without transmission investment, congestion will increase, creating greater risks for generators and further stalling investment.”
The lack of a long-term integrated federal energy and climate policy was also an issue for investors while concerns and uncertainty around marginal loss factors (MLFs) also featured in their responses.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/09/state-government-opts-for-australian-made-modules-in-solar-solution/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MICROGRID,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 9, 2021",State government opts for Australian-made modules in solar solution,"Australia’s only solar PV module manufacturer, Tindo Solar supplied the panels for the Queensland government program which delivered a combined 200 kW of solar PV coupled with 2 MWh of battery energy storage at five remote national park facilities scattered around the state.
The standalone power systems (SPS) have already been installed at Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services (QPWS) ranger bases at Dundubara on K’gari (Fraser Island), Diamantina and Welford to the west, and Lakefield and New Laura in far north Queensland.
Another two of the solar+battery systems are scheduled to be installed before the end of the year with an 85 kW system to be commissioned at Boodjamulla National Park in far north Queensland and another at the Heathlands Resources Reserve near the tip of Cape York.
The SPS replace the existing diesel fuel generators, providing autonomous renewable power to QPWS rangers and their families, enabling critical services such as water purification, irrigation, plumbing and fire-fighting.
The systems, designed and installed by Brisbane-based Solar Hybrids, feature Tindo Solar’s Karra 380P modules along with Australian-made Selectronic inverters while lithium batteries were sourced from Spanish manufacturer Cegasa and German company Sonnenschein provided sealed lead-acid gel batteries.
Tindo Solar chief executive Shayne Jaenisch said the Queensland government’s decision to choose Australia-made solar modules was a shot in the arm for the local manufacturing industry, and an indication that Australian governments are ready to prioritise quality, reliability and safety in their energy transition rather than primarily focusing on cost.
“We congratulate the Queensland government for taking the lead on this issue,” he said.
“They have installed world’s-best power systems for their remote bases and specified durability, safety and reliable power output under harsh conditions, rather than demanding the cheapest.”

Jaenisch conceded Tindo Solar modules, which are made with imported cells, are not as cheap as some alternatives, but said they come with a 25-year warranty and produce performances that consistently top the independent solar panel rankings by Choice and Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre.
“The Queensland government needed a very tough solar panel that produces reliable power in a harsh climate, allowing remote systems to be weaned off diesel,” he said.
Jaenisch said the SPS systems include online performance monitoring and control portals, as well as sophisticated monitoring of fault redundancy, system reliability and longevity.
“They have a mix of AC and DC coupled solar, and fault alarms for the systems’ air conditioners and back-up diesel generators,” he said. “They’re globally best-of-breed and they’re powered by solar panels made here, in Australia.”
Tindo Solar, which last month secured $1 million in federal government funding which will help it transition to new M10 cell technology and boost production capacity with a new $6 million state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Adelaide nearing completion, is also supplying the modules for a 243 kW solar rooftop rollout at Dubbo in New South Wales.

The Dubbo Regional Council is mounting 614 solar PV modules on the rooftops of seven council properties in move it expects will save up to $70,000 a year in electricity bills.
The installation will also help council in achieving its Energy Strategy goal to obtain 50% of its predicted electricity consumption from renewables by 2025.
“This project is just one of the many ways in which Council is striving to reduce its emissions, while increasing the economic and environmental benefits to the community,” Dubbo Mayor Stephen Lawrence said in a statement.
“In 2020, council upgraded 88% of its street light network to LED technology, saving electricity and maintenance bills by more than $450,000 for that year alone.”
The latest rooftop installation will triple the amount of PV systems installed across the council’s properties, with other major installations including a 70 kW system at the Western Plains Cultural Centre, a 30 kW system at the Hawthorn St Depot, and a 12 kW system at Barden Park.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/09/evos-eyes-electric-fleet-vehicle-sector-after-seed-funding-success/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 9, 2021",EVOS eyes electric vehicle fleet sector after seed funding success,"Electric vehicle charging company EVOS will look to roll out its purpose-built home and fleet charger – capable of delivering up to 22 kW (AC) of capacity – and associated software platform after securing financial backing from Australian automotive industry veteran Autostrada and another, yet unnamed, investor.
EVOS chief executive Marcelo Salgado said the funding will enable the company to commercialise its chargers and energy management software platform in Australia and develop an export market, and expand its engineering department.
“We’re looking forward to using this investment to commercialise our products and deliver Australian businesses and the world an easy solution to their home and workplace charging needs,” he said.
Salgado, one of three former staffers from fellow Brisbane-based electric vehicle (EV) charging company Tritium behind EVOS, said the company will look to take advantage of Australia’s growing EV market with a special focus on fleet energy management.
The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal registrations of EVs surged in 2021, almost doubling to 23,000, the second consecutive year where the number of EVs has almost doubled.
That increase has been driven in part by a flurry of government commitments with the New South Wales government recently allocating $33 million to electrify its fleet, while the Victorian government has pledged to inject 400 EVs into its fleet by 2023. The South Australian and Tasmanian governments are aiming to have their fleets fully electric by 2030.
Salgado said while the purchase of new EVs is on the up, the true benefit will be realised when those fleet vehicles are sold off and a re-sale market emerges.
“Once we have a true re-sale market, we’ll see the cost of an EV go down significantly for the everyday family, and with that we’ll need more purpose-built home chargers for those families to take advantage of one of the key benefits of owning an EV: charging at home,” he said.
“Government fleets are also set to see benefits but to truly realise the potential of an EV fleet, they need visibility into what their vehicles are doing, how they’re running and their energy consumption.”

The EVOS Fleet Home 22 charger and the dual-charge equivalent, the EVOS Twin, have been designed to meet the requirements of both individuals and fleets and for easy installation. The range includes a 7.6 kW single phase charger and a 22 kW three phase option.
EVOS chief technology officer Chris Crossman said alternating current charging lets businesses and fleets utilise down time at night or during work hours to charge cars in the most economical way.
“It’s designed to be simple to install and uninstall,” Crossman said.
“It can withstand outdoor weather conditions, is IP65 rated and updates to the underlying software are delivered over the air (OTA) via Wi-Fi. But more than that, it’s safe and its reliable for homes and fleets alike.”
The chargers, which will be manufactured using 100% renewable energy in Brisbane by Autostrada’s manufacturing arm Circuit Solutions, align with EVOS’ Smart Start software platform, creating an ecosystem designed to identify and manage the best time, speed and rate at which to charge vehicles.
EVOS chief experience and innovation officer Seshan Weeratunga said Smart Start has been designed with fleets in mind and manages the charging of EVs without the need for the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, smartphone apps or fuel cards.
The platform allows EVOS and its customers to collect rich data from the driver, car, charger and grid, providing an overview of the energy used.
It can also automatically authenticate the vehicle, eliminating the need for third-party software, only allows authorised cars to utilise the asset, and allows roaming on EV charging networks.
“We’ve had significant experience in this space and one of the biggest challenges we saw for everyday drivers and fleets alike is not only a lack of charging infrastructure in Australia, but the fact that using chargers can be overly complex,” Weeratunga said.
“When a driver went to a charger, they might have to download a specific app simply to be invoiced. And from a fleet perspective the hassle and time it can take to manage multiple accounts for its fleet was a significant hindrance to EV rollouts.
“Our solution addresses those issues immediately. The additional benefit of our patent-pending Smart Start platform is that it can be used to manage the payments on other charging networks, it’s not tied solely to managing EVOS chargers.”

The 63 MWp solar project is located in the Luzon region of the Philippines and has been exporting power to the grid since April 25, 2021. MEM provided engineering, design, and construction services, alongside its Filipino partner, Sidcore Consulting.
“The Gigasol project is another step toward AC Energy’s goal of reaching 5,000 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2025,” said Anabele Natividad, Vice President of Development for AC Energy. “The project started just prior to the pandemic. While this added some complexity to the project, we had a great team; Modern Energy was instrumental to the success of this project in the design and construction phases to bring us into operations.”
Overall, AC Energy plans to install half of its 5 GW renewable energy capacity goal in the Philippines. The remaining capacity will be rolled out in other, unidentified, Southeast Asian countries. To date, the company says it has installed over 1.2 GW worth of projects in the Philippines.
Last August, the company announced it was working on two new solar plants in Central Luzon with a capacity of up to 150 MW, of which the GigaSol project was a part. In total, it says it has 330 MW of solar plants under construction in the country.
According to statistics released by the Department of Energy in December, the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.06 GW under the country’s renewable energy law at the end of June 2020. The government of the Philippines plans to install 15 GW of renewables capacity by 2030. Currently, the 200 MW Tarlac Solar Plant is the country’s largest PV facility.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/09/transforming-lives-through-solar-mini-grids/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS,MICROGRID,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 9, 2021",Transforming lives through solar mini-grids,"From pv magazine India
pv magazine: How big is the potential for solar mini-grids in India? Which load sizes and applications do these make more sense for? 
Jaideep Mukherjee: The mini-grid sector has played a critical role in providing access to reliable electricity in rural India. The reliability of electricity enhances not only productive use but also spurs micro-enterprise activities in villages. Despite universal electrification of villages and households, there is still a major gap between demand and supply characteristics. 
SPI has been working to improve healthcare infrastructure and create socio-economic opportunities for rural and micro-entrepreneurs. As of now, electricity from the 300+ renewable energy grids supported by us has reached 432 villages and has helped in transforming the lives of over 337,473 people.
The solution for electrifying most of rural India lies in mini-grids with 15-100 kilowatts of peak power, enabled by storage that can electrify 100-140 households, 50-60 shops, and a mix of productive users.
Is the awareness level enough to get consumers connected? How can adoption be improved? 
Before the pandemic, more than 800 million people worldwide used to lack access to electricity. The pandemic has pushed billions to the brink of losing their electricity access since they were unable to pay their bills. This toll fell disproportionately on the poor and most vulnerable. 
Communication is crucial for mini-grids to influence demand, overcome barriers, communicate benefits, and recruit clients. Structured communication can facilitate awareness and education about the benefits of mini-grid adoption.  
In recent years, effective communication has evolved from haphazard awareness-raising activities to systematic, evidence-based behaviour change communication strategies.
Energy service companies (ESCOs) must develop a communication plan for mini-grid initiatives that addresses individuals, homes, and the community independently in order to encourage behaviour changes.
SPI has been working to improve adoption through community action. We have worked with Women Self Help Groups, who have immense understanding of the villages they live in and the issues they face.
One of the ways women have played an integral role in providing reliable power is by performing billing and collection duties, as seen on the Model Distribution Zone (MDZ) Program in the Paradeep division of Odisha. In this program, ‘Bijuli Didi’s’ were recruited, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and also generating livelihoods. 
A total of 160 rural women were employed as bill connection associates with a potential monthly income of INR 8,000.
What are the other major barriers to mini-grid implementation? How big a problem is the availability of technical skills from implementation to operation? 
Though the mini-grid sector has been making huge strides in India, there remains uncertainty about policy regulations such as downstream infrastructural subsidies and clear financial frameworks for implementation.
Mini-grid developers face high costs as mini-grids are established in villages with low education levels and low operational efficiency of manpower.
Also, when the electricity demand is low, the plant is inefficiently used. The low demand also results in a higher tariff burden for consumers.
Due to ineffective feed-in tariffs and ambiguous terms of sale, the numerous actions available when the grid arrives, such as selling power to the grid or purchase by the DISCOM, may prove less efficient.
Furthermore, mini-grids in India still lack specially designed technological components. Inverters used in Indian mini-grids, for example, are not designed for this application. Furthermore, imported components, such as smart meters, are exorbitantly priced due to import fees and customs duties.
How can the cost be minimised for mini-grid implementation as these projects are relatively small in scale? 
Mini-grids—smaller off-grid electricity distribution networks—are being recognised as a cost-effective solution to bring power to rural communities that often lack access to a traditional power grid.
Solar mini-grids have a considerably lower initial investment than traditional electricity sources such as thermal or coal facilities. On the other hand, the latter benefits from enormous economies of scale and has a longer lifespan. As a result, the levelised cost of electricity (during their lifetime) is significantly lower than that of solar.
It’s critical to concentrate on technological advancements like improved batteries, energy-efficient products, and low-cost mini-grid components. These will lower the initial investment and speed up the adoption of mini-grids. 
Standardisation, metering, automated billing and collection, and inverter and charge control electronics helped improve mini-grid component integration.
Smart Power India has developed a set of services to support energy-based microenterprises like irrigation units, oil expellers, rice hullers, water treatment at the village level as part of the Micro Entrepreneurship Development (MED) program. With access to reliable power, these enterprises are likely to employ relatively expensive and sophisticated appliances for productive purposes, which, in turn, helps in increasing power demand.
The market has seen emergence of many off-grid solar players? What role do they have to play other than just providing solar solutions? 
In a country where 70% of the population lives in rural areas and has a 3.2-crore micro-entrepreneurs base, ensuring the sustainability of rural electricity supply down to the last mile remains a major challenge. More than half of the population lacking reliable energy access lives in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh.
Reliable energy access encourages micro-enterprises to opt for off-grid resources like micro or mini-grids. Some businesses meet their energy needs with fossil fuels such as diesel and kerosene. Such businesses willingly switch to cleaner electricity sources when subsidised fuel is no longer available to meet lighting needs or power high-wattage motor loads. 
Off-grid solar players have innovated business models to drive energy demand by handholding and enabling local enterprises to scale up. The business model encourages trust-building between enterprises and energy service companies by understanding their energy needs and offering reliable solutions for business growth. 
When local business owners achieve scale in their operations, it leads to increased energy demand and economic activity in the area. Mentoring from off-grid solar companies aids in the modernisation and expansion of operations by facilitating marketing connections and entrepreneurial skill training.
Many benefits accrue to businesses due to mentoring, including up to a 50% increase in productivity, business expansion, increased household income, and, even more importantly, livelihood opportunities for the local community. Then there are benefits to energy companies in terms of ensuring increased and stable demand for their power. 
How do mini-grids prove their relevance in a scenario where standalone solar systems (pay-as-you-go) become more accessible and feasible? Do you see mini-grid defection happening?
Typically, there are two types of solar power plants—off-grid and grid-connected.
An off-grid system, popularly known as a standalone solar electrical system, is the main energy source in areas where no source of electricity is available. The main advantage of this system is that it does not depend on the grid or any other source of electricity.
A storage battery system acts as an essential component in providing electricity at night. Popular examples of the standalone solar system are solar lanterns, solar home lighting systems, and solar water pumping systems.
In recent years, several energy service companies, especially in East Africa, have appeared on the market, combining pay-as-you-go concepts with the sale of photovoltaic systems or electricity produced by these devices. Usually, this results in one-time installation costs and weekly/monthly payments.
When properly planned, an off-grid home solar system is an excellent cost-saving feature that can pay back the initial investment through electricity bill savings within the first five years of operation. However, when designed with revenue generation in mind, a grid-connected home solar system can be both a cost-saving feature and a revenue-generating system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/09/right-sized-power-electronics-for-sub-5-mw-pv-projects/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 9, 2021",Right sized power electronics for sub-5 MW PV projects,"While in some ways, utility scale solar construction may seem straightforward, connecting to Australia’s notoriously “long and skinny” grid can be problematic. A project must pass Generator Performance Standard (GPS) analysis, as adjudged by the regulator – a hurdle which, once cleared, allows a utility scale PV project to commence full operation and generate the resulting revenues.
Delays in achieving GPS can result in significant losses for project developers and EPCs. Indeed, a number of market participants have encountered financial difficulties as their projects languished with power output well below nameplate, having not satisfied GPS static and dynamic analysis.
As a result of this challenge, projects with a capacity of less than 5 MW are proving popular in Australia in 2021. Projects below this size do not have to clear the GPS process and can be relatively quick and easy to construct and enter full operation.
“We are currently working with many developers with over 100 MW pipeline of sub-5 MW projects,” says Aaron Zadeh, the head of utility and e-mobility projects with Fimer Australia.
A project qualifies with the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) as a sub-5 MW PV if its power electronics must be physically capable of supplying no more than 5 MWp of power to the grid – not artificially held below 5 MW by software controls. This means the inverter itself must be less than 5 MW in size – with 4.95 MW representing the sweet spot.
String inverters, otherwise described as a decentralized inverter solution, can be sized deployed with relative ease at a size of 4.95 MW – due to their modular nature. However, due to lower capex and ease of installation, central inverters are still frequently the preferred power electronics solution of choice for many developers. The challenge then being is finding a central inverter with the right size.
Central inverters are frequently supplied with a capacity of 4.6 MW, 5 MW, 5.5 MW and 6 MW – all suboptimal for a 4.95 MW project.
To address this need, Fimer has introduced its 4.96 MW PVS980 Compact Skid inverter, transformer and switchgear product – a solution that is highly efficient, low cost and that can be supplied and deployed in a time effective manner.
Fimer has published a detailed white paper to highlight this burgeoning market sub-segment and the company’s central and string inverters, centralized and decentralized platforms, which are ideal for such projects.
The PVS980 complete skid is currently available in the Australian marketplace and is being produced in Fimer’s manufacturing facilities in Italy and India. It can be shipped in a standard 40ft container for ease of transportation and installation. And it has already gained considerable traction.
“Fimer’s PVS980 technology has been selected for multiple large-scale solar farms ranging from 50 MW to 350 MW and has completed the grid connection process for many sub-5MW sites spread across SA, VIC, NSW and QLD,” reports Zadeh.
The PVS980 skid comprises one 4950 kVA Fimer PV980-58 inverter, an optimized Medium Voltage (MV) oil-immersed transformer, MV switchgear and all auxiliary services. It can connect to any grid at 11kV and above.

The PVS980 platform allows project developers to deploy a 200% DC/AC ratio in a sub-5 MW project – which is a ratio that delivers handsomely for developers and project owners. A project with such a DC/AC ration can be coupled with a DC-battery to utilize clipped power during the peak hours of generation, delivering eletricity during times of peak demand maximizing both site performance and revenues.
“With a DC/AC ratio of 2, site developers can potentially recapture the excess DC power behind the inverter and store the energy into a suitably sized DC-coupled battery without increasing the total site capacity,“ says Zadeh. “While there is no standard recommendation for a DC/AC ratio, the general practice is to design the system with DC/AC ratio of around 125% to 140% which is also limited by the inverter capability. With Fimer’s PVS980-4.95 MVA system, this capability is now upgraded to 200%.”
The free white paper sets out such a project design and operation in more detail, along with a real world case study.
For commercial and industrial applications and for electricity retailers, sub-5 MW arrays appear to be an ideal solution. Some larger projects may also be divided into sub-5 MW parts, facilitating faster construction, grid connection and operation. The Fimer PVS980 platform now presents a right sized power electronics solution at precisely the right time.
