This logical definition is far from the benchmark applied in Australia though, where green power use is recognised with certificates which don’t impose limits on either their time of use nor location. 
Such a lax standard could become a big problem for Australia’s burgeoning hydrogen export industry. “If we don’t get the standard to align with European and US standards, then we’re at risk of creating a lot of hydrogen that is B-grade because it doesn’t qualify as a green product,” Grant McDowell, Enosi’s Head of Commercialisation and Strategy, tells pv magazine Australia.
With hydrogen standards still under development, there remains an opportunity to advance the benchmarks but, as Hoy notes, “the runway is getting shorter.” 
By 2017, Google was matching 100% of the electricity its operations consumed with renewable purchases, giving it RE100 status.
That all sounded great, until, as Steve Hoy puts, “their own engineers called bullshit.” 
In fact, Google (spurred by these defiant engineers) found it had used what it calls ‘carbon free energy’ just 66% of 2021 – meaning renewables actually powered its data centres two thirds of the time, while coal and other fossil generation was consumed for the difference.

Following on from this discovery, Google set itself a new target of reaching 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030 – a benchmark it feels needs to be attained to honestly and transparently meet its sustainability goals.
Google’s story is noteworthy because it illustrates the developing cognisance around time matching renewables and the limitations of standards lauded just a few years ago.
Google is not alone in its reexamination of what using 100% renewable electricity actually involves, with Enosi CEO Steve Hoy saying the American tech industry has jumpstarted a “powerful movement” reverberating globally.
In 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order committing the government to use “100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, at least half of which will be locally supplied clean energy to meet 24/7 demand.” More broadly, the US is targeting a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.
Meanwhile, by 2027 the European Union is proposing hydrogen projects must match the electricity they consume with renewable generation on an hourly basis. In the UK, that time window drops to 30 minutes– meaning to be certified as green, electrolyses really can only run when the dreaded wind is blowing and the sun is shining.
“If we’re going to export to those markets, we’re going to have to get on board,” Hoy says.
This idea of time matching renewable power 24/7 has barely cracked into the Australian conscience though. GreenPower, Australia’s government backed program enabling customers to ensure their electricity use is matched with power from verified renewable electricity sources, recently opened itself consultations following an independent review of the program. 
A bid to keep pace with the hurdling rate of change in the energy sector, the consultation paper’s first and only mention of 24/7 load matching is on the final page of the document. The fact it’s mentioned at all Hoy deems a “glimmer of hope.”
GreenPower – like the Renewable Energy Target and schemes in Australia – is based on Large-Scale Generation Certificates. These certificates function as a currency for buying and selling renewable energy and are overseen by the Clean Energy Regulator.
The issue with these certificates is they can be created in the middle of the day on January 1 and surrendered is against energy used on the 31st of December in the middle of the night.

As Hoy explains, by buying an LGC what you’ve actually done is spend money to claim you used renewable energy which was, in reality, consumed by whoever is plugged into the grid at the time of generation. 
“We’ve got this conflation of LGCs with renewable power,” the Enosi CEO says. LGCs, Hoy adds, have their place but need to be recognised for what they are – a way to subsidise renewable projects. “You’ve subsidised a wind farm, good on you – I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, but you haven’t bought renewable power.”
Moreover, LGCs incentivise solar and wind farms the same as, say, storage projects – even though ventures storing excess daytime power are far more necessary today for Australia to reach a 24/7 renewable grid.
This puts Australia in something of an “absurd situation,” as Hoy calls it, where electrolysers could run all night and claim to be green – even though the actual electricity used likely came from coal generators. 
The Australian government is currently in the process of developing its hydrogen Guarantee of Origin (GO) scheme. Under the previous coalition government, Hoy says the standard being looked at was very much cut and dry based on LGCs purchases.

“That’s not great, and that’s not actually green in my view and a lot of people’s views,” he says.“Don’t run the electrolyser all night and tell me the solar farm powered it. It’s rubbish.”
The tune, he says, has changed somewhat since the election though – another glimmer of hope. According to Hoy, questions are now being asked within these government agencies about certifying hydrogen project’s electricity time of use and location.
The Federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, the lead policy agency in the development of the hydrogen Guarantee of Origin scheme, told pv magazine Australia it will provide an “internationally-accepted scheme for low emissions products… based on an international methodology for calculating the emissions associated with hydrogen production.”
Exactly what that looks like is still up for debate and it is unclear which direction any “international methodology” will take.
Coming back to GreenPower, it told pv magazine Australia it “is open to trialling 24/7 firmed renewable energy products with interested retailers.” It noted “this type of product will become more important in the coming years” saying “Greenpower looks forward to hearing from stakeholders through the current consultation what role they expect real time 24/7 matching will play, and how it can work in practice in an Australian context.”
Tracing the origin of electricity is really an accounting game since certifying electrons is beyond our grasp.
To even start thinking about tracing, a key condition first needs to be met: the generation source and the user need to be in the same grid. This sounds logical but Australia has several separated grids, including the National Electricity Market (including NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania), the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) and North West Interconnected System (NWIS) in Western Australia, and the Northern Network grid in the NT. 

What happens in power tracing is like looking at a lake – essentially you measure the what comes in and what goes out at any moment. This time reference is crucial – but it is not something we’ve always been capable of measuring.
When Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme was brought in 20 odd years ago, smart meters were not standard – which Hoy says as led to some of the shortfalls in the LGC scheme today. 
“But now you can do it [time match], there’s a very good case that we should,” he says.
With today’s technology, it is entirely feasible to match generation and consumption within a grid at a fairly granular level. As this becomes more commonplace, Enosi’s Grant McDowell says he would like to see energy contracts linked to generation types. People could then opt for, say, a solar contract, where they should be able to get cheaper power through the grid because solar has by far the lowest cost of generation. 
This, McDowell says, would set off a positive feedback loop in which cheaper pricing would drive demand and load shifting – a behaviour change around when consumers use their energy. Getting cheaper power by opting for solar and wind, which is also a low cost generation form, could then help equalise the higher prices of energy from battery and other storage technologies. Such a set up could help renewable contracts balance out to be competitive and drive uptake.
“More importantly, in energy terms you’re [actually] at 100% renewable and what we call True Zero,” McDowell says.
In the meantime, Hoy thinks councils and companies which have attained RE100 status shouldn’t shy away from following in the footsteps of Google and reexamining their power usage. He believes 66% should be worn as a “badge of honour” because time matched renewable use is a difficult standard to attain – but it is a more honest form of assessment and helps build awareness that we’re not there yet. 
True zero, not net zero, needs to be the aim of the game if we’re going to turn our systems green.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/27/hornsdale-big-battery-begins-providing-inertia-grid-services-at-scale-in-world-first/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 27, 2022",Hornsdale big battery begins providing inertia grid services at scale in world first,"After two years of extensive trials, Neoen’s Hornsdale Power Reserve now has the capacity to provide an estimated 2,000 megawatt seconds (MWs) of equivalent inertia to South Australia’s grid through Tesla’s Virtual Machine Mode technology.
Known as virtual synchronous machines or grid forming inverters, this technology gives batteries the capacity to help stabilise the grid by providing inertia. Along with frequency control services, inertia is necessary for operating a stable grid and is especially important after major disturbances.
Until now, inertia services have only been provided by gas or coal fired generators and their rapid retirement is causing inertia shortfalls or grid instability – especially in regions like South Australia, where renewable penetration has reached 64% over the last 12 months.
The Hornsdale Power Reserve will now be capable of providing around 15% of the state’s predicted inertia shortfall – a globally significant milestone.
The use of the technology at Hornsdale has been approved by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which has been working closely with Neoen, Tesla and ElectraNet, South Australia’s network operator, to trial the Virtual Machine Mode at Hornsdale following its expansion in 2020.  
Together the cohort have now completed all the necessary studies, testing and analysis to deploy the technology at scale, with that capacity available from today.
“We are proving that our assets can replace fossil fuels not only in the production and storage of electricity, but also through providing all the essential services that a power system needs to function,” Neoen’s Chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said. “We are keen to build on this progress, continuing to innovate and to accelerate the transition to renewables in Australia and around the world.”
Grid-scale big batteries in Australia find themselves in a funny position today where the technology is capable of providing multiple grid services, including fast frequency response, frequency regulation and energy arbitrage, and now – with advanced inverters – inertia. The issue is there are no markets yet to reward this full value stack. 

This is slowing the rollout of the much needed services because their value isn’t reflected in solid revenue streams which would drive investment. Just yesterday though, the Commonwealth government-backed ARENA provided funds for Monash University to conduct a $1.18 million study into alternative market designs to better support energy storage technologies and drive clearer investment signals.
“Improving the economics of energy storage is going to be key in our transition to high shares of renewable electricity,” ARENA’s Miller added. Last year, AEMO published a white paper outlining the importance of grid forming inverters/virtual synchronous machines in realising its goal to be ready for instances of 100% renewables by 2025.
There are a number of other big batteries in planning or construction which will also deploy virtual synchronous capacities, including AGL’s 250 MW/250 MWh battery project on Torrens Island in South Australia.
In the lead up to the deployment, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) provided $8 million to trial the grid forming technology at Hornsdale, which sat alongside $15 million from the South Australian government’s Grid Scale Storage Fund.
ARENA’s CEO, Darren Miller, described Hornsdale as a “pioneering project” demonstrating “the full technical capabilities of what batteries can achieve with advanced inverter technology installed.”
Hornsdale is one of Australia’s largest lithium-ion batteries, second only to Neoen’s Victorian Big Battery which came online last year.  

Neoen is also developing several other big batteries in Australia, including the 100 MW Capital battery outside Canberra and a 300MW and 800MWh battery in Blyth, north of Adelaide.
In total, the company has 576 MW of storage capacity either in operation or under construction. Neoen has previously said it plans to have at least one large-scale battery operating in each of the five states participating in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM).
At the end of 2021, Neoen’s global pool of storage assets sat at over 700 MW, the vast majority of which are in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/27/five-things-to-consider-in-designing-and-commissioning-high-performance-solar-plus-storage-projects/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 27, 2022",Five things to consider in designing and commissioning high performance solar-plus-storage projects,"From pv magazine USA
When it comes to designing and building solar and energy storage projects, experience counts. Here are five things to consider when designing and commissioning a high performance solar- plus-battery storage system, plus a real-world case study from one such heavily loaded DC-coupled system.
To truly optimise battery storage system (BESS) designs in solar projects, the use cases for the PV and storage must be well understood and aligned with the project’s financial model. This requires a high level of optimisation and project specialisation held by only the most experienced storage partners. For example, the team should know that storage systems can be effectively oversized in year one, rather than augmented, to match the PV module degradation and exponentially diminishing clipped solar production.
The decision dynamics vary depending on architecture (AC versus DC coupling) and market applications. At a minimum, these hybrid systems enable projects to provide more value to the grid by distributing power during peak demand periods; at their best, they can improve solar performance, ride through turbulent grid conditions to keep the plant online, and enable value stacking across retail, wholesale, and merchant revenue targets.
Safety is priority number one for solar-plus-storage systems, and planning should start well before installation. Owners must factor in safety at the earliest stages of the project, including the development phase, and seek help from experts who can speak to product bankability, technical viability, hazard mitigation, and the many safety related aspects of their project. Before ever considering using a storage product, an extensive safety diligence process covering each component within the system should occur. This diligence ensures an asset will meet its expected life while also ensuring compliance with applicable codes and standards, and the local authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs).
A risk assessment methodology should focus on the causes and consequences of component- level failures and apply a unique risk tolerance to evaluate whether the safeguards yield a safe and acceptable result. The following is example of an assessment sequence used in a typical hazard analysis:
The product safety process should include, among others, the following critical steps:
Using products without thorough knowledge of them is fundamentally dangerous when it comes to designing energy storage systems. While there are many lithium-ion-based technologies on the market, incorporating a deliberate recommendation process leads to the system best suited for a given project. When the EPC has a strong knowledge base, they can push hard to handle the procurement and product diligence of the BESS.
It’s not uncommon to find solar industry professionals flummoxed by the long timelines required to properly commission energy storage systems. A frequent cause of this is the overwhelming amount of data required to control, monitor and warranty the systems appropriately. Much of this data is generated by one system, required by another to operate effectively, and stored in a third location, making data infrastructure and network planning of paramount importance. The earlier in project design and more comprehensive this planning happens, the more likely a system will run smoothly through commissioning.
For large commercial, community or utility-scale projects, there are numerous battery modules, battery racks, cabinets, meters, and power electronics at all levels. Each of these components connects to the energy management system (EMS) and the data acquisition system (DAS), and any physical or software issues can cause a system warning or fault — and each system fault can cause a stoppage. Troubleshooting the DAS can be a hindrance to performance testing, as the subsystems within the BESS are extremely codependent. Networking should be worked out during the design phase. Data infrastructure standardisation is tremendously beneficial, and redundancy will keep your system online.
Lastly, consider how data dependencies will impact each phase of system commissioning. For example, to complete solar capacity testing for a DC-coupled system, energy storage inverter data will likely need to be accessed and referenced. This means any network connections between the energy storage equipment and DAS should be completed prior to solar testing. The EPC and energy storage vendor teams must closely collaborate to ensure a smooth commissioning process that minimizes downtime and delays.
Batteries typically have temperature and humidity thresholds, which is why having operating climate management systems is essential not only during asset operations but also during the pre-energisation period between delivery and commissioning. On construction sites with no auxiliary power supply, batteries could sit in the sun all day with internal temperatures reaching 150°F. Excessive heat and humidity will degrade a battery’s state of health and can lead to premature failure and future hazards. During construction, it’s important to properly coordinate deliveries with temporary or permanent auxiliary power sources to maintain, control and monitor battery conditions.
Conditioning and preventative maintenance is not limited to batteries. Long storage times can lead to unsuspected damage on a power conversion system as well. Without proper operation and heating, humidity control, and preventative maintenance, severe damage can occur to power modules, fans, control boards, capacitors, and more which creates a safety hazard during commissioning and a large bill to rectify or replace the unit.
It may seem obvious, but field operators, project managers, commissioning engineers, and asset management professionals should proactively share lessons learned for optimal success. Learning from team members on different projects across portfolios is one of the best ways to circumvent potential problems. In other cases, shared experiences can apply on a regional level, across similar use cases, and in particular on a given product design and implementation.
For example, slight changes in a product from one generation to the next, such as a modification in conduit entry points, may not get updated in early-stage vendor drawings. By sharing this information ahead of later deliveries, the site supervisors at other projects can make field modifications and avoid delays. Other field learning includes rigging set up, pre-energisation and commissioning of the DAS and the use of pre-commissioning checklists.
Case Study: DC-coupled system ground fault detection
One of the unique challenges with deploying heavily loaded DC-coupled plants is designing appropriate and effective ground fault detection systems. In DC-coupled systems, the solar and energy storage systems aggregate on the inverter’s DC electrical bus. As a result of increasing the number of PV circuits (due to the high inverter loading ratio) and energy storage system circuits combined in parallel, the inherent insulation resistance of the power plant is lower, thereby making a single detection device more susceptible to tripping on changes in environmental conditions.
On a multisite solar-plus-storage project portfolio in the northeastern United States, this ground fault detection issue was addressed through extensive collaboration with partners and a thorough insulation monitor redesign. A new system was deployed that could handle the unique conditions presented on each site without compromising on safety or operational proficiency.
Early and persistent planning
An in-depth due diligence process creates value and risk mitigation for the customer and gives the system vendors confidence, making for more efficient system design, construction, commissioning, and operations. Early and persistent planning is critical to maximise the full scope of value engineering opportunities on solar plus energy storage projects.

Quebec-based startup Capsolar has developed a solar panel for vehicle-integrated applications.
“The CAPSolar’s SM–550 solar module is capable of maximising the capture of solar energy in a dynamic setting by reducing the impact of shading on its performance while being as robust and lightweight as possible when fitted on our structure which can fit any type of low-speed electric vehicle,” the company’s CEO, Samy Benhamza, told pv magazine.
The module has a size of 2,100 mm x 1,320 mm x 25 mm and weighs in at 30 kg. It has a power conversion efficiency of 21.3%, an open-circuit voltage of 108.0 V, a short-circuit current of 6.4 A, and a fill factor of 76%. It can be operated with a maximum temperature of 45 C while driving and 55 C when the vehicle is parked.
The panel relies on 24%-efficient solar cells provided by US manufacturer SunPower. It also features an IP67 enclosure and an MPPT buck controller. “The solar panel itself is fully flexible but when mounted on our structure, it conforms to the desired shape and becomes rigid. In its layout, strategically oriented solar cell series help in better managing different incidence angles and combined with multiple bypass diodes, we have an optimal shading management,” Benhamza said.
According to the manufacturer, the panel offers a 70% higher daily energy output at the same power rating as competitor products. The company tested the module in Montreal, Quebec, on a client’s vehicle and claims it achieved a 17% average range extension per day, with a peak of 26% on sunnier days.
“In collaboration with our European strategic partners in Belgium, we have developed a patent-pending, fully modular system that allows us to adapt our panels, just like LEGO, for each type of low-speed electric vehicle with no extra modification and custom work,” Benhamza explained.
Capsolar is currently collecting data to better determine the parameters that have the most impact on the performance of a vehicle–
integrated solar module. “We will then be able to feed this data to the charge controller we are designing and use artificial intelligence to optimize the operating parameters of the MPP–tracking algorithm,” Benhamza concluded.
