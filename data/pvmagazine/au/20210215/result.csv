Around 7,600 people, many of them older Australians, live on Ingenia properties in rented or owner-occupied premises; and since Covid-19 restrictions eased, the company has seen a boom in Australian holiday makers at its Ingenia Holidays properties, which offer rental cabins, and caravan and camping sites.
The CEFC said its investment “is designed to demonstrate how energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can reduce costs for residents and owners and encourage greater uptake across the industry”.
In addition to its short term emissions-reduction target, Ingenia has set a goal to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2035, an industry-leading commitment which the company CEO, Simon Owen tells pv magazine Australia has made its 900 employees “really proud”.
Last year saw Ingenia publish its first sustainability report in which it identified the potential to reduce energy consumption by investing $2.5 million in solar PV installations.
So far, it has invested $1.3 million across 27 properties, which it anticipates will save more than $300,000 per annum in electricity bills.
A further 1,191 kW of solar is being installed across 23 communities at a cost of $1.2 million which will yield further expected savings of $230,000 each year.
Ingenia’s solar rollout includes blanketing the rooftops of clubhouses, or community-centre hubs, in residential developments such as the over-50s resort-style Bethania community in South Brisbane; installing solar from the start in new builds such as Ingenia Latitude One in Port Stephens; and retrofitting many of its earlier developments.
Owen said that CEFC funding will likely enable solar installation on every new residence built by Ingenia; its 3,000-home pipeline of potential developments represents a significant opportunity for CO2 displacement. 
“Battery storage is also top of mind for us,” says Owen. “We’ve spent time and money internally looking at the feasibility of installing them, but the cost hasn’t quite worked out yet.”
Owen anticipates that 2021 will see the return on investment begin to add up, and that Ingenia will “start looking at installing batteries at a large scale”.
The most recent reckoning of electricity consumption by combined Ingenia properties was for FY 2020, and came in at a breathtaking, 17,746,104 kWh, but this no longer represents the total consumption of a portfolio that has continued to grow, with both new builds and property acquisitions over the past eight months. The total number of income-producing sites across Ingenia properties is now around 10,000.
Ian Learmonth, CEO of the CEFC, points out that buildings account for more than half of Australia’s national electricity use, and almost a quarter of emissions, hence, he says that, “The property sector represents a great opportunity to accelerate Australia’s pathway to a lower emissions economy.”
Among its ongoing emissions- and cost-reducing initiatives, Ingenia will pilot the Green Building Council of Australia’s yet to be finalised, new Green Star Homes standard on 30 new-build homes, starting at its Ingenia Plantations over-55s community in Woolgoolga, on the New South Wales mid-north coast.
The new standard assesses Australian homes against a number of criteria, including whether they’re net zero in energy use, fully electric, powered by renewables, water efficient and climate-change ready.
“Cleaner, greener homes produce fewer emissions, and they cost less to heat and cool,” said Learmonth, who added that the $75 million CEFC-provided debt facility “extends the economic benefits of clean energy technologies to residents of affordable housing through lower energy bills.”
Among Ingenia’s holiday makers, Owen has observed a movement to source energy from renewables: he says that around 50% of caravaners and campers now travel with solar arrays that power at least some of their activities.
“It’s definitely a growing trend, because a lot more holiday parks are starting to charge for power use,” he tells pv magazine.
Owen is also excited about a new Ingenia proposal that could see its holiday parks offer eco cabins, which would be solar-plus-battery powered and “effectively off the grid”.
“It’s an interesting market, and I think it would enable us to tap into a new cohort of guests,” he says. 
Energy efficiency measures being introduced across Ingenia’s Holidays portfolio include “smart” air-conditioning controllers which limit selection of temperatures to a certain range, and the replacement of low-efficiency lighting, hot water systems and air-conditioners with more efficient models.
“We are actively progressing ways to innovate and create Australia’s leading communities,” said Owen; “This finance will assist us to explore and implement additional programs aimed at reducing our carbon emissions and energy costs.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/15/bhp-nickel-refinery-hooks-up-with-the-largest-solar-farm-in-the-west/,"COVID-19,EV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"FEBRUARY 15, 2021",BHP nickel refinery hooks up with the largest solar farm in the West,"In one of the first renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) of 2021, BHP this month signed an agreement with Risen Energy for Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia to supply up to 50% of the electricity miner’s needs for its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
At 100 MWdc, Merredin Solar Farm is the largest to reach completion so far in Western Australia, and has been exporting at full capacity to the South West Interconnected System since August 2020.
Nickel West’s bundled PPA (which combines tradeable Large-scale Generation Certificates with purchase of power) commenced on February 1 and will displace around 364,000 tonnes of CO2 over the duration of the contract, which also has an option for extension beyond its scheduled 2031 end date.

Western Australia’s Minister for Mines and Petroleum, Energy, and Industrial Relations, Bill Johnston referred to the importance of nickel to renewable energy when he congratulated BHP on its initiative, saying, “BHP’s Kwinana nickel refinery is a key contributor to WA’s future battery industry, and is helping global efforts to decarbonise.”
“Nickel is a future-facing commodity and sustainable nickel production is essential to meet future demand,” said Eddy Haegel, Asset President at BHP Nickel West. 
Supporting this statement, BHP reports that it sells 75% of its nickel output to global battery manufacturers and it estimates that the cumulative demand for nickel in batteries over the coming 30 years will be some 250-350% higher than during the previous three decades due to worldwide efforts to decarbonise transport by switching to battery electric vehicles. 
On inking the Risen Energy deal, Haegel said, “This contract, the sulphide nature of our nickel deposits and our integrated value chain increases our position as one of the least carbon-intensive nickel miners in the world.”
BHP’s nickel sulphate plant at its Kwinana nickel refinery is expected to begin production this quarter according to BHP’s most recent annual report.
The Risen PPA will help BHP achieve a medium-term target of 30% reduction in its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, based on adjusted FY 2020 levels; and contribute to its long-term goal of achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2050.
The negotiated competitive pricing of the contract will also result in up to 20% reduction in the Kwinana refinery’s electricity bill.
Twenty-six renewable PPAs — under which a buyer agrees to purchase energy and/or LGCs at a fixed price from a solar or wind farm — were announced in 2020, according to the Business Renewables Centre Australia (BRC-A), which offers advice and support to businesses considering PPAs as part of their emissions-reduction strategies, often providing revenue certainty to investors in renewable projects under development.
Last year these PPAs included entities such as Coles supermarkets supporting development of the Western Downs Green Power Hub in Queensland; and the City of Adelaide, which entered into an agreement with electricity retailer FlowPower for supply of a solar-wind renewable blend.
In total, 2020 saw 1.3 GW of PPA-contracted renewable energy, which supported development of more than 4.5 GW of renewable generation at a time when merchant investment in renewables and investment by retailers contracted.
This weekend, Dr Chris Briggs, Technical Director at the BRC-A, wrote that Corporate PPAs have made up more than 40% of renewable-energy market offtake “in most recent quarters”, an “unexpected result” given the pandemic and resulting recession.
He said that ongoing growth in demand for PPAs, “is underpinned by buyers with sustainability targets or policy goals, and/or those that are taking a longer-term perspective on the value of the PPA as a hedge against volatile electricity prices”.
Briggs foresees state-sponsored Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) encouraging an ongoing pipeline of PPAs. He says that, “facilitating PPAs between local industry and solar and wind farms has been identified by governments as a priority to support economic development, benefit sharing within the REZs and the development of a social licence for the development occurring within regional areas”.
The Merredin Solar Farm PPA is BHP’s first with a renewable generator in Western Australia. It follows the miner’s signing in September last year of a 5-year semi-renewable energy PPA (combining output from solar, wind, hydro and gas) with the Queensland Government-owned CleanCo, to help offset some of the electricity used at its coal mines in that state.
Risen Energy, a Chinese PV module maker, acquired the then nascent Merredin Solar Farm in 2018, and progressed funding and engineering design, through to installing some 360,000 Risen Energy solar panels and operating the solar farm, as part of its goal “to deliver 2 GW of clean energy to Australia”, said John Zhong, local Vice General Manager of Risen Energy.
He added, “This agreement will bolster current and future Western Australian renewable projects. We look forward to welcoming many more clean energy partnerships to power manufacturing, minerals processing and other Western Australian industries.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/15/transgrid-secures-600-million-debt-facility-for-transmission-upgrades-supporting-rez-no-1/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",NATALIE FILATOFF,"FEBRUARY 15, 2021",TransGrid secures $600 million debt facility for transmission upgrades supporting REZ No. 1,"Plans for transmission to support development of the New South Wales Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone are progressing apace with TransGrid last week having secured a $600 million bank debt facility to finance planned grid augmentation, and community consultation on a proposed new transmission corridor commencing today in the town of Wellington.
TransGrid’s Executive Manager for Business Growth, Richard Lowe said of the debt facility that it will play “a significant role in securing a renewable future for Australia. It enables us to continue the delivery of services to our fast growing pipeline of long-term contracted load and renewable energy infrastructure.”
New high-voltage transmission lines have been proposed to run in a 180 kilometre long corridor, with a preliminary width of between 3 and 6 km, from the existing network near Merriwa, passing south of Dunedoo before continuing south-west and connecting at the existing network east of Wellington.
The final easements for the transmission will be only 60 or 80 metres wide, and their path will be informed by landowner and community feedback, said a TransGrid callout to participate published earlier this month.
Recognising the importance of Australia’s first coordinated REZ as envisaged in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO’s) Integrated System Plan (ISP), ARENA provided $5 million in funding to TransGrid in June last year, to enable a $16.2 million scoping study that will result in a business case of the Central-West Orana REZ.
“This study is expected to provide a pathway to achieve Australia’s first true Renewable Energy Zone,” said Darren Miller, CEO of ARENA in June, “and provide a blueprint for how others can be created in the future.”
In May 2020, at a time when grid connection for large-scale solar and wind projects had become increasingly harder to negotiate in the National Electricity Market (NEM), the NSW Government’s call for expressions of interest in participating in a 3 GW REZ that coordinated transmission with renewable generators and energy storage was rapidly oversubscribed by nine times — the government received 27 GW of proposals for solar, wind and battery projects.

The NSW Minister for Energy and Environment, Matt Kean, has been lauded, both for his leadership in getting the REZ ball rolling and for quadrupling — from $9 million to more than $40 million — the State Government’s commitment to enabling this pilot REZ.
Expected to be shovel ready at the end of 2022, with construction commencing in early 2023, transmission for the Central-West Orana REZ will be designed to help unlock up to $5.2 billion of private investment in the region by 2030, generating not only energy to replace the fossil-fuel power generation in NSW as coal-fired stations close over the coming decade, but also resulting in an estimated 3,900 peak construction jobs and 500 ongoing positions in the Central-West NSW region..
In December, the REZ project was declared Critical State Significant Infrastructure by the NSW Minister for Planning and Public Spaces, Rob Stokes. A great deal of investor confidence and public trust rests on how the project is conducted.
“The efficient development of the transmission network will provide system and economic benefits,” wrote Paul Italiano, CEO of TransGrid in the foreword to the provider’s NSW Transmission Annual Planning Report 2020.
On another occasion Italiano added, “Investment in the new infrastructure will enable renewable energy providers to connect to the grid and enable more affordable, reliable and clean energy for NSW customers.”
After today’s (8am and 5pm) and tomorrow’s (8am) community consultation sessions at Wellington Civic Centre, TransGrid will progress it’s program of information and consultation in Elong Elong, Dunedoo Leadville, Gulgong, Cassilis and Merriwa, according to a timetable published on the transmission network provider’s website.
