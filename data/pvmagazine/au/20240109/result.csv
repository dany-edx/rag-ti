The benefits of AZB chemistry are attributable to the energy-dense zinc metal anode and aqueous salt solution electrolytes. But their incompatibility, which results in chemical corrosion of the anode, effectively reduces the cycle life of the battery cell.
A team of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) School of Chemical Engineering say they have developed a solution that addresses the corrosion issue, improving the battery life span by five to 20 times, the equivalent of pushing the lifetime from a few months to more than three years.
Researchers Yuan Shang, Dr Priyank Kumar, and Dr Dipan Kundu said they spent three years working on the solution, which involved adding small concentrations of organic compounds to the battery electrolyte.
The researchers have now revealed that adding a 1% concentration of 1,2 butanediol to the electrolyte addresses the corrosion issue and effectively reduces the dendritic zinc deposits that otherwise short-circuit the battery cell.
The outcome of their work, published in the Advanced Materials journal, is a five to 20 times improvement in the battery cycle life under conditions suitable for beyond-lab-scale development.
The research team said the solution preserves the aqueous nature of the electrolyte, maintaining cost and safety benefits of AZB technology and the results are approaching that of competing lithium-ion batteries.

Kundu said AZB technology could provide “a cost-effective and reliable storage option for industries like mining, construction, and telecommunications.”
The UNSW has estimated that a fully developed technology would cost consumers around one-third to one-fourth the price of the present-day lithium-ion systems.
“The AZB technology can be implemented as energy storage systems at various scales, from small-scale residential/commercial and medium-scale community storage units to large-scale grid-level installations,” Kundu said.
The UNSW team said it is continuing to work on developing the technology with an eye on developing battery cell prototypes and is seeking funding to develop a spin-off focused on commercial development.

TE H2, a joint venture formed by French oil giant TotalEnergies after its takeover of Paris-headquartered renewables producer Total Eren, signed a memorandum of understanding with the NT government in 2022 to develop the Darwin H2 Hub.
To be built on a 4,000-hectare site within the planned Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct, the facility is to include more than 2 GW of solar generation capacity providing energy for a 1 GW electrolyser capable of producing more than 80,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum.
TE H2 Australia Managing Director Kam Ho said the latest announcement marks a significant milestone in the project’s development.
“The proposed Darwin H2 Hub is TE H2’s cornerstone project and aims to be the Northern Territory’s first solar-powered green hydrogen production and export project, delivering sustainable and cost-competitive power for domestic use and global export,” he said, adding that the facility will “contribute to the Northern Territory government’s vision of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and will enable other industries to move towards decarbonisation and sustainable industry.”
Ho said the company will now progress the design of the downstream facility, transmission infrastructure and upstream generation facility, with financial close to be considered by 2027.
NT Chief Minister Eva Lawler said the government’s decision to award the Darwin H2 Hub major project status recognises the project’s significance to contribute to economic growth, decarbonisation of industry, employment and renewable energy supply chains in the Territory.
Lawler said the facility will generate 800 jobs during the construction phase and 175 positions once operational. It will also assist both Australian and global companies to decarbonise through the use of green hydrogen, and to facilitate industries in a net zero economy.
“The TE H2 project is an example of how this government sources new clean energy projects that will significantly contribute to the Territory’s drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” she said.
Lawler also highlighted that the production of green hydrogen, in combination with the Territory’s strategic location in the Indo-Pacific, is “a key opportunity for the Territory to address the growing demand for this green energy globally.”

“This agreement couldn’t have come at a better time as we rapidly grow our pipeline of opportunities across the country,” ClearVue Global Chief Executive Officer Martin Deil said.
ClearVue has developed specialised glass technologies that preserve glass transparency while generating clean energy. The integrated glazing units (IGUs) feature PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and a coating on the rear external surface that allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and ultraviolet (UV) light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells.
The company said its solar window technology is suitable for use in a range of sectors, including the building and construction and agricultural industries.

Under the terms of the three-year agreement, which includes an option for two five-year renewals, MS Glass has secured exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights for ClearVue’s IGUs in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory.
In addition, ClearVue has granted MS Glass exclusive distribution rights in Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. MS Glass has also been awarded a non-exclusive licence to manufacture and supply the products to ClearVue in these regions and territories, as well as internationally.
Deil said the agreement formalises ClearVue’s existing relationship with MS Glass which has over the past 18 months shared its industry knowledge and provided access to its production facilities in Melbourne, alowing ClearVue to continue to develop its product.
“This helped us understand the nuances of IGU manufacture, enabling us to design a product that integrates seamlessly into existing production lines,” Deil said. “We look forward to reporting to the market as and when new Australian projects are signed through MS Glass both in the short term and over the years to come.”
MS Glass General Manager Tania White said the company has commenced marketing ClearVue’s IGUs and has already achieved “notable levels of interest.”
“Several customers are patiently awaiting product availability following improvement cycles and final testing,” she said.
“We will continue to build interest and a book of business as we prepare to launch the product for sale in the Australian market over the next six or so months. We expect substantial interest in the ClearVue product.”
The agreement builds on ClearVue’s growing list of global licensees including in the United States, Southeast Asia, Israel, and South Africa.

Tesla announced it has released an application programming interface (API) for its solar, Powerwall battery energy storage and electric vehicle (EV) chargers.
An API is a software intermediary that allows applications to communicate with each other. The new API will enable third parties to interact with software controlling the home energy components.
The EV and home solar provider released an API in October for electric vehicle fleet management. Now, its API supports coordination of distributed energy assets.
Tesla has increasingly been implementing software plans to coordinate distributed energy assets in programs like virtual power plants (VPP). In a VPP program, customers enroll their solar and storage assets in a program that taps their stored or produced electricity during times of peak demand. Customers are financially compensated for these electricity export events.
Developers can find the API here.
Powerwall 3
Tesla’s Powerwall will be a key component in VPP program implementation and fleet management. The company announced its third-generation Powerwall in September 2023.
The new battery has an energy capacity of 13.5 kW and offers continuous on-grid power of 11.5 kW. The system measures 110 cm x 61 cm x 19.3 cm and weighs 130 kg.
The battery includes an inverter featuring six solar inputs with maximum power point trackers (MPPTs). The device has reportedly a solar-to-grid efficiency of 97.5%. The new product comes with a 10-year product warranty.
“PW3 is optimised for ease of installation & high power, which means that a single Powerwall can serve as an uninterruptible power supply for most homes. This is a big deal for ensuring that the lights stay on and you can power all your devices in the event of a power outage,” said chief executive officer Elon Musk.
