https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/17/wa-utility-unveils-plans-for-800-mwh-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 17, 2023",WA utility unveils plans for 800 MWh big battery,"Western Australian (WA) government-owned energy generator and retailer Synergy plans to build a 200 MW/800 MWh battery energy storage system alongside a 100 MW/200 MWh big battery which is currently being constructed at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana power station south of Perth.
Synergy has submitted a development application to the Joint Development Assessment Panel for an estimated $450 million (USD 300 million) grid-scale battery to be built alongside the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana Big Battery which is expected to commence operations next month.
It was originally anticipated the battery would be operational by September 2022 but the project has been delayed due to issues associated with global supply chain issues.
Once completed, the Kwinana Big Battery will connect to the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), the state’s main grid, and will have the capacity to power the equivalent of 160,000 homes for two hours.
Synergy, which will operate and manage the battery energy storage system, said it is a major component of its future asset mix with WA’s state-owned coal power stations to be retired by 2030.
“Batteries are flexible, they provide grid stability and support the integration of more renewable energy into the network,” Synergy Chief Executive Officer David Fyfe said.
Fyfe said the Kwinana Big Battery and the proposed second energy storage systems are part of the utility’s commitment to deploy 1,100 MW of new large-scale storage by the end of the decade to ensure supply stability as the continued uptake of rooftop solar and renewables forces changes in the energy system.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston has also backed the introduction of large-scale energy storage to support the integration of more renewable energy into the grid, saying it will smooth fluctuations in demand and renewable energy supply and substantially contribute to grid security and stability.
“Increasing energy storage over the next decade will be crucial to addressing system security risks, such as high levels of rooftop solar generation, and ensuring reliable power supply to Western Australia’s main electricity grid,” he said.
Synergy said construction of the second big battery would begin as soon as possible after planning approval is received and the utility is already engaging potential suppliers and securing long lead items for the project.
The proposed Synergy big battery is one of a number of energy storage projects being pursued in WA.
The Australian arm of French renewable energy developer Neoen has filed planning documents to develop a 1 GW/4 GWh battery near the coal town of Collie in WA’s southwest and a 200 MW/400 MWh battery at Muchea northeast of Perth.
Victoria-based developer Sunshot Energy is also exploring large-scale energy storage, floating the potential for a 600-800 MWh battery to be built as part of a proposed green hydrogen industrial hub near Collie.

Established in 2017, PowerPlus specialises in supplying modular lithium ferro phosphate (LFP) battery storage solutions for on-grid and off-grid installations. The company operates out of facilities at Scoresby in Melbourne’s east, where it already employs more than 80 people.
PowerPlus founder and Chief Executive Officer Bradley Paton said the PPK transaction would help drive growth pathways for the company.
“We are excited by the opportunity for PowerPlus Energy to join the PPK Group of companies, which will help drive growth pathways in our business,” he said.
“This growth will also provide upside opportunities to our Australian suppliers, both to grow their businesses and innovate with us.”
PPK Chairman Robin Levison said the acquisition of PowerPlus complements the group’s business, commercial and operational strategies, and is synergistic with its other investments, including in Geelong-based battery manufacturer Li-S Energy which is developing a lightweight lithium-sulphur battery.
“PPK has been assessing a variety of opportunities in the energy market as we believe the world continues to shift towards renewable energy, and that energy storage will play a crucial role in ensuring a reliable and efficient energy system,” he said.
“We see the PowerPlus Energy acquisition as a key step in supporting this shift.”

Brisbane-based PPK will initially pay $1.8 million to acquire a 33% interest under a share purchase agreement, with a plan to increase its holding in PowerPlus to as high as 75% within two years for an additional $2.8 million. PPK will also get two seats on the PowerPlus board.
If the conditions of the acquisition are met, PPK will also repay an existing loan for $2.9 million owed by PowerPlus Energy to a continuing shareholder.
The group also plans to advance $1 million to PowerPlus to accelerate its manufacturing capability.
Paton said the association with PPK will deliver significant manufacturing, business growth and battery sector expertise, providing “an opportunity to enhance our knowledge across the battery ecosystem.”
“Especially with Li-S Energy being in such close geographical proximity at Waurn Ponds in Geelong,” he said.
PPK said the transactions are subject to customary conditions, including satisfaction of final due diligence by the board. It is currently anticipated that the first transaction will complete before the end of the financial year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/17/solmax-unveils-reflective-membrane-to-increase-power-yield-in-bifacial-pv-projects/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 17, 2023",Solmax unveils reflective membrane to increase power yield in bifacial PV projects,"Canadian company Solmax Geosynthetics, which supplies “geosynthetic drainage geocomposites” has developed a material that reportedly increases the albedo of the surface below a PV power plant by about 70%, allowing more light to reach the rear side of bifacial modules.
The material, made of polyethylene resins and coated with a thin white polyethylene layer that reflects ultraviolet (UV) rays, was initially designed for environmental protection by containing chemicals and hazardous waste.
“The increased albedo results in additional irradiance reaching the back of the module,” the company’s value engineer EMEA, Douglas Sutherland, told pv magazine. “The amount of irradiance will depend on the geometric characteristics of the plant.”
Called Geolux, the new product consists of a reflective geomembrane made of polyethylene resins and coated with a thin white polyethylene layer that reflects UV rays. According to Solmax, which already has an established presence in Australia, supplying geosynthetic products to mining, waste management, and civil engineering sectors, the material is inert and will not cause any chemical reaction with the ground.
“Geolux can improve the energy yield between 5 to 20% which means an equivalent levelized cost of energy (LCOE) reduction of around 2% to 5%,” Sutherland said.
“In the end, the main limiter for the extra energy benefit is the AC capacity. The question is now whether it is convenient or not to modify the AC capacity. This must be addressed by performing a trade-off between the extra energy generated and the costs associated with the AC capacity increase.”

According to Sutherland, developers could evaluate the impact of the new product at the early stages of project development using the albedo-app function in the PVradar software.
“Design parameters such as the AC capacity can be optimised to ensure that the PV plant owners get the most out of the albedo enhancement,” he said.
At least two people are needed to install the membrane and a sharp blade such as a knife is needed to cut it. Gripple pins are used to ensure the material is held firmly in place.
In terms of total project costs, the new product would mean USD 0.024 per W of additional capital expediture.
“Using our experience on a 500 MW project in the Middle East, accounting for recent inflation, it would cost approximately USD 12 million ($18 million) for the entire project,” Sutherland said. “It was USD 8 million ($12 million) two years ago and hopefully prices will drop again in the future.”
Sutherland said the material, which has a lifespan of at least 30 years, also prevents weed growth beneath the modules, offering significant O&M savings.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/17/australian-manufacturer-targets-worlds-best-battery-follow-ip-portfolio-purchase/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 17, 2023",Australian manufacturer targets ‘world’s best battery’ follow IP portfolio purchase,"Gelion Technologies has stumped up almost $7.75 million (GBP 4.25 million) to purchase an intellectual property (IP) portfolio from British technologies company Johnson Matthey, with the Sydney-based company saying the transaction places it firmly at the forefront of the global battery industry.
The lithium sulfur and silicon anode (LiSiS) patents, spanning 82 patent families, include solid and liquid electrolytes, disordered rock salt, electrode formulation, and battery materials recycling. The acquisition also includes technology transfer packages, cell designs and manufacturing protocols for Li-S cells, market and portfolio analysis, and manufacturing design and cost models.
Gelion Chief Executive Officer John Wood said the new IP portfolio, in combination with the company’s existing IP, could hold the key to developing and manufacturing the world’s most advanced battery technology here in Australia.
“This positions Australian research and development at the front edge of the global battery wave. We now own the technology to become a renewable energy superpower,” he said.
“The importance of this acquisition cannot be understated, not just to Gelion but also to Australian research and manufacturing as a whole.”
“Lithium sulfur is widely tipped as the next big stage of the lithium energy storage industry, and with this IP portfolio, Gelion intends to build the world’s best battery.”
Gelion, which late last year launched a zinc-bromide battery manufacturing facility in western Sydney, has backed lithium sulfur as the next dominant battery technology, saying it already offers higher energy densities and lower costs than the lithium-ion alternatives.

Gelion said it has “for some time” been developing LiSiS technology with the aim to improve the safety, longevity and energy density of lithium-based batteries for mobile applications and the IP acquisition “significantly” strengthens the company’s own technology.
Wood said the combination of Gelion’s existing technology, and the new IP portfolio has the potential to resolve the issue of sulfur management which has been identified as a critical issue for lithium sulfur batteries and eliminate the reliance on the maturity of lithium metal anodes as the lithium sulfur cathodes developed by Gelion are compatible with graphitic, silicon, and lithium metal anodes.
Wood said the acquisition will help Gelion to move rapidly from research to commercialisation and provide Australia with an opportunity to develop upstream and downstream manufacturing capabilities.
“By combining the strengths of both portfolios, we can offer a clear pathway to a commercially viable product, providing us with a crucial strategic advantage in a highly competitive market,” he said.
“We believe it opens paths to deliver higher energy density, lower cost, and higher safety outcomes on paths that are years faster than alternate industry initiatives.”
Gelion said this presents a compelling commercial proposition for a range of markets including electric vehicles, e-aviation and drones and it will now focus on advancing its technology with a view towards scaling globally.
“This includes developing the zinc bromide cells …and our lithium sulfur and lithium silicon sulfur technologies,” the company said.

Austria-based Alternative Energy Projects (AEP) has unveiled its first complete mobile power plant. The “Solar-Box” is a 20-foot container with solar modules, an electricity storage unit, and a hydrogen storage system.
The solution increases solar self-consumption and reportedly works both on-grid and off-grid. AEP Managing Director Gerald Wirtl told pv magazine that the system is available for direct purchase, or via its sales partners in different equipment variants.
“In terms of price, the container is priced at around €125,000 ($199,500)  for purchase from our warehouse in Linz,” said Wirtl.
The output of the container solution starts at 94 kW and can be scaled up to large systems of more than 5 MW, Wirtl said. Each container module can reportedly be transported to the desired location by common means of transport such as truck, ship, or train.
Each container has 168 solar modules, each with 560 W of power, as well as an inverter with 100 kVA and a completely pre-wired AC cabinet. The containers weigh 12.5 tonnes.
It purportedly takes between 30 to 45 minutes to unfold and assemble the PV plant. The tilt angle of the modules is 15 degrees and all orientations are possible. With four workers, the plug-and-play system could be installed in three hours, says AEP.
Connection is possible to low and medium voltage, the company said, noting that the plug-and-play architecture allows the power plant to be easily commissioned at its destination without high connection costs.
AEP describes other advantages of its system as simplified building permits, straightforward assembly of solar modules, corrosion resistance, and compatibility with storage and energy management systems.
The system has broad application potential, ranging from temporary power generation on green spaces to powering remote construction sites and industrial facilities, or providing emission-free power at events.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/17/agrivoltaics-market-valued-at-14-billion/,"MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,INDIA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MARCH 17, 2023",Agrivoltaics market valued at $14 billion,"From pv magazine USA
Agrivoltaics, the combination of farming practices with energy produced by solar photovoltaics (PV), is forecast to become a USD 9.3 billion ($14 billion) marketplace by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% in that timeframe from USD 3.6 billion ($5.3 billion) a year ago, according to a research note by India-based market research company Allied Analytics.
Experts believe agrivoltaics can minimise barriers to food security and the transition to clean energy, Allied Analytics said. While the agrivoltaics market is still in the growth stages, it is expected to grow as the solar market continues to boom, owing to demand for clean energy and sustainability.
The agrivoltaics sub-sector market has seen progress as the industry learning curve grows around best use cases in recent years, with the global installed output of agrivoltaics rising from 5 MW in 2012 to around 2.9 GW in 2020, according to Allied Analytics.
To promote a healthy growth environment, subsidies from governing authorities will be required. The implementation of agrivoltaic solutions will require joint ventures, lease agreements, reduced loan rates, and risk exposures, said the market research note. In addition, since there is a significant reduction in crop yield, regulations regarding solar installations need to be enforced for minimising land exploitation.
Based on climate change and increasing drought and extreme weather events, agrivoltaics offers key advantages such as zero-emission solar power coupled with food production and the protection of crops from drought and damage caused by hail or heavy rain.
To date, the world’s largest agrivoltaics installation has been built on the edge of the Gobi Desert in China, where berries are cultivated underneath solar modules, with total output of 700 MW, set to increase to 1 GW.
According to Allied Analytics, major agrivoltaic market developers include BayWa, Insolight SA, JA Solar, Enel Green Power, Sunseed APV, Mirai Solar, Namaste Solar, Ombrea, Sun’Agri and Next2Sun.
