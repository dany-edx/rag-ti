The Newcastle-based startup, which was included on The Australian‘s list of Green Power Players 2023, is aiming to build and operate a factory to manufacture both supercapacitors and redox flow battery electrolyte for Australian and international customers in the coming five years. 
Headed by University of Newcastle Professor Thomas Nann and two of his former PhD students, Allegro is seeking to commercialise a microemulsion battery electrolyte breakthrough made at the Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, back in 2017.
Microemulsions are essentially a combination of water molecules with hydrophobic liquid, coupled with a surfactant allowing the two normally repellent solvents to bond.  The combination occurs at a micro level to ensure it’s thermodynamically stable.
In their research, the team behind Allegro found that using by microemulsions as a battery electrolyte, you can overcome the pesky 1.2 volt barrier which has thus far plagued water-based or aqueous electrolytes. 
What that unlocks in real terms is a form of electrolyte that is far cheaper, easier, non-toxic and less carbon intensive to manufacture.
According to the startup’s modelling, 70% of the price of supercapacitors is the electrolyte. “One litre or kilogram of the current electrolyte costs about USD 10, ours costs 10 cents,” Professor Nann previously told pv magazine Australia. “So it’s a factor of 100 cheaper.”
This lower price means the technology can cater to solutions that were not previously commercially viable. “For example, EVs [electric vehicles] and grid stabilisation, because the solution is so cheap it becomes competitive for these applications,” Allegro Energy Manufacturing Engineer Mark Wojcik told Dashworks.
“For supercapacitors, Allegro will sell tailored solutions. This would comprise a bank of supercapacitors and an electronic management system that monitors the health of the capacitors. Solving problems, rather than selling a single product.”
“With [redox flow batteries], again our safe and cheap electrolyte gives us an advantage in the large-scale, long-duration market. This is a relatively young market, so it is a bit of a race to be the dominant company in the market internationally,” he added.
So far, the major challenges for the Allegro team has been shifting the collective mindset from research-based to manufacturing-based, as well as “learning to do everything for the first time,” Wojcik said.
“Connecting the machines up, commissioning them and figuring out how they all work was an interesting journey for the team,” he said of the recent pilot line set up.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/01/australias-resource-value-adding-pipeline-at-10-billion-as-experts-map-path-to-superpower-status/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 1, 2023",Australia’s critical minerals pipeline valuated at $10 billion,"“Australia is positioned to emerge in the new world economy as a value-added critical minerals superpower,” says a new report from Climate Energy Finance.
The report notes Australia’s pipeline of investment proposals “accelerated dramatically in 2022” to value of $10 billion (USD 6.7 billion). Among these proposals are key minerals for the energy transition, particularly when it comes to battery energy storage, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, vanadium, and rare earths.
This massive push is driven by both Australian mining majors pivoting to future-facing commodities, as well as new entrants to the sector. Report authors Tim Buckley and Matt Pollard urge targeted, ambitious policy incentives and strategic co-investment to solidify Australia’s position in the growing market. 

Global critical minerals demand is expected to grow five to 10 times this decade, the report notes. Such growth could also create approximately 35,000 jobs in the materials processing and manufacturing sectors by 2030.
It is crucial, the report says, that this opportunity is co-managed with First Nations and regional communities, and guided by a “nature positive” approach. Without a more inclusive and holistic approach, the industries spearheading this “reindustrialisation” risk repeating the mistakes of the past, which have greatly contributed to the crisis the world is now facing.
“Two global factors are combining to facilitate Australia becoming a value-adding superpower that refines its critical minerals into high-grade chemicals and metals before export,” writes Australia’s former chief scientist, Alan Finkel.
The first is that nations worldwide are urgently looking to “derisk” their energy supply chains by diversifying their sources away from China. The second is that these nations are also increasingly favouring materials refined and manufactured using clean energy, adds Finkel.

Combined, these two factors provide a massive opportunity for Australia, a country blessed with enviable natural resources and critical mineral deposits, coupled with a stable political and legal system.
“Australia has the global competitive advantage of abundant geological reserves of critical minerals,” the report says. “We are the world’s leading producer of unprocessed lithium (46% in 2021), and we produce 79% of the world’s hard rock lithium, with exports forecast to reach $16 billion in 2023, up 15x in two years.” On top of that, Australia is the world’s third largest cobalt exporter and fourth largest exporter of mined copper, nickel and rare earths.
However, the report’s authors argue that Australia is wasting its geostrategic advantage as “almost 100% of Australia’s critical mineral exports are sent to China for refining to supply its dominant battery and EV manufacturing industries.”
In 2022 alone, China invested $816 billion in the clean energy transition, and maintains global dominance in virtually all zero emissions industries, including the processing and manufacture of critical minerals, batteries, electric vehicles, aluminium, steel, nickel, polysilicon, graphite, solar modules and wind turbines. Indeed, the two Chinese leaders in battery manufacturing now produce over 50% of global supply.

China’s dominance, the authors say, presents both risks and opportunity for Australia. But the opportunity to onshore the processing and manufacture of Australia’s raw commodities is too lucrative to lose out on.
“Australia’s abundant wind and solar resources and extensive land area mean we have the potential to install [approximately] 25,000 GW of renewables capacity, sufficient to generate over 86,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy annually,” the report says. “This competitive advantage provides a critical opportunity to decarbonise value-adding onshore, and aid our key trade partners in abating value chain emissions by using low cost zero-emissions firmed renewables to power mining, refining and manufacture.”
To realise this potential, it is critical Australia’s federal government enhance its strategic public-private investment focus to maximise co-investment in energy transition, the authors say. 
Such an undertaking would involve updating the mandates of the government’s Future Fund, Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which all seek to support the energy transition.

The installed capacity of rooftop solar in Australia just hit the 20 GW mark, with over 3.4 million solar power systems installed on Australian households and businesses, according to analysis from the Clean Energy Regulator’s REC Registry.
“When the Liddell coal-fired power station closes in April 2023, rooftop solar will have a greater capacity than the remaining coal-fired power stations operating across the country,” says Warwick Johnston, managing director of consultancy SunWiz.
Australia leads the world in solar uptake, with over 1.2 kW of solar power per person.
“Australian solar power systems are more affordable than in any other country, so it’s understandable that we lead the world in per-capita uptake of solar,” Johnston added.
There are over 8,000 accredited solar installers in Australia, Sunwiz said, and together with their assistants and employers they install over 300,000 solar systems each year.
In addition to rooftop solar systems, there are over 11 GW of larger industrial solar power systems and grid-scale solar farms, Sunwiz found.

Renewable energy project developer, operations manager and energy trading business BayWa re has been steadily establishing itself in the region.
Still new to solar, the markets in Southeast Asia are almost the inverse of Australia, Director of Solar Distribution Junrhey Castro tells pv magazine Australia. The utility segment is by far the biggest, with rooftop generally accounting for less than 20%, Castro says.
Of the rooftop segment, commercial and industrial installation dominate – though Castro is witnessing this shift with new technology trends and growing support from Southeast Asian governments.
The region still faces significant challenges in terms of its grid infrastructure, and is increasingly coming up against a lack of expertise in solar, according to Castro. That is, solar installers are still relatively rare, and there are few certification and quality schemes, which Castro fears is slowing solar’s growth.
The most promising markets in Southeast Asia tend to change, Castro says, with solar temporarily booming in one country thanks to this or that government scheme, only to deflate and move into a neighbouring country.
As it stands, Castro rates Thailand as the company’s key market in the region, labelling it the most stable. Malaysia is another stable market, Castro notes, and one where solar is more mature – though with numerous untapped segments.
“Vietnam was a big market back in 2019 and 2020 but now we’re seeing that most of the players are focussed now in the Philippines,” he says. 
In terms of how BayWa re has moved into each of the region’s markets, Castro says the approach has generally been to get started by developing projects. However, he notes the company entered the Philippines on the distribution side, before working towards projects.
BayWa re entered operations in the Philippines in 2020. Despite the pandemic, the company finished its first year of operations with a 180% increase in revenue. It is expecting to grow by 150% this year, buoyed by support of the new government.
“The numbers are really strong for us in the Phillipines,” Castro says. In June 2022, the country elected a new, more renewable-supportive government, which has already brought in a Renewable Energy Act. While this vision still needs to be executed, Castro is optimistic not only about the country’s renewable future, but also by BayWa’s strategy.
“The numbers are really strong for us in the Phillipines,” he says, nothing it as proof the company can extend into the Phillipines in the same way it has in Thailand.

Given the strong growth in utility installations in the Phillipines, Castro says it is “only a matter of time until the grid becomes an issue because the infrastructure is still not there.” BayWa re has been pushing storage with its utility customers as a way of getting ahead of the midday congestion which has plagued other countries, like Australia, with strong solar uptake.
The region’s darling in previous years, Vietnam is now in a period Castro describes as an “FIT hangover.” Vietnam’s generous solar feed-in tariffs (FIT) previously spurred demand well above expectations, but that scheme has now ended, taking with it much of the excitement around solar.
“It’s a little bit of a difficult market now, but we think it is moving through a transition. There are policies upcoming now that will support renewables, so we are still optimistic,” Castro says.
He believes Vietnam’s policy is clear and its government committed, saying he expects there to be new opportunities to tap in Vietnam soon.
With each country in the region in quite different stages of the energy transition, Castro points to Indonesia as a key emerging market. BayWa re is not yet active in Indonesia, but is looking to move into the market in the coming years. The government in Indonesia has policies, but there are still question marks over how they will be implemented, Castro says.

Laos and Cambodia are both on the company’s radar also, though again it is still early days.
Until recently, the driver of rooftop solar in Southeast Asia has been the C&I segment, with most installations sitting between 1 MW to 3 MW, according to Castro.
More recently, however, Castro says residential sales have increased “quite significantly.” So significantly, in fact, he expects residential demand could soon be on par with C&I.

This growth he attributes, at least partially, to the trend towards integrated renewable product stacks – that is, bundling solar, inverters, batteries, electric vehicle chargers and energy management software into one platform.
“It’s much easier to install. It’s much more user friendly,” Castro says. These fully integrated product suites are proving an important selling point in the region, where he notes customers often invest in technologies as a way of “showing off.” The budgets households in the region seem to have to invest in renewable technologies has come as something of a surprise to Castro. 
The potential scale of the rooftop market in Southeast Asia is “huge,” Castro says, but has been hampered by regulatory issues in some countries, as well as by legal issues around foreign ownership.
Thailand is seeing strong growth in the rooftop segment, according to Castro, who notes the Philippines is also going down a similar path.
Perhaps more than regulatory and legal issues, these two markets are now being slowed by a lack of expertise. “It’s still very difficult to find someone who has experience in solar.”
“You go to Thailand – I think the residential market could grow even more if we had more installers.”
Aside from solar installers being far and few between, and there is a lack of certification, safety and other schemes to turn to for training.

“The industry is changing so fast, we’ve been seeing a lot of projects in the market that find constant issue with their safety, in terms of installation. I think that’s something we have to be aware of,” Castro says. 
“The government has to be part of the solution because if you don’t enforce that, we could go into gigawatts of solar installation on the rooftop side, but if something happens in terms of safety that puts us all in danger.”
“We need to put in place a certain professionalism and education in place to reach that goal.”
The Philippines is doing important work in this space, Castro says – seeking to mimic some of the installer training schemes and certifications in place in Australia.
But for the industry to truly boom, Castro says more training is needed. There is lots of emphasis on fast installations today – but the puzzle is how to maintain a high quality standard while also reducing costs, he says. “That is really needed in the solar industry in the next few years.”
He wants to see renewable energy integrated better into the region’s education systems. For instance, he says engineering curriculums in Southeast Asia still tend to focus on old technologies, but a shift towards teaching about solar and other renewable technologies would be invaluable for enabling the region’s transition.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/01/sono-motors-scraps-development-of-sion-solar-cars/,"EV,FINANCE,MARKETS,GERMANY,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"MARCH 1, 2023",Sono Motors scraps development of Sion solar cars,"From pv magazine Global
Sono Motors has decided to terminate the development of Sion solar electric vehicles, so it can focus on a capital-light, “solar-only business.” The Munich-based company, which went public in November 2021, said on Friday that it is laying off 300 employees due to the change in its business model. COO Thomas Hausch is also stepping down from his role.
The company’s decision to end the Sion program appears to be driven by the high cost of its business plan, coupled with “depressed capital market conditions.” Sono Motors said an estimated 90% of its funding needs for 2023 were dedicated to the solar car program.
Sono Motors first publicly presented its plans for the Sion solar electric car in 2017. The Sion was marketed as the world’s first affordable solar EV, with a price tag of about USD 26,000 ($38,700).
Sion’s outer shell featured 456 monocrystalline solar half cells to extend the time between charges and enable self-sufficiency on short journeys. Its 54 kWh lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery would allow for a maximum charging capacity of up to 75 kW (DC) and 11 kW (AC). The vehicle also had an 11 kW, on-board bidirectional charger.
However, pre-series production of the Sion remained beyond reach, as Sono Motors has repeatedly failed to secure enough funding. In December, it launched the #savesion campaign to offer customers €3,000 ($4,732) discounts in exchange for advance payments. It aimed to secure €100 million ($157 million).
Sono’s plan was to start production of the Sion car in Finland in the second half of 2023. However, “given the resource-intensive nature of the Sion program, including personnel requirements, the company is now implementing a significant cost reduction program,” it said in a statement.
“It was a difficult decision and despite more than 45,000 reservations and pre-orders for the Sion, we were compelled to react to the ongoing financial market instability and streamline our business,” said Laurin Hahn, the CEO of Sono Motors.
The company said the success of its 18-vehicle series-validation program proved the viability of its solar electric vehicle concept. This is why it will continue to use its proprietary polymer-based vehicle-integrated solar technology, but only by retrofitting and integrating the tech into third-party vehicles.
It also plans to sell its Sion program. In addition to the passenger car program, it will offer PV solutions for buses, e-vans, and refrigerated vehicles. It will launch its Solar Bus Kit retrofit solution in the second half of 2023, the company said on Friday.

India reached a cumulative installed solar capacity of 67.6 GW on Dec. 31, 2022, with 15,041 MW of new PV capacity added in 2022. A significant positive for 2022 was the open access market, which added 3.4 GW of new capacity, the highest ever to date, according to India Solar Compass Q4 2022 released by Bridge To India.
Adani (1,755 MW), NTPC (1,618 MW), and Avaada (1,383 MW) were the top developers by projects commissioned in 2022.
The report stated the average solar tariff during the year 2022 rose 11% to INR 2.66/kWh, while hybrid tariffs increased by 15% year-on-year to INR 2.85/kWh. State-owned hydropower producer SJVN was the top project winner in pure solar auctions with a total allocated capacity of 1,095 MW, followed by Fortum (800 MW) and Tata Power (650 MW). Tata Power led solar-wind hybrid auctions by a large margin with total wins of 1,310 MW, followed by NTPC (450 MW) and ReNew (300 MW).
As on Dec. 31, 2022, the total project pipeline (projects allocated to project developers and at various stages of development) stood at 52,293 MW.
Q4 2022 addition stood at about 2,755 MW, a 17% decline over the preceding quarter. Out of this, 79% (2,166 MW) was utility-scale, 15% (428 MW) rooftop, and 6% (161 MW) off-grid.
