The December Quarter 2020 Quarterly Carbon Market Report released this week shows that by the end of 2020 Australia had installed 32 GW of new renewable energy capacity – 13 GW of rooftop solar under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) and 19 GW of large-scale capacity.
The record rollout included a staggering 3 GW of rooftop solar PV in 2020, a 40% increase on the 2.2 GW installed nationally in 2019.
“Sustained low technology costs, increased work-from-home arrangements and a shift in household spending to home improvements during Covid-19 played a key role in the increase of rooftop solar PV systems under the SRES,” CER chair David Parker said.
The CER said installed rooftop solar PV capacity has increased by an average of 38% year on year for the past three years and early signs point to another record year in 2021.
An impressive 950 MW of rooftop solar PV capacity was installed in the final quarter of last year, up 27% up on the previous high (760 MW) set the quarter before, and growth has continued to accelerate.

The CER expects between 3 GW and 4 GW of rooftop solar PV to be installed this year with growth up 30% in January 2021 compared to the same time last year.
The rollout of large-scale solar PV projects is also expected to continue at pace after 4 GW was accredited nationally in 2020, well above the CER’s original prediction of 3.4 GW.
This increase was due in part to several utility-scale power stations that were expected to come online in 2021, including the 200 MW Wellington Solar Farm and the 227 MW Collector Wind Farm, being accredited earlier than expected.
“Several utility-scale power stations commencing generation and being accredited towards the end of 2020 rather than in early 2021 were the primary drivers for the increase,” Parker said.

The report also confirms Australia met its LRET of 33,000 GWh. The CER expects eligible generation could reach 40,000 GWh in 2021.
Australia has added on average more than 6 GW of renewable capacity each year since 2018 and the level of investment is expected to continue through to 2022.
“It comes as no surprise that total renewable generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) has climbed to over 30% at the end of 2020, up 5% compared to the previous year.” Parker said.
2020 also saw a record 16 million Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) issued owing to a 25% increase in crediting for savanna burning and 17% increase in crediting for vegetation projects.
“This was an 8% rise from 2019, a trend we are expecting to continue in 2021.” Parker said.
Emissions reduction from schemes administered by the CER reached 53 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2020 and is expected to increase to 57 million tonnes in 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/12/clearvue-looks-to-mining-sector-for-bipv-application/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 12, 2021",ClearVue looks to mining sector for BIPV application,"The ASX-listed ClearVue has set its sights on the mining sector, supplying Murdoch University with two of its solar glass windows which have been installed in a prototype four-person mine-site accommodation hut, or donga, at the university’s Perth campus.
The donga will utilise ClearVue’s integrated glass units (IGU) which feature solar PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and UV light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells.
The company said the technology delivers a minimum of 30 watts per sqm while maintaining 70% transparency.
ClearVue said its solar windows are one of a range of sustainable, low-carbon building products and technologies being used in the mining accommodation project.
With major mining companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto setting targets of net zero carbon emissions across the whole of their operations by 2050, the research initiative will examine not only how to increase the energy efficiency of the dongas, but also improve the thermal comfort for their occupants, particularly fly-in, fly-out mining workers.
ClearVue’s energy generating windows will, in addition to providing improved insulative performance, supply power to USB mobile phone chargers, LED lighting and sensors.
Data collected during the trial will be used to assess energy consumption and thermal comfort levels, which will then be used to develop a virtual building model able to simulate a mine-site.

The project is a continuation of ClearVue’s collaboration with the university which includes the installation of its IGUs in a commercial-scale demonstration greenhouse at the university campus.
Glazing of the greenhouse was completed earlier this month ahead of testing and commissioning of the greenhouse.
The ClearVue greenhouse, described as the world’s first clear solar glass greenhouse, is one of several greenhouses constructed at the university as part of a $7.45m agricultural research precinct.
The joint research collaboration will see the energy efficiency and generation performance of ClearVue’s glazing technology monitored.
The Perth-based company and Murdoch University will also conduct trials in the greenhouse to measure how well plants grow in the ClearVue-glazed sections of the structure.
To coincide with growing seasons, a winter crop cycle trial is expected to commence at the end of this month or early next month. The initial results from the greenhouse trials are expected around mid-year.
ClearVue said the plant science trial results will help facilitate the commercial application of its solar glazing technology across protected-cropping agriculture markets, a key target for the company’s marketing efforts alongside high-rise commercial buildings.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/12/trina-solar-launches-tracker-for-large-format-modules-in-australian-market/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 12, 2021",Trina Solar launches tracker for large-format modules in Australian market,"As debate continues about the merits of 210mm solar PV module technology compared to the smaller alternatives, Trina Solar has reaffirmed its stance that the larger-size modules are set to become the industry standard, announcing on Thursday it had launched two integrated PV tracker solutions in Australia.
Trina Solar, the only major module manufacturer to acquire a tracker company and integrate it as a wholly owned subsidiary, has unveiled the Vanguard 2P single-row tracker and Agile 1P dual-row tracker, both of which are compatible with the 210mm ultra-high power solar modules.
Andrew Gilhooly, head of Trina Solar’s utility solutions in the Asia Pacific, told pv magazine the launch of the trackers is part of an industry-wide move that advances the application of 210mm modules and will help demonstrate their value.
That value was identified in a report released last month by Norwegian renewable energy consultancy DNV GL which found the 210mm modules have the capacity to reduce balance of system (BOS) cost and levelized cost of energy (LCOE).
The DNV GL report says Trina Solar’s Vertex 210mm 545W mono-facial modules can cut the BOS cost by up to 6.3% and LCOE by 5.8% compared with the 182mm 535W mono-facial modules. The report also says the Vertex 210mm 600W mono-facial module performs just as well in reducing BOS and LCOE (5.6%) compared with the 182mm 585W module.
“The modules that use solar cells 210mm in diameter, as compared to smaller cell size, comprise fewer number of cells for high wattage,” Gilhooly said. “Having fewer cells per module also means the string voltage is lower. This in turn unlocks the possibility to run much longer strings, up to a maximum of 40 modules in high ambient temperature locations.
“These longer strings deliver considerable savings in installation labour and electrical balance of system costs through less DC trenching, fewer combiner boxes and so forth.”

Gilhooly said the compatibility with 210mm modules will also raise the tracker’s system value and contribute to reducing project costs.
“Trina Tracker … can accommodate these longer string lengths without requirement for additional structural reinforcement or damping components,” he said.
“With this longer, structurally sound tracker the number of motors and associated drivetrain componetry can be reduced on a per MW basis, delivering a significant reduction in procurement cost for the customer.
“As module efficiency continues to improve incrementally, over time, we see an associated reduction in tonnage of steel required on a per MW basis.”
One of eight major PV manufacturers to have unveiled trackers which are compatible with the 210mm ultra-high power solar modules, Trina Solar said its trackers will also allow integration with modules from other manufacturers and come with a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system for real-time data monitoring and analytics to measure system performance.
The Vanguard 2P single-row tracker and Agile 1P dual-row trackers are also compatible with the new, larger-format bifacial modules above 500W.

Trina Solar’s first 210mm module rolled off the company’s production line in early 2020. Since then the product line has been stacked with different large-size modules including the Vertex S 400W, and the Vertex series of 500W, 550W and 600W and beyond.
“Some of our modules that incorporate the 210mm diameter solar cells include Vertex S, which has proven to be very popular in Australia for rooftop residential and installations for small commercial and industrial companies,” Gilhooly said.
“We also have Vertex modules designed for large commercial, industrial and utility-scale projects. These modules too are proving to be top sellers for us in Australia.”
Trina Solar said it expects to have “no less than 50 GW” of production capacity at the end of 2021, the bulk of which will be devoted to 210mm modules.
Trina Solar’s announcement regarding the 210mm module compatible trackers comes just days after the company announced it had launched a dedicated energy storage unit.
Terry Chen, head of Trina Solar’s overseas energy storage business, said Trina Storage will develop flexible energy storage solutions focusing on front-of-the-meter (FTM) renewables plus storage, standalone projects as well as large industrial and microgrid scenarios.
“The world’s energy infrastructure is undergoing rapid transformation that poses opportunities and challenges. There is already strong demand globally for energy storage products and solutions,” he told pv magazine.
“But the number of experienced, bankable players that can provide professional, high-quality and cost-efficient solutions is limited.”
Trina Storage plans to establish a supply chain of “top players” to deliver its energy storage solutions and will also manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries as part of the venture.
Chen said the Australian market is among the company’s targets but there are no plans in place for a product rollout before the end of the year.
“Australia as an energy storage market that has huge potential,” he said.
“We see that ‘front-of-the-meter’ (FTM) pipelines are growing in the region. It is definitely on our radar and we would actively pursue opportunities beyond 2021.”

Neoen’s latest Capital Markets Day announcements saw it set out ambitions to win new projects at a pace of at least 2 GW per year through 2025. If achieved, that will give Neoen more than 10 GW of assets in operation or under construction by year-end 2025, which is more than twice the 4.1 GW Neoen had at the end of 2020. 
Neoen’s timed its aggressive strategy well as it has been reported that the first stage of what could be 1200 MW of wind, 600 MW of solar, and 900 MW/1,800 MWH of battery storage has received planning approval. The project, which should create more than 300 construction jobs and rely on the yet-to-be built SA-NSW Interconnector (Project EnergyConnect), is proposed for Worlds End, 18km south of Burra, SA, around Baldina, Bright, and Koonoona, on the traditional lands of the Ngadjuri Nation. 
Neoen Australia’s managing director Louis de Sambucy told The Advertiser: “Goyder South will not only support South Australia in reaching its goal of net 100% renewables by 2030, it will deliver income security to farmers, as well as jobs to the Goyder region.”
The project is set to be constructed in three stages, the first of which, now approved, will see 400 MW of new renewable energy under construction by early 2022. 
SA Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said “approval means hundreds of jobs can be created in regional SA, boosting the economy as we recover from the global coronavirus pandemic. Goyder South builds upon the SA-NSW interconnector which the Marshall Liberal Government is working with industry to deliver.  
Neoen’s revenues rose by 18% to €298.8 million in 2020 and the company is clearly looking to reinvest its profits. Neoen said that a contributing factor its 2020 revenues “was the strong first-quarter increase in storage as a result of specific, non-recurring factors in Australia.” 
Neoen’s Chairman and CEO, Xavier Barbaro, said Neoen’s ambitious plans through 2025 is “predicated in particular on the strong development prospects of the countries in which we currently operate and on the quality of our local teams.”
As a way of ensuring capital for this growth, Neoen will adopt a “farm-down policy of selling full ownership or a majority stake in projects in its secured portfolio.” This marks a moderation in the company’s long held “develop-to-own model” but not a full departure as “assets sold pursuant to Neoen’s farm-down policy will not exceed 20% of the gross annual increase in its secured portfolio.” 
The two subsequent stages will depend upon the completion of Project EnergyConnect.

As solar continues to grow its share in the world’s energy mix, the issues of land availability and intermittent generation become ever more important to deal with. Combining solar and wind generation has shown several advantages in balancing energy yields over a longer period – since sunny and windy conditions tend to occur at different times.
A recent study from Ireland suggests that adding more solar to the country’s considerable wind capacity could help to stabilise prices in the long term; and plans for large solar-wind hybrid projects are in action all over the world. Meanwhile, on the land usage side, floating solar projects have been implemented successfully on inland waters for several years now, and developers are beginning to consider the much larger challenge of installing PV at sea.
Looking at both of these opportunities to further solar’s growth, scientists led by Utrecht University in the Netherlands carried out a feasibility study for a floating solar installation incorporated into a new 752 MW wind farm located in the North Sea close to the Netherlands southern border. The study is presented in the paper Pooling the cable: A techno-economic feasibility study of integrating offshore floating photovoltaic solar technology within an offshore wind park, published in the journal Solar Energy.
The wind farm in the study is connected to the Dutch grid via a 700 MW transmission cable, and the researchers focus on the optimal use of this cable capacity. The group first combined historic wind and solar irradiance data to calculate the potential energy yield of the wind, and calculated the effects of adding PV in increments of 100 MW – finding, for example, that 300 MW of PV could be integrated at the site, and only 1.72% of its yield would need to be curtailed due to exceeding the cable capacity.
Factoring in the high investment costs due to limited experience in floating PV at sea, the group finds integrating the two would only be feasible for now with a subsidy to support the technology’s development. However, their calculations show that adding solar could lead to better usage of the connection cable, and that if offshore PV can achieve further maturity the approach could be useful in the future. “The combination of an offshore solar PV system and a wind farm can be beneficial in technical and economical terms,” the scientists state. “We have calculated optimal wind and solar combined capacity given meteorological conditions in the North Sea, showing that curtailment of solar is quite limited.”
The case study also demonstrates that for any potential site for an offshore solar-wind hybrid project, the weather conditions need to be carefully analysed, along with the costs, to determine the optimal combination and capacity for either technology.
According to a recent report from DNV GL, the North Sea may host around 100 MW of floating solar capacity by 2030, and 500 MW by 2035. The LCOE of offshore PV systems is currently estimated at around €354/MWh but in the future it should be close to that of ground-mounted solar parks.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/12/trina-launches-670-w-solar-panel/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 12, 2021",Trina launches 670 W solar panel,"From pv magazine Global. 
Chinese PV manufacturer Trina Solar has launched a new Vertex solar module with a power output of 670 W.
The new product, which features a conversion efficiency of 21.6%, was conceived for large scale solar power projects and is the most powerful panel manufactured by the company to date.
Trina said the panel is based on 210mm wafers, non-destructive cutting, high-density interconnection, and multi-busbar (MBB) technology. “The MBB and high-density interconnection improve the module efficiency to up to 21.6% while the non-destructive cutting pioneered by Trina Solar significantly reduces the risks of cell micro-crack[-ing] and power loss,” it explained.
The module, as with other powerful products of the Vertex series, is claimed to reduce, significantly, both the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) and the balance-of-system (BoS) costs of a project, due to the reduced number of arrays that can be achieved with bigger and better-performing panels. “In large scale power plants, the 670 W Vertex has 28 modules on each string,” said Zhang Yingbin, head of global product strategy and market at Trina Solar.
Trina estimates a project cost reduction of between 5% and 7%, as a result of a reduction of the non-silicon cost of silicon wafers and cells for the upstream supply chain, and a cost reduction for trackers, pile foundations, cables and labor. “Compared to other 500 W+ modules in the industry, BoS cost savings are at least RMB0.08-0.09 ($0.012-0.013) per watt hence … a significant overall advantage,” the manufacturer said. The module is also claimed to optimise container-space utilisation in transportation.
Trina launched its 635-660 W Vertex series in August. A month earlier, it had unveiled a 600 W version of the Vertex panel.

Sharp has launched the NU-JD445 solar panel, a half-cut monocrystalline PERC product with a 20.1% efficiency rate and 445 W of power output.
The new product relies on nine-busbar technology, which should make the modules less susceptible to micro-cracks. Like all half-cell modules from the Japanese manufacturer, the products have three small junction boxes, each equipped with a bypass diode. These enclosures transfer less heat to the upper cells, which helps to extend the lifetime of panels while improving overall system performance, it is claimed.
The panel has a size of 2,108×1,048mm and a weight of 25kg. The module is suitable for a system voltage of up to 1,500 V and has a temperature coefficient of -0.347% per degree Celsius.
The product has been certified according to the certifications IEC61215 and IEC61730 standards, which the manufacturer claims confirm the quality and safety of the module, which was tested for resistance to ammonia, salt mist, sand and voltage-induced degradation (PID).
The module was specially developed for ground-mounted and commercial and industrial photovoltaic systems and offers, according to Sharp, and offers a good balance between cost reduction and system compatibility. A 1.67m-long cable comes with the new module, which is said to enable installation in a landscape format or to allow skip cabling for installation in a portrait format.
In September, Sharp launched the NU-JD440 solar panel, which is also a half-cut monocrystalline PERC product, but with a lower, 19.9% efficiency rate and 440 W of power output. In January 2020, Sharp launched its first monocrystalline PERC module series to feature half-cut cells. It had previously announced three more mono PERC products, with a claimed 19.1% efficiency rate, in April 2018.
