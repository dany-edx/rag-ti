This morning, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) announced its first investment through the Advancing Hydrogen Fund: $12.5 million to help Korea Zinc subsidiary Ark Energy Corporation produce green hydrogen to power the world’s heaviest fuel-cell electric trucks soon set to ply the 30 kilometre zinc concentrate-to-ingot route from Townsville Port to Sun Metals Refinery, and back. 
It’s a demonstration project for the functionality and versatility of a hydrogen hub; a demand incubator for hydrogen; a use case for electric vehicles in the hard-to-abate heavy transport sector, along with the necessary refuelling infrastructure; and a precursor to Ark Energy exporting green hydrogen to Asia.
First things first: CEFC Ian Learmonth said in a statement announcing the landmark investment, “Australia’s ability to continue reducing its emissions depends on how well we tackle those areas of the economy that are harder to abate.” 
The transport sector ranks as Australia’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, responsible for a whopping 17.5% of emissions.
And as Learmonth points out, “Trucks that work in the heavy transport sector have ultra-heavy payloads and typically operate around the clock, so cannot be off the road for several hours to recharge.”
Hydrogen fuel-cell exchange is seen as the fastest-delivery, high-density energy source to power such workhorses — in this case, Ark Energy will acquire five Hyzon Motors’ 140-tonne rated, triple-trailer hydrogen-fuel-cell powered trucks and lease them to its sister company Townsville Logistics (also a subsidiary of Korea Zinc).

The five behemoths, which will emit only water vapour, are expected to abate about 1,300 tonnes of CO2 per year, and inspire many more such investments in the resources industry.
They will operate on a back-to-base model where that base is Ark Energy’s SunHQ hydrogen hub, which will be equipped with a 1 MW PEM electrolyser, compressors, storage and refuelling infrastructure. 
SunHQ is expected to produce around 158 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, powered by renewable energy from the Sun Metals 124 MWac solar farm at its zinc refinery.
Hydrogen excess to the Hyzon fleet needs will be made available to other customers in the Townsville region, kickstarting uptake of the green fuel and increasing the potential for decarbonisation.                                                               
“Everything we learn about hydrogen use in heavy transport,” from this project, said Rupert Maloney, CEFC Head of Hydrogen, “will help others who are also keen to improve their sustainability despite similar challenges.
“By demonstrating the suitability of what are expected to be the largest hydrogen fuel-cell electric trucks in the world, this investment has the potential to spearhead further take up across the heavy transport sector, including mining and other industries such as rail, marine and even aviation.”
Hyzon, a US-based company, in which Korea Zinc also has a minority shareholding, has also developed rail and aviation-fuelling systems from its core Horizon hydrogen technology. 
In Australia, it is so far supplying Fortescue Metals with hydrogen-fuel-cell coaches to transport its workforces in the Pilbara; this month it sold 10 zero-emissions coaches with 700 km range, designed for regional and inter-city travel to a customer in Brisbane; in July it contracted to supply Wesfarmers with two hydrogen-powered Hymax-450 prime movers, and it has a number of other deals in the offing.
Although Hyzon vehicles sold in Australia will initially be supplied from its international factories, such as its Netherlands-based facility, the company says it “expects to localise production of key platforms in Australia from 2022”.
Taking green hydrogen to extremes
Ark Energy has declared its intention to become an “extreme user” of hydrogen, “making it pervasive across the group’s businesses”, said CEO Daniel Kim in today’s statement.
He also underscored the company’s intention to become a demand creator for green hydrogen, and said, “To help build demand for hydrogen, we need to supply it as cheaply as possible, which is why the CEFC’s support is so critical.
“Customers can leverage our production and refuelling infrastructure at SunHQ, and won’t need to pay the capital cost of conversion away from diesel,” he added. “It all adds up to kickstarting the development of North Queensland’s local hydrogen economy.”
The Ark Energy green transport and refuelling ecosystem is the first hydrogen project to be supported by both the CEFC and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency which is contributing a conditional $3.02 million — to be paid upon the commissioning of the refuelling facility and delivery of the five fuel-cell electric trucks, which are expected to arrive in Australia in December 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said today, “Ark’s first-of-a-kind deployment is a great opportunity to highlight the potential of ultra-heavy fuel cell electric trucks in Australia, which has significant replication potential and could fast track the reduction of emissions by using renewable hydrogen not only in heavy transport, but the entire resources supply chain domestically.”
Grants, loans and heavy automobiles to make hydrogen fly
In mid-2020 the SunHQ renewable energy hub also received a $5 million grant from the Queensland Government Hydrogen Industry Development Fund.
At that time, the Sun Metals Solar Farm was supplying a third of the zinc refinery’s energy needs, with the rest of its daytime output intended for sale into the energy market, but system strength issues were plaguing the grid in North Queensland, and export of renewable energy from Haughton and Sun Metals solar farms, and from Emerald Wind Farm, was under threat of being slashed to zero.
Green hydrogen production achieved through self-consumption of its renewable generation turns out to be the most economically promising approach for Sun Metals, which joined the RE100 list of companies late last year, pledging to be 100% powered by renewables by 2040, with an interim target of 80% by 2030. It has also declared its intention to become the first refinery in the world to produce green zinc.
At the CEFC, Maloney says that  investment in Ark Energy infrastructure, “enables us to lift our ambitions even further and support emissions reduction in the carbon-intensive zinc supply chain”.

A fast, simple, Australia-tested solution to climate change","In the context of COP26 achievement so far, a moonshot is called for, and one Australian company is calling it. Behind the scenes of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference, eleXsys Energy is agitating for businesses and municipalities to Just Look Up for a simple solution to the huge problem of global warming: it’s positing that if 50% of all global rooftops hosted solar, their combined output could provide 100% of the world’s current electricity needs.
What the world doesn’t yet fully understand, says Richard Romanowski, Executive Director and Co-founder of the global-award-winning eleXsys Energy combined hardware and software solution, is that the problems of connecting huge amounts of variable solar and wind generation to the grid can be solved by taking renewables-powered commercial enterprises, villages and regional towns off the grid and enabling them to sell services and energy back into the network, as required, via wholesale-energy-market and FCAS-market participation.
Licensed in its home country to Planet Ark Power, eleXsys Energy is in the process of installing 1.9 MW of solar generation on the rooftop and car park of the Adelaide Airport IKEA store in South Australia, alongside a 3.36 MW/3.45MWh lithium battery supplied by CATL and the unique eleXsys Energy management system.
The flagship for hundreds more such C&I installations, this IKEA microgrid will allow the homewares megastore to be 100% powered by onsite renewables by 2025, while reducing its energy costs by a forecast 25%.
In addition, the eleXsys control platform has allowed a system more than 10 times the accepted “safe” size for grid interaction to be connected in solar-rich South Australia, which leads the world in addressing the problems associated with renewable-energy exports.
For regional towns that link rooftop solar on businesses, community buildings and residences to grid-scale storage, an eleXsis-managed microgrid will supply cheap electricity that lowers the cost of doing business, provides a sustainable point of difference to the locality’s products and produce, and helps new enterprises thrive.
“When you take a village or a small city that is struggling and give it clean, cheap energy, it can start new businesses, integrate vertical farming, it sparks a whole range of different things that will grow a community rather than having it slowly diminish,” says Romanowski.

 
EleXsys, says Romanowski, solves problem of backward flow of energy from distributed generators — utility-scale and small-scale — destabilising electricity grid voltages.
The compact, scalable hardware device is controlled by AI-based software to deliver services previously provided by deploying multiple devices: it is a grid-forming inverter, a battery charger and speed controller with power-factor correction capabilities — call it a dSTATCOM, aka a distribution static synchronous compensator.
Developed over several years by former energy utility engineer, Bevan Holcombe, and brought to market by clean-energy entrepreneur and co-founder of renewable-energy solutions provider Planet Ark Power, Romanowski, eleXsys Energy has solved the problem of solar curtailment, but another crucial part of its appeal is that it enables an investable solar-poweredbusiness model.
In the context of commercial and industrial transition to solar in particular, it allows the the entire solar-generation, storage and market-participation ecosystem to be independently owned by an entity paying rent to the property/building owner, then selling the world’s cheapest electricity (without added network costs) to the building tenant(s) or owner, and making money by providing services to the grid.
The IKEA project, for example, is owned by a superannuation fund, “and the reason they’ve invested is because with eleXsys they get a 20-year secure income stream”, Romanowski tells pv magazine Australia. 
In 2019, when Planet Ark Power won the World Energy Council (WEC)/German energy agency (dena) Start Up Energy Transition Award for the eleXsys Energy technology, Sandrine Dixson-Declève a global expert in the socio-political challenges of energy transition in response to climate change, said to Romanovski, “Wow, this releases trillions of dollars that want to invest into decarbonisation, because you make it bankable. But how do you explain that in 10 seconds?” or words to that effect.
Also at the time of the company’s WEC/dena win, Romanowski says, the Secretary General of the World Energy Council, Christof Frei, told him, “This technology is game changing. We need you to think 100 times bigger, to help us decarbonise the world.”
That’s one factor behind eleXsys Energy taking its “Just Look Up” challenge to COP26. The other is a growing body of research from experts at institutions such as University College Cork in Ireland, working with Columbia University in the US and Imperial College London, as well as the 2019 Australian PV Institute report on the potential for rooftop solar generation in Australia, which indicate that rooftops, commercial and residential, have the latent, sun-soaked space to change the emissions-climate equation.
Technologies like eleXsys can realise that rooftop potential, and deliver energy to customers that is already as cheap as Angus Taylor’s shot at the moon, says Romanowski. 
That is, if you take out the network and transmission components of your energy bill (as IKEA will be able to with its onsite generation and storage), solar energy is already at 10 cents per kilowatt; where Taylor’s challenge for solar farms to achieve costs of 1.5 cents/kW does not calculate the addition of likely 10 cents/kW in the cost of upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure, and even a little more besides for the cost of curtailment… 
EleXsys is focused on scaling up recognition and delivery of its technology, and is not relying on the success of its COP26 lobbying; the company will go global by mass licensing its software and hardware as a service into countries where electricity markets enable strong investor returns.
“We’re working first on a market-entry business strategy to the UK, and our second market entry is into Pennsylvania in the US,” says Romanowski.
The UK, he says, already has in place similar FCAS and wholesale-market mechanisms to Australia.
In the US, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order No. 2222, “which is proposing that you can participate in the auxiliary services and in the wholesale market from behind the meter, is just a couple of months off”, says Romanowski. 
Therefore, he says, in three markets — Australia, the UK and the US — which have those market mechanisms, the much-referred-to expense of battery technology today is no barrier to the immediate viability and saleability of the eleXsis proposition. “Battery prices already are cheap enough to make it work,” says Romanowski.
In Australia, he points out, we can do 750 IKEA-equivalent projects today and replace a coal power station, without any permission or subsidy — we don’t need government grants or any change in government policy.”
Businesses staring down the commitment to net-zero carbon emissions can Just Look Up.

Both installations were financed through the Sustainable Australia Fund, via Environmental Upgrade Agreements, which support works that improve the environmental performance of built assets.
Co-directors of North East Funerals, Christine and John Haddrick, incorporated a number of energy-saving initiatives into their new building but wanted to try to further reduce their business’s substantial electricity bills.
The 40 kW solar system that they financed through the Sustainable Australia Fund is expected to save at least $245,000 over the life of the installation, and displace 993 tonnes of CO2 emissions over the same period.
John Haddick said last week that the business recently received its first electricity account since the rooftop array started generating, and found, “we had exported more energy to the grid than we used”. He added that the resulting financial savings, “are considerable, and we expect the system to have paid for itself within four years”.
Sustainable Australia Fund
The Sustainable Australia Fund offers up to 100% of project finance, at competitive rates, over periods of up to 20 years, and on flexible terms; for example, repayments can be suspended for up to three-quarters of the loan period and they may be split between landlord and tenants.
Projects that qualify as environmental improvements include replacing single glazing with double or triple-glazed windows that retain warmth in winter and keep interiors cooler in summer; re-roofing — again to achieve greater energy efficiencies; installation of LED lighting; and the addition of rooftop solar and/or battery energy storage.
Wangaratta’s Cafe Martini is part of the former Bull’s Head Hotel, which was originally constructed in 1866, but the heritage building comfortably accommodated a 15 kW rooftop array.
The cafe restaurant is projected to save $3,164 during its first year of solar-energy supply, and to reduce its CO2 emissions by 24 tonnes a year.
“I’m really looking forward to seeing how much of an impact it makes on our electricity bill,” said cafe owner, Mark Sorrensen, who added, that if the system generates enough solar, feeding that excess back into the grid “is beneficial for all of us”.
The mayor of Wangaratta, Councillor Dean Rees, agreed wholeheartedly, saying the Sustainable Australia Fund, “brings environmental benefits for the rural City of Wangaratta, which is important to the whole community.”
He noted, “This program gives our local businesses a great avenue to access finance over a longer term, and enables them to reduce operational costs and improve building value.”
Originally established in 2002 by the City of Melbourne, to help overcome the barriers to environmental upgrades, such as business cash flow and the split incentive between tenants and landlords to pay for building improvements, the Sustainable Melbourne Fund as it was then known was substantially recapitalised in 2019 to offer a total loan facility of $200 million to applicants throughout Australia, and was renamed to reflect its national remit.
Among the flexible loan arrangements it offers to benefit landlords and tenants is the ability to transfer the loan as part of the sale of an improved building.
The Sustainable Australia Fund works with a network of local installation partners dedicated to helping Australian businesses realise their dream of generating their own energy.
In Wangaratta, both of these latest solar arrays on commercial properties were installed by Wangaratta-based Kennedy Electrical & Solar, which compounded the benefits of the funding within the local community.

Being able to accurately forecast the energy yield of a PV system is important in convincing investors of the returns solar can achieve, as well as providing a benchmark for owners and operators to better understand how a project is performing.
And as PV technology continues to diversify, with more differentiated products making their way to market, understanding how each will perform under certain conditions is an increasingly important consideration. And when a project does not meet expectations, it can cause big problems for all involved, and even harm solar’s wider reputation.
This was on the minds of a group of researchers led by Shoolini University and India’s National Institute of Technology in Hamirpur, who set out to develop a new model to predict the output of solar cells and modules over time. A key consideration for their model was accounting for the often unavoidable performance loss that PV systems experience over time. By working this into the model, the group estimates it is able to increase the accuracy of yield forecasts by as much as 26%.
The model is described in full in the paper A power prediction model and its validation for a roof top photovoltaic power plant considering module degradation, published in Solar Energy. The researchers measured the output and degradation of various solar cells in the lab under a sun simulator, and then validated these results with data from a PV installation on the institute’s rooftop. The paper also identifies different parameters to include in the model under different climate conditions, finding that a simpler model with only three parameters offered the most accurate forecast under low irradiance conditions, while four and five parameter models were more precise as the level of irradiation increased.
“Our model could be useful for developing PV power forecasting software capable of predicting daily, monthly, and yearly solar power generation, which is a crucial parameter for calculating the electricity supply and demand distribution, as well as for marketing PV systems,” said Shoolini University Professor Shyam Singh Chandel. “Being able to predict the output power of different PV technologies will help interested parties decide for the best option available in the market for a particular location. Based on the foreseen energy generation and the selected technology, one can estimate the total expenditure and payback period for a given project.”
