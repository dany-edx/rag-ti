The latest AEMO’s Quarterly Energy Dynamics (QED) report shows wholesale electricity spot prices averaged $264 per MWh in the NEM for Q2 2022, up by $177/MWh on the previous quarter and more than three times on Q2 2021’s $85/MWh average.
Wholesale gas prices averaged $28.40 per gigajoule (GJ) in east coast markets, compared to $8.20/GJ the same time 12 months ago, and almost triple the previous record of $10.74/GJ set in the September quarter last year.
The skyrocketing prices triggered the application of administered price caps, first in the gas markets and then in the NEM, and the first suspension of trading in Australia’s main grid since its creation in 1998.

AEMO executive Violette Mouchaileh said the three months to June had been one of the most “complex and challenging periods” in the market’s history and underscored the need to accelerate the transition to renewable energy generation, storage, transmission, and system services.
Mouchaileh blamed the soaring prices on “multiple factors”, including high global prices for fossil fuels, outages at coal-fired power plants, supply issues, and the coldest start to winter “in decades”.
“These factors also drove the frequency of NEM spot prices exceeding $100/MWh from 14% in Q2 2021 to 86% in Q2 2022, and above $300/MWh from 1% to 26%,” she said.
“What’s clear is the urgent need to build-out renewable energy with diversified firming generation, like batteries, hydro and gas, and transmission investment to provide homes and businesses with low-cost, reliable energy.”
AEMO said coal-fired generation outages reached highs of about 3.6 GW in late April and peaked in June at 4.6 GW.

Those outages, bidding changes and fuel supply constraints saw black coal generation’s average quarterly output down by 947 MW or 8.5% from Q2 2021 to its lowest Q2 output on record, its share of NEM supply falling 4.8 percentage points to 43%. Output from brown coal plants also continued to shrink, dropping 0.9 percentage points to make up 15.6% of supply while gas-fired generation overtook coal as the primary fuel towards the end of the quarter, rising 27% to 472 MW from Q2 2021 to its highest Q2 level since 2017.
Renewable energy continued to expand its share of the market. Output from grid-scale solar and wind increased 21%, or 664 MW, from a year earlier, driven by new capacity additions and commissioning.
Rooftop solar continued to grow with total installed capacity in the June quarter reaching 2,174 MW, 22% higher than the same period last year.
Overall renewable supply share for the quarter was 31.8%, up 3.7% on the same time last year.

The solar farm, which is to be coupled with a 10.1 MW/5.4 MWh battery energy storage system, is part of the $73 million Northern Goldfields Solar Project, which will also comprise a 27.4 MW solar farm at BHP’s mining operations at nearby Mt Keith, about 430 kilometres north of Kalgoorlie, and interconnecting transmission infrastructure.
The Australian arm of Canadian independent power producer TransAlta Renewables will build, own and operate the off-grid project as part of a power purchase agreement (PPA) extension signed in October 2020.
German renewable energy specialist juwi has been appointed to construct the Northern Goldfields Solar Project, which will be integrated into TransAlta’s remote power grid. The renewable generation will replace power currently supplied by diesel and gas and is forecast to reduce BHP’s scope 2 emissions at its Mt Keith and Leinster operations by about 12% per annum.
BHP Nickel West asset president Jessica Farrell said construction of the solar farm comes at a time when global demand for sustainable, low-carbon nickel – a key component of battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing – is on the rise.
“The Northern Goldfields Solar Project is BHP’s first off-grid large-scale renewable energy project across our global operations,” she said. “Significantly, it will remove the equivalent of up to 23,000 combustion engine cars from the road every year, supporting our greenhouse gas reduction targets.”
BHP, which last year signed an agreement with Tesla to supply the United States-based EV manufacturer with nickel from its Nickel West plant, said it expects the solar project to produce its first power by the end of 2022.
As well as beginning work on the solar and storage project, TransAlta is also working with BHP to identify potential sites for 40-50 MW of wind generation to add to the renewable mix at the Mt Keith and Leinster operations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/29/new-tech-to-produce-hydrogen-from-tap-water/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JULY 29, 2022",Update: New tech to produce hydrogen from tap water,"From pv magazine Spain
Spanish scientist José Antonio G. I.  has developed a system that is able to generate and store hydrogen on-site from tap water without electrolysis.
“Until now, the most common way to produce hydrogen is by electrolysis. However, this process implies a significant electrical consumption that makes it not interesting from an economic point of view,” he told pv magazine.
The prototype consists of a water tank that is initially filled with water, ferrosilicon, and sodium hydroxide. Hydrogen production begins when a 20 W compressor discharges pressurised air in the lower part of the tank.
“It is the air that causes the reaction between the different chemical components and generates hydrogen,” the scientist explained. “Then, the generated hydrogen leaves through the upper area of the tank to be introduced into an equally pressurised tank. The water in this second tank collects the possible impurities and hydrogen comes out through the upper part of the tank.”
After the hydrogen is purified, it flows via an upper conduit to another tank equipped with closed contacts, a safety valve and an outlet pipe assisted by a solenoid valve.

“Currently, we are developing a model with a 220-litre tank that can work with a pressure of 1 kg/cm2 and a flow rate of 30 litres per minute,” González Ibáñez went on to say. “This can generate heating, hot water and electricity for a household or a small business.”
The group is also designing a larger model that can work with a pressure of 750 Kg/cm2 and can reportedly supply a thermal power plant or a container ship.
“Hydrogen is produced at the place of consumption, so transportation disappears, it only needs a water tap,” the scientist emphasised. “The system is capable of generating the energy equivalent to a litre of gasoline –30 Mjoules or 8.333333 kW– for €0.0151515 (US$0.0153749).”
*The article was updated on July 31 to specify that the two chemical elements added to the first tank are ferrosilicon and sodium hydroxide.

Brazilian chemical company Unigel started the construction of a green hydrogen plant in Bahia, in northeastern Brazil. The company said the facility will be the country’s first hydrogen plant and the world’s largest integrated green hydrogen and ammonia plant. “Located in the Camaçari Industrial Complex (BA), the new plant will have an initial production capacity of 10,000 tons/year of green hydrogen and 60,000 tons/year of green ammonia,” the company said in a statement. The US$120 million (€117.6) project should begin commercial operations by the end of 2023. The facility will rely on technology provided by Germany-based thyssenkrupp nucera. “By 2025, the company expects to increase fourfold the production capacity of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Unigel said. “In the first phase of the project, Unigel installs three 20 MW standard electrolyzers from thyssenkrupp nucera, adding up to a total capacity of 60 MW,” the German company stated in its own press release.
The Environment Minister of the German region of Lower Saxony, Olaf Lies, approved €2.3 million in funding for a hydrogen pilot project planned by German energy company Uniper at the Krummhoern natural gas storage site. “It has long been clear that the energy transition cannot be achieved with electrons alone. Hydrogen will be a central element for the success of the energy transition. We need it to become independent of fossil fuels and to decarbonize our energy sector and industry,” Lies said. Uniper will test the new salt cavern specifically built for hydrogen storage on a large scale and in a real-world environment at the natural gas storage facility in Krummhoern, Northern Germany, which has not been used since 2017. The company will also build a new cavern using an existing well. “The storage facility will be one of the first of its kind and is scheduled to start operating by 2024,” said Uniper. The storage capacity should reach up to 250,000 cubic meters.
A US-Belgian research team has developed a new type of catalyst for fuel cells, adding a molecule to the traditional nitrogen-coordinated iron catalyst. “Adding a fifth ligand – four nitrogens plus another one – can lead to a much more stable and robust electrocatalyst,” the researchers said. The team tested three options for the fifth ligand: azanide (NH2-); hydroxide (OH-); and sulfate (SO42-). According to the study, the fifth ligand also improves the durability of the catalyst. “It appears that this fifth ligand manages to keep the iron in the plane of the iron-nitrogen when oxygen is added into this structure.” The team used computational chemistry techniques to test the new catalysts, such as X-ray emission spectroscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The study “Identification of a Robust and Durable FeN4Cx Catalyst for ORR in PEM Fuel Cells and the Role of the Fifth Ligand” was published in ACS Catalysis. 
Solar energy and onshore wind are crucial to unlocking Africa’s hydrogen potential, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Africa Energy Outlook 2022. “With further cost declines, Africa has the potential to produce 5 000 megatonnes of hydrogen per year at less than US$2 per kilogram,” reads the report. The continent has 60% of the world’s best solar resources, but only 1% of its operational solar generation capacity.
Serbia and Hungary signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on renewable hydrogen. “The signed memorandum is the basis for exchanging documents in this area and discussing potential joint projects,” said the Serbian government. 
Air Products announced it will also spend or commit at least US$4 billion in additional new capital for the transition to clean energy over the next five years, bringing its total commitment to first-mover projects to US$15 billion through 2027. “We continue to see significant opportunities for hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, and our industry-leading US$15 billion capital commitment is further demonstration of sustainability being at the heart of our business and growth,” Seifi Ghasemi, Air Products Chairman, commented.
