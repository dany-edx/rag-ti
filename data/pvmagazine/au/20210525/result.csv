Combined, the systems have generated 182 MWh of electricity for the Council, saving it over $46,000.
The installations have proven so successful a spokesperson for the Council told pv magazine Australia it is planning a far bigger solar installation, 500 kW, expected to be commissioned next year.
The third system will be at the town’s Oasis Regional Aquatic Centre. Originally, the Council had hoped to install solar on the roof of its Civic Theatre, but during the design stage a condition assessment identified issues which made it unsuitable for a solar system.
The funding for that system was then reallocated to its $1.3 million budget for the Oasis Energy Savings Project, which includes 500 kW of rooftop solar.
“The project will improve our services, for example the heating of the hydrotherapy pool will be more consistent, and the water temperature will be hotter. We’ll also have better air handling, improve the internal air quality and atmosphere with reduced humidity, and keep the air warmer during winter and cooler in the summer,” the Council’s Project Coordinator, Thomas Lemerle, said.
“It’ll be the first step in moving the Oasis towards clean energy and reaching Council’s targets for net zero emissions.”
Wagga Wagga is just one of a number of city council embracing solar to simultaneously save money and decarbonise. In fact, just last week the Victorian Energy Collaboration announced 46 of Victoria’s 79 local councils powered by renewable energy.
City of Wagga Wagga
The 99 kW solar system on the Civic Centre building was laid horizontally in order to maximise the number of panels the roof could fit, with Lemerle saying the Council were “very pleased” with its performance.
The solar system installed there and at the Livestock Marketing Centre were co-funded by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency under its Community Energy Efficiency Program (CEEP).
“We’re on track for the Civic Centre system to pay for itself in 2.6 years, and the Livestock Marketing Centre system in 3.3 years,” Lemerle added.
Both systems were installed by Solar Professionals, the trading name for KGM Services.

The program, which so far includes 2,500 homes across Albion Park, essentially allows installed smart meters to dynamically control homes’ hot water systems, meaning they can be switched on during the day when there is cheap surplus energy in the grid.
In other words, the program makes the hot water system work much like a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) or energy storage system, but doesn’t have the additional hardware and software requirements. This is helpful not only for customers, who get their water heated at the most cost effective rate, but it also means this surplus can be soaked up without any additional infrastructure.
While the program focuses on electric hot water systems, it could also be applicable for electric vehicle charging, batteries or other forms of load control or demand response services.
Endeavour Energy
The program has attracted the attention of state energy minister, Matt Kean, who was at the launch yesterday. “Nowhere else in Australia are we seeing this level of collaboration and innovation within the electricity sector to produce community wide benefits,” Minister Kean said.
“This state-of-the-art program has found a way to manage peak energy demand, helping to future proof the grid with even more home solar systems.”
 “The smart meters will also detect safety issues with a customer’s installation, and help detect network issues and outages, particularly during storms and incidents.”      
The program is managed by Intellihub, an Australian metering provider specialising in products that enhance grid visibility and data insight.
“It’s an innovative project, not just because of the technology, but how it’s being used to benefit customers, the environment and industry all at once,” Intellihub CEO Adrian Clark said.
Endeavour Energy
The value the program adds to Endeavour Energy, one of Australia’s largest electricity distributors, is that it allows the company to better manage its increasing penetrations of renewables through access to data from the low voltage network via a smart meter.
“Endeavour Energy initiated this program to solve the problem of replacing and upsizing a 50 year old, off-peak control system in its nearby substation,” Endeavour Energy’s CEO Guy Chalkley said.
“By using advanced smart meters, instead of investing in expensive old technology at the substation, Endeavour Energy can save real dollars and cents for our customers by finding ways to help them capture more affordable solar energy.
“We’ll also be able to access energy and power quality data through the smart meter to help us better respond to issues and outages, particularly during storms, giving customers even safer and more reliable energy.”
The plan is to continue rolling the program out of the NSW south coast and parts of Western Sydney.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/25/four-keys-to-getting-australias-hydrogen-economy-right/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 25, 2021",Four keys to getting Australia’s hydrogen economy right,"Hydrogen. The universe’s smallest molecule today holds perhaps its loftiest promise. To realise this promise (that is, the decarbonisation of difficult to abate sectors) without falling into the ample traps set by incumbent systems, the transition needs to be thoughtfully designed.
Nicky Ison, WWF Australia’s Energy Transition Manager, tells pv magazine Australia four things need attention to safeguard our emerging hydrogen economy and ensure it begins clean and correct.
“There’s fossil fuel hydrogen and renewable hydrogen, and that’s the least confusing way of describing it,” Ison says, plainly.
Currently, the vocabulary around hydrogen’s origin is explained by a rainbow of colours, from green to blue to grey to brown. It’s confusing for people in the industry, let alone lay people.
In fact, former Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull also brought up the issue of hydrogen’s many colours at the Smart Energy Conference earlier this month, saying “green hydrogen is the only type of hydrogen we should be planning for.”
“Blue hydrogen” or hydrogen produced with fossil fuels where emissions are supposedly offset by carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, Turnbull flatly called “B.S.” “There is no other colour [other than green] of hydrogen that you can responsibly support,” he said.

The Smart Energy Council are working on this specific issue, introducing a Zero Carbon Certification Scheme to guarantee hydrogen and all its subsidiary materials are made completely from renewable energy.
The reason, Ison says, is that hydrogen produced using fossil fuels simply doesn’t hold any promise for a cost curve reduction since it is a mature industry. Renewable hydrogen, on the other hand, is emerging will inevitably drop in price significantly through economies of scale.
While renewable hydrogen is still significantly more expensive to produce today, Ison points back to 2009, when there was a huge cost difference between solar electricity and traditional electricity.  Government backing of solar quickly closed that gap, getting Australia to where it is today (a country where solar is single handedly dropping electricity prices so low its sending coal out of business.)
Like wind and solar, the electroysers used to make renewable hydrogen are a modular technology, which means they will follow a similar trajectory down in terms of cost, especially with government backing.
The other reason that public money should be more shrewdly spent is, of course, to reach climate targets. “We should not be investing in technologies that are not zero emissions,” Ison tells pv magazine Australia. As obvious as this might seem, Australia’s federal government last month pledged $275 million to develop hydrogen hubs and along with it a cool $263.7 million for carbon capture and storage technology, giving a clear signal about what kind of hydrogen projects it plans to back.
Global hydrogen accounts for 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, so decarbonising the existing industry should be top priority, Ison says.

Around 98% of the hydrogen produced today uses fossil fuels in its production. This accounts for more CO2 emissions per year than the global aviation industry and global shipping, according to Wood Mackenzie analysis.
This, Ison says, makes it clear that hydrogen’s greening process needs to begin at home in the existing hydrogen industry.
When renowned journal Nature published a piece from German-Swiss research team concluding the use of hydrogen-based fuels should be prioritised in sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production, steel production and high-temperature industrial processes, it caused stir.
“Hydrogen as a universal climate solution might be a bit of false promise,” it said. Ison largely agrees. She says the focus should be on integrating hydrogen where it’s needed most, not in areas where electrification is already established and working well, such as electric vehicles.

“Renewable hydrogen is absolutely essential for decarbonisation, but we shouldn’t waste it on processes where we could use renewable electricity directly,” Ison said.
If we focus on industrial applications, Australia will be able to export hydrogen, probably in the form of ammonia, Ison says. “But the biggest opportunity is actually is onshoring industrial processes.”
Our incumbent system is based on the characteristics of fossil fuels – which are expensive produce, but exceedingly cheap and easy to transport. Renewable energy, on the other hands, is cheap to produce but costly and difficult to transport.
If the ease of fossil fuel transportation meant manufacturing and industry could be pushed offshore where labour is cheaper, this model loses its legs as the world decarbonises. This shifts the foundational nature of the industrial sector globally.
Like the authors of the Grattan Institute’s ‘Start with steel’ paper, Ison says this shifts holds a lot of potential for Australia.
By bringing industrial processes like steel making and ammonia production back onshore, Australia could impel a manufacturing boom and the creation on new jobs industries, she says.
For example, Australia is net importer of ammonia and fertiliser (ammonia is a key ingredient of fertiliser). However, we do have ammonia production facilities concentrated in Western Australia and Queensland. We could decarbonise these existing facilities before ramping up production. This would reduce our reliance imports and then as thirst for clean supply chains grows, these production facilities would be in place to become an exporters, in turn driving jobs and local industrial growth.
Hydrogen was one of the most talked about issues at this month’s Smart Energy Conference. Australia’s Hydrogen Conference is set to kick off tomorrow also in Sydney’s International Convention Centre.

Today, the Victorian government introduced its new Energy Fairness Bill to parliament to “protect Victorian households and businesses from aggressive and exploitative practices.”
The new legislation will ban door-to-door sales for solar businesses, electricity and gas retailers, deeming the practice “high pressure sales tactics.” For solar companies, the ban will come into effect on September 1, 2021, while for electricity retailers it will be delayed until the end of the year.
“We’re putting energy companies on notice,” Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said.
The state government’s new legislation comes after company Vic Solar was fined $3 million for ‘predatory’ tactics earlier this month. In March, Powershop’s Kogan Energy brand was also fined $300,000 after Victoria’s Essential Services Commission found the energy retailer was offering solar customers more expensive electricity plans than non-solar customers.
The changes are not limited to the state of Victoria either, with the Clean Energy Regulator, a Commonwealth government agency, spending the first half of this year introducing a sweep of new tools, rules and taskforces to oversee them.
The new legislation primarily focuses attention on retailers, rather than solar businesses, with its heftiest measure being a penalty of up to $1 million for energy retailers who arrange the wrongful disconnection of vulnerable customers. This measure, the government said in its statement, is to “protect customers in particular who are on payment plans or who require electricity for life support.”
Victoria’s government is also introducing penalties of up to $1 million for gas and electricity licensees who provide false or misleading information to the Essential Services Commission.
Additionally, the bill bans ‘save’ and ‘win-back’ offers, like short-term discounts which ultimately end up costing customers more in the long run. “This misleading tactic is used by retailers to stifle competition and by banning them, customers will be able to judge the genuine best price in the market – and not just for a limited time,” the Victorian government said.
It went on to say the new legislation is intended to make the energy retailer market fairer and more transparent.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/25/stop-removing-your-solar-panels-early-please-its-creating-a-huge-waste-problem-for-australia/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 25, 2021","Stop removing your solar panels early, please. It’s creating a huge waste problem for Australia","From The Conversation
Installing solar panels is an easy way to lower your carbon footprint and cut electricity bills. But our recent research found there are many incentives to remove them prematurely, adding to Australia’s massive waste problem.
Researchers predict Australia will accumulate 1 million tonnes of solar panel waste by 2047 — the same weight as 19 Sydney Harbour Bridges.
But this number is likely to be higher, as we found people often choose to remove panels after just 10 to 12 years of use. This is much earlier than their estimated end-of-life age of 30 years (and potentially older).
Unfortunately, recycling is just a small part of the solution. So why is this happening, and what can we do about it?
Australians have heeded the call to increase renewable energy. The installed capacity of panels across Australia has increased dramatically from 25.3 megawatts in 2007 to 77,078 megawatts in 2017. Likewise, the rooftop solar market capacity has almost doubled between 2014 and 2018.
Australia has committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of using fewer resources. And this requires us to use products (like solar panels) efficiently, with less waste. But Australia’s 2020 progress update shows our per capita material footprint is increasing. In fact, it’s one of the highest in the world, at 70% above the OECD average.
To help lower our growing material footprint and keep e-waste out of landfills, we need to ensure solar panels are sustainable in life, as in death.
It is assumed the primary reason why people remove solar panels is due to technical failures, such as when they’ve reached their expiry after 30 years, or breaking due to extreme weather or during transport. But failing to generate electricity doesn’t explain why many are thrown away prematurely.
So, we interviewed solar panel installers, recycling organisations, advocacy groups and local government waste managers across the Northern Territory. And our resulting qualitative research found social and economic incentives for removing solar panels.
We found a whole system of panels gets removed when only a few panels are damaged, as the new panels must have similar electrical properties to the old.
If the panels are still under warranty, the manufacturer often pays to replace the whole set, even when only a few are faulty. This means working panels are removed alongside the faulty panels, prematurely turning into waste.
Solar panels have also become a commodity item. Many of us dump old phones and cars when newer technology becomes available, and solar panels get the same treatment. After recovering the investment in solar panels through reduced electricity bills, some people are keen to get newer, more efficient models with a new warranty.
Our research also suggests government incentives aimed at rolling out more solar panels have caused consumers to replace their entire solar array. This is because previous rebates didn’t cover the replacement of only one or a few panels.
Finally, the life of solar inverters is usually 10-12 years, much shorter than the 30-year life span of the panels themselves. Some people use this as an opportunity to install a new set of solar panels when they change their inverters.
There’s currently little research on what we can do with panels when they’re removed for reasons other than technical failure.
Researchers often put forward recycling as the preferred option for removed panels. But sending the growing number of working panels to recycling facilities is a tremendous waste of resources, and increases the burden for panel recycling, which is still in its nascent stages.
Managing waste is the responsibility of states and territories, and they align their waste strategies with the federal government’s National Waste Policy.
But there’s no directive yet at the national level on solar panel disposal, specifically. This means there’s a patchwork of policies across the states and territories for managing this waste.
Victoria, for example, has identified solar panels as the fastest growing waste stream in the state’s overall e-waste flow, and the state government has banned them from landfills.
But such measures wouldn’t work for the Northern Territory, given its lack of processing facilities and the distance to the recycling centres in southern Australia, which are at least 1,500 kilometres away. With ample open land, they’re more likely to end up dumped illegally.
Australia needs clear guidelines at a national level on collecting, transporting, stockpiling and disposing solar panels. A lack of clear policy hampers state, territory and local governments from managing this waste effectively.
By proposing recycling as preferred option to manage this waste, we risk excluding other important options in the waste management hierarchy, such as reducing waste in the first place by making solar panels that last, extending their life.
The federal government has also touted “product stewardship” as a potential solution. This is where those involved in producing, selling, using and disposing products share the responsibility to reduce their environmental impact.
But this model wouldn’t effectively service regional and remote areas, as collecting and transporting goods from remote locations comes at a very high financial and environmental cost.
It’s worth noting some panels do undergo a kind of “second life”. There’s a unique demand for secondhand panels from people who can’t afford new systems, those looking to live off-grid, small organisations keen to reduce energy bills, and mobile home and caravan owners.
But with a number of massive solar farms proposed across northern Australia, it’s more important than ever to explore new strategies to manage removed solar panels, with clear policies and creative solutions.

The project, known as the Riverina Energy Storage System (RESS) will be the product of an agreement between Edify and Shell Energy after the two companies signed a long-term services agreement to deliver the battery.
RESS is set to connect into TransGrid’s network at the Darlington Point Substation, where it will work to add flexibility to the NSW electricity market and aid the growing presence of renewable energy projects in the region.
The agreement will see the battery partitioned, with 60 MW / 120 MWh operational rights going to Shell Energy. Shell Energy CEO Greg Joiner said “Shell Energy recognises that batteries have an important role to play in transitioning to and managing risk in a lower carbon energy future.”
“This long-term services agreement is a model for how large energy users can access dispatchable power like battery storage, which complements renewables” continued Joiner, “while contributing to a cleaner and more resilient power system. Shell Energy was pleased to select Edify as its battery energy storage partner in this collaborative approach to meeting the NSW Government’s need for an innovative power solution.”
Of course, innovative power solutions are key for emissions reductions targets at both the state and federal level. Edify Chief Executive, John Cole, noted that large-scale batteries like the RESS are integral to energy firming “in our brave new world of renewables”.
“Energy storage is fast becoming a valued capacity solution for the NEM,” Cole added, “given its fast and precise response. The uncertainties in this growing technology class are reducing and with it the barriers to acceptance from market and network participants. We are proud to be leading the advancement of batteries to shore up the renewable energy market and to increase the availability of clean, green, low-cost, dispatchable electricity.”
The RESS is another addition to the growing line of big batteries in the pipeline for the NEM, and that number is only going to increase with the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposing a new rule in April to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the NEM, services that will come largely from batteries.

Bengaluru-headquartered Aegeus Technologies has introduced the Shreem cleaning bot exclusively designed for rooftop solar installations. The robot is fully autonomous and weighs only 5 kg (with batteries), portable enough to carry in a backpack. 
Shreem can be operated through a web-based app from any remote location, and overcomes the problem of accessibility for dangerous or difficult-to-reach rooftop installations. The bot, being Bluetooth-enabled, can also be operated manually using a mobile app or through an RF remote-operated controller. It can be preset to start at a desired time of the day automatically.
Shreem uses airwash technology to clean the panels, requiring no water or any harmful chemicals. It consists of two sets of wiping brushes (axial and radial) made of microfibre cloth. Controlled airflow blows the dust off the panels efficiently. The radial brush ensures any leftover dust on the edges is also blown off.
The bot uses an intelligent algorithm and sensors to detect edges and move in a straight path covering the entire area. It aligns automatically to account for undulations or uneven surfaces. Further, it is intelligent to differentiate between the end of the table and gaps between tables. The bot uses a computational neural network to train itself about the number of rows, columns, modules, inclination angle, path planning, and direction for effective operation.
Shreem comes with a solar-powered docking station, which keeps monitoring weather parameters like the rain, wind speed, etc. The bot will return to or continue to be in the docking station if the weather is unsafe for its operation.
Shreem can clean around 200 panels an hour. It is powered by a 10Ah lithium-ion battery pack with a life of around 2000 cycles.

Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has launched a new residential heterojunction panel series that is compatible with its Evervolt lithium-ion storage solution for residential solar installations.
The new module series, which will be available from the third quarter of this year, features a power output ranging from 370 to 380 W and an efficiency of 21.2% to 21.7%.
The panel’s temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius and the manufacturer offers a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year power output guarantee. The panels are said to be able to operate at 92% of their original performance at the end of the guarantee period.
Furthermore, the Japanese module maker launched a black version of the same module in a series with a power output of between 360 and 370 W and efficiency ranging from 20.6% to 21.2%. “The new modules are the latest technological evolutions in our roadmap of innovative solutions designed with homeowners’ and installers’ needs in mind,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, Panasonic said the cabinet of its Evervolt battery has been improved to stack more batteries and store more energy in a smaller space. “The improved cabinet will be 29x47x18 inches, 22 square inches smaller than the previous EverVolt battery storage model,” it explained. “In addition to offering both the AC- and DC-coupled options, the battery storage system can be scaled down to as little as 11kWh of energy storage or expanded to 102kWh.”
Panasonic had launched its EverVolt storage system in September 2019. The battery has a storage capacity ranging from 5.7 kWh up to 34.2 kWh. The 5.7 kWh ‘mini’ version of the storage system has an average back-up capability of three hours, the 11.4 kWh standard option six hours and the 17.1 kWh ‘plus’ product nine hours.

A new tool from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Berkeley Lab allows users to explore trends in wholesale electricity prices and their relationship to solar and wind generation.
The Renewables and Wholesale Electricity Prices (ReWEP) tool allows users to compare pricing trends across locations, regions, and a number of different timeframes, down to the nodal level. These comparisons help illustrate the ongoing interactions between solar and wind generation and wholesale energy prices.
The ReWEP tool consists of maps, time series, and other interactive figures that provide a general overview of how average pricing, negative price frequency, and extremely high prices vary over time; and a summary of how pricing patterns are related to solar and wind generation. Interactive functionality allows investigation by transmission regions (ISOs/RTOs), year, and season, and over diurnal cycles.

The ReWEP tool is intended to provide users a way to explore ongoing changes to pricing patterns, including those related to growth in wind and solar deployment.
