Hydrostor is planning to build a 200 MW energy storage system with eight hours of storage capacity at the Potosi mine site near Broken Hill. The long-duration energy storage system will utilise advanced compressed air energy storage (A-CAES) technology.
The agreement with Transgrid requires Hydrostor to reserve up to 50 MW of capacity from the Silver City project, representing up to 250 MWh of storage, to provide a reliable back-up power supply for the 17,000 people who live in Broken Hill. The new system will replace existing diesel turbines that currently provide support during planned or unplanned outages.
The remainder of the Silver City project’s capacity will be available to be traded on the grid on a daily basis, while supporting existing and new renewable energy generation.
Hydrostor Vice President Martin Becker said the new partnership with Transgrid, which comes after the company announced a binding agreement with Australian miner Perilya to leverage existing assets at the Potosi mine site to support construction of the Silver City project, is a key moment for the technology.
“This is another significant milestone in the development of this critical infrastructure project that will ensure the delivery of clean power and energy security to the Broken Hill region,” he said.

Hydrostor’s A-CAES technology operates in a similar way to pumped hydro. It features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It draws off-peak or surplus energy from the grid to produce heated compressed air. During charging, heat from the compressed air is collected and stored before the cooled air displaces water out of an underground cavern up to a water reservoir on the surface. To discharge, water flows back into the cavern forcing air to the surface under pressure where it is heated with the stored thermal energy and drives a turbine to generate electricity.
Hydrostor Chief Commercial Officer Jordan Cole said the technology represents a “scalable, cost-effective solution for the provision of long-duration energy storage.”
“We look forward to progressing this essential infrastructure project that ensures clean energy is accessible when needed,” he said.
The Silver City project is expected to bring significant economic benefits to the Broken Hill region, with Hydrostor estimating it will contribute approximately $1 billion (USD 660 million) to the local economy and will generate 750 jobs during construction and 70 ongoing jobs once in operation.

It is anticipated the new solar farms will add more than 50 GWh of clean energy to the state’s renewable energy supply.
“This landmark agreement with INSW provides an opportunity for CleanPeak to make substantial investments in regional NSW and build new renewable energy projects, adding to our growing portfolio of projects that are accelerating Australia’s clean energy transition,” CleanPeak Chief Executive Officer Philip Graham said.
“CleanPeak operates the Barangaroo energy precinct, delivering electricity and thermal services and this agreement is consistent with our mission to deliver a 100% reliable and renewable energy supply to our customers”.
INSW said CleanPeak, which owns the behind-the-meter electricity network that supports the Barangaroo development, will supply the state government with renewable energy certificates over a 25-year period from 2025 at a “fixed and competitive” rate.
The agency said CleanPeak’s capacity to generate clean energy from the new solar farms as well as renewable energy certificates will allow Barangaroo’s grid-supplied electricity consumption – or scope 2 carbon emissions – to be completely offset.
INSW said the deal ensures Barangaroo can achieve carbon neutrality without tenants in the 7.5-hectare commercial and residential precinct needing to enter individual renewable energy contracts, meaning they can source electricity from a provider of their choosing.
“By entering into this groundbreaking agreement, Barangaroo has ensured both its carbon neutrality and a sustainable energy future for the long term,” INSW said, noting that the purchase of green products will be funded by levies collected by the state government from Barangaroo’s building owners.

CleanPeak said construction of the first two new solar farms, being developed near Moama and Hay in NSW’s southwest, is expected to begin early next year with more projects to follow once planning and regulatory approvals have been acquired.
The Moama and Hay projects, which will both utilise single axis trackers, are expected to each generate more than 25 GWh of renewable electricity annually with CleanPeak Chief Operating Officer Jon Hare noting that the company is planning to install batteries at each of the sites.
“Our plan is to add a battery energy storage system at each site, which will provide the flexibility to better match solar generation with each customer’s consumption profile providing the reliability in renewables that our customers need,” he said.
The deal is the latest shift into utility scale solar for CleanPeak which established itself as a developer of major commercial projects.
In November, the Sydney-headquartered company acquired three operating solar farms with a combined capacity of 14.3 MW. The purchases include the 11 MW Williamsdale Solar Farm and the 2.3 MW Mount Majura Solar Farm in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), and the 1 MW Karratha Solar Farm in Western Australia. Earlier this year it acquired the 13 MW Mugga Lane Solar Park near Canberra and commenced construction of the 30 MW Wangaratta Solar Farm project being developed in northeast Victoria.
The solar farms add to CleanPeak’s portfolio of C&I energy projects which include more than 50 MW of rooftop solar and 35 MWh of battery energy storage either in operation or under development.
CleanPeak, in conjunction with Igneo Infrastructure Partners, also owns the Barangaroo South precinct’s District Energy Infrastructure, having acquired the behind-the-meter system from developer Lendlease in mid-2022 in a deal estimated to have been worth up to $150 million.
The infrastructure, much of it housed in a 77,000-square-metre space built below Barangaroo, includes 52 MW of thermal energy assets, along with the embedded electricity network and solar assets that supply the precinct.

AEMO’s updated and newly expanded monthly connections scorecard shows another 69 projects with a combined total of 11 GW of new capacity have advanced to the pre-registration phase. Out of these, 39 projects totalling more than 6.8 GW of capacity have signed a connection agreement with a transmission and distribution network service provider and are ready for construction.
“The scorecard shows that we’re expecting a major influx of generation and storage capacity, with 90% of all new generation and storage projects currently in the application and pre-registration stages,” AEMO Onboarding and Connections Group Manager Margarida Pimentel said.
“This represents 149 projects totalling 31,000 MW, equal to half of the NEM’s total generation capacity.”
The latest scorecard of generation and storage projects working through the NEM connection process also highlights a large year-on-year increase in battery project applications, up from 14 projects totalling more than 1.8 GW of capacity to 22 projects with a combined capacity of 5.1 GW.
Pimentel said the updated scorecard provides project tracking through the ‘application to full-generation output’ connections process, but also adds key insights and trends over time. The expanded scorecard lists detailed project information by connection stage, broken down by technology type, region and average time within each stage.
“In the next decade, two-thirds of today’s coal power stations are expected to retire, requiring urgent investment in generation, storage and transmission projects to meet consumers’ electricity needs,” she said.
“The expanded monthly connections scorecard gives participants a new level of useful project details, providing a much broader view for their connection activities.”
AEMO’s data shows that 620 MW of new capacity received application approval in October, taking the total for the financial year to date to 1,560 MW, and 320 MW of new capacity completed registration in the month for a total of 1,200 MW since the start of July.

Three projects, including the 400 MW New England and 53 MW Wyalong solar farms in New South Wales and the 173 MW Dulacca wind farm in Queensland, commenced operating at their full output in October, increasing the year-to-date total to 11 projects with a combined capacity of 1,430 MW.
Pimentel said that by engaging early to understand key locational considerations and gaining early feedback on their design, some projects are now getting their technical standards approval in just one-third of the time that it used to take.
“These projects are also progress faster by being transparent about project milestones and constraints, and actively working with AEMO and NSPs to address project issues, which allows them to capitalise on pre-negotiated financing and construction arrangements,” she said.
Despite this, AEMO noted that developers are facing a range of connection challenges, including a shortage of experienced resources, the need to refinance projects, long lead times for equipment, and the need to change original equipment manufacturers.
The scorecard shows that 25% of projects have been in the pre-registration stage for more than two years.

The ETU said that an inspection last week had exposed dangerous workplace practices and conditions at work sites associated with the EnergyConnect project, a 900-kilometre electricity interconnector that will link power grids in NSW, South Australia and Victoria.
The project is a joint venture between South Australian network operator ElectraNet and NSW provider TransGrid which, along with construction partner Elecnor, is building the 700km NSW section of the project.
The ETU said the breaches include non-compliant harnesses and first aid kits, poor food, water and sun safety, unqualified workers conducting electrical work, and no toilets. The union said workers were also having to deal with unreliable mobile-radio communications and inadequate first-aid procedures.
“The fact that the workplace health and safety regulator has boots on the ground to investigate should be ringing alarm bells to Elecnor and Transgrid,” ETU National Secretary Michael Wright said.
“Apart from being provided some hi-vis clothing and a vehicle, workers have largely been left to fend for themselves on the lines. Workers have been dodging falling objects, and wearing fraying and non-compliant harnesses. When something goes wrong, they’ve waited an eternity for help.”
Wright said the project has had a “horror track record” for the rights of workers and that the “unsafe working conditions are making it that much harder to attract the workforce we need to transition the nation to net zero.”
“This cannot be what the energy transition looks like,” he said.
A Transgrid spokesperson did not respond to the individual allegations but said in a statement the company took the safety of employees and contractors “very seriously.”
“Transgrid strives for best practice in all aspects of safety and as such, we drive continual improvement regarding safety standards to ensure they are above and beyond the required compliance levels,” the spokesperson said.
“Our safety systems, our people and their behaviours are supported by protocols that ensure anticipation and mitigation of any safety issues.”
Construction of the high-voltage interconnector is due to be completed in 2024, providing 800 MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions, unlocking some 5.3 GW of new renewable energy projects.

The work to strengthen the grid is part of the Victorian government’s $540 million Renewable Energy Zone Development Plan which aims to unlock up to 10 GW of new wind, solar and battery energy storage projects across the state.
AusNet Chief Executive Officer David Smales said the Mortlake Turn-In project will improve capacity on the transmission network in the state’s southwest and provide a critical boost to renewables projects that have been impacted by constraints in that part of the network.
“This project has a number of benefits, including addressing network constraints, creating jobs, and providing new renewable generation development opportunities in the longer term,” he said, adding that the project will ensure “we have the transmission network needed to harness the sun and wind from the southwest of Victoria.”
Currently, two 500 kV transmission lines stretch past the Mortlake Terminal Station, located about 50 kilometres northeast of Warrnambool, but only one connects to the station. The Turn-In project will connect the second 500 kV line to the station by upgrading existing equipment.
AusNet said connecting both circuits at the Mortlake Terminal Station will allow a more balanced sharing of power between the two parallel circuits, making the network more stable.
AusNet has been contracted by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to deliver the project along with its construction partner Consolidated Power Projects Australia.
The Victorian government has forecast that it will need to bring 25 GW of new renewable energy and storage capacity online by 2035 to meet its targets of 65% renewables by 2030 and 95% by 2035.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/08/nuclear-who/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 8, 2023",Nuclear who?,"From pv magazine Global
The “World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2023” overseen by French nuclear energy consultant Mycle Schneider shows that despite the significant global presence of the nuclear industry, which produced 2,545 TWh of energy last year, the sector is shrinking, with renewables looming large due to cheap costs and popularity.
Schneider told pv magazine that as costs between solar and nuclear continue to widen PV continues to come out on top.
“In the longer term, soft costs determine solar electricity prices and their key factor is the density of installations,” he said.
“This is no doubt the main reason why China was able to add over two-thirds of its gigantic 85 GW 2022 solar additions as decentralised, mainly rooftop, installations, systematically implementing programs through entire counties thus super high density of projects.”
Schneider said the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind projects is lower than nuclear. He cited 2022 data collected by US-based Lazard showing the LCOE for combined solar and wind can be USD 45–130/MWh ($68 – 198/MWh) which is well below nuclear’s estimated mean of USD 180/MWh ($274/MWh).
Schneider said there has only been one nuclear reactor construction license awarded in the United States, given to the NuScale with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), but operations were terminated in November as the project “did not identify enough subscribers for the projected power output at the projected price.”
“Estimated construction costs, long before construction starts, as the design has not been certified yet by the safety authorities hit USD 20,000/kW, which is about twice the cost estimate of the most expensive European pressurised reactors (EPRs) in Europe,” he said.
Schneider said fourth-generation reactors, described as “PowerPoint Reactors”, would not be able to compete with renewables as they “hardly exist on the drawing board” and have not been certified by licensing authorities.
“How can we discuss potential competitiveness if there is no design, no existing fuel chain, no safety analysis?” he said. “However, these ideas are decades away from implementation at any scale if ever. Many of these conceptual ideas, like fast neutron reactors or molten salt reactors, have been talked about for decades. The probability that they will ever exist is shrinking with the widening cost gap of existing designs with renewables.”
Schneider said renewable energy and nuclear energy will never be complementary energy sources. He used Olkiluoto-3, the first European enterprise resource planning project, as an example. The nuclear facility had “hardly” started commercial operations in April 2023 when its output was reduced in May due to unprofitable wholesale market energy prices. It could not compete with the flexibility of renewables, Schneider said.
“Increasing penetration of variable renewables like wind and solar need fine-tuned, flexible, complementary elements like demand-response, storage, efficiency, sufficiency, hydro, and biomass,” he said. “Nuclear power needs to run as many hours as possible to amortize the huge upfront investment.”
Schneider said wind and solar technologies work well together and can produce a large chunk of the energy grid’s base load. Not only this, he said, but they also “eat” into nuclear’s profitability. “There are many systemic characteristics that clearly illustrate that not only are renewables and nuclear not complementary but they are increasingly contradictory as renewables increase their share,” Schneider said.
The report states that renewable technologies – consisting of solar, hydropower, and wind – are the main area of “optimism” for energy security. “Nuclear power remains, at best marginal and all too often irrelevant to the challenges ahead,” the document reads.
The report also states last year and this year were pivotal for examining and improving the international energy sector. Insecurities exposed by the Ukraine war and the climate emergency forced countries to develop new industrial and economic strategies to strengthen domestic supply chains and manufacturing.
As a result, solar’s total installed capacity at the end of 2022 reached 1,047 GW. The industry increased its annual production at an “unprecedented” speed, with an annual production of 1,309 TW/h. In more than a decade the LCOE for utility-scale solar projects has decreased by 83% but rose by 47% for nuclear, meaning that nuclear power is “the most expensive generator.”
“Aside from natural gas peaking plants at discount rates of less than 5.4 percent, nuclear turned out always the most expensive resource on an LCOE basis,” the analysts said. “The growth of renewable energy is now not only outcompeting nuclear power but is rapidly overtaking fossil fuels and has become the source of economic choice for new generation.”
Global energy power generation for nuclear dropped by 4% last year, according to the report. This is despite a net addition of 4.3 GW in operating nuclear power capacity and four reactors being decommissioned.
As of the end of June, however, 58 new reactors were under construction, which is five more reactors than last year, the document states. The share of the nuclear global commercial gross electricity generation fell to 9%, which, according to the report authors, is the largest dip since 2012 – the year following the major Fukushima nuclear accident.
“At the end of 2022, the nominal net nuclear electricity generating capacity had peaked at 368 GW, two having added 5.3 GW during the year, 1 GW more than the previous 2006 record of 367 GW, but it dropped again to 364.9 GW by mid-2023,” the authors of the report stressed.
They also explained that at the end of June, 407 operational reactors in 32 countries produced 365 GW. This is less than the 413 GW of installed solar capacity expected to be reached by the end of 2023, according to forecasts provided by New York-based research firm BloombergNEF.
Reactor construction times now average six years, which is a drop since last year, the report states. Despite the expedited process, however, other challenges loom, such as year-long delays, “lengthy” licensing procedures, complex financing negotiations and site preparations.
China is developing the most new nuclear facilities, clocking in 39 from 2012 to 2021. The country also deployed the only SMRs in 2023: the twin-High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor units, according to the report. But the authors write they were subject to a “historical pattern of cost escalations and time overruns,” meaning it will be “less likely” for SMRs to be commercialised in the future
“Despite optimistic numerical targets for expansion, the proposed role for nuclear power in a decarbonised world faces continued competitive pressures on both cost and technical capabilities,” according to the report.
“This includes the economics of operating reactors and the funding of new ones.”

GCube Insurance, an underwriter for renewable energy projects, said that about 54% of incurred costs of total solar losses can be attributed to hail, despite being only 1.4% of the total number of claims filed. This is based on data collected by Gcube over the past five years. Average costs totalled USD 58 million ($88 million) per claim.
It said this risk is being underestimated by solar asset owners, causing a gap between insurance requirements for solar projects and what is available in the market and leading to project delays and cancellations.
GCube insures more than 100 GW of renewables projects in 40 countries.
Other leading insurance risks include fires (16% of claims and 20% of total costs) and electrical failures (19% of total claims and 3.5% of total costs), based on five years of GCube data.
The insurance underwriter said in pursuit of a reduced levlized cost of electricity (LCOE), solar manufacturers have adopted larger, thinner modules with more fragile surface glass, leading to increased hail risk.
“Hail damage risk is undermining the security of solar power as a prominent clean energy solution,” said Fraser McLachlan, chief executive officer of GCube Insurance. “We therefore have an overriding imperative to develop solutions to this challenge and restore our ability as insurers to provide the sector with long term risk underwriting.”
