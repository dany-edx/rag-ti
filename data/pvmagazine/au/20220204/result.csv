https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/04/poll-reveals-clean-industries-key-to-future-prosperity-in-coal-heartlands/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Poll reveals clean industries key to future prosperity in coal heartlands,"A poll of more than 2,000 voters in Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) found that more than 60% of respondents believe the future prosperity of the states won’t be found in coal or gas, but rather in clean industries like green hydrogen, the mining of critical minerals like lithium and cobalt, and manufacturing renewable products.
The survey, commissioned by the Climate Council and conducted by YouGov, found only a quarter of voters in Queensland (26%) and about one fifth in NSW (21%) believe their state’s future prosperity lies in coal and gas.
NSW and Queensland are home to 11 of Australia’s 17 operational coal-fired power stations and are also the nation’s largest coal producers. The two states also dominate Australia’s coal export sectors, with NSW home to the world’s largest coal port while three of the nation’s major liquefied gas export facilities are located in Queensland.
Yet two thirds of those who took part in the poll say renewable energy will be the best source of future employment opportunities with 63% of people in Queensland and 68% in NSW backing the transition to clean energy to drive the future jobs market.
Economist Nicki Hutley, a former partner at Deloitte Access Economics, said the poll shows people in NSW and Queensland understand “the era of coal and gas in this country is coming to a close as the world rapidly decarbonises”.
“They strongly support government investment in new, clean industries that will future-proof jobs and secure our economic prosperity,” she said.
“Significantly, voters recognise that further cuts to carbon emissions – critical if we are to keep global warming in check – will increase jobs and lift economic growth.
“They also think regional areas will benefit the most. However, there is a strong view that there needs to be better support from government for communities that currently rely on fossil fuels in order for them to adjust to the changes.”

The survey found that 60% of people in Queensland and 62% in NSW believe the government’s top investment priority should be in renewables.
In Queensland, 20% backed coal and 15% said gas. In NSW, the figures were 15% for coal and 17% for gas.
Almost two thirds of those polled believe further cuts to carbon emissions will deliver economic benefits to workers (58% in Queensland and 64% in NSW) and to businesses (59% Queensland and 66% NSW).
Six in 10 agree that regional areas will benefit most from the global transition to renewables but only two in 10 say workers who currently rely on fossil fuels are getting enough support to prepare for a decarbonised future (19% in Queensland and 21% in NSW).
Amanda Cahill, chief executive of not-for-profit advisory organisation The Next Economy, said Australia’s transition from fossil fuels to clean new industries presents opportunities for regional areas but they’re crying out for support from government to help them diversify their economies.
“This poll reaffirms what I’ve been hearing on the ground. Workers, businesses and investors are ready to take advantage of the opportunities in the new economy, but they need the government to back them in with clear targets, regional development funding and planning support,” she said.
“The countries we export to are already on the road to net zero emissions and we have a choice – help them do it or lose out on those new export opportunities.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/04/cricket-captain-targets-climate-change-with-rooftop-solar-program/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Cricket captain targets climate change with rooftop solar program,"Australian cricket superstar Pat Cummins on Thursday announced the creation of Cricket for Climate and its solar PV project Solar Clubs, an initiative designed to unlock the solar potential of up to 4,000 community cricket clubs across the nation.
Cummins, the world’s No.1 ranked fast bowler, has gone into bat for climate change, saying Cricket for Climate’s goal is for cricket clubs across Australia to achieve net-zero emissions with “urgent action” needed to reduce emissions.
“It is clear we are not doing enough to reduce carbon pollution, largely from the burning of coal, oil and gas,” he said.
“Scientists are clear we need to at least halve our carbon emissions by 2030 to have any chance of keeping warming to below 2C and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.
“And while sport may not be the obvious or most important reason to tackle climate change, it gives us a window into the kind of future we could be facing.”
Cummins said Cricket for Climate’s first initiative is the installation of 10 kW solar PV systems on the roofs of 15 cricket clubs across Australia.
Chinese PV manufacturing giant LONGi, inverter supplier Sungrow and Australia’s largest solar distributor One Stop Warehouse have donated the solar panels and inverter systems for the first stage of the program.

Cricket for Climate said there is potential to add battery energy storage systems to the solar installs at a later date.
Cummins said the first rooftop system has already been installed at the Penrith Cricket Club in Sydney, where he honed his skills as a junior.
More than a dozen clubs linked to top players, including Cummins’ teammates Steve Smith, David Warner, Mitchell Starc andMarnus Labuschagne and Australian women’s Test cricket vice-captain Rachel Haynes, will follow in the next month.
Cummins said the Solar Clubs program is a win-win situation for the game and for the environment with the clubs to be transformed into energy-generating income positive assets.
“It’ll cut clubs’ power bills and greenhouse gas emissions and produce savings that can be spent on resources and player development,” he said.
“Few countries in the world can match Australia’s extraordinary potential to generate renewable energy like solar and wind power. We’ve got real ambitions; this is just the start.
“We’re looking at all the possibilities and we’re excited about what’s to come.”

Penrith Cricket Club president Paul Goldsmith said the newly installed rooftop system is expected to slash the club’s annual power bill by about $3,000.
“We’re thrilled to be part of this Cricket for Climate Solar Clubs initiative,” he said.
“The annual electricity bill for our club was around $17,000 per year and it’s estimated that, as well as reducing carbon emissions, this new solar system will save us more than $3,000 every year, which can be redirected into much-needed resources and future focussed projects.”
Other clubs set to receive solar panels as part of the first include phase of the program include the Sydney, Northern District, Tamworth and, Sutherland cricket club in NSW and the Cleveland Thornlands club in Queensland.
It’s estimated the roll out of solar panels to the first 15 clubs will be completed in the next six months, with plans to then expand the initiative to include other local clubs around the country.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/04/new-german-leader-proposes-climate-club-that-would-punish-free-riders-like-australia/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,GERMANY",,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",New German leader proposes ‘climate club’ that would punish free riders like Australia,"This year, Germany is the president of the G7 – a key forum for wealthy democracies to discuss solutions to global challenges.
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who replaced long-time leader Angela Merkel in December last year, wants the G7 nations to become founding members of an international “carbon club”. This alliance of countries would coordinate shared climate policy standards and impose costs on countries that don’t meet them.
The proposal should ring alarm bells in Canberra. It is likely to mean economic and diplomatic costs for Australia, and further isolate this nation as a climate laggard on the world stage. To avoid this, Australia should at least match the climate ambition of G7 countries, by pledging to halve greenhouse gas emissions this decade.

The “climate club” concept was developed by Nobel-prize winning economist William Nordhaus in 2015, and has since gained ground in international policy circles.
United Nations climate agreements – such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement – are voluntary. Nordhaus argues this provides an incentive for some nations, overly focused on their own national interests, to seek to minimise their share of the global costs of climate action.
So while responsible nations bear the cost of switching to new, cleaner technologies, the “free-riding” nations benefit from those technologies and a potentially safer climate while failing to make adequate cuts to their own domestic emissions.
To address this problem, Nordhaus proposes a “club” model for climate cooperation. Club members – those countries who move first to take climate action – would be rewarded and protected from competitive disadvantage.
Members would harmonise their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work toward a shared goal. And nations that do not meet their global obligations would incur penalties, such as a levy on exports to club member nations.

In addition to Germany, the G7 comprises the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and Canada.
Just a month after being elected German chancellor, Olaf Scholz announced at the World Economic Forum in January that Germany intends to turn the G7 into the nucleus of an international climate club.
Scholz has been keen on the climate club idea for some time. Last August, as Germany’s finance minister, he proposed an “A-B-C” model that would be:
A G7 climate club could build on the experience of the European Union. The EU already has an internal carbon market and will next year start imposing border levies on imported goods, based on the emissions generated in their production. The highest costs will be borne by exporters from countries that don’t have a carbon price or meaningful climate policy.
Scholz suggests G7 countries could negotiate similar arrangements to those of the EU. The G7 countries will consider Germany’s proposal at ministerial meetings this year.
Climate policy is a key priority for the Biden administration in the US, providing a window of opportunity for positive negotiations.
And there are already moves to set shared standards across the Atlantic. In October last year, the EU and the US announced they were working towards a world-first deal to restrict access to their markets for high-carbon steel.

Australia is widely seen as a free-rider in global climate efforts. While G7 member states have promised to cut their emissions by about 50% this decade, Australia has pledged only to cut emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels.
At last year’s COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Australia was the only major developed country that refused to set a stronger 2030 emissions target. It’s also the only country in the world to have repealed a carbon price.
What’s more, the Morrison government is promoting a “gas-fired” economic recovery from the COVID pandemic. It continues to promote coal and gas exports, and derides the EU’s carbon border levies as protectionism.
Safe to say, if a G7-led climate club formed in the near future, Australia would not be invited to join.
Australia should take Germany’s climate club proposal seriously, and move quickly to implement climate policies that bring us in line with G7 nations.
Otherwise, Australia faces the prospect of economic harm. This would not just come in the form of potential carbon border levies, but also a loss of both investment capital and the economic gains that come from being a first mover in clean industries.

The climate club concept is not without its detractors. Some academics and climate negotiators caution that it could undermine multilateral cooperation in UN climate talks, while others warn such agreements can exacerbate equity issues between richer and poorer nations.
For its part, Germany has suggested climate finance could be provided to help developing countries become club members, and club members could make a phased policy transition.
The proposed G7 climate club marks a major shift in global efforts on climate change. Major powers now view climate action as a race for competitive advantage. The first movers in the new industrial revolution will take first, second and third prize.
If Australia wants to stay in the race, much more ambitious federal climate policy is urgently needed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/04/melbourne-airport-lands-on-solar-strategy-as-part-of-net-zero-ambition/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022",Melbourne Airport lands on solar strategy as part of net zero ambition,"Melbourne Airport has committed to continued investment in renewable energy generation after officially opening a 12 MW solar farm which is expected to produce enough clean energy to power all four of the airport’s passenger terminals.
Comprising an estimated 30,000 solar panels spread across about 192,000 square metres under the approach to the north-south runway, the new solar farm is expected to generate 17 GWh of renewable electricity every year, equating to almost 15% of the airport’s annual electricity consumption.
But that target is set to be eclipsed in the coming years with Melbourne Airport chief of infrastructure Simon Gandy declaring that by the end of the decade more than 50% of the airport’s energy needs will be met by on-site solar generation.
Gandy said the continued investment in renewable energy forms part of the airport’s commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2025.
“While our primary job is to move passengers and freight safely and efficiently around Australia and the world, we are committed to doing so in a way that is environmentally responsible,” he said.
“We know that achieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025 is ambitious, but we also recognise that we need to take big steps to tackle the challenges we face as a global society.
“We will achieve our target by reducing our energy footprint through operational and technology efficiencies and sourcing our future energy demands through renewable energy generation.
“This means that by 2030 we expect to have more than 50% of our energy needs met by expanding our on-site solar generation facilities, with the remainder of our energy requirements procured through dedicated power purchasing agreements directly linked to high-quality solar and wind farm developments in Victoria.”

Gandy said in addition to the Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets, the airport is also developing a strategy for Scope 3 emissions, working closely with airline and ground transport partners, airport tenants and broader supply chain to reduce emissions across the aviation industry.
The first element of that strategy has already been delivered with a 2 MWdc rooftop solar system recently installed atop Agility Logistics’ new headquarters in the Melbourne Airport Business Park.
The system, featuring more than 4,000 solar panels spread across approximately 30,000 square metres of roof, will connect into the airport’s embedded network.
The new 12 MW solar farm was developed by Beon Energy Solutions contracted with Next Generation Electrical. The team used Canadian Solar monofacial panels mounted on a fixed ground racking system specifically selected to avoid glare in the vicinity of the airport’s runways.
Melbourne Airport chief of ground transport Jai McDermott said airport management had capitalised on flight cancellations caused by Covid-19 to install the panels with construction taking just over six months to complete.
“While the airport was definitely quiet on most days through the pandemic, we were able to crack on with a great project,” he said.

Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio has praised the introduction of the solar farm.
“This very much fits in with our government’s own ambitions when it comes to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and importantly, halving our emissions by 2030,” she said.
“It shows what you can achieve when you make a decision, you set yourself clear ambition and you take actions that can be seen and replicated.”
Melbourne Airport’s new solar farm is one of the largest behind-the-meter solar installations in the country, and the largest at any of the nation’s airports.
Brisbane Airport is home to 6 MW of solar, 5 MW of which is installed on its rooftops, while 1 MW is ground mounted, while Darwin Airport is continuing to build out its renewable generation capacity.
Darwin Airport announced last year work had begun on a 4 MW rooftop install across four buildings at the site. The $5 million project was to complement two existing solar farms and rooftop systems totalling 6 MW, which last year produced more than 8 MWh of renewable energy, enough to support 84% of the airport’s operations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/04/india-targets-domestic-production-with-40-pv-import-duty-boost-to-manufacturing-linked-incentive/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 4, 2022","India targets domestic production with 40% PV import duty, boost to manufacturing-linked incentive","From pv magazine India
India’s Union Budget shows the government’s determination to promote domestic solar manufacturing, as it includes increased incentives and supportive policies, while discouraging imports by introducing customs duties on PV modules and solar cells from April.
The budget allocates an additional INR 19,500 crore ($3.6 billion) to the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which offers funding support to bidders who commit to setting up fabs to produce everything from polysilicon to PV modules on Indian soil.
“The move is aimed to facilitate domestic manufacturing for the nation’s ambitious goal of 280GW of installed solar capacity by 2030,” said Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
The minister said newly incorporated manufacturers will have an extra year to be eligible for a 15% concessional tax rate before the start of production, with the deadline extended to the end of March 2024.
Solar manufacturers will benefit from the removal of anti-dumping and countervailing duties applied to foreign-made stainless steel, coated steel products, bars of alloy steel, and high-speed steel, with the government citing the high price of the metals on the international market.
Developers who used imported solar cells and modules will have to brace themselves for the imposition of a 40% basic customs duty on non-Indian solar modules, and a 25% rate on cells from April 1, in response to demands from Indian solar manufacturers.
Sitharaman also announced the launch of sovereign green bonds. The government will support the development of domestic capacity in green energy generation and clean mobility via “supportive policies, light-touch regulations, and facilitative actions,” said the minister. Government contributions will be made to these “sunrise opportunities,” said Sitharaman, without offering specifics.
To help foster e-mobility, the minister said energy storage projects would enjoy the benefits of being designated as infrastructure assets – including access to cheap finance. The government will also establish special mobility zones with zero fossil-fuel and battery swapping policies.
“Considering the constraint of space in urban areas for setting up charging stations at scale, a battery swapping policy will be brought out and interoperability standards will be formulated,” said Sitharaman. “The private sector will be encouraged to develop sustainable and innovative business models for “battery or energy as a service.” This will improve efficiency in the EV [electric vehicle] ecosystem.”
Sumant Sinha, the chairman and chief executive of Nasdaq-listed Indian renewables developer ReNew Power, hailed the budget as climate-friendly.
“The budget lays the groundwork for India’s ambition to become a net-zero country by 2070,” he said. “The government has very firmly put [the] energy transition and clean energy at the heart of India’s economic growth and looks to address some of the most challenging aspects of this transition.”
The PLI tender to support the gigawatt-scale production of high-efficiency solar modules received bids for 54.5GW of solar equipment annual manufacturing capacity last year, with several bidders put on the waiting list. Today’s additional budget allocation will ensure more manufacturers are supported by the scheme.
Sinha said the revocation of anti-dumping duty on steel will reduce the cost of modules considerably and tie in well with incentives for locally incorporated manufacturing entities, which will be able to start manufacturing by March 31, 2024. The definition of grid storage as infrastructure assets will help mobility startups and independent power providers explore low-cost financing, he added.
The clean power executive also welcomed the budget announcement on sovereign green bonds, saying they will help mobilize finance for electricity distribution companies as well as for clean energy investors.
Vineet Mittal, chairman of fellow renewables developer Avaada Group, said the Union Budget will make it easier to invest in Indian clean power.
“The industry was eagerly waiting for these reforms to increase its competitiveness and take the growth of the sector to the next level and become self-reliant in renewable energy. The government has shown its commitment to become self-reliant in module manufacturing and battery storage,” he said.
Gyanesh Chaudhary, the vice chairman and managing director of module manufacturer Vikram Solar, welcomed the additional PLI allocation.
“The sovereign green bonds will boost green infrastructure development which will help in meeting India’s carbon emission reduction targets,” he added. “Green bonds will also enable an international yield curve for Indian corporates, leading to better pricing for bonds. The battery-swapping policy, with interoperability standards, will boost the electric vehicle ecosystem.”
Chaudhary told pv magazine that he appreciated the government’s focus on strengthening the domestic solar industry by notifying the basic customs duties on solar products.
“We are confident, with the implementation and roll-out of the measures announced in Budget 2022, we will move closer towards realizing the aatmanirbhar Bharat vision in the solar sector, and India’s energy security through green power,” he said.
Bharat Bhut, co-founder and director of Gujarati PV manufacturer Goldi Solar said the budget has given indigenous manufacturers several “reasons to cheer.” He said that implementing a 40% basic customs duty on solar modules “will ensure the growth of the entire domestic manufacturing ecosystem.”
However, he said the application criteria applied to the PLI program should be changed so all sizes of business can participate.
“All of these measures will result in a more robust domestic module supply,” he concluded.
