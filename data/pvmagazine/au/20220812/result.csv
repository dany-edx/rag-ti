Council has this week unveiled a solar and battery storage system installed at the Yeppoon Sewage Treatment Plant, where it is expected to deliver a power saving of close to 70%.
“The solar power plant is estimated to generate power equivalent to the annual power consumption of about 90 households,” Councillor Andrea Friend said, adding the plant can be completely powered by the solar facility during daylight hours, while directing any surplus to battery storage for use during the night.
“For back-up power supply in less favourable conditions, the plant can revert back to the electricity grid if needed.
“There is also the capacity for expansion of the facility to accommodate increased demand.”
Further north, Cairns Regional Council has signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland government-owned generator CleanCo for 100% renewable electricity to power its sites.
The council has signed a 10-year PPA with CleanCo, with the majority of council’s electricity supply to be sourced from the Kaban Green Power Hub wind farm near Ravenshoe, with the remainder coming from other clean energy sources across Queensland.
Council said the PPA builds on its existing investments in 3 MW of on-site solar.

In New South Wales (NSW), a group of 16 councils have inked a new PPA, signing a renewable energy deal with the Australian arm of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola.
From 1 January 2023, the group of 16 councils in the Central NSW and Riverina regions will source renewable energy to power their large sites and streetlighting as part of an eight-year contract. The clean energy will be supplied from the Bodangora Wind Farm near Wellington and the Flyers Creek Wind Farm being constructed south of Orange when it becomes operational.
Central NSW Joint Organisation chair and Cabonne Mayor Kevin Beatty said the buying power of 16 councils was substantial.
“Collectively, the Central NSW region will source around 78% of its electricity for councils’ large sites and streetlighting from renewable energy under this deal. This is a huge win for the region,” he said.
In Victoria, the City of Greater Bendigo has teamed with Solar Recovery Corporation to help address growing concerns about how best to dispose of decommissioned or end-of-life solar panels.
With more than 100,000 tonnes of solar panel waste predicted to enter Australia’s waste streams by 2035, the council has established dedicated drop-off points at its Eaglehawk Landfill and the Strathfieldsaye and Heathcote transfer stations where residents can now dispose of solar panels for recycling for free.
“Materials that can be recovered from old solar panels include glass, plastic, silicon, copper and aluminium and all solar panels dropped off … will be collected and processed in Australia by Solar Recovery Corporation,” council said. “This material can be recovered from old solar panels for re-use in local manufacturing streams.”
Council said the free service is available to residents only and not commercial operators.

“WA’s EV fast-charging network is an important step to boost our uptake of electric vehicles, enabling drivers to travel the vast distances around the State more easily,” premier Mark McGowan said in a statement.
“When completed, WA’s EV fast-charging network will be the world’s longest of its kind – with construction well underway and expected to be completed by early 2024.”
The project will entail the deployment of 98 EV chargers at 49 locations along major transport routes. On average, charging stations will be less than 200km apart. Each location will have both a standard and 150 kW(dc) fast charger installed, the latter allowing drivers to recharge their EV in as little as 15 minutes.
Jet Charge chief executive Tim Washington said the network would allow EV drivers to travel throughout the state without any range anxiety.
“We started Jet Charge almost a decade ago to accelerate the transition to low-emissions vehicles in Australia by breaking down the barriers to EV charging,” he said. “We are so proud to be involved with a landmark EV charging network that features a lot of Australian-made innovation, and will absolutely smash those barriers allowing people to drive EVs all over the great state of Western Australia.”

Brisbane-based Renewable Energy Partners (REP) said it would also be exploring opportunities to co-locate solar PV and a battery energy storage system within the project area.
“We are excited to be developing another large-scale renewable energy project in the Western Downs region of Queensland,” REP chief executive officer Luke McDonald said.
“Having received strong support from both the Queensland government and the Western Downs Council for our other renewable energy projects in the area, we are encouraged to support the Western Downs region becoming the renewable energy powerhouse of Australia.”
REP said the Wandoan project would comprise up to 96 wind turbines across a 14,000-hectare site. The developer said that during the feasibility phase for the wind project it would investigate the potential to deploy solar PV and a battery energy storage system as part of the project. Once operational, the asset will produce enough renewable energy to power up to 172,000 homes.
It is anticipated the project will create 250 jobs during construction and 22 jobs during ongoing operations.
The unveiling of the project comes just months after REP announced its Warrego solar and storage project, which it says will include a 180 MW solar farm to potentially be co-located with a 50 MW/200 MWh big battery.
The Wandoan project is REP’s fifth renewable development in the Western Downs region. It is also developing the 250 MW Hopeland Solar Farm, the 150 MW/300 MWh Ulinda Park battery project, and the 500 MW Wambo wind farm in the area.

The concept of an energy system powered by 100% renewable energy is nothing new, but still tends to be met with vocal skepticism from a minority, as a quick look at the comments section on this site could show.
However, a growing body of literature has been published that outlines the clear possibility of such a system and the technologies and investments it would require. A group of energy researchers, led by Christian Breyer of Finland’s Lappeenranta University, has conducted an extensive review of this literature, going back to Bent Sorenson’s 1975 paper “Energy and Resources,” published in Science. The group notes that since 2010, the number of published studies showing that 100% renewable energy can be achieved by 2050 has grown by 27% each year.
“A quickly increasing number of researchers conclude that the entire energy system demand can be met based on renewables,” said Breyer. “Doing so will actually be cheaper in the long term, while fulfilling sustainability requirements.”
The review paper, “On the History and Future of 100% Renewable Energy Systems Research,” was recently published in IEEE Access. It charts the historic milestones in the research up to its present- day status, and additionally seeks to address the major criticisms that continue to be leveled at it, including the cost, intermittent generation, materials, and current requirement for fossil-fuel energy to power manufacturing of renewable energy, among others.
The paper also addresses the “institutional inertia” of large agencies. It singles out the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for particular criticism, on claims that they are slow to adopt the latest research demonstrating the possibilities of renewable energy technology.
“According to the United Nations, over 160 firms with US$70 trillion (AU$98 trillion) in assets are committed to decarbonise the global economy, which means phasing out fossil fuels by 2050. Our research has shown that we have the technologies to implement a global energy supply based entirely on renewable energy,” said Dr. Sven Teske, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney. “The science clearly shows that a global 100% renewable energy supply is technically and economically possible. The next step is for our research to be included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s assessment reports, which are currently based on outdated energy scenario research.”
The paper shows that most of the literature on 100% renewables favours solar and wind as the primary generation sources, but there is less consensus on the optimal split between the two.
“In most transition pathways, solar energy and wind power increasingly emerge as the central pillars of a sustainable energy system combined with energy efficiency measures,” the paper said. “Cost-optimisation modelling and greater resource availability tend to lead to higher solar photovoltaic shares, while emphasis on energy supply diversification tends to point to higher wind power contributions.”
And with both wind and solar well established and available, more recent research has moved focus to the less-known areas, and particularly the more difficult sectors to electrify.
“Recent research has focused on the challenges and opportunities regarding grid congestion, energy storage, sector coupling, electrification of transport and industry implying power-to-X and hydrogen-to-X, and the inclusion of natural and technical carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches,” Breyer said. “The result is a holistic vision of the transition towards a net-negative greenhouse gas emissions economy that can limit global warming to 1.5 C with a clearly defined carbon budget in a sustainable and cost-effective manner based on 100% renewable energy-industry-CDR systems.”
While congratulatory about the achievements this field has made since its beginnings almost 50 years ago, the group notes that there is still work to be done, reminding readers that no major 100% renewables study has yet included carbon dioxide removal technology, and potential issues of social justice, community disagreement and environmental degradation are not often taken into account by the models.
“The technologies are already there. The substantial evidence presented is already also empirical evidence in several regions and countries. The ability to exploit synergies across energy efficiency, electrification, district heating and electrofuels is certainly proven,” added Brian V. Mathiesen of Denmark’s Aalborg University. “Now decision makers have to stop all new investments in fossil fuels and focus on creating renewable energy based smart energy systems.”

SMA Solar Technology AG had a difficult first half of 2022. The persistent supply difficulties with electronic components have affected the development of the company’s sales and earnings, as seen in its latest figures released on Thursday.
In the first half of the year, SMA sold PV inverters with a total power of around 5.8 GW – about one gigawatt less than in the first half of 2021. Sales fell from €488.3 million (AU$709 million) to €471.9 million (AU$685 million)year-on-year.
In particular, sales in the Home Solutions segment were lower because the high demand could not be met due to the shortage of materials. In the Commercial & Industrial Solutions and Large Scale Project Solutions segments, the higher prices ensured that sales remained at the previous year’s level despite lower sales.
SMA’s consolidated earnings were negative in the first half of the year. After a profit of €13.3 million (AU$19.3 million) in the same period last year, this time there was a loss of €10.6 million (AU$15.4 million).
Despite the losses, the SMA Managing Board confirmed the March forecast for the 2022 fiscal year. The company expects sales of between €900 million and €1 billion (AU$1.3 – $1.4 billion) and before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) of between €10 million and €60 million (AU$15 – $87 million). In the first half of 2022, EBITDA was €16 million (AU$23 million).
In the meantime, SMA is issuing “a series of measures to improve its long-term ability to deliver,” said SMA Chief Executive Officer Jürgen Reinert. This includes the construction of a new gigawatt factory at the Kassel site, which is intended to double the company’s production capacity by 2024 in response to the growing demand for PV inverters and storage solutions.
“Our order intake is developing positively. But the continued tight delivery situation is having a significant toll on the development of sales and earnings,” said Reinert, adding, “As in numerous other industries, the difficulties relating to the supply of electronic components are also affecting European inverter manufacturers, illustrating once again the dependency of global supply chains on the Asian markets. We are expecting a significant improvement of the overall situation and profitable sales growth from 2023 onwards.”
