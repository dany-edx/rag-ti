With 7.2 kWh of storage and 6 kW of power, Decarbon Venture says its products are the most powerful mobile generators on the market today and outdo gas rivals.
“They are also much lighter and less expensive to operate than equivalent gas-powered generators,” Decarbon Venture cofounder Geoff Eldwood said.

The DCV AirBase ecosystem, as it is dubbed, includes foldable 400W solar panels which connect to a semi-solid state battery. The storage component is modular and comes in three variations:
In terms of pricing, the Airbase Quad comes it at USD 6500 ($9,670), and the Duo product at USD 3299 ($4,900).
The system is designed for car camping, boating, off-grid living, and potentially home backups. This is a highly popular market segment among Chinese manufacturers, with a multitude of such products on display at the Smart Energy Conference in May.

Decarbon Venture’s, however, emphasises its Australian-outback readiness – which is a decidedly tough natural environmental. 
The company also says it is the first such product to allow batteries to be removed and replaced with fresh batteries without powering down. “I wanted to build an evergreen solution that uses modular power cells that can be swapped when needed, and can be scaled up or down,” Elwood said.
Decarbon Venture’s family of AirBase generators will be sold first as a Kickstarter campaign in late August 2023, and can be distributed globally.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/27/how-much-will-australia-realistically-achieve-with-its-critical-minerals/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 27, 2023",How much will Australia realistically achieve with its critical minerals?,"By the end of 2024, Western Australia’s Minister for Mines and Energy, Bill Johnston, says the state will account for 10% of the world’s lithium hydroxide demand. By 2028, that figure is expected hit 20%, as planned refineries complete commissioning.
Building on that, Matt Dusci, acting CEO of miner-cum-critical materials processor IGO, says by 2030, Australia will be producing approximately the same amount of lithium hydroxide as China does today.
The path there, however, is not easy. Speaking at the WA Renewables and Critical Minerals Superpower Summit held in Perth on Monday, Dusci described the shift from ore exporter to refined material exporter alone as a “astronomical jump for us [Australia].”
In 2022, IGO and its joint venture partner Tianqi Lithium Corporation from China claimed to produce Australia’s first commercial quantities of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at its Kwinana Lithium Hydroxide Refinery. Meanwhile, in April the company announced plans for another facility, this time to produce precursor material for cathodes in lithium-ion batteries alongside billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Wyloo Metals.

This is to say, IGO has a unique vantage point, having gone through the process of building a critical minerals processing plant in Australia as well as planning a higher value precursor plant – an approach which is increasingly being touted as the nation’s path to staying economically relevant in the global energy transition.
Dusci described the process as “incredibly challenging here.”
“Yes, we can compete. We can compete on operating cost, we can compete on a safe and reliance jurisdiction, we can compete on ESG, we can compete when it comes to having a true cost on carbon when producing. Where we struggle is capital. Capital cost is a lot cheaper [elsewhere].”
Dusci’s fellow panelists Tim Buckley, Director of Climate Energy Finance; Cameron Perks, Principal Analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence; Mark Urbani, Founder of Renewable Metals; Joanna Kay, General Manager of Zero Carbon Hydrogen Australia at the Smart Energy Council; and Kirk McDonald, Project Manager at Supercharge Australia, all pointed towards challenges with the flow of capital in Australia in one form or another.

Part of the issue Dusci sees with securing capital comes down to the fact that refining critical minerals and processing materials is a new industry in Australia, so it is classed as a risky venture. He pointed out that in counties like Korea and China, where these types of industrial ecosystems are well established, such barriers are far more easily overcome.
To that end, the cost for Albemarle, a US giant which is also seeking to process lithium in Australia, to set up its refinery in Australia was estimated by Cameron Perks of reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence to be twice as expensive as it would be in China. 
Perks also pointed to China’s Tianqi, which he said had tried to replicate its successful Chinese plant model in Kwinana, Western Australia with little success due to the significant regulatory differences between the two countries, and the lack of expertise here.*
Coming back to Monday’s panel, Dusci’s view is that Australian governments need to step in to offset some of the risk associated with the nascent industry. As an audience member pointed out, most of the countries in, or moving into, this space have been heavily subsidised or supported by their governments, including China, Korea, Japan, and increasingly the US and Europe. 

The level of support being offered by international governments at the moment is to such a degree that finance analyst Tim Buckley said the market could really no longer be classed as “free.”
This, Dusci said, throws up another huge barrier for Australia’s prospects. “We can definitely get over some of the challenges in the free market. We can’t compete in deploying capital in Western Australia or Australia if it isn’t a free market and there are other incentives that attract that capital elsewhere.”
Given the challenges that come with just refining, is it plausible for Australia to even pursue actual battery manufacturing, panel chair James Choi questioned.
For something like the electric vehicle (EV) market, battery manufacturing will be done near to where the cars are actually manufactured, Dusci said. The advantages of this hub type of model were echoed by other panelists. (In the Queensland government’s critical mineral strategy, released on Tuesday, it appears to be following a zoned model too.)

“The exception will be static storage,” Dusci added. “Static storage is another area where Australia can play.” Unlike the lithium-based batteries used in transport, the shape and chemistries of stationary storage or grid-scale batteries is still being decided. That is, there are a number of viable looking technologies vying to gain dominance, and it is still not clear what will come out on top.
Buckley of Climate Energy Finance pointed out Australia could also have an opportunity when it comes to heavy haulage electric trucks, since as a nation we command much of the market via our mining industry. “In heavy haulage vehicles, Australia is number two,” he said.
Perks’ view was less optimistic. “Who actually knows how to build a battery plant in Australia?” he questioned.
For Buckley, the way to set up the industry here would be through deep partnerships with Korean, Chinese or other countries with established battery manufacturers.
“But can you physically bring the people here to build the plant and ramp it up?” Perks responded.
“We are five or 10 years behind on that expertise. Let’s not pretend like Korea or Japan or China don’t have far more experienced engineers in this area. But we have the best miners in the world, and we’re going to have the best renewables in the world,” Buckley said.
Here Perks again pointed to Tianqi’s difficulties finding the necessary labour force in Australia to realise its vision.*
Image: Accenture
This brought the discussion to a crucial junction: Australia’s acute lack of people to actually carry out these projects.
“We simply won’t have the labour force or the skills to build these new industries,” James Choi said. “So there needs to be a policy response to acknowledge the fact we either need to nurture the skillsets here in Australia… and if we can’t build the skillsets here in Australia, we have to acknowledge that we do have to have more flexible work and immigration policies to allow skilled workers to build these new industries.”
“If we want to have a hydrogen industry, if we want to battery industry, I think we need to have a sensible discussion about skilled work in take in Australia without inflaming the political dynamics,” he added.
Again, this point was echoed across the panel. As Buckley pointed out, the global energy transition is a race and the rest of the world is treating it as such. Part of that race is about securing expertise. Australia isn’t the only country needing more engineers and other skilled workers – and other countries seem well ahead in recognising this.

Australia is also losing its entrepreneurs and innovations, Kirk McDonald of Supercharge Australia, which works with startups, pointed out. “The money is coming thick and fast for them to leave, for them to go overseas,” he said. If the “brain drain” phenomenon was once limited to countries with low GDPs, it is now coming for countries like Australia which continue to lack boldness and ambition in its future focus.
With the Australian federal government currently developing an ‘Australian Made Battery Plan’, Choi asked panelists what they each thought would be most helpful to overcome the outlined challenges.
Tim Buckley responded: “I think we should phase out cap and diesel fuel rebates and so we stop creating a headwind for the option of electrification, and then redeploy that capital back into investing for the future.” He noted that the Australian National Audit office in 1996 actually described this policy as a “counter productive strategy,” and Buckley urged governments to finally take their own pertinent advice.
For Joanna Kay, the most important step is to rethink skilled migration. “I’ve seen countries like India, for example, really eagerly seeking those Australian resources, so I’ve seen it on the other side, and they’ve been able to really actively engage in and have those JVs. There’s no reason why we can’t do that. We have to be competitive… we need the man or woman power on the ground to get it done.”
For Dusci, it came down to developing industrial hubs to deal with refining and manufacturing plants, as well as incentivising industries to deal with waste streams. “But ultimately, [we need to] create an environment where government does share some of the risk.”
Renewables Metal’s founder Mark Urbani said we need to start looking now at incentivising consumers and industry to recycle batteries – which are a valuable source of critical minerals – as well as disincentivizing companies from exporting only the lowest possible derivatives of materials.
McDonald’s message was clear: we need more capital. Specifically, governments need to become far less skittish about investing in the future and recognise what is at stake. “We need to make batteries for our own security purposes,” he said. What to invest in our country’s future should not be an ‘if’ but a question of how much, he said.

What becomes possible within a newly designed energy system is difficult to predict – and so exactly could happen to these systems in a cyberattack involves an element of imagination.
What is certain is that as new technologies emerge, so too do new potential attack surfaces. “There’s probably truth is what everyone is saying, from people that say ‘you shouldn’t worry about it,’ all the way through to, ‘it’s the biggest threat since cybersecurity was invented,’” Wattwatcher’s Chief Innovation Officer, Grace Young, told pv magazine Australia. 
“Does it need the kind of lockdown ‘we shouldn’t do anything’ kind of mentality we sometimes see? No. But we do need to put measures in place,” she added.

In Young’s eyes, one of the most consequential changes in Australia’s DER cybersecurity landscape is the proliferation of devices capable of controlling residential energy systems, like rooftop solar. As noted in part one, the inverters of new solar systems in South Australia will be required to have software capable of dynamically controlling household solar exports from July 1. That is, the inverters will receive instructions based on network conditions and will adjust system output accordingly.
Victoria will introduce a similar mandate from March 2024, and Western Australia is also travelling this path. Queensland has also mandated a form of solar export control, though its technology choice appears to remain more of a blunt switch off tool like that already imposed in other states.
Given the success of South Australian trials in dynamic exports, the mandates have largely been welcomed and are expected to significantly improve overall solar export capacities.

Greater control, however, brings with it greater consequences should that control fall into the hands of a nefarious player. “My understanding is that if they were controlled in a certain way, they could certainly cause grid instability, knocking out blocks, critical infrastructure, all kinds of different things,” Young said.
To be clear – these kinds of consequences could be possible only when control devices are widespread, which is not the case today. Young estimates Australia only hosts a small number of control devices at the moment, perhaps a couple of thousand.
“As we talk today, it is not a massive threat,” she said. But in the next year as these mandates come into force, “then we’ve now got three states where every single solar system that has been installed is controllable. Suddenly the threat is much larger.”
“In about two to three years I think there will be a critical mass [of controllable systems].” If Australia roughly installs around 350,000 rooftop solar systems per year, depending on how many states introduce control mandates, this could see Australia have anywhere from 750,000 to over a million controllable systems installed within three years. “So we are talking about a massive increase in controlled devices just looking purely at solar,” Young said.

“In an event where we are wanting to curtail solar and somebody blocks that signal – that could cause grid disruptions and all kinds of issues,” she added. This could also permanently damage critical grid infrastructure, as well as household appliances.
Then there is the possibility of a wide-scale takeover of a raft of control devices to create grid instability, potentially leading to blackouts which could range anywhere from annoying and brief to something more serious.
“What if it’s more targeted and you’ve got nefarious players involved? What if there are other attacks going on at the same time?” Young questioned.
Young also noted neighbourhood or community batteries are rapidly connecting to Australia’s grid, used as a tool to control frequency and voltage and maintain grid stability. “What happens if someone turns that against the grid and uses that to disrupt the grid? These are really serious problems.”
“I can see it becoming quite a serious threat in certain contexts and circumstances if it was done nefariously and, therefore, yes we absolutely have to take it seriously.”
Image: Ausgrid
On the individual level, nefarious control of these devices could cause big disruptions for households in the form of ‘denial of service’ attacks. That is, electricity access and hot water systems could be disrupted and, if the house was a smart home, it could impact a whole range of appliances and other devices. “Is it more a nuisance or serious threat? I don’t know if we can say that. There are probably really legitimate threats in amongst all of that,” Young said.
“The solution is not to not remotely control [DER systems]… but certainly some security is necessary to ensure the information and control remains in the right actor’s hands,” Sunwiz founder and managing director, Wawrick Johnston, told pv magazine Australia.
Johnston also pointed to the potential consequences in the event of the considerably more likely event of a data hack. 
Data hacks are commonplace today, and when it comes to energy data very particular things can be exposed. That is, energy data reveals when someone is at home and likely also how many people are in a household at any given time. 
Devices should take measures to de-identify this data, Young noted. “When it is de-identified data and you can’t trace it back to a household or a premises, it is far less threat as to the exposure of that information.”
“So there are risks associated specifically with energy data and its exposure, but we feel at a general level, they are quite manageable and fairly low risk when you compare them against things like control mechanisms,” she added.
In its report on the cybersecurity findings from DER marketplace demonstration ProjectEDGE, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) flags that cyberattacks in the DER space could easily go unnoticed.
“The DER marketplace is designed to have bi-directional flow of information with each single entity having significant amount of customer and operational data at a given point in time… Lack of consolidated visibility over malicious activity and security incidents across the DER Marketplace, could lead to such activity going unnoticed for a long period of time which could affect the confidentiality and availability of data across the DER Marketplace,” the report says.
AEMO also notes, “due to the interconnected-ness of the marketplace, a compromise of a single entity could have significant impacts across the DER marketplace.”
As an antidote, AEMO suggests far greater testing of DER devices and systems, risk detection processes and recovery processes, to name a few.
Grace Young will present the talk ‘A real-time marketplace for energy data: How do we strike a workable balance between open, proprietary, industry, customer, private and secure?‘ at EnergyNext in Sydney on July 19, 2023.

The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), OPIS’ benchmark assessment for modules from China, dived to USD 0.173 per W, falling for a fourth week running to its lowest value ever according to OPIS data. In the aftermath of Intersolar Europe, the market must reckon with clear signals that the region is oversupplied with modules, as well as how China polysilicon prices upstream are very close to their floor.
The 11.73% week-on-week plunge is also record-breaking in being CMM’s largest percentage drop ever.
It comes as OPIS contacts, during and since Intersolar, have almost unanimously highlighted that prices are falling fast and hard. The majority saw prices in the USD 0.170-0.175/W range, with numbers as low as USD 0.150/W heard. Some did not share prices as they assessed the degree of the drop.

With a similar unanimity, market players also lamented the overstocked state of Europe’s module inventories, which face falling values and which curtail further shipments. Europe installed a record 46.1 GW of solar power in 2022, according to a SolarPower Europe report. But around 85 GW of modules were shipped there last year, with the remainder ending up in warehouses owned by Chinese companies across Europe, according to a veteran market observer.
Given these modules represent 2022’s much-higher-than-present prices, it is better to get them sold now, before prices fall further and companies risk losing even more, the veteran added.
A continent away from Europe, China polysilicon prices have plummeted to CNY63.5 ($13.23)/kg, on the threshold of the CNY60/kg figure OPIS contacts generally consider the material’s cost figure. It is a “common consensus” that this market now faces overcapacity, said one source, who added that China’s tier-1 manufacturers alone have more than 100,000 MT of polysilicon stockpiled.
Looking ahead and in light of these bearish factors, module prices are expected to keep sliding, with one source expecting them to stabilise in the next quarter after the polysilicon and wafer segments have hit their cash cost.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/27/solar-driven-photoreactors-to-generate-hydrogen-on-rooftops/,"HYDROGEN,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 27, 2023",Solar-driven photoreactors to generate hydrogen on rooftops,"From pv magazine Global
A research team led by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany has developed panel-like photoreactors that use a water-splitting photocatalyst to produce hydrogen on rooftops or dedicated solar farms.
“Various photocatalysts are now known,” said Paul Kant from the Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT) at KIT. “They can be used, for example, to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, or to produce climate-neutral fuels from water and carbon dioxide.”
The proposed systems mimic the photosynthesis process and use a photocatalyst to drive the required chemical reaction for the electrolysis. The photoreactors contain the photocatalyst and the materials for the chemical reaction themselves.
“The design method and base design are applicable to any sunlight-harvesting liquid, gas, or heterogeneous multi-phase photocatalytic system,” the scientists stated. “To ensure comparability with other approaches, however, the design method and the resulting photoreactor are demonstrated experimentally with the established, commercially available, and reliable potassium iron(III) oxalate photocatalytic system.”
The photoreactor is made of hundreds of parallel reaction channels, with each of them embedding a V-shaped concentrator and a tube-like cavity. The V-shaped concentrator harvests light from various incident directions and drives it into a tube-like, mirrored cavity, enclosing the reaction volume. “The photoreactor should ideally conduct incoming sunlight to the photocatalyst with little loss, regardless of the direction it is coming from or where the sun is in the sky,” said Kant.
The microstructured polymer panels are coated with aluminium for high reflectivity and, according to the German group, enable both optimal operating conditions and efficient light transport to the photocatalyst over the entire course of the day.
The researchers believe that this system configuration may lead to the manufacturing of low-cost, high-efficiency in the near future.
“Being made from three polymer parts only, all produced via established mass-manufacturing techniques, the material cost of the reactor components is estimated to be in the range of [USD] 9.4 $ m2,” they explained. “Including a catalyst worth USD 1 million ($1.5m)per tonne, the material cost estimate of the photoreactor system increases to roughly [USD] 22 $ m2.”
They presented the novel concept in the study “Low-cost photoreactors for highly photon/energy-efficient solar-driven synthesis,” which was recently published in Joule. The research team includes academics from the University of Toronto in Canada.
“Further optimisation of the photoreactor should address the manufacturing of the key components in polymers and the consideration of real-world aspects such as aging of polymers and optical coatings, as well as challenges such as dust accumulation in the rather complicated surface of the photoreactor aperture,” they concluded.
