Enphase Energy, Inc. completed the previously announced acquisition of ClipperCreek, a California-based specialist in electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions for residential and commercial customers in the U.S.  ClipperCreek has been a pioneer in the EV charging market since 2006 and sold more than 110,000 Level 2 AC charging stations since its inception.
Home EV charging stations have wide implications for home energy management, as households not only consume significantly more power with an EV, but the charging units have a large battery that can be used for both backup and grid services.
This acquisition accelerates the Enphase roadmap to enable bi-directional charging capability for vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid applications. Enphase also establishes a domestic manufacturing footprint, as ClipperCreek has manufacturing facilities in Auburn, CA.
“EV adoption is quickly gaining momentum with sales expected to grow more than 40% annually in the U.S. over the next five years. We look forward to working with the talented team from ClipperCreek to develop smart EV charging solutions and integrating them into our home energy systems,” said said Badri Kothandaraman, president and CEO of Enphase Energy.

State-owned electricity company Horizon Power on Monday announced it had installed another 19 standalone power systems (SPS) units just east of Esperance, with another 26 to be operational in the region by March.
SPS units are powered predominantly by solar coupled with battery storage, though they also include a diesel generator. Western Australia, in all its vastness, has embraced the off-grid systems wholeheartedly. 
For the state, the systems are not only cleaner, but are also substantially cheaper and easier to maintain over their lifetime than the traditional poles and wires connected to a centralised generator setup.
Boundary Power
The state has successfully installed hundreds of similar units in the last five years, with the McGowan government pledging to install 1,000 more during its re-election campaign last March.
The total 45 units to be installed in Esperance will be delivered by Horizon Power and its state-owned partner Boundary Power as part of a $10 million state government ‘Renew the Regions’ program. 
Horizon Power says the installations will result in many large, commercial farms at the fringes of the company’s overhead network transitioning to off-grid power. According to Horizon, SPS units have proven “very attractive” to farmers operating large equipment since they no longer need to navigate around electrical infrastructure during seeding and harvesting.
So far, the rollout of SPS has enabled over 200 kilometres of powerlines to be removed from private paddocks. Horizon Power’s next rollout will result in an additional 120 kilometres being removed.
Western Power
Standalone power systems were first installed in Esperance, however, in response to an entirely different, though particularly Australian hazard: bushfires. In 2015, bushfires in the region destroyed electricity infrastructure. In response, off-grid units were deployed. These proved more reliable electricity generators for customers, and also decreased the risk of fires caused by farming machinery connecting with the overhead networks.
Horizon Power has been allocated $45.8 million to install 150 SPS systems in regional Western Australia over the next three years. 
The remaining 850 government-pledged SPS systems will be delivered by Western Power over five years. Western Power is also government-owned, though it focuses on providing electricity to customers in WA’s main grid, the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), while Horizon focuses on the state’s regions and remote communities.
Western Power estimates it could rollout more than 6,000 SPS units in its service area in the coming decades. Likewise, Horizon is putting the off-grid model at the centre of its vision for its future network.

Last week, the Australian government posted the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) referral for the project, inviting the public to comment until January 18. Formal planning applications following on from the company’s now-complete preliminary assessments, site design and community consultation are expected to be lodged mid-year.
The Goulburn River Solar Farm proposal currently involves a 520 MW (DC) solar farm (peaking at 588 MW) and a 296 MW/588 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). Few details of the battery are included in the public referral, so the potential chemistry remains unclear, though the document does detail the system will be “housed in a series of outdoor containers”. 
In total, the solar farm will include around 950,000 bifacial solar panels expected to generate 992,000 MWh of electricity annually, enough to supply approximately 4% of the state’s electricity demand, according to lightsource bp.

The Goulburn River Solar Farm is to be built on more than 1000 hectares of cleared freehold land previously used for grazing livestock. The site will be returned to this purpose once the solar panels, sitting about five metres above ground level, have been installed. This will see around 1000 sheep grazing on the property, “managing” the grass, weeds and plant life below the sprawling agrivoltaics project.
Lightsource bp expects construction to begin by mid-2023. 
The company has already been in discussions with a number of state government authorities, as well as community stakeholders, holding a series of web events toward the end of last year. In the referral the company says it will continue to consult with residents and local community, holding in-person community sessions (hopefully) in March and April this year. “Following this engagement, we will conclude a range of detailed assessments, before undertaking the statutory pre submission consultation,” lightsource bp’s website reads.
In the referral, it says the project will involve a capital investment value of more than $30 million.
Lightsource bp is seeking to significantly ramp up its global solar portfolio, taking it from 4 GW to 25 GW in the next four years. The company owns a number of projects in Australia, mostly in NSW. Those include the 400 MW (DC) Wellington North solar farm on which construction is soon to begin, the 200 MW (DC) Wellington solar farm which is currently in construction, the 107 MW (DC) West Wyalong solar farm also in construction, as well as the 840 MW (DC) Sandy Creek solar farm, though this project is, like Goulburn River Solar Farm, still in early planning stages. Lightsource bp is also currently constructing the 210 MW (DC) Woolooga solar farm in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/11/ultra-low-cost-solar-gets-a-40-million-rd-boost-from-arena/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 11, 2022",‘Ultra low-cost solar’ gets a $40 million R&D boost from ARENA,"The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced up to $40 million in funding to support research and development (R&D) toward the federal government’s “ultra low-cost solar stretch goal”. The goal, announced as part of the government’s much-belated net-zero 2050 commitment prior to COP26 in Glasgow last year, seeks to bring solar generation down to $15/MWh as the foundation for Australia’s energy future. 
ARENA already has previous R&D investment for solar in place through its Solar 30 30 30 target of 30% module efficiency and 30 cents per installed watt at utility scale by 2030. But now that the federal government’s latest Low Emissions Technology Statement (LETS) makes “ultra low-cost solar” a priority technology, ARENA is inviting applications for the newly available funding through two streams: 
In a statement ARENA said it would split the $40 million additional funding equally between the two streams, and ARENA CEO Darren Miller noting that Australia’s pioneering solar researchers will be key to driving further cost reductions and improving solar cell efficiency. 
“Australia’s solar researchers have been leading the world for decades,” said Miller. “Thirty years ago, UNSW researchers invented the PERC silicon solar cell, technology which today is the foundation of more than 80% of the world’s solar panels.” 
“That great work continues through ACAP, our universities and CSIRO as well as clean energy startups,” continued Miller. “Just a few months ago, SunDrive – a startup founded by former UNSW students and now based in Sydney – created the world’s most efficient solar cell.”
Indeed, SunDrive managed to achieve the most effective commercial-sized silicon solar cell in the world with a figure of 25.54% in testing carried out by the Institute for Solar Energy Research in Germany last September. 
Even more recently, SunDrive gave itself an early Christmas present with the successful fabrication of its first full-size solar panel. SunDrive’s innovative solution, achieved through hundreds of experiments in trial and error, amounts to a major technological shakeup of the solar industry’s Chinese cell manufacturing supremacy by finding a way to replace traditional and expensive silver in solar cells with the much more abundant and cheap copper. Copper is not as conductive as silver, nor as adhesive to the solar cell, but Allen’s solution rectifies this disparity as evidenced by its 25.54% world efficiency record.
Since the company was started in 2015, SunDrive has received $2 million in grants from ARENA. It’s innovation like this, Miller continued, that ARENA aims to support. “this $40 million R&D funding round will support Australia’s solar researchers and industry to get behind the target of Solar 30 30 30 and drive innovation that will deliver ultra low cost solar…a vital component in helping Australia move towards a lower cost, largely renewable electricity system and achieve the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.” 
Green hydrogen boost 
Part of the federal government’s ultra low cost solar ambition is to drive the scaling up of production of low cost green hydrogen to achieve the LETS hydrogen goal of “H2 under $2”. Although the government remains technologically neutral when it comes to hydrogen, green hydrogen generated through solar electrolysis has the greatest potential for cost reductions. 
Expressions of interest for the Ultra Low Cost Solar R&D Funding Round are set to open in February 2022, with applications due on Monday 11 April 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/11/korea-zinc-invests-in-gravity-storage-developer-energy-vault/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH KOREA,SWITZERLAND",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 11, 2022",Korea Zinc invests in gravity storage developer Energy Vault,"From pv magazine Global
Korea Zinc has agreed to invest $50 million in Switzerland-based Energy Vault so it can use its energy storage technology at its Australian refinery. The South Korean smelting giant is the latest major company to back Energy Vault ahead of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this quarter.
The new investment upsizes previously announced private investment in public equity funding from $100 million to $150 million, in conjunction with Energy Vault’s agreement to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Novus Capital Corporation II. Its previous funding round included investments from Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, BHP Ventures, Volta Energy Technologies, and Softbank Vision Fund, among others.
The new strategic partnership supports Korea Zinc’s strategy to decarbonise its refining and smelting operations under Sun Metals, its wholly owned subsidiary in Australia. The companies expect to begin project deployment of Energy Vault’s proprietary energy storage and energy management software technology in mid-2022. The size and cost of the project have not been disclosed.
The investment comes hot on the heels of Korea Zinc’s acquisition of Epuron, a major utility-scale wind and solar energy developers in Australia, with a pipeline of over 9GW. In late December, Ark Energy, an arm of Korea Zinc which runs the company’s decarbonisation efforts in Australia, said Epuron’s pipeline of projects will be used to help decarbonise its zinc metal processes and to power green hydrogen production.
Energy Vault’s technology is another piece of the puzzle in Korea Zinc’s ambitious plan to make its Sun Metals refinery in Queensland the world’s first refinery to produce green zinc. In November, Sun Metals – the second largest single-site energy consumer in Queensland – vowed to power its entire operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2040, with an interim target of 80% by 2030.
Previously, Sun Metals developed its own 125 MW solar farm, which became operational in 2018, to lower the cost of running its refinery, which was then on the verge of expansion. Today, the solar project provides some 22% of the refinery‘s energy needs. Sun Metals has also announced that it is considering buying wind assets in Queensland that could increase that renewable component to almost 90% of its energy needs.
“Energy Vault’s innovative storage technology and energy management software platform can play a key role in enabling and accelerating our decarbonisation strategy as we enhance our ability to power our operations with renewable energy,” said Yun B. Choi, vice chairman of Korea Zinc.
Energy Vault’s EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-tonne blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
According to the company, there is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time. Its composite blocks are developed in cooperation with Mexico’s Cemex, using local soil at sites where it builds its storage systems, as well as other materials such as recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and decommissioned wind turbine blades.
Energy Vault’s EVx tower features 80% to 85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.
The company says its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from two to four hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from five to 24 hours or more.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/11/dont-look-up-hollywoods-primer-on-climate-denial-illustrates-5-myths-that-fuel-rejection-of-science/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,WORLD",,"JANUARY 11, 2022",‘Don’t Look Up’: Hollywood’s primer on climate denial illustrates 5 myths that fuel rejection of science,"From The Conversation US. 
Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence play astronomers who make a literally Earth-shattering discovery and then try to persuade the president to take action to save humanity. It’s a satire that explores how individuals, scientists, the media and politicians respond when faced with scientific facts that are uncomfortable, threatening and inconvenient.
The movie is an allegory for climate change, showing how those with the power to do something about global warming wilfully avoid taking action and how those with vested interests can mislead the public. But it also reflects science denial more broadly, including what the world has been seeing with COVID-19.
The most important difference between the film’s premise and humanity’s actual looming crisis is that while individuals may be powerless against a comet, everyone can act decisively to stop fuelling climate change.
Knowing the myths that feed science denial can help.
As research psychologists and the authors of “Science Denial: Why It Happens and What to Do About It”, we recognise these aspects of science denial all too well.
The first question President Orlean (Meryl Streep) asks the scientists after they explain that a comet is on a collision course with Earth is, “So how certain is this?” Learning that the certitude is 99.78%, the president’s chief of staff (Jonah Hill) responds with relief: “Oh great, so it’s not 100%!” Government scientist Teddy Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan) replies, “Scientists never like to say 100%.”
This reluctance to claim 100% certainty is a strength of science. Even when the evidence points clearly in one direction, scientists keep exploring to learn more. At the same time, they recognise overwhelming evidence and act on it. The evidence is overwhelming that Earth’s climate is changing in dangerous ways because of human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, and it has been overwhelming for many years.
When politicians take a “let’s wait and see” attitude toward climate change (or “sit tight and assess,” as the movie puts it), suggesting they need more evidence before taking any action, it’s often a form of science denial.
The title phrase, “Don’t Look Up,” portrays this psychological assumption and how some politicians conveniently use it as an excuse for inaction while promoting their own interests.
Anxiety is a growing and understandable psychological response to climate change. Research shows there are strategies people can use to effectively cope with climate anxiety, such as becoming better informed and talking about the problem with others. This gives individuals a way to manage anxiety while at the same time taking actions to lower the risks.
A 2021 international study found that 80% of individuals are indeed willing to make changes in how they live and work to help reduce the effects of climate change.
Often, individuals want to believe in an outcome they prefer, rather than confront reality known to be true, a response that psychologists call motivated reasoning.
For example, belief that a single technological solution, such as carbon capture, will fix the climate crisis without the need for change in policies, lifestyles and practices may be more grounded in hope than reality. Technology can help reduce our impact on the climate; however, research suggests advances are unlikely to come quickly enough.
Hoping for such solutions diverts attention from significant changes needed in the way we work, live and play, and is a form of science denial.
Taking action to slow climate change will be expensive, but not acting has extraordinary costs – in lives lost as well as property.
Consider the costs of recent Western wildfires. Boulder County, Colorado, lost nearly 1,000 homes to a fire on Dec. 30, 2021, after a hot, dry summer and fall and little recent rain or snow. A study of California’s fires in 2018 – another hot, dry year – when the town of Paradise burned, estimated the damage, including health costs and economic disruption, at about US$148.5 billion.
When people say we can’t take action because action is expensive, they are in denial of the cost of inaction.
In a politically polarized society, individuals may feel pressured to make decisions based on what their social group believes. In the case of beliefs about science, this can have dire consequences – as the world has seen with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S. alone, more than 825,000 people with COVID-19 have died while powerful identity groups actively discourage people from getting vaccines or taking other precautions that could protect them.
Viruses are oblivious to political affiliation, and so is the changing climate. Rising global temperatures, worsening storms and sea level rise will affect everyone in harm’s way, regardless of the person’s social group.

A comet headed for Earth might leave little for individuals to do, but this is not the case with climate change. People can change their own practices to reduce carbon emissions and, importantly, pressure leaders in government, business and industry to take actions, such as reducing fossil fuel use, converting to cleaner energy and changing agricultural practices to reduce emissions.
In our book, we discuss steps that individuals, educators, science communicators and policymakers can take to confront the science denial that prevents moving forward on this looming issue. For example:
As scholars who work to help people make sound decisions about complex problems, we encourage people to consume news and science information from sources outside their own identity group. Break out of your social bubble and listen to and talk with others. Look up.
