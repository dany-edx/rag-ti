Concentrated solar power systems use mirrors and receiving towers to gather and store the sun’s energy. The technology has had a disrupted history, from being hailed a great solution, to being wedged out by cheap solar PV combined with the finicky hindrances which detracted from CSP’s great advantage of dispatchability. 
One of those finicky hindrances includes the molten storage systems’ hot tank, which had tended to leak because of thermal cycling and fatigue, resulting in substantial production losses for CSP projects.

Now, a consortium including Sydney-based Vast Solar, as well as CyD, Solar Dynamics, and Alia Energy Consulting and Critical Engineering, say they have jointly developed a tank design which addresses the issue, drawing on input from the Advanced Materials Team at the Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute (ASTRI), led by the Queensland University of Technology and Flinders University.
Dubbed the Flexitank, the consortium said it developed the new design by carefully analysing, understanding and learning from previous failures. The design increases the flexibility of the floor of the tank and mitigates the risk of failure associated with thermal cycles by absorbing the repeated expansion and contraction typically encountered in such tanks, the consortium outlined.
“Once we understood the tank failure modes and started testing the physical properties of the incumbent materials, we realised that flexibility is the key to overcoming thermal cycling and fatigue,” Vast Solar CEO, Craig Wood, said. “The economics of thermal storage are compelling, and we are delighted that our work will now deliver much needed reliability.”
“We are confident that the new design will substantially improve the operation performance of CSP systems moving forward,” Dominic Zaal, ASTRI Director, added.
In May, Vast Solar called for expressions of interest from contractors to progress its plans for a 50 MW hybrid power plant in Mount Isa, which will combine solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with its own concentrated solar thermal power technology.
Unlike traditional concentrating solar thermal power technology which uses molten salt both as a heat transfer and for storage, Vast Solar has developed low cost, modular technology with integrated thermal storage that uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine. The technology allows plants to be configured with 4-16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW.
The technology has been proven at Vast Solar’s 1 MW pilot plant in Jemalong, New South Wales which has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/07/industry-first-pilot-using-hydrogen-in-food-manufacturing-launches-in-nsw/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",Industry-first pilot using hydrogen in food manufacturing launches in NSW,"Headquartered on the New South Wales Central Coast, Star Scientific has garnered much attention internationally  for its Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser, or HERO, technology. Now, for the first time that technology will be applied in an 18-month pilot with Mars Food Australia and not-for-profit Central Coast Industry Connect Limited.
The pilot will see Star Scientific’s HERO technology, which is driven by a catalyst reaction that generates temperatures of over 700 degrees celsius without combusting hydrogen, used to generate heat for industrial-scale sanitation in food manufacturing. Precisely how the hydrogen technology will be integrated though is still being finalised, with Star Scientific telling pv magazine Australia it is in a process of “translational research” before it confirms the exact configuration of the pilot.
A big part of this initial stage, the company said, involves Star Scientific and its partners working with government to ensure the pilot remains within regulatory frameworks – which do not yet include nascent hydrogen technologies.
Looking forward, Star Scientific confirmed that it had already begun sharing information with Mars Food Australia, and will soon undertake extensive testing and consultation with the food manufacturer, as well as regulators and relevant government agencies. 
Once completed, the company says the pilot will provide a foundational framework for the development of other heat sources used in food manufacturing.

Star Scientific’s Global Group Chairman, Andrew Horvath, has previously told pv magazine Australia that food industries were among the most interested in the company’s HERO technology and had shown an immense appetite for integrating new hydrogen technologies into their processes to reduce emissions.
The company also said it is currently “in advanced discussion with green hydrogen suppliers” and is hopeful that by the time it is ready to ‘flick the switch’ on the pilot, it will have a supply of green hydrogen – the only type of hydrogen which is actually zero emissions.
The pilot is part of the Central Coast Hydrogen Food Cluster, an industry-led hydrogen collaboration between Star Scientific and not-for-profit Central Coast Industry Connect Limited which launched last month.
“With the establishment of the Central Coast Hydrogen Food Cluster we have the platform for industry players to be involved in the development of alternative heat sources for the food industry using hydrogen,” Frank Sammut, Executive Director of the Central Coast Industry Connect, said.
“Having a global company like Mars Food Australia taking part in this first pilot project demonstrates the will and the need of industry to move forward with becoming truly ‘clean and green’ and will showcase the enormous opportunity of this technology in the local and international marketplace,” Sammut added.
“We are really excited about being able to demonstrate how our HERO® can pave the way for Australian food manufacturers to reduce emissions, and very grateful for the support from all levels of government for this pilot,” Star Scientific Chairman Andrew Horvath said. 
“For us, it’s a recognition of the critical role that the cluster will play as an ‘incubator’ of regulatory issues for the hydrogen supply chain and more specifically, ‘green’ hydrogen made from renewable energy. This will enable us to identify challenges and provide solutions,” he added.

Since the end of 2018, IXL Solar has been for all intents and purposes the sole Australian manufacturer of 5B’s Maverick array system, which has won the company widespread favour for its prefabricated, scalable, and rapidly deployable ground-mounted design.
The acquisition of IXL Solar will help 5B rapidly scale ahead of its Maverick technology’s deployment in some truly massive projects, including Sun Cable in the Northern Territory, which will see up to 20 GW of solar built to export power to Singapore through a sub-sea cable.

While the acquisition marks a bringing in-house of the company’s Australian manufacturing capability, which already existed onshore but to a limited degree and primarily for research and development (R&D) purposes, pv magazine Australia has been told the company has no plans to pursue a vertical integration model.
Rather, the move is about bolstering 5B’s capabilities in Australia to further refine its product blueprint and use that knowledge to better train its international assembly partners. 5B will continue its model of expansion via international assembly partnerships. 
Continuing this model, 5B will remain focussed on product innovation, using its newly acquired Adelaide facility to further streamline manufacturing process. The company will keep its Mascot campus as its primary product R&D facility, with the Adelaide facility to become its advanced manufacturing centre of excellence.
5B
5B will retain all 20 manufacturing specialists and staff at IXL Solar, folding them into the team with the company eager to make the most of a plant set up by a company, IXL group, with more than 160 years of experience in manufacturing.
“The world needs massive scale, ultra low cost solar power, fast, and we are constantly seeking ways to accelerate the growth of our team and scaling of our 5B Maverick solar deployment platform,” 5B Co-Founder and CEO, Chris McGrath said. 
“The IXL Solar team joining 5B will be highly impactful in achieving such acceleration and will reinforce the manufacturing outcomes of our 5B Maverick technology at gigawatt-scale for our customers and 5B Ecosystem Partners – including in terms of time, cost, quality, safety and sustainability.”
Since its first project in 2017, 5B has completed 52 projects, with over 32 MWp capacity. Today, it is successfully selling and delivering to some of the biggest utility scale players globally, with its technology expected to be deployed on the world’s largest planned solar project, Sun Cable.
For IXL, the sale represents an evolution of its long-standing relationship with 5B, with the company becoming a 5B shareholder. “We have supported [5B’s] growth and ambitious pipeline to supply some of the world’s largest gigawatt-scale solar projects,” IXL Chairman Rob Backwell said. “We see this transaction as an opportunity for our staff to grow and succeed with 5B, and take Australian innovation to the world,” he added.
IXL will continue to own the IXL Solar name, though the company said it has no plans to operate a business under that name.

While FPV projects on freshwater lakes and reservoirs have now been installed in more than 40 countries, offshore FPV does not have the luxury of such calm and protected waters, meaning the equipment for offshore applications needs to be of an exceptional and specialised quality. 
Thankfully, the technology for these applications is improving rapidly. And considering a 2020 study by NREL estimated potential FPV on hydropower reservoirs at 7.6 TW, there has not yet been any serious calculation for the potential of offshore FPV, but one would think the figure enormous. 
Unlocking this enormous potential depends on making the right technological advancements to develop offshore FPV arrays capable of withstanding ocean waves and winds. But there is no shortage of firms on the case. Take German wave energy technology company Sinn Power GmbH, which recently unveiled its first floating ocean ‘hybrid’ platform, that combines wave, wind and solar energy. 
A G8 spokesperson told pv magazine Australia that practical trails of the Modular Tractive Buoyancy (MTB) technology, as well as the subsea stabilisation system and high-voltage subsea power connection to the floating hybrid plant “have proven successful in Singapore wit the Sunseap Woodlands Project. A 5 MW Pv system together with a 20 MW marine rated substation installed in  early 2020 off the Northern coast of Singapore.”
“Our aim,” the spokesperson continued, “is to use this hybrid concept to increase the power generation capacity by up to 2 times that of a normal floating solar plant…G8 is presently in an advanced engineering study with WookYung Engineering and Construction of South Korea to construct a 3 MW turbine combined with 1 MW of solar on a stabilised platform.”
On the research side, scientists at Malta’s Institute for Sustainable Energy have developed a simulation tool to assess the effect of wave response motion in offshore floating PV installations.
Or G8 Subsea (G8), a Singaporean company specialising in the engineering and construction of subaqueous energy infrastructure which connects offshore wind and floating PV (FPV) projects to land. The company has announced its pipeline of projects until 2024 and the list contains some ambitious FPV projects. 
Projects include the 75 MW Sarawak FPV array in Malaysia, bidded to Sarawak Energy and a 100 MW FPV project in Ghana. On the engineering side the firm is also involved in the 145 MW Pandan FPV project in Singapore, and in the supply of floating substations for the 145 MW Cirata FPV array in Indonesia. 
G8 told pv magazine Australia that discussions on these projects are at an advanced stage but that more information is currently bound up in non-disclosure agreements. However, site engineering and construction works are expected to begin “next year once concerns of the global pandemic subsides”. Of course, at the current rate the global pandemic is unlikely to subside next year.
G8 is targeting an initial public offering (IPO) in mid-2022, as it looks to firm investment. “We’re facing the greatest energy transition timeline of our generation,” said G8 founder and managing director, Gerald Tan, “and it’s all about solving a global problem, by developing better and more sustainable sources of energy. An IPO will enable us to enter the global renewables arena – we want to play at the international – not just the national – level. The growth prospects of this industry are limitless, and a public listing would better equip us to leverage that growth.” 
“We’re the only company that offers a combination of both offshore wind and floating solar solutions…Not many companies have the specialised engineering know-how to play competitively in the offshore market – but we have proprietary subsea engineering and construction expertise. That augurs well for our future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/07/photovoltaic-rotary-energy-system-for-domestic-applications-high-rise-buildings/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TURKEY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 7, 2021","Photovoltaic rotary energy system for domestic applications, high-rise buildings","From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Adana Science and Technology University in Turkey have designed a prototype of a rotary energy system (RES) that they claim may become a solution that is particularly suitable for domestic applications and high-rise buildings in regions with high wind energy and solar energy potential.
“The system was manufactured using 3D print technology and consists of a single structure,” research author, Abdurrahman Yavuzdeger, told pv magazine. “Its rotation movement produces air streams that are able to reduce the operating temperature of the solar panels and reduces dust accumulation considerably.”
The system has a decagonal shape and each of its sides hosts a polycrystalline photovoltaic panel with a size of 140×60×2.5 mm and a weight of just 33g. The modules are placed at a 30mm distance from one another and they have a power conversion efficiency of over 17%. Their rated voltage is 6V and the rated current is 100mA.
Air ducts measuring 95×150 mm are embedded between each of the system’s 10 sides to reduce the operating temperatures of the panels and, simultaneously, that of the whole system. A slip ring with an efficiency of around 96% has been used to solve the problem of entanglement of the cables in the solar modules.
A stepper motor Nema 23 for low-speed applications is used to rotate the system. It measures 56.4×56.4×76 mm and weighs in at 1kg. Its operating voltage is 8.6 V and its operating current is 1 A on each phase. A stepper motor driver TB6600 is used for rotation speed adjustment and the speed is controlled by a controller interface. The system’s rotating speed ranges from 0 to 100 revolutions per minute (rpm). A measurement station records ambient temperature and solar radiation data.
The system was operated 0, 10, 50, and 100 rpm/h and with solar radiation of between 110 and 1210 W/m2. “Although the highest irradiance value is at 10 rpm, the highest power value produced from the RES has been measured at 100 rpm,” the scientists said. “The cooling of the PV panels has been realised with the increase of the rotation speed.”
The highest output power of the system was found to be 1.8067 W at operating 100 rpm and 756 W/m2 solar radiation, while the lowest was 0.5698 W at operating 10 rpm and 234 W/m2 solar radiation.
“The total cost of the system is approximately 3500 TL (AU$410),” Yavuzdeger told pv magazine. “But these costs date back to 2018 when we began assembly the prototype.” Looking forward, the Turkish group said it wants to improve the system design and apply MPPT converter topologies to the device.
Described by its creators as reliable, silent, environmentally friendly, the system is presented in the paper Performance Assessment of a Novel Eco-Friendly Solar Panel Mounted Hybrid Rotating Energy System with Renewable Energy Applications, which was recently published in IETE Journal of Research.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/07/puffer-fish-inspired-floating-pv-structure/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,HUNGARY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"DECEMBER 7, 2021",Puffer fish inspired floating PV structure,"From pv magazine Germany
Engineering firm Schlaich Bergermann Partner (sbp sonne) has had a 50kW prototype of its floating photovoltaic system in the water in Hungary since mid-October. The system does not consist of small plastic floats that are connected to each other; instead, it is comprised of 40-meter-long and 80-centimetre-thick membrane tubes that are only inflated during installation on site. This offers a whole range of advantages over other systems, according to sbp’s engineers.
In the design, two tubes are inflated parallel to each other. A steel frame with a width of 4.5 meters is attached between them, to which the modules are fitted. Over the length of the tube, 24 PV modules can be added. Unlike the prototype, where only four pairs of tubes were installed, 25 pairs of tubes are to be connected to form an island.
Two such islands next to each other will then form a block of one-megawatt power, with the power electronics on board. The dimensions of a one-megawatt block would be 80 meters in length and up to 108 meters in width. On one half of such a block, 2,708 square meters of module area would come to 4,320 square meters of gross area. This corresponds to a space utilisation factor of around 63%.

In an interview with pv magazine, Markus Balz, managing director of the sbp Sonne office said that they have designed the first floating system optimised for bifacial PV modules. This is because a light-coloured membrane layer with an albedo value of over 0.6 is stretched underneath the steel frame, meaning that 60% of the light is reflected by the membrane.
For comparison, 0.8 is roughly equivalent to the albedo value of freshly fallen snow. Water surfaces usually have an albedo value of 0.1 and are therefore not really suitable for the use of bifacial modules. To ensure that the membrane also receives enough direct sunlight, sbp Sonne chose the spacing between the modules at an optimal ratio of 50 millimetres. “We had to give the modules some spacing so they wouldn’t collide with each other in bad weather,” Balz explained. “That’s when we optimised the spacing between the modules right away for use with bifacial modules.”
Transport can also be improved with the inflatable system. Logistics are quite expensive with floats made of blow-molded plastic, as they take up a lot of space. The inflatable tubes, on the other hand, can be folded up. This allows floating photovoltaic construction material to be transported in a shipping container for three times the capacity of a conventional system. The tubes are also said to offer better protection from waves and wind. Because of the elongated shape, the tubes can partially conform to the shape of the waves, compensating for some of the movement. In addition, this hull shape provides less surface area to attack than small-scale rectangular systems, so anchors and mooring can be sized somewhat smaller.
If the waters were calm, only a few millibars would be pumped into the tubes. Since these are very large, they would still appear hard to humans. When the forces of nature become much more noticeable and the wind picks up, the tubes can be inflated to higher pressures via integrated pumps. The increased pressure, however, results in a very high rigidity of the system, he said. “Similar to a single-axis tracker, we also want to increase the stiffness of the floating system when the wind loads become greater,” Balz continued. By making the pressure in the tubes adaptive, the material can be spared from premature wear, when the weather does not demand particularly high stiffness.
A weather station on board the system monitors wind speed and wave action and can thus autonomously decide whether to inflate the tubes. Since the system inflates itself in case of danger and the prototype was built near the membrane manufacturer’s site in Hungary, sbp Sonne named its system “Gömbhal” – Hungarian for pufferfish.
Should air ever escape from one of the tubes, they would initially be protected by an adjacent parallel tube. Should all the air escape from a double tube, the system would still be buoyant, Balz said. At the 50-kilowatt pilot plant in Hungary, air has already been let out of one of the tubes to exchange it while the plant was floating on the water. The test worked flawlessly, he said.
Over the next year, the engineers plan to collect data. To do that, all sorts of sensors have been attached to the system. This is to determine whether the assumptions about the increased bifaciality also correspond to real-world conditions. The engineers at sbp are already confident about the static properties of the system and say that nothing stands in the way of commercial sales of these systems. According to Balz, the company is already in talks with the first project developers and EPC companies but is also open to other interested parties.
