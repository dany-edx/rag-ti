AGL said construction work for the estimated $750 million battery project is expected to begin in early 2024 with start of operations targeted for mid-2026.
United States-based large-scale storage specialist Fluence has been selected as the preferred engineering, procurement and construction provider.
The project will be supported by a $35 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and a long-term energy service agreement arranged by AEMO Services on behalf of the NSW government.
ARENA said the Liddell battery, originally planned at half the size at 250 MW/500 MWh, is one of eight energy storage projects selected for support through the Large Scale Battery Funding Round. Together, these projects are expected to deliver a tenfold increase in grid-forming electricity storage capacity in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The agency said each of the batteries will be equipped with grid-forming inverter technology, allowing them to provide essential system stability services traditionally provided by synchronous generation such as coal and gas.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said batteries that are equipped with smart inverter technology which can help stabilise the grid are one of the pieces of the puzzle that will help to support the transition to 100% renewables.
“As new solar and wind connects to our grids, we’re going to need increasing amounts of energy storage to continue to provide reliable electricity to our households and businesses,” he said.
“However, as coal and gas generators retire, or start to play a lesser role, we’ll also need these new batteries to provide the crucial system security services that are currently provided by these traditional generators.”
AGL Managing Director and CEO Damien Nicks said the FID on the Liddell battery project, part of the planned Hunter Energy Hub, marks a significant milestone in the company’s decarbonisation pathway and the transition of its energy portfolio.
“The Liddell battery will be a key component of achieving our interim target of approximately 5 GW of new renewables and firming capacity in place by 2030,” he said.
Nicks said that once completed, the Liddell battery will add to AGL’s existing suite of grid-scale battery assets and contracted capacity from third parties.
This includes the 250 MW/250 MWh Torrens Island battery in South Australia, which commenced operations in August, and a 50 MW/100 MWh battery under construction at Broken Hill in New South Wales, which is expected to begin operations shortly.
AGL shut down the Liddell power station in April after more than half a century of operations as it looked to convert the site into a renewable energy hub.

The successful projects include the 350 MW Culcairn Solar Farm being developed by Neoen near Albury in the Riverina region and the 400 MW Uungula wind project being built by Squadron Energy near Wellington in the state’s central west.
The long-duration storage projects include a 275 MW/2,200 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system to be built by Ark Energy, a subsidiary of Korea Zinc, at Myrtle Creek near of Casino in northern NSW.
Another eight-hour lithium-ion battery, the 49 MW/392 MWh Goulburn River project being built by Lightsource bp at Merriwa in the Upper Hunter Valley, was also successful in this third tender round.
Hydrostor’s 200 MW/1,600 MWh Silver City compressed air energy storage project being developed near the outback town of Broken Hill rounds out the projects to be fast-tracked under the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap incentive scheme.
The government said the five projects are expected to be operational from 2028 and represent $4.2 billion (USD 2.82 billion) in private sector investment in the state’s renewable energy infrastructure.

NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe the state has now locked in 5.79 GW of its legislated 12 GW renewable target for generation and 574 MW of the legislated 2 GW target for long-duration storage.
“NSW is now almost halfway there on our 2030 renewable generation target, and over a quarter of the way there on our long-duration storage target,” she said.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said the results of the latest tender round out a significant year for the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap tender program.
“AEMO Services has delivered three highly successful tenders throughout 2023,” he said, adding that participation in the tenders demonstrates “the market value and fit of our innovative financial contract, which offers projects exposure to market upside and reduces risk and cost to consumers compared to traditional schemes.”
But while pleased with participation levels in the first year of tenders, Verschuer said the state would need to continue development “at or near record levels” to remain on track to meet its minimum investment objectives.
Verschuer said AEMO Services will continue to deliver biannual tenders for at least the next decade.
The five projects announced in the third tender are expected to support an estimated 1,000 jobs over the project lifetimes, $2 billion in local supply chain benefits, and enough generation to power 360,000 NSW homes per year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/19/intellihub-trial-aims-to-free-up-more-than-510-mw-of-flexible-demand/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",Intellihub trial aims to free up more than 510 MW of flexible demand,"As part of a two-year project, Intellihub will partner with device manufacturers to develop the connectivity layer that enables flexible operation of home energy devices including rooftop solar, electric vehicle chargers, and residential batteries. The project is targeting 510 MW of aggregated load under control through the enrolment of more than 150,000 customer energy resources (CER).
Intellihub said the $22 million (USD 148 million) Demand Flexibility Platform project, which is being supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) with a $9.75 million grant under the Advancing Renewables Program, aims to deliver an end-to-end solution that enables connectivity to multiple device types and manufacturers through a single integration.
“We now have the smarts to manage the energy these devices consume so they become a flexible energy resource,” Intellihub Chief Executive Officer Wes Ballantine said.
“They will work like a large battery energy system, soaking up excess daytime solar energy and avoiding consumption during peak demand periods to reduce stress on the system.”
The two-year project will initially target integration with residential hot water systems and rooftop solar systems, before expanding to incorporate other CER such as home batteries, electric vehicle (EV) chargers and pool pumps.
Electricity retailers will be able to sign up households to the platform and use it to manage their customers’ home energy devices as part of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP). Intellihub will provide the interface between electricity retailers and the customer-owned devices.
Participating CER can then be turned on to soak up excess daytime solar energy and help stabilise the electricity grid or programmed to reduce demand during peak periods to better manage supply and demand across electricity networks and wholesale markets.
Ballantine said it is expected there will be more than 10 million energy devices sitting behind the meter in Australian homes by 2030 and better coordination of the assets is essential in helping the country to transition to a net zero energy system.
“There is enormous benefit from being smarter about how we manage these resources, not just for the energy system but for consumers and local communities,” he said, noting that the project is “just a small fraction of what is possible by better managing our behind-the-meter resources.”

Ballantine said Intellihub is already in close discussions with several electricity retailers to partner with the company on the project.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the continued growth in CER presents both challenges and opportunities for the industry but the flex demand project could provide a potential solution at scale that can deliver widespread benefits.
“Without the ability to monitor and control energy flows, these devices can create challenges for the grid, however, when aggregated and controlled, these resources can provide much-needed demand flexibility, unlocking benefits for retailers, networks and consumers,” he said.
“Intellihub’s Demand Flexibility Platform represents an opportunity to create a smarter energy grid, where consumers are at the forefront of the energy transition, through the utilisation of their owned energy resources, being able to better match supply and demand on the grid while also making cost savings.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/19/smartestenergy-signs-ppa-for-girgarra-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",SmartestEnergy signs PPA for Girgarra Solar Farm,"Developer Enel Green Power said construction of the Girgarre Solar Farm is well underway on the site just 10 kilometres from Standhope, between Bendigo and Shepparton in Victoria.
The project is scheduled to become fully operational in early 2025. Now that SmartestEnergy has signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Enel Australia, the approximately 200 GWh of clean energy produced each year by the Girgarre plant will go to the retailer’s commercial and industrial customers.
The Girgarre Solar Farm, located about 70 kilometres west of Shepparton, is remarkable for eliciting no objections from the local community. This is largely owing to the fact that Peter Leeson, from Leeson Group, conducted community liaison for the project before it was sold to Enel Green Power. Notably, $70,000 in revenues from a crop which sprang up on the site prior to construction was donated to the community via Girgarre Development Group, which used the funds to upgrade shared facilities in town.
The goodwill already generated is an asset that appears to be appreciated by the Australian subsidiary of the Italian energy company.
In announcing the PPA with SmartestEnergy, Enel Green Power Australia Chief Executive Officer Werther Esposito said, “We would like to sincerely thank the local community, including the local Campaspe Shire Council, Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation, amongst other valued local stakeholders, for their support of the project to date.”
“Through Enel Green Power’s creating shared value approach, our team are focused on ensuring proactive engagement and benefit sharing for the local community throughout the project’s construction and operational phases.”
Earlier this year, Enel Green Power Australia sold a 50% share in its Australian solar portfolio to Japanese oil and gas giant Inpex, which gives the Japanese firm joint control of 254 MW of Enel Australia’s installed capacity with another 170 MW under construction. Enel said it is further developing its portfolio with wind, solar, storage and hybrid projects across Australia, as well as expanding its activities in solutions within its retail and trading operations.
SmartestEnergy is wholly owned by the Japanese Marubeni Corporation. The B2B energy retailer has offices in the UK, USA and Australia, establishing the latter in 2019.
So far this year, the company has signed agreements in Australia with Woolworths in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and a long-term PPA in southeast Queensland with Greek energy giant Mytilineos for Kingaroy Solar farm.
Also this year, the energy retailer signed PPAs with Octopus Australia to offtake 25% of generation from its Darlington Point Solar Farm in New South Wales and with Queensland government-owned utility DS energy for its first 100% renewable energy contract. The agreement now signed with Enel Australia appears to be the first PPA that SmartestEnergy has signed with Enel Group.
SmartestEnergy said its new PPA with Enel for Girgarra Solar Farm involves enough energy to power about 43,000 households.
Enel said mounting structures and systems that support the solar modules are currently under construction while piling is continuing across the site.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/19/pep-invests-250-million-in-electric-vehicle-charging/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",PEP invests $250 million in electric vehicle charging,"EVSE provides electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions for home (AC) and public (generally DC for fast charging) scenarios. The company also provides DC charging solutions for larger commercial vehicles and fleets, whereby both residential and commercial offerings include end-to-end solutions that bundle hardware, software and installation services.
In the new partnership with Pacific Energy Partners (PEP), the Australian electric vehicle (EV) charging company will work with Intellihub on smart charging and energy management behind the charger. Intellihub devices enable two-way communication between the network and the home.
EVSE aims to next year provide vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatible offerings, enabling EVs to discharge energy from their batteries back into the home or grid. This capability can stabilise grids during peak periods, especially with fleets and larger vehicles. V2G capabilities allow electric car owners to power their homes with their vehicles during blackouts or emergencies.
Intellihub has already made the foray into EV charging. Last month, the first of 50 chargers went into operation as part of Intellihub’s EV Streetside Charging project, which attracted $871,000 in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). The EV chargers, designed for privately owned electric cars, are installed on streetlight posts. This kind of offering has been increasingly popular in Europe with companies like the Berlin-founded company Ubitricity having now installed thousands of streetlight post charging points across the UK and Europe.
EVSE said Intellihub’s expertise can inform its offerings and the partnership between the two companies can better enable collaboration and make sure their offerings are mutually compatible with home metering, vehicle charging and renewable energy. Besides PEP, Intellihub’s shareholders also include the global metering solutions business Landis+Gyr.
For PEP, the new partnership is an opportunity to capture the growing residential, commercial and fleet EV charging markets.
“PEP’s strategic investment will enable EVSE to grow at scale as it continues to lead the way in the rapid electrification of Australia’s transport sector over the coming decade,” PEP Managing Director Cameron Blank said,
EVSE has become the second-largest provider of EV charging solutions in Australia and Intellihub’s footprint in New Zealand is expected to provide a path for EVSE across the Tasman. As part of the PEP deal, EVSE is also expected to establish an office in New Zealand. New Zealand has binding government targets in place to ensure the decarbonisation of the transport sector.
“We’re now installing more than 40,000 smart meters across Australia and New Zealand each month, and more and more, we’re going beyond the meter to support the better management of consumer energy devices like electric hot water, pools, solar and batteries – and EV charging,” Intellihub CEO Wes Ballantine said.
PEP has $8.7 billion in assets under management. Earlier this year, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation invested up to $80 million in equity into the firm’s $1.4 billion Secure Assets Fund II. PEP is looking to drive further decarbonisation efforts across its existing funds as it works with companies seeking to meet the challenges of lowering their emissions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/19/energy-storage-project-bids-now-sought-for-victoria-and-south-australia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 19, 2023",Energy storage project bids now sought for Victoria and South Australia,"The South Australia and Victorian Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) opened for registrations in October 2023. Bids are now being sought for up to 600 MW of 4-hour equivalent (or 2,400 MWh) of dispatchable capacity.
Bids can come from South Australian or Victorian utility-scale long-duration storage projects, including batteries, hydrogen and pumped hydro. Projects must be at least 30 MW and capable of storing energy for at least two hours.
The first Capacity Investment Scheme tender was launched in New South Wales earlier this year. The CIS involves the government underwriting new investments in renewable generation and storage through ‘contract for differences’ that are won through a competitive tender. The contracts on offer include pre-agreed floors and ceilings for revenue earned by any one project. If the revenue is lower than agreed, the federal government pays the shortfalls, guaranteeing projects a baseline income. The government will take a share of profits if revenues exceed the agreed price ceiling.
The initial aim of the CIS, signed off by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments in December 2022, was to drive investment in “dispatchable” clean power projects. In October 2023, the federal government announced a major revamp of the scheme to accelerate the development of renewable power generation and storage capacity.
The current tender is to allocate 800 MWh to South Australia, 800 MWh to Victoria and another 800 MWh to either state. The tender will progress in two stages, with project bids closing on 23 February 2024 and financial value bids in April 2024, which is to be confirmed.
The goal is to deliver dispatchable renewable energy to South Australian and Victorian grids before the end of 2027. AEMO and its subsidiary, AEMO Services, will administer the competitive tender on behalf of the federal government and make recommendations. Registration and application for the CIS SA-Vic tender can be made through the ASL website.

The bike paths each span 1,000 square meters in the provinces of North Brabant and North Holland.
The PV module tech offers an efficiency of 21% per square metre. The solar cells are protected by a multilayer of resin and the electrical architecture has been designed to reduce the amount of wiring.
The two cycle paths will produce 160 MWh per annum of renewable energy during the first year. The two projects are part of an initiative launched in 2018 by Rijkswaterstaat, which is part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.
Solar roads in the Netherlands are not an unfamiliar concept. In 2016, a bike path near Amsterdam was equipped with solar panels and another one was built in 2020 in Utrecht. However, the feasibility and economic viability of solar roads remain controversial.
The Dutch government is also developing “Zon op Infra,” a plan to test the viability of solar power production on road infrastructure. The plan includes the deployment of solar installations along highways and on noise barriers. 
The Dutch authorities are struggling to identify surfaces on which to deploy large-scale PV plants due to the scarcity of land. In recent years, research institutes and private companies have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on non-agricultural land, including dikes, rooftops, onshore and offshore water surfaces.
