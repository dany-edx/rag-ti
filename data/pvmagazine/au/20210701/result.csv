Mrowka said rooftop solar safety standards, particularly those relating to the controversial DC isolators which were mandated in Australia in 2012, have not kept pace with technology and industry changes.
“One example is the AS/NZS 5033 standard that mandates rooftop solar isolators, which have become the largest single cause of solar fires in recent years,” he said.
“Combine that with low-cost Chinese products that can be quite dangerous as they age, especially when poorly installed, and you have a ticking time-bomb that can cause electrical shorts and fires.”
Standards Australia has commenced a review of AS/NZS 5033 with the draft standard receiving more than 680 submissions during the public comment stage which closed last month.
Mrowka told pv magazine an update on the installation and safety requirements standard is expected in December but he was far from confident it will deliver the changes the industry is seeking.
“The safety issue is very difficult because governments have given out so many rebates for what may be potential fire hazards that this could be another pink batts installation debacle,” he said, referring to the government-funded insulation scheme which was abandoned in 2010 following the death of four workers and a string of house fires.

Founded in 2006, REA Global designs and installs solar PV energy generation and storage systems for residential and commercial customers, installing an estimated 15,000 modules annually.
Headquartered in Brisbane, the company also designs and manufactures solar modules and is progressing plans to establish offices in New South Wales and Victoria.
“We’ve been part of the industry for 14 years and 10 years of that as an EPC company designing, installing and maintaining solar systems,” Mrowka said.
“We’ve seen a lot of industry changes and one of the biggest issues in the industry is the application of the current technology which is critical.
“We’ve got a fundamental flaw where higher voltage systems are being installed with DC rooftop isolators that are not fit for purpose.”
Data provided by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) shows more than one in four Australian homes have solar modules on their roof and the market is on track to eclipse all previous records in 2021.
That uptake has however delivered unintended consequences with Fire and Rescue NSW statistics showing solar PV related fires had increased five-fold in the past five years.

Isolation switches have been blamed for causing almost half of solar module fires and Mrowka is one of many in the industry who is lobbying against their mandated installation, declaring the safety mechanism has caused more harm than good.
“They’re not designed to be sitting on people’s roofs,” he said.
“If we could change one thing to improve this situation, it would be to mandate rapid shutdown and panel-level monitoring and communication.”
The United States is among those nations pursuing rapid shutdown capability for rooftop solar and Mrowka said it is something that needs to happen in Australia to avoid the situation in the U.S. where some first responders won’t attend fire at a home with solar on the roof until after dark.
“They understand the risks and they’re not putting themselves at risk, to the detriment of the homeowner whose house is burning down,” he said.
Mrowka said the simple solution is to install a microinverter system that does not use high voltage DC, pointing out that REA Solar exclusively uses technology manufactured by California-based Enphase which has rapid shutdown capability built in.
“The problem with current solar systems is that when you pull the fuse in the street or you cut power to home, energy flowing from the solar system to the inverter is still live and can’t be circuit-protected,” he said.
“We install our solar panels with Enphase microinverters which let us circuit-protect the system because it runs 240 volts alternating current from the panels, so the homeowner can shut them down, just as with lights and power in the home.”

Mrowka said it is also crucial the industry address the lack of education and information being provided to consumers regarding the costs associated with microinverters and DC isolators which require ongoing maintenance.
“It’s not us versus them, of AC versus DC, it’s an education thing,” he said. “If you get a DC system, we’re not saying the thing will catch on fire, we’re just saying that if it’s not maintained, over time you’re at a greater threat of it catching on fire.
“If you maintain the system, there shouldn’t be a problem but because companies are selling low-cost systems, they’re not providing that awareness to customers that there are maintenance costs involved.
“They’re not telling them the rooftop isolators need to be maintained each year. They are failing to educate the customers. They either don’t understand it themselves or they don’t want to disclose it to the customer for fear of losing a sale.
“It’s really frustrating the lack of education that’s being provided in the industry.”
As well as its rooftop solar focus, REA Global is also pursuing projects in the electric vehicle space with Mrowka recently taking delivery of a new Porsche Taycan.
An experienced driver, Mrowka said he plans to race the car which will be powered entirely by solar.
“It can do a quarter mile in 10 seconds,” he said. “It blows everything away.
“We plan to do some promotional events and racing to raise general awareness that the future of motorsport will be green and electric.”

Veolia had planned to build a grid-scale solar PV farm and energy-from-waste facility at Gillman in north-western Adelaide after striking a $7 million deal with the South Australian government in 2017 to develop about 200 hectares of state-owned land in the industrial suburb.
Veolia’s plans for the site included a solar farm capable of generating 75 MW to 100 MW of power backed up by battery storage. The energy generated by the solar farm was to be dispatched to tenants in the proposed industrial park through a microgrid with any excess exported to the state network.
The agreement with the government became active in June 2018 after Veolia purchased approximately 20 hectares of the Gillman land but a company spokesperson confirmed on Thursday it had scrapped the project.
“In light of global events and unforeseen changes to market conditions, Veolia has come to an agreement with the South Australian government to exit from the Gillman project,” the  spokesperson said in a written statement.
“In doing so, the government will be able to move forward with alternative options to maximise the land’s potential through reuse, something we fully endorse and support.”
Government development agency Renewal SA said Veolia had not met the milestones set out in the agreement with the state government and had elected to not take up its option to continue with the project.
Renewals SA project delivery and property general manager Todd Perry said both parties had agreed to terminate the existing project agreements, enabling the government to pursue new options for the land’s use.
‘We are disappointed that Veolia’s development at Gillman will not proceed,” he said
“This land has long been identified as being of economic importance to the state due to its size and location, and Veolia’s departure will delay progress towards the achievement of potential employment generating activities.
“Renewal SA is now reviewing the development strategy and desired outcomes for this site to ensure this immensely strategic and important state landholding can be utilised to drive economic growth into the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/01/agl-energy-pushes-ahead-with-plans-to-split/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 1, 2021",AGL Energy pushes ahead with plans to split,"After months of deliberations, AGL has confirmed it will progress with plans to split into two companies – Accel Energy, a baseload power producer, and AGL Australia, a multi-product energy retailer and energy trading and storage business retaining the AGL brand.
In an ASX announcement on Wednesday, AGL confirmed it will proceed with plans to partition itself into two energy businesses with separate strategies.
Accel Energy will retain the company’s coal-fired power plants and wind farm contracts, and would spin off AGL Australia, the country’s biggest retailer of electricity and gas, into a separately listed company.
AGL chairman Peter Botten said moving forward as two independently listed companies would give the retail business and the generator business the individual freedom to pursue their own agendas.
“For Accel Energy, this means focusing on the transition of its existing electricity generation assets and investment in the long-term rejuvenation of its valuable operating sites as low-carbon industrial energy hubs, as well as new clean energy projects,” he said.
“For AGL Australia, it means focusing on being Australia’s leading multi-product energy retailing business while investing in flexible energy trading, storage and supply and decentralised energy services.”
Accel Energy will be Australia’s largest electricity generator, generating around 20% of the electricity demand in the National Electricity Market (NEM).

It will house the group’s coal-fired assets, including the Loy Yang A, Macquarie Generation and Torrens Island sites, with a focus on the redevelopment of the sites into low-carbon industrial energy hubs.
Accel Energy will also be Australia’s largest operator and offtaker of wind energy via the Macarthur, Hallett, Wattle Point and Oaklands Hill wind farms, with the potential to develop 1.6 GW of new wind projects.
The newly created AGL Australia will be Australia’s largest energy-led multi-product retailer of essential services to households and businesses, providing more than 4.5 million customers with electricity, gas, broadband and other services.
AGL Australia will also own and operate Australia’s largest private hydro fleet, fast start gas-fired power stations, a growing battery development portfolio and its 20% investment in renewables firm PowAR, which includes the Broken Hill Solar Farm in its portfolio of renewable assets.
AGL expects to complete the demerger by June 2022.
The demerger announcement comes after months of speculation as to whether the plans, first announced by former AGL chief, Brett Redman, would go ahead after his departure in April.

Botten said on Wednesday it was only after careful consideration that the board had decided to move ahead with demerger plans, first announced in March.
“The impact of recent challenging market conditions on our financial performance emphasises that AGL Energy is now at an inflection point, as the transition of the energy sector accelerates, driven by the rapid evolution in renewables and decentralised energy technology, customer needs and community expectations,” he said.
“After careful consideration, the board has confirmed that AGL Energy should move forward as two independently-listed companies.”
“The clarity of purpose created by this change will protect shareholder value, enabling each business to focus on their respective strategic opportunities and challenges presented by the accelerating energy transition.”
Graeme Hunt, currently Interim managing director and CEO of AGL Energy will serve as CEO of the new Accel Energy.
Christine Corbett, chief customer officer of AGL Energy since 2019, will assume the managing director and CEO roles of the new AGL Australia.
The demerger announcement came on the same day that AGL said full-year earnings for the year to June 30 will be “within the lower half of the previous range of $1,585 million to $1,845 million”, and underlying profit in the middle of $500 million to $580 million, including a $90 million insurance payout from a 2018-19 outage at the Loy Yang A power station.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/01/ausnet-reveals-preferred-route-for-proposed-300-transmission-line/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 1, 2021",AusNet reveals preferred route for proposed $300 transmission line,"AusNet has unveiled a single corridor for the proposed Western Victoria Transmission Network Project, declaring the project has positioned western Victoria one step closer to becoming the state’s renewable energy powerhouse.
The Western Victoria Transmission Network Project (WVTNP) proposes the construction of a new transmission line starting at Bulgana, near Stawell in Victoria’s west, and stretching approximately 190km to Sydenham in Melbourne’s north-west.
A new overhead double circuit 220 kV line would connect the existing Bulgana Terminal Station to a new terminal station to be built north of Ballarat while a double circuit 500 kV high-voltage line would connect from there to a new terminal station at Sydenham.
AusNet said the project, to be delivered by its commercial arm Mondo, would enable the connection of new renewable energy generated in western Victoria into the National Electricity Market and increase the Victorian transmission capacity.
About 4 GW of wind and solar projects have already been constructed in western Victoria and AusNet said in a statement on Wednesday the new transmission link has the potential to unlock another 900 MW of renewables in the region.
While western Victoria has emerged as a hotbed of renewables development, it has also become notorious for grid limitations with a number of utility-scale solar and wind farms in the area having had their outputs downgraded through Marginal Loss Factors, resulting in major dents in revenues.

AusNet executive project director Stephanie McGregor said the new transmission line, the first major transmission infrastructure built in Victoria for more than three decades, is urgently needed to ensure solar and wind energy being produced in the state’s west can enter the grid as the state transitions from coal-generated electricity to renewables.
“Once built the Western Victoria Transmission Network Project is expected to deliver substantial benefits to electricity consumers and the region over the life of the project,” she said.
“Transmission upgrades are a major step toward enabling the potential of Australia’s green energy boom, [and] this project is a major piece of the puzzle to facilitate that in Victoria.”
The project, which is included as a “committed” project in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s blueprint for the future grid, the Integrated System Plan, would complement other transmission projects such as the proposed new Victoria-NSW interconnector, VNI West.
Construction is expected to commence sometime in 2022, and the transmission link is expected to be fully operational by 2025. AusNet said the new transmission line would create more than 300 jobs during construction.

While AusNet has now identified a single corridor, considered to be the least constrained, the network operator will continue investigations, including undertaking flyover surveys between July 5-9 to capture light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and aerial imagery, to determine the placement of the proposed transmission line within that corridor.
AusNet said it will also continue to consult with community with the project attracting some opposition, with concerns the construction of overhead transmission lines will impact existing agricultural activities.
McGregor acknowledged the feedback and input from landholders and communities but said the selection of the corridor takes into consideration the location of private residences, the surrounding landscape, the environment, cultural significance and the agricultural use of land.
With the required Environment Effects Statement yet to be completed, McGregor said AusNet would continue to work with the landholders themselves to ensure agriculture and other land use can continue along the line with minimal disruption.
“We absolutely acknowledge and understand the uncertainty around the issue of farming under potential transmission lines,” she said.
“Ongoing engagement continues to be our priority. As the EES progresses there will be many opportunities for landowners and the community to provide further input as the process continues.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/01/sulphur-based-redox-flow-battery-with-15-consecutive-hours-of-runtime/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 1, 2021",Sulphur-based redox flow battery with 15 consecutive hours of runtime,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have developed a sulfur -based redox flow battery that is claimed to be able to operate for 15 consecutive hours of runtime and for over 2,000 hours’ cycling without obvious capacity decay.
This performance, according to the scientists, was achieved by applying a novel charge-reinforced, ion-selective (CRIS) membrane to a polysulfide-iodide redox flow battery built by the same research team in 2016. “Sulphur-based redox flow batteries adopting a commercial ion-selective membrane are compromised by the crossover and precipitation of active materials, leading to a rapid capacity decay and poor lifetime, and its application in large scale energy storage fails to be effective,” they emphasised.
The membrane was fabricated with a polymer-bound carbon and placed onto commercial Nafion membrane N117 to keep the two electrodes apart. Nafion membranes are proton-conductive polymer films that are used in redox flow batteries to prevent a problem known as “crossover,” which occurs during charging and recharging when battery electrolyte components cross the membrane in the battery cell, thus causing capacity losses that can reach up to 50%.
“The absorption of negatively charged species in porous carbon has strengthened the negative charge of the membrane and reduced the loss of active materials, which dramatically increased the stability and the lifetime of batteries,” the scientists said, referring to the use of the CRIS membrane.
The redox flow battery also exhibited a capacity decay rate of just 0.005% per day for 1,200 cycles, and a lifetime with over 2,000 hours’ cycling, which the academics said corresponds to approximately three months. For comparison, a device built exclusively with commercial membrane N117 has a lifetime of 160 hours’ cycling, or 6.7 days.
“Under the condition in which the energy storage device with a new battery continuously operated and discharged for more than 15 hours, the surprising result yielded, in turn, a levelised cost of storage (LCOS) for this system which is competitive with other state-of-the-art redox flow techniques for long-duration energy storage applications,” the scientists concluded. “This approach can be universally applied in other redox flow batteries using sulphur-bromine or sulphur-iron materials, and in organic redox flow batteries, which goes further, to fulfil a high stability of cycling.”
The novel membrane is described in the study Polysulfide-based redox flow batteries with long life and low levelised cost enabled by charge-reinforced ion-selective membranes, published in nature energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/01/sterling-and-wilson-solars-order-book-grew-72-in-fy2021-despite-australian-subcontractors-bankruptcy/,"COVID-19,FINANCE,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 1, 2021","Sterling and Wilson Solar’s order book grew 72% in FY2021, despite Australian subcontractor’s bankruptcy","From pv magazine India
Sterling and Wilson Solar, one of the world’s largest solar EPC solution providers, announced today its financial results for the year ended March 31, 2021. 
The company received orders for 1.96 GW capacity amounting to INR 7,936 crore for FY21, a 72% increase over INR 4,602 crore for FY20. 
However, its overall fiscal 2020-21 performance was impacted due to one-off exceptional events in the fourth quarter. These included a prime subcontractor going bankrupt in Australia, an increase in prices of modules, higher freight cost, and provision for liquidated damages on delay due to Covid-19.
“The prices of solar modules have risen by over 35% in last nine months. This was on account of a significant increase in the cost of the key raw material ‘polysilicon’. Prices of aluminium, copper and steel have also risen along with freight costs,” said Amit Jain, Global CEO, while sharing the results.
Revenues from operations dipped to INR 5,081 crore from INR 5,575 crore in the previous year. 
Of INR 5,081-crore revenue from operations, solar EPC business contributed INR 4826 crore. Revenue from operations and maintenance stood at INR 252 crore, a 37% increase year-on-year. Other operating income was INR 2.98 crore.
Sterling and Wilson Solar’s unexecuted order book as on June 29, 2021 stood at INR 9,348 crore, which is executable over the next 12 to 15 months. The current bid pipeline continues to remain strong. 
Jain said the sector is likely to continue to face some pressure in the near term on account of the increase in solar module prices and supply chain disruptions caused due to COVID-19 outbreak. 
Going forward, he expected the growth to pick up, given the strong fundamentals, government and regulatory commitment, and continued investor interest in the sector. 
With the Covid-19 wave on the wane globally, logistics and supply chain issues will likely get ironed out by Q2FY22 and return to pre-Covid levels. Operational effectiveness is also expected to normalise in the second half FY2021-22, he added.
