But following the success of Horizon Power’s Onslow microgrid, in which the coastal town near Exmouth was powered by 100% renewable energy for 100 minutes using the energy management technology, the company will now deploy the technology across the state.
The technology, called a Distributed Energy Resources Management System, or, attractively, DERMS, can monitor and orchestrate generation from distributed customers in real-time, integrating it with the utility’s other assets.
It does this by using predictive analytics, including weather pattern analysis, forecasting energy generation and demand to ensure the energy system remains stable.
In Onslow, the deployment of the technology enabled more than four times the amount of rooftop solar to be installed compared to a traditional energy system, Horizon Power said.
It is hopeful the other areas it services – which include the North West Interconnected System (NWIS) in the Pilbara, as well as minor networks and microgrids outside the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), will fare similarly.

“This deployment is ground-breaking as it enables rooftop solar, customer batteries, electric vehicles, centralised solar and batteries, and the traditional centralised power station to all work together in a coordinated way to maximise renewable energy supply, without adversely impacting power quality and reliability,” Horizon Power’s General Manager of Technology and Digital Transformation, Ray Achemedei, said.
“Deploying a distributed energy resources management system will increase solar access for our customers, lower their energy bills, and help reduce emissions,” he added.
The energy management system will be deployed in Broome at the start of next year, where rooftop solar limits remain a struggle for customers. 
The technology will then be progressively rolled out across all Horizon Power’s other systems by mid-2024.
“This is the technology that will underpin the transition to 100% renewable towns,” Achemedei said.

Melbourne’s BE Power, who is codeveloping the facility with GE Renewable Energy, a division of US giant General Electric, has selected engineering company Bechtel to support the project. Bechtel will be involved in the project’s ongoing bankable feasibility study and, if it is given the green light, the company will then go on to engineer, procure, and construct Big-T.
The project’s final investment decision scheduled for late 2023.
The project seems to have spent quite a while in the woodwork, having been one of 12 projects shortlisted by the former Coalition government for its Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) scheme back in 2019.
It doesn’t look like there has been much movement on that scheme since – which, alongside Big-T, shortlisted five gas projects and a coal project to participate.
Nonetheless, Big-T seems to be pushing on alone, located in Queensland’s domiciled Renewable Energy Zone 8 (QREZ8).
“We are pleased to secure the services of the global construction infrastructure leader Bechtel,” BE Power managing director, Scott Walkem, said. “Bechtel has significant expertise in the delivery of power infrastructure including hydropower. Further, Bechtel and GE have a long history of working collaboratively to deliver energy projects.”

The companies are hoping to complete the study by the year’s end.
“The feasibility scope will focus on assessing the accelerated implementation of a large-scale production facility from minimum 150 MW and up to 2 GW of hydrogen and preferred derivatives including ammonia for export and domestic use,” AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said in an update today.
“[The hydrogen hub] will be the first of its kind in Australia and will be an example of how an energy hub can combine grid-scale batteries, solar thermal storage, wind and pumped hydro,” he added.
The hub is set to be built around AGL’s Liddell coal plant, which is to fully retire by April, and Bayswater – less than five kilometres away, though not scheduled for closure until 2035.
The project proposes to use water from Lake Liddell and power from the planned renewable capacity to produce hydrogen for export or to use in the local grid.
To this end, the new partners – all with backgrounds in gas – have been brought in to help with the expanded feasibility study.
The Japanese companies, Inpex Corporation and Osaka Gas, will focus on assessing the feasibility of cost-competitive green hydrogen, while gas pipeline giant APA Group considers transmission and Jemena looks into blending hydrogen into its gas network.
Fortescue Future Industries and its chairman Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest have been extremely vocal about green, renewable hydrogen being the only worthy path for Australia. While today’s announcement mentions nothing about a shift in how the project plans to produce hydrogen, it is no secret that gas companies have a vested interest in pursuing hydrogen – which can be made from gas cheaply today.
FFI has previously announced plans to build the world’s biggest electrolyser manufacturing plant in Queensland as well as a 1 GW solar manufacturing plant.

That call was promptly heeded, with Rio Tinto’s Australian chief executive, Kellie Parker, saying it had received proposals for “a lot more than the 4 GW.”
Rio Tinto appears to be keeping a check on expectations though, with Parker adding in her speech to the Melbourne Mining Club on Friday: “All of us understand that Australia remains an expensive location to build, so it won’t be easy.” Parker did not give any indication of costs, however.
The company is seeking to meet the energy needs of three of its Gladstone assets, including the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland Alumina refinery. “These assets require 1,140 MW of reliable power to operate, which equates to at least 4,000 MW of quality wind or solar power with firming,” Rio Tinto back in June.
Such a massive fit out would require much planning and the company does not seem to have even decided on its renewable model yet, with Parker saying Rio Tinto had received proposals which put it in varying roles from project owner, to operator, partner, investor and customer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/09/study-finds-100-renewables-would-pay-off-within-six-years/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,FINANCE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"AUGUST 9, 2022",Study finds 100% renewables would pay off within six years,"From pv magazine Global
As renewables come to represent a larger portion of the worldwide energy mix, and as targets are put in place to increase it further still, there are plenty of worries over the cost that radically changing our energy systems will entail. And the intermittent nature of wind and solar also creates concern about insufficient supply and possible blackouts.
The latest energy system models from Stanford University researcher Mark Jacobson, however, show that for 145 countries, the energy transition too 100% wind, water, solar and storage would pay for itself within six years, and ultimately cost less than continuing with the current energy systems.
“Worldwide, WWS [[wind-water-solar] reduces end use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from US$17.8 to US$6.6 trillion per year), and Social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from US$83.2 to US$6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of US$61.5 trillion,” Jacobson said in his most recent paper. “Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than business as usual.”
He described the model in “Low-cost solutions to global warming, air pollution, and energy insecurity for 145 countries, which was recently published in Energy & Environmental Science. It builds on Jacobson’s previous work by adding new countries, more recent energy consumption data from all regions, and calculations to deal with uncertainty in the future price of battery energy storage, the role batteries will play, and the development of newer technologies such as vehicle to grid. But despite these uncertainties, Jacobson is certain that technological barriers don’t present a major roadblock for the transition.
“(About) 95% of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercialised,” he states.
The study also finds that, while jobs would be lost in the mining and fossil fuels segments, 28 million more jobs would be created than lost overall. Only Russia, Canada and parts of Africa are expected to see net job losses as a result, as these regions economies depend heavily on fossil fuels.
Though the study provides clear evidence that a full transition to 100% renewable energy is both technically and economically possible, Jacobson warns that plenty of uncertainty remains.
“Many additional uncertainties exist. One of the greatest is whether sufficient political will can be obtained to affect a transition at the rapid pace needed” he said. “However if political will can be obtained, then transitioning the world entirely to clean, renewable energy should substantially reduce energy needs, costs, air pollution mortality, global warming, and energy insecurity while creating jobs, compared with BAU [business-as-usual].”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/09/magnesium-superionic-conductor-for-lithium-free-solid-state-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",MARIJA MAISCH,"AUGUST 9, 2022",Magnesium superionic conductor for lithium-free solid-state batteries,"From pv magazine Global
Magnesium is a promising alternative to lithium for cost-effective, high-capacity solid-state batteries, mainly due to its abundance, but the poor conductivity of magnesium ions (Mg2+) in solids at room temperatures has held back its practical application. Researchers at Tokyo University of Science (TUS) have addressed this decades-long roadblock by developing a novel Mg2+ conductor with a practically applicable superconductivity of 10-3 S cm-1.
Mg2+ has poor solid-state conductivity because divalent positive ions (2+) experience strong interactions with their neighbouring negative ions in a solid crystal, impeding their migration through the material. To address this, the researchers have exploited a class of materials called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
“MOFs have highly porous crystal structures, which provide the space for efficient migration of the included ions. Here, we additionally introduced a “guest molecule,” acetonitrile, into the pores of the MOF, which succeeded in strongly accelerating the conductivity of Mg2+,” said Masaaki Sadakiyo, the TUS junior associate professor who led the study.
The team used a MOF known as MIL-101 as the main framework and then encapsulated Mg2+ ions in its nanopores. In the resultant electrolyte, Mg2+ ions were loosely packed and could easily migrate. To further enhance ion conductivity, the research team exposed the electrolyte to acetonitrile vapours, which were adsorbed by the MOF as guest molecules.
The team then subjected the prepared samples to an alternating current (AC) impedance test to measure ionic conductivity. They found that the Mg2+ electrolyte exhibited a superionic conductivity of 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1. The researchers believe this to be “the highest ever reported conductivity for a crystalline solid containing Mg2+.”
To understand the mechanism behind this high conductivity, the researchers carried out infrared spectroscopic and adsorption isotherm measurements on the electrolyte. The tests revealed that the acetonitrile molecules adsorbed in the framework allowed for the efficient migration of the Mg2+ ions through the body of the solid electrolyte.
These findings, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, reveal the novel MOF-based Mg2+ conductor as a suitable material for battery applications. But they also provide critical insights into the development of solid-state batteries, which continue to attract interest and big investment from the automotive and energy storage industries.
“For a long time, people have believed that divalent or higher valency ions cannot be efficiently transferred through a solid. In this study, we have demonstrated that if the crystal structure and surrounding environment are well-designed, then a solid-state high-conductivity conductor is well within research,” explained Sadakiyo.
