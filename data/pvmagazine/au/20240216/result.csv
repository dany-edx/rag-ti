Stating $644 billion will be spent around the world on new capacity this year, the research found an additional 18 million kilometers of grid network requiring nearly 30 million tons of copper, is needed to keep pace with electrification.
Closer to home, in its 2024 Draft Integrated System Plan (Draft ISP), the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasts close to 10,000 km of transmission will be needed in Australia by 2050, and about 5,000 km of this delivery occurring in the next decade, creating 4,000 km of new corridors and the upgrade of about 1,000 km of existing lines.

Grid upgrades are discussed extensively in the Draft ISP, which were brought into sharp focus this week in Victoria. A report from the Melbourne Age newspaper today found in a report that 13,000 Victorian pylons are rusty and 50 have toppled in strong wind since 1959, 25 of them in the last 15 years.
The VNI West, a new high capacity 500 kV double-circuit line to connect Western Renewables Link (from Bulgana) with Project EnergyConnect and HumeLink (at Dinawan) via a new substation near Kerang is due for completion in December 2029, at a cost of $3.6 billion, will be built with towers governed by a new building storm-resistant code.
However, older structures remain in the network which were built to historical design standards with inadequate strength to withstand convective downdraft winds occurring in extreme storm events, according to the AusNet Services 2023-2027 Transmission Revenue Reset report.
It says 45 structures had functional failures associated with eleven extreme wind events affecting Victoria’s transmission network since 1959, stating approximately 78% of the tower fleet would be retrofitted with Fall Arrest Systems (FAS) by 2022.
Edvard Christoffersen, senior analyst Rystad Energy said with regard to the global study, power grids will be both an enabler and an obstacle to the energy transition.
“Mature grids have enabled the rapid expansion in solar and wind capacity seen in recent years, but many national grids are now near or at the point where further connections cannot be made without upgrading or expanding them. Annual investment levels must increase if the current trend of renewable energy buildout is to continue,” Christoffersen said.
For Australia to achieve the needed 10,000 km of transmission lines by 2050 to align with climate change targets, it’s Optimal Development Path (ODP) for transmission projects through to 2050 come at a cost of around $16.4 billion or about 13% of the total cost of all generation, storage, firming, and transmission infrastructure valued at $121 billion.
According to the Department for Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW), Rewiring the Nation program will provide $20 billion of low-cost finance for transmission investment to modernise the grid and implement the ISP.
The federal government is also providing $75 million for the design and approvals phase of Marinus Link and over $250 million in underwriting support for VNI West to support early works and enable it to share infrastructure with EnergyConnect to reduces cost to consumers or affected communities and landholders.
Regardless, risks to achieving timely energy transition relying on an aging transmission grid exist if delays of the ODP occur, through interruptions such as storm events, but also from slow approval processes, investment decision uncertainty, cost pressures, social licence issues, supply chain issues and workforce shortages.
“The possibility that replacement generation is not available when coal plants retire is real and growing, and a risk that must be avoided. The sooner firmed renewables are connected, the more secure the energy transition will be,” the Draft ISP says.
Submissions to the AEMO Draft ISP closed today and the final ISP is scheduled to be published with supporting material on June 28 2024.

Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO), the state-run agency that manages the SDE++ program for renewable energy in the Netherlands, has publicly proposed the idea of supporting the production of solar panels, storage systems and electrolyzers.
The new incentive scheme, “Investeringssubsidie maakindustrie klimaatneutrale economie” (IMKE), will fund a portion of the capital expenditure needed to build factories for the three clean energy technologies.
The RVO said that the incentives for the production of PV panels will be limited to products for building-integrated (BIPV) and vehicle-integrated (VIPV) applications, as well as heterojunction modules or perovskite-silicon tandem panels.
The maximum amount that could be devoted to each solar manufacturing project may not exceed €70 million, while the threshold for battery or electrolyser manufacturing projects will be limited to €20 million and €50 million, respectively.
The consultation process will be finalised on March 3.
Dutch solar manufacturer MCPV, a spinoff of Resilient Group and one of SolarNL’s companies, is now spearheading a project to re-shore PV manufacturing to the Netherlands. In July, it unveiled plans to construct a solar cell and module factory at an undisclosed location in the country.
The factory is expected to have an initial capacity of 300 MW and is set to reach 3 GW by 2026, producing solar panels using an unspecified heterojunction cell technology with an efficiency of up to 26.5%. MCPV also plans to produce tandem perovskite-silicon solar modules at the facility in the future, with cell efficiencies surpassing 30%.
In June, the Dutch government allocated €2.6 billion through its National Growth Fund to support the production of innovative technologies in the fields of sustainability, energy, high tech, digitisation, and health care.
“The sun plays a key role in the energy transition,” the government said in a statement at the time, without providing further details on program implementation. “Researchers, raw material suppliers, construction companies and the automotive sector are joining forces to ensure that the next generation of solar panels is developed here in a fully circular manner.”

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/16/priorities-elsewhere-qcells-exits-australian-market/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-16,Priorities elsewhere: Qcells exits Australian market,"One of the longest running solar brands is shutting up shop in Australia. Citing “record-breaking price drops and extreme market competition” a statement from Qcells notes that it is focusing its attention elsewhere.
The decision was not formally announced via press release, but trickled out through industry media reporting. For a solar manufacturer that is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2024, such an exit from the Australian market is hardly befitting its long history in one of the world’s leading distributed generation energy marketplaces.
However, the sudden move does indicate the difficulties facing solar manufacturers in 2024 – with prices at record lows and a manufacturing downturn beginning to bite. It also speaks to the Australian marketplace’s particularly closeness to Chinese suppliers, with efficient supply chains through which low prices can be passed onto consumers.
Qcells itself has been consolidating manufacturing of late, closing an older PERC facility in South Korea in December 2023. On the flipside it has been expanding its manufacturing operations in the US – adding 3.3 GW of ingot, wafer, and cell capacity, in Cartersville, Georgia, to its existing 5.1 GW of module capacity in Dalton, Georgia. The expansion upstream in the US saw the investment of USD2.5 billion ($3.8 billion).
Qcells remains a leading supplier to the US market and is benefiting from generous incentives provided to domestic manufacturers under the Inflation Reduction Act. On Feb. 13, Qcells was the top-ranked modules supplier to the US marketplace, as assessed by SolarReviews.
The United States solar marketplace remains affected by a web of duties and protectionist measures – some relating to credible accusations of forced labor in some parts of the solar supply chain in China. As a result, module pricing is reliably more than 25% higher in the United States than in tariff-free Australia.
While module pricing has been dynamic in recent months, prices as low as USD0.10/W have been reported in China, as manufacturers shed inventory – according to analysts S&P Global. For Qcells, with its most modern manufacturing facilities in Korea and the United States, such pricing would be challenging in the extreme.
“This market condition is combined with the uncertainty of long-term competitive product supply for Australia,” the Qcells statement provided to pv magazine Australia reads.
The company has indicated that it will take a “few months” to wind up operations in Australia and will “fulfil the responsibilities of services and supply to customers that we have promised.”
Qcells informed Solar Quotes that its modules and batteries will continue to be covered by its manufacturer warranties. After sales support will be provided by Australian company Zeco.
The decision to exit the Australian market would be disappointing for many longer-term industry participants – some of whom would remember Qcells from its days as the leading German manufacturer. Yet it clearly reflects the challenging market conditions for PV producers at present and Australia’s exposure to these market conditions.
For Qcells, its immediate future lies in the protected and supported US marketplace. In Europe, the company is investing heavily in building up its direct-to-consumer channels alongside its project development arm Qenergy. Australia’s cutthroat market, given these priorities, may have been a costly distraction.
