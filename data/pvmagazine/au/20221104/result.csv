The collaboration, the companies said, intends to establish a framework to identify and assess possible green hydrogen and ammonia projects, with an overall vision of having these products reach parity with fossil fuel-based alternatives by 2030. 
FFI’s CEO, Mark Hutchinson, described the announcement as coming at a critical moment in energy. “As winter approaches, and energy costs continue to skyrocket, competitive green energy costs have never been more needed.”
While the announcement pushes that both companies see green hydrogen as useful for steel manufacturing, fertilisers, and other chemical industries, it would appear the main focus is still on developing it as a fuel source – and potentially even a gas heating alternative, though this isn’t clear.
Such focuses have been criticised by BayWa r.e. Australia’s technology innovation and hydrogen lead, James Hamilton, among others. 
FFI has been growing rapidly in the last years, and is easily Australia’s most ambitious player when it comes to green hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/04/australian-big-battery-nearly-triples-companys-storage-revenue/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",Australian big battery near triples Neoen’s storage revenue,"Australia features prominently in Neoen’s quarterly results, attributed with driving a significant portion of the French company’s growth – especially from its storage assets.
Neoen is Australia’s biggest big battery owner, and the company is reaping major benefits for its early movement in the sector, with revenues from storage alone hitting $100 million in the first nine months of 2022, a 2.7 fold growth.
By comparison, the company’s revenue growth from solar was 20% and for wind 50%. 
Overall, Neoen’s storage revenue accounted for 18% of its consolidated revenue in the first nine months of 2022, versus 10% in the first nine months of 2021.

“This hefty increase was largely driven by the contribution from the Victorian Big Battery, which entered operation in December 2021,” Neoen said in its results. “In the first quarter, it earned revenue under its capacity reserve contract with the Australian regulator, which provides for the unlock of additional peak capacity on the existing Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) during Australian summers. 
“It also generated sales from network services (FCAS) and arbitrage revenue amid highly volatile market conditions, especially during the second and third quarters. The storage segment was also underpinned by the promising performance of the Hornsdale Power Reserve in Australia,” the company added.
Neoen noted its merchant energy sales accounted for 33% of consolidated revenue to September, versus 24% in the first nine months of 2021. “This percentage notably reflects the Victorian Big Battery’s contribution.”
In October, Neoen completed financing for its 100 MW / 200 MWh Capital Battery in Canberra, declaring the project is track to be operational in the first half of 2023. In September, it also lodged an application to build a 1000 MW /4000 MWh big battery in Western Australia.
The company has long said it plans to have a big battery in all five of the National Electricity Market states – and seems to be throwing WA in just for good measure.

Another deciding factor, Young added, was the zone’s proximity to Project EnergyConnect, a major interconnector under construction linking NSW, South Australia and Victoria.
The NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap largely hinges on the establishment of five renewable energy zones – Central-West Orana and New England, both declared in 2021, as well as the Illawarra, Hunter-Central Coast, and South-West. With these zones, the state is seeking to replace the capacity which will be lost as coal-fired power plants Liddell, Eraring, Bayswater and Vales Point close before 2030.

The state roadmap seeks to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online and attract $32 billion (USD 20.7 billion) in private capital by 2030. It is an enormous undertaking, balancing the massive energy demands of the most populace state with a dramatic U-turn away from coal towards renewables in a tight timeframe.
In October, NSW opened its first bidding round for the New England REZ, starting up what’s to be a decade of rolling tenders.
Coming back to the South West REZ, the expression of interest process for that zone alone saw 49 registrations totalling 34 GW from potential generation and storage projects, more than 13 times the intended capacity of the zone.
In the wake of that early response, EnergyCo conducted a review of the submissions and has since refined the geographic boundary of the South West REZ.
“The refined boundary for the South-West REZ geographic area seeks to deliver a balanced and optimal outcome, considering the likely technical and economic feasibility issues for renewable energy and storage project developments, network infrastructure considerations, land-use constraints, and stakeholder views,” EnergyCo said at the time.
EnergyCo is the infrastructure planner for the South West REZ and will coordinate transmission, generation and storage projects.

Supported by various levels of government, network operators and utilities, the VPP is now operating in the suburbs of Harrisdale and Piara Waters in Perth’s southwest with 300 customers and their 650 variously-branded assets recruited.
With its large, islanded network and high levels of rooftop solar, the Western Australian VPP has piloted a version of the “Open Energy Networks” (OpEN) hybrid model, which defines roles and responsibilities for transitioning to a two-way power grid, enabling better integration of distributed energy resources (DER).
As Megan Allan, Project Symphony’s stakeholder and communication Lead, wrote for pv magazine earlier this year, the project has achieved some significant milestones during its testing period in 2022. Those include the successful orchestration of 200 kW of energy over a bi-directional balancing market trading interval, which saw seven organisations, including technology and project partners across five different time zones, conduct 20 integration tests over five days.
“The testing involved the partners’ platforms communicating with each other, providing both instructions and responses that support real electron flow changes to and from DER, whilst engaging with a simulated market environment,” Allen wrote.
“This included Synergy registering a facility comprised of aggregated DER determining its available capacity for a trading interval and incorporating a basic Dynamic Operating Envelope (DoE) at the National Metering Identifier (NMI) level, published to Synergy by Western Power such that the aggregator can prepare and provide a market submission to AEMO. Synergy also managed customer assets from load to generation, to meet AEMO’s dispatch instructions. Western Power monitored the network during the scenario.”
The project has also enabled aggregators to receive automatic dispatch instructions from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and then set an automatic dispatch of the aggregated facility into the market.
Struggling to reliably connect the vast and sparsely populated state, VPPs are entertained as “the future for electricity in WA,” said WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston in a statement.
“It’s great to see hundreds of customers embracing Project Symphony. Their participation will provide valuable insights into how Western Australia’s electricity system can be strengthened to continue to provide reliable, secure, and affordable power,” he said.
“In the face of a rapidly changing energy industry, customers’ rooftop solar systems, batteries, and air conditioning orchestrated together can play a meaningful role in providing services and stability to the network.”
With rooftop solar representing around 2 GW of renewable energy capacity in WA, collectively the largest generator in its grid, the South West Interconnected System, the scope for impact here is sizeable. 
Using Australian technology company SwitchDin’s platform, the $35.5 million (USD 22.5 million) Project Symphony has been funded by $8.6 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, $19.3 million from the Western Australian government, and a further $7.6 million from AEMO.
The project is a partnership between state-owned utility Western Power, Synergy, Energy Policy WA, and AEMO.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/04/what-to-expect-from-cop27-the-horns-of-the-energy-trilemma/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,WORLD",,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022",What to expect from COP27: the horns of the energy trilemma,"What’s the game plan?
After the glitz and glamour of Glasgow, COP27 is likely to be a relatively subdued affair. Despite the exotic location (Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt), the atmosphere is expected to be workmanlike, with a focus on pragmatism to allow a slowing down of the most ambitious short-term decarbonisation goals. At this, known as the ‘African COP’, we expect negotiations between developing and developed countries on finance for adaptation to climate change to be a key theme.
Expect the pace of NDC pledges to slow temporarily
Announcements around nationally determined contributions to climate targets (NDCs) have slowed recently, a trend we expect to continue. As part of the Glasgow Climate Pact signed at COP26, all 193 parties agreed to revisit and strengthen their targets by the end of 2022, yet at the end of October only 26 had done so. Given energy security and affordability concerns, some 2030 goals are likely to be postponed. However, a more ambitious pace should kick in once energy security concerns are addressed, putting countries back on track for 2040 and 2050 goals.
A recommitment to the Methane Pledge is likely
Amid growing public scrutiny, sectoral initiatives and commitments by companies in major methane-emitting sectors have increased since COP26. That could provide an opportunity to strengthen the Methane Pledge at COP27, thereby delivering more decarbonisation while avoiding awkward discussions on sensitive issues. However, major emitters including China, Russia and India are unlikely to join the 125 economies who have already signed the pledge.
Finalising Article 6 should boost carbon markets
Resolution of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries to voluntarily cooperate to achieve emission reduction targets, was a major triumph at COP26. Many countries are already actively exploring bilateral cooperation on carbon credits, so tightening Article 6 and committing to the setting up of an official body to unify crediting could be another easy win which steers clear of controversy.
Countries will buy time on coal
With energy security issues taking priority, few countries are in a position to uphold their commitments on the phasing down of coal. In some Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries such as Germany, coal-fired power plants are reopening, while globally, fossil fuel subsidies doubled in 2021 – mostly to protect consumers from high energy prices. However, we expect the current reversal to be excused by exceptional circumstances, with advances in carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen making up for it in the long term.
Adaptation financing will be the hot-button topic
With extreme temperatures, drought, floods, storms and wildfires becoming more frequent, we expect developing countries to demand stronger commitments on adaptation financing. So far, developed economies have failed to deliver on the agreed USD 100 billion annual climate financing goal. Yet according to some studies, the cost of adaptation alone will be closer to USD 400 billion a year. And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) puts the cost of mitigation at three-to-six times higher than the capital flows so far committed.
This is likely to be the major stumbling block at COP27, with other issues kept at stalemate until a solution (or at least a partial one) is found. However, ultimately, adaptation pledges are likely to be increased with respect to COP26.

Located approximately 650 kilometres north of Adelaide, BHP’s Olympic Dam site is one of the world’s most considerable deposits of gold, uranium, and copper.
Copper is an increasingly important material in the renewable energy supply chain, and BHP Olympic Dam asset president, Jennifer Purdie, says the mining giant is focused on producing “South Australia’s high-quality copper to build renewable technologies and infrastructure…more sustainably.”
Baseload contract
A baseload contract means continuous power supply regardless of whether the sun is shining or the wind blowing. Such contracts in the power purchase agreement (PPA) space are increasingly common, especially in Nordic states with extensive wind generation portfolios, though the market is also strong in Spain and the US.
However, the trend is only just beginning in Australia, and utility-scale battery systems can be thanked. In a company statement, Neoen says it will deliver a “24/7 green energy solution to the mine, along with the associated large-scale certificates (LGCs).” And it will do this by firming the intermittent wind resources of its 412 MW Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm with storage capacity from its Blyth Battery.
The Blyth Battery received approval this year for up to 300 MW/800 MWh of storage capacity. In August 2022, Neoen announced storage revenues had grown by more than one third in the last year thanks to its Australian battery assets – specifically its Victorian Big Battery coming online coupled with Australia’s energy crisis.
Neoen said this contract is a demonstration that its portfolio of renewable energy and storage assets means it can now offer, “for the first time, firm delivery of green power.”
Louis de Sambucy, Neoen Australia’s managing director, says that the company is convinced its ability to “combine our assets and our energy management capabilities to create bespoke commercial offers will be a key element of success for our future developments.”
The company’s chairman, Xavier Barbaro, concurred, adding that “this first baseload PPA is a significant step forward for Neoen and will serve as a template for future contracts, opening up great market opportunities in Australia and in the rest of the world.”
In Oct. 2021, BHP was signed a similar “bespoke” renewable energy agreement with the Australian arm of Spanish energy group Iberdrola for the 317 MW Port August Renewable Energy Park in South Australia to supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs for its Olympic Dam mining operation. A BHP representative confirmed to pv magazine Australia that the Iberdrola PPA began delivering power to the Olympic Dam site in mid 2022.
The Goyder Renewables Zone, of which Goyder South Stage 1 is a part, is an under-construction hybrid wind, solar and storage project that has approval for 1,200 MW of wind, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW of battery storage capacity.
Construction on Goyder South Stage 1 began on August 25, 2022, and is expected to be operational in 2024.
This is not the first PPA agreement BHP has signed. In 2021 BHP signed a PPA with Risen Energy to supply the miner’s Nickel West Kwinana refinery in Western Australia with renewable energy from its Merredin Solar Farm. However this was not a baseload contract.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/04/longi-launches-all-new-back-contact-module-promising-22-8-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022","Longi launches all new back contact module, promising 22.8% efficiency","From pv magazine Global
Longi Solar has launched a brand new module series, and introduced a ‘hybrid passivated back contact’ cell technology. The new Hi-MO 6 series will initially run in four different formats primarily targeting rooftop and distributed generation projects, and includes products supplied with integrated module-level power electronics. The series will also be available in a range of colors suited to BIPV applications.
In solar manufacturing, 2022 has largely been defined by manufacturers either switching to heterojunction (HJT) technology, or upgrading their existing PERC capacity to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells. By moving to produce back-contact technology, Longi is aiming at even higher efficiency, albeit with a less-established technology that’s still thought to have huge potential.
Datasheets for the new product range promise module efficiencies of up to 22.3%. Additionally, Longi expects to be able to achieve a maximum of 22.8% in manufacturing. And with its new cell technology, the company also expects to gain many of the advantages seen with TOPCon and HJT.
“Modules equipped with HPBC cell technology can generate a greater volume of energy under high-temperature and low-irradiation conditions, and also have superior power degradation performance,” the company stated. Longi added that its simulations show an average yield increase of up to 10% compared to PERC in typical installation scenarios.
With Hi-MO 6, Longi is sticking with the 182mm cell format that it introduced a few years back. The modules will be offered in 54, 60, 66 and 72 cell formats, with power ratings between 410 W and 575 W.
Alongside the new cell technology, Longi is introducing several other module innovations likely to appeal to customers in the rooftop/distributed segment. One module in the series named ‘Guardian’ is to be supplied with built in module-level power electronics, in the form of Longi’s smart optimiser. This allows for flexible system design, real time monitoring and optimisation, and rapid shutdown capability – increasingly a requirement in many rooftop markets.
Another module in the series, marketed under the name ‘Artist’ will be available in various colours and highly customisable to suit building-integrated projects. Back-contact technology itself promises improved aesthetics, since the modules can be designed with minimal gaps between cells and no busbars, making for a smoother appearance.
The series is rounded out by two more products, the ‘Explorer’, which will be available with a black backsheet, and ‘Scientist’, which targets the highest possible efficiency.
All of the modules will be supplied with a 15-year product warranty and 25-year performance warranty, which specifies 0.4% annual degradation from year 2 to year 25, leaving the module with 88.9% of its initial performance after 25 years in operation.
Following today’s announcement, Longi expects to have the full Hi-MO 6 range in mass production before the end of 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/04/107-mw-rackless-earth-mounted-solar-memorandum-of-understanding-signed/,"INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ARIZONA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"NOVEMBER 4, 2022","107 MW rackless, earth-mounted solar memorandum of understanding signed","From pv magazine USA. 
Erthos, an energy technology company with uniquely designed utility-scale Earth Mount Solar PV, announced 14 MW of projects under contract and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a single 107 MWdc project. These agreements are with five of the top US and global utility-scale solar developers, Erthos reports.
What makes earth mount solar PV unique is that the solar arrays are mounted directly on the earth with no mounts or trackers below. While the design is unusual, the company announced the closing of a $27.8 million (USD 17.5 million) Series B funding round in March to scale-up. This follows a $11.8 million Series A in 2019, which launched the company and helped it finalise the earth-mount system architecture. It also funded the development of the autonomous cleaning robot, which drives over the surface of the panels to clean them, which is necessitated by having the solar modules so close to the ground.
While most utility-scale solar installations use single-axis trackers, Erthos said that with the drop in solar module prices, it is more cost effective to buy additional solar modules to make up for the loss of efficiency from foregoing trackers. The company points to other advantages as well, including increased panel density, which can cut land costs. Visual impact is minimal because the modules sit on the ground. And the company says it can install the modules in about half the time, halving the cost.
Maryland-based Chaberton Energy focuses on community solar and is benefiting from Earth Mount Solar PV’s ability to deliver the desired energy on a fraction of the land compared to other solutions.
“Erthos technology allows us to build projects in specific locations that present challenges in terms of land availability and visibility. We’re excited to collaborate with the Erthos team, and we look forward to the opportunity to deploy this technology at more locations,” says Stefano Ratti, CEO of Chaberton Energy. Erthos and Chaberton Energy have executed two Owner’s Architect Agreements for projects in the mid-Atlantic.
Encore Renewable Energy, which focuses on community-scale renewable energy and energy storage development with headquarters in Vermont, has signed an MOU with Erthos for a noteworthy project in its portfolio.
“As a forward-looking company, our team is always looking to improve the value of our projects with innovative technology,” says Chad Farrell, CEO of Encore Renewable Energy. “Erthos is answering that call for a project of ours, significantly improving project economics with its novel earth-mounted approach,” says Farrell.
Path Company, which has operations across the southern US, has agreed to use Earth Mount Solar PV for a community college project in its home state of Mississippi. Erthos offered Path several key benefits, including the lowest first cost for the project, optimal land usage, and access to the knowledge and experience of the Erthos team.
“With Erthos, we are getting a solution adapted to our specific site and project, provided by some of the most experienced professionals in the business,” says Russ Phillips, co-founder of Path Company. “We know our project is in good hands.”
Projects under contract will bring the installed base of Earth Mount Solar PV to 17 MWdc. Additionally, Erthos has signed an MOU for a 107 MWdc project with a yet-to-be-disclosed US developer.
“In this case, the project has very high interconnection costs,” says Jim Tyler, CEO of Erthos. “Erthos offers a clear advantage here because it has two to three times the energy density of a tracker or fixed-tilt system. This makes it ideal for projects with high fixed costs,” says Tyler.
