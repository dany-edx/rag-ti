Perth-based Frontier, formerly mineral exploration company Superior Lake Resources, this week recommenced trading on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) after a strongly supported $8 million capital raising that the company said had validated its new clean energy strategy.
Frontier’s first renewable energy development is the Bristol Springs Solar Project being developed on a 200-hectare site near the town of Waroona.
The solar farm would have an initial generation capacity of 114MWdc but Frontier said additional land acquisition opportunities are available that could allow for an increase up to 490MW. The company also plans to assess the feasibility of adding a battery energy storage system.
Frontier managing director Mike Young said Bristol Springs is well advanced with development approval granted by the WA Regional Development Assessment Panel, an electricity connection application already in progress and world-class supporting infrastructure to ensure rapid advancement towards production.

Young, a former managing director at Vimy Resources, said the project is ideally located between the industrial centre of Kwinana, the Port of Bunbury, and the town of Collie, home to the 300MW coal-fired Collie Power Station.
“The renewable energy industry offers significant growth opportunities, particularly to support nearby aluminium mining and the Collie and Kwinana industrial precincts, all of which require massive decarbonisation,” he said.
“This is why we decided to transition from mining exploration and focus on clean energy opportunities.
“The project is strategically located in the heart of WA’s southwest, one of the fastest growing regional areas in Australia. The local population and the WA government are extremely supportive and progressive regarding the future requirement for renewable energy solutions in the region.”
Young said the project will also have the advantage of “excellent supporting infrastructure” and a highly skilled local workforce, “giving it an advantage over similar but more isolated projects”.
The company said proceeds from the capital raising will be used to advance the project, including completing a solar front end engineering design and undertaking a range of studies relating to the project.

Frontier said it will also investigate other renewable energy projects to build its portfolio.
“One area we are keen to assess is production of green hydrogen,” Young said.
“This is in line with the WA government’s plan to produce and export green hydrogen by 2030 in the same quantity as LNG gas produced for export,” he said.
“This strategy, led by Hydrogen Minister Alannah MacTiernan, has highlighted the need for WA green energy projects and hydrogen manufacturing capability.
“We will also look at investing in other renewable energy projects, such as wind projects or other solar projects.”
The board and management team contributed about $1.9 of the total $8 million capital raising including $1 million from chairman Grant Davey.

Core said it would supply Tesla, which expects to spend more than $1 billion a year on raw materials from Australia for its batteries, with up to 110,000 dry metric tonnes (DMT) of spodumene concentrate for processing over four years.
Core commenced construction on the Finniss mine, located about 80 kilometres south-west of Darwin, in October 2021 and expects to produce its first lithium concentrate in the final quarter of this year. The supply to Tesla is expected to commence in the second half of 2023.
Tesla has agreed, subject to execution of a definitive agreement, to support those plans and incorporate the product into its battery supply chain.

The term sheet remains subject to the parties completing negotiations and execution of a definitive product purchase agreement by August 2022 but Core Lithium managing director Stephen Biggins said on Wednesday he is thrilled to have reached agreement with Tesla.
“Tesla is a world-leader in electric vehicles and its investment in offtake and interest in our expansion plans for downstream processing are very encouraging,” he said.
Biggins said the Tesla deal builds on other offtake agreements secured with China-based companies Ganfeng Lithium and the Yahua Group.
Core said those agreements account for about 80% of the mine’s expected output over the first four years of production.
The offtake agreement is just the latest for Tesla which has looking to secure future supply as the demand for critical battery metals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt accelerates due to the rise in popularity of EVs and battery energy storage systems.
In January, the EV giant Tesla signed an offtake deal with Melbourne-based miner Syrah Resources to supply battery-ready graphite from its U.S. production facility in Louisiana, for four years.

In February, Tesla signed a five-year deal to secure lithium from Perth-based company Liontown Resources.
Liontown will supply Tesla with lithium from its Kathleen Valley project being developed about 400 kilometres north of Kalgoorlie. The mine is expected to begin commercial production in the first half of 2024.
Tesla will buy 100,000DMT of the concentrate in the first year starting 2024, increasing to 150,000DMT per year in subsequent years.
The supply to Tesla will account for about a third of the project’s annual production capacity.
Liontown has also executed an offtake term sheet for Kathleen Valley with Korean electronics giant LG, which has secured up to 150,000DMT of spodumene concentrate per annum
“This means that we now have two of the premier companies in the global lithium-ion battery and EV space signed up as foundational customers, marking a significant step towards realising our ambition to become a globally significant provider of battery materials for the clean energy market,” Liontown chief executive Tony Ottavian said.
“Our shareholders should be proud that future Tesla cars will be powered by Liontown lithium.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/04/fortescue-accelerates-plans-for-gravity-charged-electric-powertrain/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 4, 2022",Fortescue accelerates plans for gravity-charged electric powertrain,"Iron ore major Fortescue has announced plans to spend almost $70 million over the next two years to develop the world’s first Infinity Train which it said would fully recharge its battery using gravitational energy generated on the downhill sections of the miner’s rail network.
The train will be developed in collaboration with Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE), the UK-based offshoot of the Williams Formula 1 motorsport team famous for its initiatives in high-performance battery systems and electrification.
Fortescue acquired WAE for $310 million in January. The acquisition was completed on Wednesday.
WAE is set to remain an independent company to accelerate its growth, while its battery technology division will be closely coordinated with Fortescue. Both will be managed by Fortescue’s green energy, technology and development company Fortescue Future Industries (FFI).
To mark the settlement of the acquisition, Fortescue and WAE have announced plans to develop what it said would be the world’s first zero emission train.
The regenerating battery electric iron ore train project will use gravitational energy to fully recharge its battery electric systems without any additional charging requirements for the return trip to reload.
“The Infinity Train has the capacity to be the world’s most efficient battery electric locomotive,” Fortescue chief executive officer Elizabeth Gaines said.
“The regeneration of electricity on the downhill loaded sections will remove the need for the installation of renewable energy generation and recharging infrastructure, making it a capital efficient solution for eliminating diesel and emissions from our rail operations.”
Fortescue’s current rail operations include 54 operating locomotives and consumed 82 million litres of diesel in the 2021 financial year, accounting for 11% of the company’s Scope 1 emissions.

The company said this diesel consumption and associated emissions will be eliminated once the Infinity Train is fully implemented across Fortescue’s operations, significantly contributing to Fortescue’s target to be diesel free by 2030.
Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest said the Infinity Train will not only support the company’s ambition to reach net zero emissions by the end of the decade, but would also lower the company’s operating costs, create maintenance efficiencies and productivity opportunities.
Forrest also expects there will significant opportunities for the gravity energy technology to be commercialised on a global basis.
“The Infinity Train will join Fortescue’s green fleet under development and will contribute to Fortescue becoming a major player in the growing global market for green industrial transport equipment,” he said.
“The commercial opportunities are obvious for FFI as it pioneers this technology, captures its value and distributes it globally. Less obvious, is that we have an opportunity to not only lower our operating costs, eliminate the cost of diesel from our company but of course eliminate our rail system carbon emissions.”
Fortescue said its studies and development costs for the Infinity Train are expected to be almost $70 million (US$50 million) over the next two years.
WAE chief executive Craig Wilson said the project, which includes the design and construction of a bespoke battery electric powertrain, provides the company with an opportunity to help reduce emissions in the hard-to-abate heavy industry sector.
“High-performance battery and electrification systems are at the core of what we do and now that we are part of the Fortescue family, this presents an exciting opportunity to develop new technologies as we work together to tackle climate change,” he said.
The announcement of the Infinity Train project follows Fortescue’s recent purchase of two 14.5MWh electric trains from Progress Rail, owned by mining and construction equipment giant Caterpillar.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/04/plug-play-electrolyser-for-green-hydrogen-production-from-germany/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"MARCH 4, 2022",Plug & play electrolyser for green hydrogen production from Germany,"From pv magazine Germany
Germany-based electrolyser manufacturer Enapter has unveiled a new electrolyser that is said to be suitable for projects of all sizes via “plug-and-play” operation.
The EL 4.0 electrolyser is the fourth generation of the patented anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyser that the company has been developing since 2017. According to the manufacturer, its technology relies on cheaper materials than the competing proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers. Enapter’s new product is lighter and smaller than previous models and is ISO 22734 certified. The standardised modules could be plugged together for projects of any size.
The AEM electrolyser is available in four versions – AC, DC, air-cooled, or water-cooled. It is claimed to enable the production of 1.0785kg of high-purity hydrogen per day. The maximum power consumption is 3.0kW with water consumption of 0.4 liters per hour. The device measures 482x635x266mm and has a weight of 38kg.
In response to an inquiry from pv magazine about the cost of the electrolyser, Enapter said that the new electrolyser is not yet in mass production but can already offer a price reduction of up to 35% compared to the price of its previous module.” With the ramp-up of mass production in Germany, the costs for the production of green hydrogen would then fall below those for hydrogen from fossil fuels,” the spokesperson from the company stated.
The plug-and-play products could be used in a wide variety of applications, thus promoting decarbonisation in the energy, transport, industry and building sectors. In addition, it is quick to install. “The EL 4.0 will be a building block for system integrators, enabling them to quickly introduce hydrogen production and realise the market ramp-up needed globally. We are sure that the future mass production of these AEM electrolysers will fundamentally change the production of green hydrogen,” said Sebastian-Justus Schmidt, co-founder and CEO of Enapter.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/04/the-major-solar-players-will-shift-from-perc-to-topcon/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MAX HALL,"MARCH 4, 2022",‘The major solar players will shift from PERC to TOPCon’,"From pv magazine Global
The world’s major solar manufacturers can be expected to switch from industry standard PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) products to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology “within the next few years,” according to a US analyst.
The technological shift prompted by manufacturers nearing PERC’s conversion efficiency threshold of 23.7% – for commercially produced products – is one of the predictions made by Denver-based Clean Energy Associates (CEA) in its survey of the solar manufacturing industry during the last three months of 2021.
The analyst also revealed Chinese manufacturer GCL exited the solar cell production market in the fourth quarter of last year, contributing to a slower-than-expected expansion of PV cell and module capacity expansion.
With the CEA citing the removal of old production facilities by Chinese manufacturers; tough global manufacturing conditions; and a difficult trade relationship between solar superpower China and the US as other reasons for delayed cell and module capacities, the analyst said the picture was entirely different for the manufacture of solar panel raw material polysilicon.
The report, announced in a press release issued by the CEA on Friday, estimated 500,000 tonnes of annual poly production capacity will come online this year, with a lot of facilities that were set in train in late 2020 due to hit full production in “early to mid 2022.”
That should see a reverse in polysilicon prices which rose sharply last year, contributing to solar panel price hikes. Chinese polysilicon manufacturer Daqo today announced it had signed a five-year deal with an unnamed “leading solar manufacturing company in China.” Daqo expects to supply around 30,000 tonnes of poly to the end of 2026, with the actual volume and prices to be determined monthly.
Although there were fewer new cell and module production lines ramped up in the closing months of last year, the CEA said it expects expansions to resume pace this year with around 45GW of new annual solar panel manufacturing capacity to arrive by the end of December, and more than 55GW next year.
Chinese demand could play a significant factor with the CEA speculating Beijing could remove clean electricity from this year’s application of its “dual control” policy, which limits energy consumption and the energy intensity of manufacturing processes and which last year prompted electricity shortages.
The solar market will also be pumped over the next four years by manufacturing plans announced in Europe, as the region attempts to wean itself off an over dependence on Chinese supply chains.
The CEA expects solar ingot and wafer production lines could “potentially” amount to more than 20GW of annual capacity in Europe in 2025; cell output capability “could grow” to more than 30GW in that year; and the module figure can be “expected to increase” to more than 45GW by the middle of the decade.
