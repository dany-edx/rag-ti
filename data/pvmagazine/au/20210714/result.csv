The aim of the initiative is to work together with key industry stakeholders from hard-to-abate sectors, exploring solutions to can help them reduce emissions across their supply chain.
The initiative involves some of Australia’s biggest companies from Rio Tinto to BHP, Woodside, BlueScope Steel, BP Australia, Fortescue Metals Group, Australian Gas Infrastructure Group, Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers, Aurecon, AustralianSuper, Cbus, National Australia Bank, Schneider Electric and HSBC.
Together, the participants account for approximately 21% of Australian industrial emissions.
Despite eyebrows already raising over ARENA’s funding of huge multi-national fossil fuel companies to decarbonise, the agency today pledged a further $2 million on top of the $300,000 it had previously awarded the initiative.
The scheme focuses on five supply chains: iron and steel, alumina and aluminium, liquefied natural gas, metals such as lithium, copper and nickel and chemicals including plastics, and fertilisers and explosives. These sectors together represent more than a quarter of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions and approximately $160 billion in exports annually.
With the $2 million in funding, ClimateWorks and Climate-KIC now identify and model credible pathways for industry to transition to net zero emissions, supporting participating companies to implement pilot projects demonstrating these pathways. “The initiative will include rigorous technological and economic analysis of opportunities in each supply chain, and an analysis of systems capable of providing low-cost, reliable, net zero emissions energy. ARENA’s funding will go towards a program of works covering engagement, research, analysis and implementation,” ARENA’s media release read.
The initiative also includes Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO, Rocky Mountain Institute and BloombergNEF as key knowledge partners.

Westerman’s prepared speech grabbed media attention before it was even delivered today with its provocative target. Westerman was, however, keen to clarify what he’s aiming for – which he noted is not quite what’s been reported.
“I’m not saying Australia is going to run at 100% renewable energy for the entire year of 2025, nor am I asking for policy intervention or otherwise,” Westerman clarified during the Q&A part of the event hosted by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA).
Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA)
“The goal I’m setting for us, Australia’s independent system operator, is to harness the talent, capabilities, experience and know-how across the industry to engineer grids that are capable of running at 100% instantaneous renewables penetration and to do this by 2025.”
The key word here is instantaneous, which means the grid can remain stable while powered fully by renewables at any single moment in time, rather than all the time.
“Right now, we are seeing everyday our control rooms grapple with very high and very low periods of instantaneous renewables penetration,” Westerman said.
“Our job is to operate a safe, secure, reliable and affordable energy system, so we need to be in a position where we can manage 100% instantaneous penetration of renewables. That is what our forecasting tell us.”
“This must be our goal, not because of personal ambition or politics or ideology, but because we know this is where we’re headed,” Westerman added.
Per capita, Australia installs renewables at ten times the rate of the global average. “This pace of change is actually well ahead of our own planning scenarios,” Westerman said, referring to AEMO’s ‘step change’ scenario, which was, until not long ago, actually considered Australia most ambitious decarbonisation route.
The dizzying rate of renewable installations has meant Australian electricity networks and market operators have increasingly been constraining variable assets like rooftop solar, wind farms and utility-scale solar farms. That is, they’ve limited how much clean electricity these renewable resources are allowed to export onto the grid.
Westerman doesn’t seem to be particularly fond of this practice, which is why he wants to ready the country’s grids to be able to handle 100% instantaneous renewables penetrations.
“If we’re not in that position, we’re going to be constraining off zero-cost energy for consumers, and I don’t think that’s the right thing,” he said. “We have to be in a position where that is allowed onto the market.”
Instead of imposing constraints, Westernman plans to move forward with that he called a ‘tiered approach’ in which curtailment of renewable assets like rooftop solar would be an absolute last resort.

Australia’s Smart Energy Council has welcomed the pivot. “AEMO has previously championed controlling household solar, something strongly opposed by the Smart Energy Council,” CEO John Grimes said.
“AEMO’s new tiered approach to managing minimum system load is supported in principle, acknowledging there is a lot of work still to be done to ensure Australia makes the best use of abundant solar during the middle of the day,” he added.
Until today, AEMO’s public goal was for Australia’s grid to be able to cope with 75% renewable penetrations at any one time. Taking the leap into this final quarter and ultimately transitioning Australia’s energy system, Westerman said, involves a “kaleidoscope” of challenges.
“The challenges are too big for any one person or one organisation to solve,” he said.
“The answer of how we get from 75% to 100% is that we have to harness the talent and capabilities not just at AEMO but across the industry. We have to work collaboratively, find solutions,” Westerman added.
Innovation is also key, according to Westerman, who pointed to retired thermal power stations which are now simply spin their rotors without actually burning coal and thereby providing inertia to the grid, stabilising it.

Despite the hurdles, Westerman painted an inspiring picture of Australia’s renewables journey, pointing out that since 2012, more than 90 cents of every dollar invested in energy generation in Australia has gone towards solar and wind.
Currently, around 55 GW of projects are proposed on east coast of Australia alone. “It’s almost as much generation capacity as exists today,” he said.
Westerman also pointed out that Australia’s grid has already proven it get accomodate impressive penetrations of renewables, with the AEMO chief noting there are already instances when renewables contribute to more than half of eastern Australia’s electricity supply, up from peaks of 38% in 2018.
“In WA, we’ve reach 65%,” he added, before turning to renewables superstar South Australia – which, last year on October 11, was entirely powered by renewable energy for one hour. A feat Westernman described as “stunning”.
His ambition is to get Australia to a place where such days are not outliers, but regular occurrences.
“That is not decades away, it’s just a few years time and it’s unchartered territory for any large independent grid anywhere in the world.”
Alongside new commitments for Australia’s grid, Westerman also shared his new vision for AEMO itself, for which he become head in May. During the event, he committed AEMO to “greater transparency” and “collaboration”.
Alongside the clear top priority of the market operator, which is planning and integrating Australia’s energy systems, Westerman said his next two priorities involved shifting how AEMO interacts and engages with its stakeholders and “evolving” how AEMO manages itself as an organisation.

Broome has an exceedingly fragile grid, so fragile that the local power provider – state-owned Horizon Power – hasn’t allowed locals to connect even the smallest of solar systems to Broome’s electricity network. The coastal town is far from the only region to experience such solar limitations, which are of increasing concern to the Australian Energy Market Commission and have underpinned the thinking behind its recent rule reform proposals.
On Tuesday, the Western Australian government through its electricity provider Horizon Power, announced an additional 900kW of hosting capacity had been allocated to residential customers in Broome, enough for about 160 households to install solar systems.
Locals jumped at the opportunity, with the allocation exhausted by mid-morning.
This initial release will be followed by 1,400kW in December 2021, the majority of which (1150kW) will be made available to businesses, with the remaining 250kW going to residential customers.
The release brings the total additional hosting capacity for Broome to 2,300kW this year. The state government said the new hosting capacity has been made available as Horizon Power develops technical solutions to support increasing levels of renewable energy.
Customers on Tuesday applied to take up this capacity through a redesigned online application system, which the state government says will deliver a more efficient technical assessment and review for approvals. This will also presumably be how businesses and households apply for the December release.
“Ongoing improvements to the allocation and distribution of hosting capacity when it becomes available will ensure this is distributed in the most equitable way possible,” WA Minister for Energy,  Bill Johnston’s, media release read.

This could cause a solar crisis as soon as this summer,"From Lightning Solar & Electrical
With a surplus of work becomes a deficit of solar installers and this could mean bad news for the industry.
It’s predicted by the end of the year there will be a solar crisis. Panel prices are increasing due to increased shipping costs meaning that sales and marketing type companies won’t be able to sell cheap systems or go bankrupt in doing so.
Here’s everything we know about the predictions and how they may affect you.
Over the past 8 months we’ve seen a huge increase in solar panel demand. Lot’s of frustrated homeowners are looking for the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to their energy bills, and of course, that light is solar.
Since Covid, most homeowners are now working from home. Unlike before, where they would be using energy from the office, they are now having to suck more and more from the grid. This is leaving most with an outrageously high energy bill at the end of the month. The pandemic has caused solar demand to rise a lot.
Of course one of the best ways to combat this in Australia would be to invest in solar. Therefore, many homeowners have begun to make the change to a more affordable future. In turn, this has caused a ‘mini boom’ for the solar industry, and a lot of companies are taking advantage of it.
Along with the help of the solar panel rebate dropping, solar companies are having an abundance of enquiries. Of course, this soon becomes a free-for-all for hungry salesmen and companies offering the ‘cheapest’ price.
This increased demand doesn’t seem to be slowing down either, but can these solar companies handle this extra pressure?
I say rumoured, but we’ve already seen it first hand from our suppliers. There is going to be an increase in the price of solar panels and it’s already started to happen.
This is because there is a global price increase on shipping costs which is unheard of. It’s not only affecting the solar industry but all other industries as well.
However, solar has particularly taken a hit. In Australia, we import 90% of all solar panels and inverters. Known brands like Jinko solar are all from overseas and have taken the hit.
We haven’t seen a price increase like this in years. In fact, solar panel prices have been dropping each year for the past 10 years. This is definitely a big change and something that has arguably been overdue.
So, what exactly does this mean for the solar industry, and how is it being handled?
Up until recently, Australia was not affected by the price change in solar panel supply. This meant that solar companies and installers were taking advantage of the solar boom.
We all know that the solar industry is already a ferociously competitive market, however since there has been an increase in demand, the competition has gotten worse. Left-right and centre prices are being slashed on quotes and systems are being offered at cost price.
Most of the time, the companies can afford to take the hit on selling a system at a cost price because they will cut the costs elsewhere. For example, they will cut costs in solar installation, safety or equipment and after-sales care.
Companies run by sales and marketing types are just cashing in on the solar boom, not thinking about the future.
They will sell cheap systems and cut costs, but for how long will this last?
One of the types of solar companies that will be hit the hardest is the big ones, focusing on volume-based solar systems. Their goals are to sell as many cheap systems as they can in the fastest period of time.
However, this will be their downfall.
Given that the solar industry demand has increased so much, more subcontracted installers are booked up for the next 6 months. This leaves the companies to push people’s installs until the summer.
With this price increase, it may mean that the systems that were sold these past few months won’t be feasible after this price increase. This means that when they come to charge the customer, they will realise that the system they sold is not costing more than the original quote.
I don’t know about you, but I can’t see these companies sticking by their quotes but instead pulling out or going bankrupt. This will leave homeowners frustrated and without solar, potentially causing further demand.
Now that prices have started to increase, all the systems that were sold months ago and pending payments will have to be re-assessed by the solar companies.
Of course, when they quote these systems they leave the margins so tight that they will not be able to absorb this price increase. Instead, they are left with no choice but to cancel or file for bankruptcy.
It’s forecast that solar panel prices will increase as much as 4x the original price (which is unheard of).
Both just as bad as each other, and of course leaving homeowners in the dust with potentially lost deposits.

Both just as bad as each other, and of course leaving homeowners in the dust with potentially lost deposits.
Even more concerning, if these companies do go bust, they leave previous customers and homeowners without the workmanship warranty on their systems. Any faults that happen will be left unanswered.
Of course, it’s very common to see faults in these cheap systems as well because most of the time the companies cut costs by subcontracting the work to unqualified, cheap installers.
Again, this is another reason why it’s so important to not get the cheapest thing. Your house is your biggest asset, so why risk it by buying the cheapest system?
Our solar experts that have been doing this for over 10 years are all predicting the same outcome.
A solar crisis by the end of the year.
This could be triggered by the price increase and the huge demand for solar over these past few months along with volume-based solar companies jumping on the solar boom to get ‘rich quick’.

The government-owned water utility has partnered with English solar inspection and data analysis company, Above, which says it uses thermographic drone inspections detect various module problems like faulty junction boxes, wiring issues, string issues, and Potentially Induced Degradation (PID).
SA Water will use drone-mounted infrared and high-definition cameras collect video data about its solar plants’ modules. Above says its cloud-based platform, SolarGain, then digests the data and distills it into meaningful information using computer-vision algorithms and data analytics. “The software platform enables maintenance teams to locate modules, investigate issues and carry out repairs,” Above said in a statement.

Historically one of South Australia’s largest electricity consumers (in FY2019-20 it spent $86 million on electricity expenses), SA Water has spent the last four years in a concerted journey towards renewable generation. Its invested $300 million on its solar project, the Zero Cost Energy Future initiative, which was completed in May following the installation of 367,769 PV panels.
SA Water is targeting a renewable generation capacity of 242 GWh of energy per annum, with the utility noting its initiative also involves around 34 MWh of energy storage. The water utility’s aim is to get to $0 net electricity costs while also reducing its carbon footprint.
It’s not clear how long SA Water has been employing Above to inspect its solar arrays since the partnership was only announced on Tuesday, but the utility’s Senior Manager of its Zero Cost Energy Future Initiative, Nicola Murphy, said the drone technology has proved to be a useful tool in sustainable asset management.
“We’re proud to be at the forefront in leading a solar project not often seen on such a large scale in the water industry, and it is important that we continue to embrace innovation and new technology such to achieve our project outcomes to benefit our customers and business,” Murphy said.

CEO of Above, Will Hitchcock, says the English company has been operating in Australia for the past three years, and described the partnership with SA Water as a “fantastic opportunity”.
“Investing in digital technologies will enable the utility company to increase solar generation, streamline on-site operational activities and maintain its portfolio of healthy solar plants,” Above’s statement read.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/14/india-could-add-8-5-gw-of-solar-in-fy2022/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 14, 2021",India could add 8.5 GW of solar in FY2022,"From pv magazine India
India is set to see a surge in solar installation in FY2022 and will likely add up to 8.5 GW PV capacity in the fiscal year, according to ratings agency ICRA.  
ICRA expects an aggregate 10.5-11 GW of renewable capacity addition in FY 2022, with solar constituting 8.5 GW, wind about 2 GW, and the rest coming from small hydro, biomass, etc. This compares to just 7.4 GW of new renewables (including about 5.5 GW solar, 1.5 GW wind, etc) in FY2021—a year when the project execution was impacted amid Covid-prompted disruptions.
The RE installation recovery in FY2022 will be led by a strong project pipeline of 38 GW (including about 9 GW wind and the balance from solar and hybrid, etc). This apart, more than 20 GW RE projects are under the tendering phase from various nodal agencies, providing visibility for capacity addition over the medium-term, stated ICRA. 
Girishkumar Kadam, senior vice president and co-group head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited, said, “The RE sector is expected to witness investments of INR 3.5 trillion over the next four years, increasing the share of RE capacity to 34% of the overall installed capacity by March 2025 from 25% as of March 2021 led by the solar power segment.”
The delays in signing power purchase agreements and bid cancellation in expectations of reduced tariff rates remain key challenges before the RE sector. 
However, Kadam sees PPA signing activity for the earlier awarded tenders to pick up as solar bid tariffs are expected to rise in the upcoming auctions amid the rise in module prices and imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on imported solar cells and modules from April 2022. 
Despite a rise, solar power tariffs are expected to remain below INR 3/kWh.
ICRA expects the demand outlook for domestic solar manufacturers to remain favourable. Strong policy support through BCD imposition on solar imports, the notification of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, and a strong order pipeline of about 35-40 GW over the next three- to five-year period under various schemes mandating the use of domestic modules are factors working in domestic manufacturers’ favor. Delays in including the overseas suppliers in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) would further support the demand for domestic module makers in the near term. 
Vikram V, vice president and sector head-Corporate Ratings, ICRA, states, “The policy push for the promotion of domestic module manufacturing is expected to improve the cost competitiveness of domestic OEMs and has led to new capacity announcements of more than 15 GW by various OEMs. The timely commissioning of these new capacities remains important to meet the growing demand from the developers, given the current capacity constraints. Moreover, the ability of the OEMs to achieve backward integration and build economies of scale would be important to remain competitive against the overseas suppliers on a sustained basis.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/14/bringing-the-noise-for-better-solar-cell-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 14, 2021",Bringing the noise for better solar cell efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
As today’s silicon solar cells move closer to their theoretical efficiency limit, and the manufacturing industry continues to scale up, even tiny increases in efficiency can add up. And as the industry begins to look to new technologies that promise even higher efficiencies from complex structures, gaining a deeper understanding of the processes at work within the material will always be of value when it comes to improving their performance.
This was on the minds of scientists led by the University of Utah (UU) in the United States, as they sought to measure tiny fluctuations in electrical current as solar cells and pinpoint the sources of electrical noise, accompanying likely efficiency loss, within a silicon solar cell. Many other studies delving into solar cell materials at this level have relied on microscope imaging techniques to observe the processes at work within the cell. However, in this research the group took a different approach, using a technique called cross-correlation noise spectroscopy to pinpoint sources of electrical noise as a charge is generated through the various cell layers.
“Measuring noise on an object is relatively simple. You can just buy devices that do it. But the problem that plagues us is that these devices also have noise,” explained UU associate instructor of physics Kevin Davenport. “This cross-correlation technique allows us to not only measure the noise of the device, but to also measure the noise of our detector and remove it so that we can see much, much smaller noise signals.”
The technique is described in full in the paper Silicon heterojunction solar cells explored via noise spectroscopy: spatial selectivity and the influence of a-Si passivating layers, published in Applied Physics. The group applied its technique to silicon heterojunction cells, and was able to identify several key areas within the cell where noise was generated and further research could lead to better efficiencies.
“We see this wide spectrum of different noise signals and different positions along the frequency axis. We can say, ‘OK, this part of the note that we see, we can attribute to this physical process and this part is a different physical process,’” said Davenport. “But the device is full of these processes that all generate noise and it’s really difficult to un-entangle them—like pulling out a single voice in a 200-person chorus. This technique allows us to remove a lot of the unwanted portion of the signal.”
One key area they identified was the interface between the silicon layer and the transparent electrode, where deposition of the indium-tin-oxide electrode layer somehow modifies the silicon beneath and creates efficiency-reducing defects. A similar noise signal was detected at the interface with the hole transport layer at the rear of the device.
With the ability to monitor the devices and detect sources of noise at this level, the group hopes its work will open up pathways for further research understanding and mitigating their effects on device performance.
