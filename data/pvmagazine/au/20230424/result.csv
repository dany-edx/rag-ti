Sims, who chairs the new Superpower Institute founded by economist and energy expert Ross Garnaut, said if Australia seizes the “once-in-a-century economic opportunity” offered by the world’s transition to net-zero emissions it can repeat the experience of the China resources boom that peaked about 10 years ago.
“But this time the opportunity can be sustained for some decades – rather than boom and bust – and we can manage it better for productivity and broadly based development,” he said.
Speaking at the inaugural South Australian Industry Climate Change Conference in Adelaide on Friday, Sims said Australia can have more employment and higher incomes in the relatively short term, and be much richer in the longer term, by moving early and decisively away from a carbon-based economy.
“Not only is the transition consistent with a rising standard of living for Australians, it is perhaps also necessary for this to be achieved,” he said.
Sims said Australia has the world’s best combination of wind and solar energy resources, and among the largest resources of the minerals needed in the energy transition and Australian governments and industries should be wasting no time in adopting renewable energy technologies that are ready for commercial deployment, including green hydrogen, because the potential dividends are enormous.
“The logic is simple,” he said. “The world is moving to a zero-emissions economy – albeit at an uncertain speed – and we can have the lowest cost zero-emissions electricity available for large-scale economic development in the world.”

Sims, the former commissioner of the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC), said that by moving quickly Australia could decarbonise 8% of the world’s emissions – not just the 1% of the global total produced domestically.
“Australia’s advantages relative to the rest of the world are so significant that their large-scale utilisation would materially improve the prospects of achieving the world’s climate objectives,” he said.
“Australia covers about 5% of the Earth’s land surface, supplying about 8% of the world’s renewable energy is no stretch given our abundant solar, wind and land resources.”
The Superpower Institute was officially launched in Adelaide on Friday with Sims saying it has been established to change the narrative of the clean energy transition and ensure it is at the heart of economic thinking and industry.
“I am disappointed when I too often see discussion of the economy separate from discussion of the energy superpower transition,” Sims said. “This is strange. Dealing with the fundamental change that the transition to a zero-emissions economy requires should no longer be a side issue or, worse, an issue concerning the costs and difficulties involved in dealing with climate change.”
“The discussion must increasingly focus on the huge opportunities for Australia and how to realise them.”
“My modest aim is to see that all future discussion of the economy has at its centre the energy superpower transition.”
Sims said the Superpower Institute is already up and running and will focus on providing practical research and policy to help governments and industry realise the economic opportunities generated by the clean energy transition.
Initial funding has been secured for projects to use satellites to monitor methane emissions from gas pipelines and to ramp up the OpenNEM project, which publishes data on the National Electricity Market.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/24/batteries-wont-cut-it-we-need-solar-thermal-technology-to-get-us-through-the-night/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"APRIL 24, 2023",Batteries won’t cut it – we need solar thermal technology to get us through the night,"We also need to find new and better ways to create heat for industrial processes. Renewables can supply much of that heat during the day, but energy storage will be required to meet industry’s night-time heat needs.
Solar thermal technology has the potential to provide both long-duration storage and industrial heat, yet it has been largely overlooked in the Australian context. That is about to change.
The CSIRO Renewable Energy Storage Roadmap identifies a mix of technologies will be required, across sectors, to meet Australia’s energy storage needs, particularly at night. Solar thermal will be an important part of the mix.
Batteries alone won’t cut it. They’re good for short-duration storage, ranging from mere minutes to an hour or two. But you’d need an awful lot of them, at enormous cost, to cover 8-12 hours. Solar thermal becomes cost-effective for long-duration storage at scale, and brings other benefits too.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identified storage of four to 12 hours’ duration as “the most pressing utility-scale need in the next decade”. That’s what’s required “to manage stronger daily variations in solar and wind output, and to meet consumer demand, also during more extreme days, as coal capacity declines”.
Most people know about lithium-ion battery (chemical) storage and pumped hydro (mechanical) storage. However, thermal energy storage is not well understood or recognised. This is partly due to perceived costs and engineering challenges. However, as concentrated solar thermal plants are built all over the world – 30 are being developed in China alone – the knowledge base is growing.
More than 80% of Australia’s total energy use involves a thermal process:
A large proportion of these existing fossil-fuel thermal processes can be met with renewable thermal energy storage.

The CSIRO Roadmap found thermal energy storage was a relatively low-cost solution with multiple applications, including utility-scale power generation, renewable fuel production and industrial process heat.
For utility-scale power generation, the lowest cost technology for eight-hour storage in 2050 is thermal energy storage using concentrated solar thermal power. The cost in 2050 was slightly over A$100/MWh, compared with lithium-ion battery at A$140/MWh and pumped hydro at around A$155/MWh.
For 24-hour storage technologies in 2050, thermal energy storage was again the lowest cost at A$99/MWh, compared with pumped hydro at A$145/MWh or grid-charged electrical (using solar photovoltaics and wind) thermal energy storage at A$150/MWh.
Short-duration storage is likely to remain the domain of lithium-ion battery for at least up to two hours duration, and perhaps as high as four hours.
Concentrated solar thermal power uses mirrors to convert sunlight into heat energy. This heat energy is typically stored.
The stored thermal energy can then be used, at any time of day or night, on demand, to produce steam for electricity production, or heat/steam for industrial processes.
The system typically provides for six to 24 hours of operations. What this means is concentrated solar thermal can provide continuous, on demand power and/or process heat 24/7. It can also simultaneously generate power and store heat at the same time.
The stored thermal energy is typically used at night. Concentrated solar thermal systems deployed in China, Spain, the United States, South America, Africa and the Middle East generally have over ten hours of storage, which allows for the overnight generation of renewable power and heat.
Concentrated solar thermal is also a synchronous technology because it uses a traditional spinning turbine (identical to those used in coal-fired power plants). This creates much-needed system-strength and frequency services to the grid. In essence, when coal fired power stations close, concentrated solar thermal is a technology that could continue to provide essential system services.
While more than 100 concentrated solar thermal plants, generating 7 GWh of power, have been deployed around the world, the technology has not yet been deployed at scale in Australia. This will soon change with the construction by Vast Solar of a 30MW concentrated solar thermal plant in Port Augusta, supported in part by the federal government. The project will have 10 hours of thermal energy storage to generate power for supply to the grid, primarily at night. The project will also provide renewable heat and power to produce more than 7,000 tonnes of green (renewable) methanol each year. (Methanol is an essential chemical building block for hundreds of consumer and industrial products such as paints, carpets, fabrics, building materials and liquid fuels).

We need to start building long-duration energy storage systems now, so we have secure and reliable power when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. We also need to replace fossil fuels used to create industrial process heat.
Sectors such as mining, industry, transport, agriculture, and households all require secure, reliable, and affordable renewable energy. For many sectors, this need occurs at night, and that necessitates storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/24/vena-energy-turns-on-taiwans-largest-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,TAIWAN",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 24, 2023",Vena Energy turns on Taiwan’s largest solar project,"Singapore-based renewables developer Vena Energy, the company behind the first large-scale solar farm in South Australia and the first big battery built in Queensland, has flicked the switch on the largest PV project in Taiwan with the 272 MW E2 Solar Project commencing commercial operations.
The E2 Solar Project, built on 226 hectares of reclaimed land off the coast of Taixi in southern Taiwan, was constructed in two stages with the first 134 MW phase of the project commissioned in March 2022. The entire project comprises approximately 680,000 solar panels with an installed capacity of 272 MW, capable of generating about 400 GWh of clean energy annually which Vena said is up to 4% of Taiwan’s total solar energy output, establishing it as a major contributor to the nation’s transition to green energy.
Vena Energy Chief Executive Officer Nitin Apte said the E2 Solar Project is the company’s largest operating project to date and forms a key part of its plans to accelerate the energy transition across the Asia-Pacific.
“Taiwan is a key strategic market in the Asia-Pacific region, and Vena Energy is proud to share the responsibility and make our contribution to achieve the net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050,” he said. “Since 2015, we have successfully commissioned and operated seven solar photovoltaic projects totalling 412 MW, and we are delighted to see Taiwan steadily moving towards the transformation of its energy sector.”

Vena also has its focus fixed on the Australian energy market with the company indicating it has some 6 GW of renewable energy projects planned here.
The company, owned by US-based investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), already operates the 97 MW Tailem Bend Solar Farm in South Australia, and is currently constructing the 85 MW second stage, with a 41.5 MW one-hour battery energy storage system being built at the site.
It recently completed the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South battery in Queensland and has indicated that is just the first phase in the larger Wandoan South Project, which could eventually feature 650 MW of solar and 450 MW of energy storage capacity. The company has also announced plans for a 2,000 MW offshore wind farm in Victoria.
Vena said it has a total of 35 GW of solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, battery storage and hybrid renewable energy projects operating or in development across the Asia-Pacific region.

Most solar panels used today are made from silicon, a well-tested semiconductor material that is not without limitations. For example, silicon loses up to 40% of the energy it collects from sunlight in the form of heat waste. Researchers at Colorado State University (CSU) are studying radical new ways to improve solar power and provide more options for the future.
CSU chemists are proposing to make solar cells using an abundantly available natural material called molybdenum disulfide. Using a combination of photoelectrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, the researchers conducted a series of experiments showing that extremely thin films of molybdenum disulfide display unprecedented charge carrier properties that could someday drastically improve solar technologies.
The experiments were led by chemistry Ph.D. student Rachelle Austin and postdoctoral researcher Yusef Farah. Austin works jointly in the labs of Justin Sambur, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, and Amber Krummel, associate professor in the same department. Farah is a former Ph.D. student in Krummel’s lab. Their work is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Sambur’s lab became interested in molybdenum sulfide as a possible alternative solar material based on preliminary data on its light absorption capabilities even when only three atoms thick, explained Austin.
The collaboration made use of Sambur’s expertise in solar energy conversion using  nanoscale materials, and Krummel’s expertise in ultrafast laser spectroscopy, both of which helped them understand how different materials are structured and how they behave.
Krummel’s lab contains a state-of-the-art ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectrometer that can very precisely measure the sequential energy states of individual electrons as they are excited with a laser pulse. Experiments using this spectrometer can provide snapshots of how charges flow in a system.
Austin created a photoelectrochemical cell using a single atomic layer of molybdenum sulfide, and she and Farah used the pump-probe laser to track the cooling of electrons as they moved through the material. What they found was astoundingly efficient light-to-energy conversion. More importantly, the laser spectroscopy experiments enabled them to show why this efficient conversion was possible.
What they learned was that the material could convert light to energy so well because its crystal structure allows it to extract and exploit the energy of so-called hot carriers, which are highly energetic electrons that are briefly excited from their ground states when hit with enough visible light. The researchers found that in their photoelectrochemical cell, the energy from these hot carriers was immediately converted into photocurrent, as opposed to being lost as heat, which gave it an advantage over conventional silicon solar cells.
“This work paves the way for knowing how to design reactors that contain these nanoscale materials for efficient and large-scale hydrogen production,” Sambur said.
The project was a collaboration with Professor Andrés Montoya-Castillo and Dr. Thomas Sayer of University of Colorado Boulder, who contributed theoretical chemistry and computational modelling to help explain and verify the experimental data.
“The discovery required a ‘team science’ approach that brought together many different types of expertise, in computational, analytical and physical chemistry,” Krummel said.

Vivasvan Solar, based in India, has created a foldable solar structure that can efficiently power water pumps for irrigation by easily moving within or between farms. The system, which consists of PV panels and a variable frequency drive, is mounted on a trolley.
“In Sangli district, a farmer can have two-three sources of water for irrigation, such as a borewell, open well, and an artificial pond. Our mobile system with variable frequency drive is compatible with different solar pumping solutions, providing farmers the flexibility to pump water from any of these water resources on their farm,” Rahul Chavan, director at Vivasvan Industries OPC, told pv magazine.
Transporting portable solar systems can lead to the development of microcracks, particularly on rough, uneven terrains of the field. To address this concern, Chavan noted that spring suspension has been installed on all four corners between the panel arrangement and the trolley platform, with a rubber dampener lining between solar module frames. These act as shock absorbers to avoid damage to the panels. Additionally, the PV panels use a frame made from mild steel that was developed in-house.
Vivasvan Industries has already installed its portable solar structure on a farm at Kharsundi in the Sangli district of Maharashtra. The PV system consists of 15 Axitec 335 Wp panels. Chavan said that the system can be customised from 1 kW up to 7 kW on a single trolley.
