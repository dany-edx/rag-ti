However, targets are one thing; what about replacing capacity pending retirement in the short term? The NEM struggled during the most recent Q2, driven by high input prices and some outages, culminating in the unprecedented market suspension. With the imminent closure of Liddell looming, how well prepared are we?
Cornwall Insight Australia’s most recent Energy Market Perspective explored future commodity prices and how well we were able to compensate for the outages in Q2 2022.
In our report, NSW Q2 2023 was also identified as a hot spot for risk, with Liddell’s impending 1,500 MW of dispatchable capacity expected to be withdrawn by 1 April 2023. We previously discussed this topic almost two years ago when the closure was initially announced.
In this Chart of the Week, we take another look at reserve capacity for NSW based on this FY22 data and modelling the closure of Liddell, with a further hypothetical scenario should Eraring be unavailable.

Concerns over Liddell’s reliability have been apparent for years and were a large reason for bringing forward its eventual closure, and the last year provided evidence for this. Liddell’s three remaining units (after the retirement of Unit 3) have operated at just 55% of its maximum bid availability of 1,260 MW post-April 2022.
Noting that although Liddell has a nameplate capacity of 1,500 MW, it has not submitted a full capacity bid since Unit 3 retired, preferring to operate at a comfortable baseload capacity of 350 MW per unit (83% of operating capacity) overnight and ~250-275 MW per unit (~60% of operating capacity) throughout the day in daytime pricing. Liddell was ramping to maximum during high-priced peaks occasionally.
Since the closure of Unit 3, the plant has had all three units operational 35% of the time, opting for a preferred two-unit operation 44% of the time. Despite these series of changes in operation techniques, Liddell still met ~8.3% of NSW’s total energy requirements this year (Liddell met at least 15% for NSW requirements until 2021).
Looking at reliability in peak periods since Unit 3 left the system and intervals where demand is > 10 GW (~13% of total), we see that the instances of NSW having a lack of reserves to meet peak demand are very limited. It is also important to note that NSW currently relies on other states to meet peak demand, needing to import at least 1,000 MW for 41.2% of the time, 500 MW for 77.8% of the time and 300 MW for 88% of the time. This illustrates a heavy reliance on importing energy during peak intervals to keep prices stable and energy flowing.
With reserves being ‘the ability of available supply to meet local NSW demand’, NSW had reserves of less than 1,000 MW available 10.5% of the time. Removing the availability of Liddell, NSW would have reserves of less than 1,000 MW for 16.8% of the time.
For the sake of discussion and beginning to think about what the retirement scenario for Eraring may look like, given its closure is just around the corner in 2025, the removal of both Eraring and Liddell would leave less than 1,000 MW of reserve for 98% of the time (on FY22 data), with no reserves at all for 73.3% of the time. These figures highlight the expansion needed to replace the looming ~4 GW gap, as seen in our chart.
With only 60 MW of available large-scale storage in the state (Queanbeyan and Wallgrove BESS’), and the pipeline still being murky with only ~450 MW expected by mid-year next year, the ability to replace generation in times of need remains questionable.
The trifecta of Darlington Point batteries has the potential to be online in Q2 next year, but this is just 150 MW. Another 50 MW will come in New England and Broken Hill each. Neoen’s 100 MW Capital battery will likely have a commission schedule in early 2023. The 100 MW Sunraysia Emporium battery has a planned 2023 date, but the news here has quieted down.
But all these are just enough to replace one unit of Liddell for a short time frame. While there are a number of other larger batteries, Tamworth and Armadale, together 300 MW in the works and expected to be operational in 2024 (but have yet to reach financial close) and a number of larger projects announced for operation in 2025, including Eraring 700 MW, Waratah 700 MW, Uranquinty 200 MW, and Liddell 700 MW.
Outside of storage, the Kurri Kurri gas-fired station likely won’t be commissioned until 2024. There is the potential for another ~400-500MW’s of solar to come online, but this does little for peak time demand. The news on wind is not much better, with no public news on the state’s potential commissioning schedules next year.
However, history suggests that it is extremely difficult to get projects operational on time, and this has been exacerbated by the current market and grid conditions, leaving a potential for a significant shortfall in reserves should any further coal units (like Eraring) trip in the short term, but also leaves the market on the edge in 2025 should any of the current pipeline of storage or gas projects become delayed.
The closures of Liddell and Eraring also both hold the potential to have a large impact on the cap market. The remaining thermal capacity should be able to meet the requirements in the short term, but forward fuel markets and another cold autumn and spring hold the potential to cause a disturbance.
Other recent announcements by Queensland and Victoria are positive that investment is expected to pick up. However, there is a stark difference between focusing on the long-term 2030 compared to next year as some storage projects face delays and increased costs.
The question going forward remains: are we prepared for another cold Q2 as we should be? Forward markets for energy and commodities remain high, and slip-ups by the coal fleet at the wrong time can have significant consequences. Furthermore, the reliance on interconnector flow in peak demand can create risk.
Future prices give us some indication of how we will fare next Q2 (refer Chart 2). High fuel costs are likely to remain over the short/medium term, as evident in future prices. This is signalled by ACCC LNG netback prices of ~$50-60/GJ over the short term. Even sustained high gas prices of $40/GJ (Victorian and NSW cap price) translates to short-run marginal costs for gas peakers of around $400-560/MWh to break even (assuming a common standard heat rate of 10-14 GJ/MWh).

Maintaining sufficient available capacity, along with prices that are in the interest of both consumers and investors, will be one of the biggest challenges faced by the NEM as the retirement of ageing coal power plants accelerates and the generation mix features increased levels of renewable generation.
There is plenty of work to be done and investment to be made.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/07/fortescue-lands-grant-for-massive-hydrogen-electrolyser-in-queensland/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 7, 2022",Fortescue lands grant for massive hydrogen electrolyser in Queensland,"Billionaire miner Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) is working with fertiliser and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot Limited (IPL) to develop a large-scale renewable hydrogen production facility at Brisbane’s Gibson Island.
The proposal includes the construction of a 500 MW electrolysis plant capable of producing up to 70,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually, which would then be converted into green ammonia for Australian and export markets.
The project is also investigating the potential retrofitting of IPL’s existing Gibson Island ammonia manufacturing facility to run on 100% renewable hydrogen produced onsite. Currently, the facility uses natural gas as a feedstock.
FFI said on Friday the $13.7 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will help finance a front end engineering design (FEED) study with the companies to also execute a framework agreement to govern the project through to a Final Investment Decision (FID).
With studies having already confirmed the feasibility of the project, the FEED study will refine cost, schedule, permitting and commercial agreements. The study will also examine the development of the electrolyser and the conversion requirements for IPL’s existing ammonia plant to utilise the renewable hydrogen production and offtake approximately 400,000 tonnes of renewable ammonia per year.
It is expected the project will need about 1 GW of renewable energy contracts and that also forms part of the FEED study.
If built, the Gibson Island facility would constitute one of the world’s largest electrolysers. It would also be the world’s first fully decarbonised renewable ammonia plant.

Australia’s Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the project would help Australia become a world leader in hydrogen production.
“The project will provide valuable insights into the cost of producing renewable hydrogen and adapting infrastructure to facilitate exports of renewable ammonia,” he said.
“If successful, the electrolyser will be the largest built to date, feeding renewable hydrogen directly into the first fully decarbonised ammonia facility.
“The study is critical to the domestic and export industry for clean hydrogen and ammonia supply-chains to deliver Australia’s first renewable hydrogen shipments to international markets.”
ARENA chief executive officer Darren Miller said the project would significantly accelerate the development of a large-scale renewable hydrogen and ammonia industry in Australia.
“This is an exciting project for the parties involved and for Australia,” he said, adding companies are now seeing future benefits from engagement with renewable hydrogen technology.
“[They] are looking to build even larger projects,” he said. “Ultimately our goal is to reduce the costs of renewable hydrogen so that it can become … competitive with fossil fuels and we can scale up production and become a viable option for companies to decarbonise their industrial processes or further assist in the creation of a viable export industry.”

FFI chief executive officer Mark Hutchison said about 100 jobs would be supported across the Gibson Island project in the lead up to FID to be taken in 2023, with first production expected around 2025.
“Progressing this project into this final assessment stage is an important milestone in what will be a world-first conversion of an existing facility to become an industrial-scale producer of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” he said.
“This collaboration aims to put Queensland and Australia ahead of the pack – not only in terms of the scale of production and supply of green hydrogen and green ammonia, but also in terms of demonstrating to the world that projects like this are feasible and that Australia has the foresight, the commitment, and the know-how to invest in and deliver them.”
FFI said applications for planning approval for the project will be submitted shortly and the company is working with Powerlink for connection of the project to the Queensland electricity transmission network and with Urban Utilities on sustainable water supply to the project.
The company also said a domestic and international process is underway to canvas potential buyers of the green ammonia that will be produced by the facility.

Together, the projects will generate nearly 1,460 GWh of new renewable energy per year, the equivalent of powering 300,000 homes.
Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said the successful projects will play a key role in fulfilling the government’s commitment to source 100% renewable electricity for its own operations by 2025. The goal includes powering every government school, hospital as well as Melbourne’s entire metropolitan train network with renewably generated electricity.
“We’re powering every government building with cheap, clean renewable energy – boosting investment in the state by over a billion dollars and creating hundreds of jobs as we combat climate change,” she said.
“Victoria is the nation’s clean energy powerhouse, cutting emissions by more than any other state, tripling the amount of renewable energy and creating thousands of jobs.”

The successful projects include the 150 MW second stage of France-based Total Eren’s 200 MW Kiamal Solar Farm being developed near Ouyen in western Victoria. The project also includes a 150 MW/300 MWh battery energy storage system.
The 102 MW Glenrowan Solar Farm being developed by Pacific Partnerships, a subsidiary of the Sydney-headquartered construction and engineering firm Cimic Group, in Victoria’s northeast was also successful as was Melbourne-based South Energy’s 77 MW Frasers Solar Farm being developed north of Traralgon in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley in the state’s east.
The 118.8 MW Horsham Solar Farm and associated 50 MW/100 MWh battery energy storage system being developed by Melbourne-based Esco Pacific east of Horsham in the state’s west also received the tick of approval.
Other successful projects include the 95 MW Derby Solar Project and co-located 85 MW/100 MWh big battery being developed by Sungrow Renewable Energy in the state’s central north, and Octopus Investments’ 80 MW Fulham Solar Farm and 80 MW/100 MWh DC-coupled battery being developed in eastern Victoria.

D’Ambrosio said the projects will help meet Victoria’s legislated renewable energy targets of 40% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 and will also help satisfy the state’s new renewable energy storage target of at least 2.6 GW of energy storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 GW of storage by 2035.
The four successful battery projects will double the state’s current storage with 365 MW and 600 MWh of dispatchable energy for the grid – which is equal to the capacity of all the big batteries installed in Victoria today.
This additional battery storage will help manage network constraints, enhance grid stability, and help lower electricity prices by dispatching renewable energy during high price periods, D’Ambrosio said.
The projects, which will be developed across four Victorian Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) in Western Victoria, the Murray River, Central North and Gippsland, are expected to support 920 direct jobs, create around 290 positions for apprentices, trainees and cadets and deliver $1.48 billion in investment.

The 12-month-long Solar Connect trial, the first residential VPP in the Northern Territory (NT), involves about 50 participants. Most are residential energy customers with rooftop solar PV and a battery energy storage system.
The town-wide trial will comprise about 300-400 kW of rooftop PV capacity while batteries will provide 250-350 kW of instantaneous power and 400–500 kWh of storage capacity.
Newcastle-based energy management software company Switchdin will deliver the technology platform that orchestrates the solar generation and battery energy storage systems in Alice Springs’ isolated electrical grid.
The NT government said the trial will provide data and learnings to inform how small-scale generation can reliably and securely contribute energy into the electricity system to meet security and network needs.
It will also assist in meeting peak electricity demand when needed through the coordinated dispatch of stored solar energy, and support consideration of a framework to unlock value for customers from their solar and or battery systems.
“The VPP will help stabilise the power grid and reduce household dependence on energy from centralised electricity generators,” NT Energy Minister Selena Uibo said. “We know lessons learnt through this project will help inform our future electricity system plans and it is encouraging to see Alice Springs locals contributing to this bank of knowledge through their participation in this innovative trial.”

Future Grid Project director Lyndon Frearson said while the Alice Springs trial will help inform the clean energy future of the NT, it could also be of great significance to the National Energy Market (NEM).
“In addition to Solar Connect demonstrating part of what a clean energy future might look like locally, industry from across Australia is keeping a close eye on what happens here on the Alice Springs grid,” he said.
“That’s because this small but complex electricity system represents something of a test bed for larger grids. It has characteristics of larger grids, but the effects of interventions – such as a VPP – are easier to see, making it quicker and easier to learn what works and what is less effective.”
The Solar Connect VPP is just one of a series of trials, models and investigations being rolled out as part of the $12.5m Alice Springs Future Grid project, a collaborative effort led by the Intyal­heme Cen­tre for Future Ener­gy to iden­ti­fy how Alice Springs – which currently includes about 10% renewables generation – can achieve 50% renewable energy by 2030.

“The project, technically developed by the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The power plant can generate more than 132 million kWh of electricity annually, providing electricity for 40,000 to 60,000 households during peak electricity consumption,” the research institute said. “CAES has the advantages of large storage capacity, low capital cost, long lifetime, safety, and environmental friendliness. It is recognized as one of the most promising technologies for large-scale energy storage.”
The facility is based on a multistage high-load compressor and an expander, as well as high-efficiency supercritical heat storage and heat exchange, said the Chinese Academy of Sciences, without providing additional technical details. It launched the demonstration project in 2018, after developing two compressed air energy storage systems with capacities of 1.5 MW and 10 MW in 2013 and 2016, respectively.
The world’s largest operational CAES system is currently a 60 MW plant built by Chinese state-owned energy group Huaneng, Tsinghua University, and China National Salt Industry Group in Changzhou, Jiangsu province. The facility features a salt cavern, situated 1,000 meters underground and owned by China National Salt Industry Group. The system has an efficiency of more than 60% and is expected to reach a power generating capacity of 1 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/07/indias-residential-rooftop-solar-capacity-tipped-to-rise-by-60-this-fiscal-year/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 7, 2022",Residential rooftop solar capacity in India tipped to rise by 60% this fiscal year,"India’s cumulative residential rooftop solar capacity will reach 3.2 GW by the end of the current fiscal year FY2022-23, nearly a 60% increase from 2 GW as of FY 2021-22 — according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research & Analytics.
The report states the increasing need for cost savings and growing awareness among residential consumers, along with a strong push by the central government, is helping accelerate the pace of rooftop solar installations in India’s residential segment.
“India has more than 300 million households and is endowed with abundant sunshine almost throughout the year, with an annual average of 300 sunny days. This shows that the potential for rooftop solar installations in residential spaces is huge in India. We expect the growth of residential rooftop solar installations to accelerate in the near term across India because of the strong policy push and resurgent market demand,” said report’s co-author Vibhuti Garg, director – South Asia, IEEFA.
The report says Gujarat is the most favourable state for rooftop PV installations, followed by Haryana and Maharashtra. It ranked states in their attractiveness for rooftop solar based on their scores across electricity cost savings, net metering favourability, subsidy availability and disbursal, and electricity distribution company (Discom) rating.
The report highlights that there has been a key change brought about in consumer behaviour and demands after Covid-19.
“The lack of consumer awareness had been one of the major impediments to adoption, especially in the pre-Covid-19 era. However, post-Covid-19, there has been a strong surge in demand, backed by enhanced consciousness about cost savings, the environment, etc,” said co-author Jyoti Gulia, founder, JMK Research.
Interestingly, while the pace of the solarization of India’s residential segment has been underwhelming, the country has been the world’s least expensive residential solar power market for about a decade.
In 2020, the average cost of a residential rooftop solar system in India was $658/kW — 3.3 to 6.4 times less than in leading residential markets such as Japan, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the USA.
The report adds that the central government’s recent push by launching a single national digital portal to simplify the process of residential rooftop solar installations and formalising a direct benefit transfer mechanism will boost capacity addition.
“The new Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme will allow residential consumers to buy rooftop solar systems from any registered supplier of their choice. This broadens consumers’ options for quality products and services,” says co-author Prabhakar Sharma, senior research associate, JMK Research.
The report also finds that some policy hurdles persist at the state level. For example, state governments must resolve issues such as delays in net metering approvals and proper communication of the benefits of rooftop solar installations. Sometimes, state Discoms delay subsidy payments to the installers, disrupting the latter’s working capital flow.
“Concerning the residential solar regulations, all Discoms must grant net metering approvals to the consumers within a strict and short timeline. In the case of residential rooftop solar systems, Discoms, in general, need to be restricted to carrying out two activities: inspecting solar plants and selling the net meters,” said co-author Akhil Thayillam, senior research associate, JMK Research.
In addition, the residential rooftop solar segment currently faces the challenges of increasing overall system costs and weak financing support.
