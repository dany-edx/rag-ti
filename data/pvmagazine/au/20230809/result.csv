https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/09/acen-eyes-company-first-with-1-gw-floating-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,PHILIPPINES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 9, 2023",ACEN eyes company first with 1 GW floating solar project,"Philippines-headquartered developer ACEN Corporation has signed a renewable energy use agreement with the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) to lease 800 hectares of water surface area at the freshwater lake, southeast of the national capital Manila.
“The agreement marks a pivotal step toward the development of a groundbreaking large-scale floating solar project,” ACEN said. “This signifies a notable milestone as the company explores and integrates new technologies into its renewable energy portfolio.”
ACEN President and Chief Executive Officer John Eric Francia told local media the project is still in the pre-development stage but is expected to be completed within two to three years.
“We still have a lot of work to do ahead of us,” he said. “We’re still in the process of the pre-development stage so we have to work on the permitting, we need to work on the grid connection.”
“We have to talk to suppliers because this is the first time we’ll be doing floating solar. Obviously, there will be some differences compared to ground-mounted solar.”

ACEN, which is behind the 720 MW New England and 400 MW Stubbo solar farms being constructed in New South Wales and has partnered with traditional owners to develop more than 3 GW of wind, solar and battery storage in Western Australia, has already applied for solar energy operating contracts with the Philippines’ Department of Energy for the 800ha Laguna Lake area.
Francia said large-scale floating solar projects shape as a “crucial part of ACEN’s master plan” which includes establishing a 20 GW portfolio of renewable energy projects by 2030.
“We are committed to expanding our clean energy assets while addressing land scarcity,” he said.
Laguna Lake is the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines and is close to load centres, being bordered by the growing cities of Calamba, Sta. Rosa and Cabuyao, and the towns of Bay and Victoria.
The 800ha of water surface area granted to ACEN is part of 2,000ha that the LLDA had auctioned off in the southern and eastern areas on Laguna Lake for the development of floating solar projects.
Other winning bidders include Singapore-based Vena Energy and local solar power developer SunAsia Energy which will team with Macquarie portfolio company Blueleaf Energy to develop a 1.3 GW floating solar project on the lake.
SunAsia has secured 1,000ha for its project while Vena Energy will get 200ha with the company planning to deploy about 270 MW of floating solar.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/09/csiro-to-source-5-mw-of-flexible-demand-in-smart-buildings-project/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 9, 2023",CSIRO to source 5 MW of flexible demand in smart buildings project,"The CSIRO said the Digital Infrastructure Energy Flexibility (DIEF) pilot project will use software technology to intelligently control the power usage of up to 200 buildings in New South Wales (NSW), providing access to devices that consume more than 5 MW of power from the grid.
The buildings will be connected to the CSIRO’s Data Clearing House (DCH) software platform, allowing the power usage of the devices to be coordinated to match up with periods of high renewable generation.
The CSIRO said the $11 million (USD 7.19 million) DIEF project brings together a consortium of private companies, and education and government institutions to drive the development of new technologies to support flexible demand for energy.
Flexible demand is the coordinated orchestration of electrical load in response to generation, network, or market signals and offers a way to lighten the load on the grid during busy periods, provide consumers with more control over their electricity usage, and lower peak demand.
“Flexible demand is critical because it ensures grid stability, reduces costs, supports increasing renewable energy integration, and enables a more sustainable and efficient energy system,” CSIRO Energy Director Dietmar Tourbier said.
“This project has the potential to create a new ecosystem of technologies and solutions that will give consumers more control over their energy bills and emissions.”

While flexible demand offers an alternative to the traditionally rigid energy network infrastructure, the CSIRO said the approach is still nascent and requires new technologies, market processes and ways of engaging with energy users.
“The DIEF pilot project will address these issues, bringing together a consortium of project sponsors responsible for funding, research outcomes, coordinating artificial intelligence competitions and onboarding buildings onto the digital platform,” the agency said.
Stephen White, chief research consultant for energy at the CSIRO, said the DIEF project will allow property owners within the pilot to share data and identify opportunities for energy flexibility and productivity improvements.
“This technology will not only allow people to get data out of their buildings and make it accessible to their service providers, but they will also be able to receive data from external providers such as the electricity market and the Bureau of Meteorology,” he said.
“When people process all this data, they can discover cost trends and plan accordingly.”
The data collected during the trial will be used to inform government on the creation of a flexible demand policy and asset register.
Members of the DIEF consortium include electricity retailer Amber Electric, digital tech companies DNA Energy and Nube iO, electric vehicle charging specialist EVSE Australia, and energy technology company Wattwatchers. The consortium also includes Property and Development NSW, research collaborative RACE for 2030 CRC, the University of NSW, University of Wollongong, and the NSW government.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/09/australian-epc-calls-for-female-workforce-boost-to-address-skills-shortage/,"EMPLOYMENT,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 9, 2023",Australian EPC calls for female workforce boost to address skills shortage,"While concerns grow for Australia’s ability to meet its net zero targets and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) sounds alarms that the country is lagging far behind renewables commitments, a major challenge remains the mounting skills crisis, especially in the electrotechnology sector.
While positive initiatives such as the Net Zero Authority have been established and short-term measures are being taken across multiple industries to address the crisis through skilled immigration initiatives, Australian engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services provider ACLE Services argues that half of Australia’s potential workforce cannot be ignored as we look to upskill the next generation of skilled workers.
Currently, just 12% of the construction workforce in Australia are women. ACLE Services by contrast maintains a female workforce of an industry leading 43%.
ACLE co-founder and Director of Construction Brenton Moratto said the generally poor representation of women in the construction workforce presents both a massive risk and opportunity.
“There is no good reason for the industry average to be so low,” he said. “What we are finding is that barriers remain for young women in perceptions that they don’t belong ‘on site’ and in false assumptions around how diverse a career in the industry can be.”

“There are no two ways about it, if we are going to meet our targets as a nation, we need a more inclusive, more robust and more equitable workforce,” Moratto said.
“In our operations we have found that communication and clear paths to career development have made the difference to helping us achieve such high female workforce rates, something we are very proud of.”
“We must get to the heart of the issue of low female participation rates in critical skills such as electrotechnology and renewable energy construction and the government’s announcement of the Net Zero Authority and initiatives such as the National Construction Forum are a great place to start this conversation.”
ACLE Site Supervisor Janie Duval said many of the reasons behind low levels of female participation in the renewable energy workforce are based in misconceptions of clean energy developments, the diversity of essential positions available and the importance of the work being completed.
“It seems very intimidating for women to join construction because there’s a misconception that you need to be physically strong, but construction is more than that,” she said. “It’s about strategic thought when delivering infrastructure or projects, and the more you have diversity the more robust and creative approach you will have to delivering those projects. People often don’t know what it involves and may underestimate the opportunities available to women.”
“When I joined ACLE three years ago as a new entrant, I never imagined that I would become a mechanical supervisor. I never worked in construction or in the renewables sector, but it was interesting to join a workforce and see my career in the sector grow exponentially, with more responsibilities and complex projects to manage.”

ACLE Quality Assurance Manager Anna Heyvaerts is among those women who have moved into the renewable energy workforce and she is delighted with the decision.
“I started as a general labourer and worked my way to quality assurance manager,” she said. “I have a team of quality inspectors and supervisors and have noticed that in almost all projects I’m across, there’s an equal balance of women and men across different levels working together to deliver projects which I think contributes to our success.”
“The crux of the matter lies in fostering a positive work environment where everyone can thrive, irrespective of their gender. An inclusive workplace that allows women to flourish, as well as equips them with the resources, training and projects that showcase their different talents and perspectives.”
“Apart from good workforce opportunities and an inclusive workspace, it is important to also take consideration in hiring women in the recruitment process. Placing importance on who can get the job done based on merit is just as important as ensuring there is diversity and robust perspectives when delivering infrastructure.”
ACLE said while Australia continues to double efforts to meet its renewable energy targets, green-lighting necessary developments and improving approval processes, attention must be paid toward the widening gap between intentions and capability – removing obstacles facing 50.21% of the Australian workforce is a good place to start.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/09/battery-tech-company-teams-with-miner-on-lithium-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 9, 2023",Battery tech company teams with miner on lithium project,"Battery technology company Lithium Australia is to form a joint venture (JV) with Mineral Resources (MinRes) after the miner agreed to help progress the Perth-based company’s patented lithium extraction technology by solely funding the development and operation of a $4.5 million (USD 2.94 million) pilot plant. MinRes will also provide the raw materials to feed the extraction process.
Lithium Australia will contribute its patented LieNA lithium extraction technology which it said uses a chemical concentration process rather than the traditional energy intensive roasting process to extract lithium from raw spodumene.
The company, which will manage the pilot plant’s production process, said its technology is underpinned by its ability to recover lithium from fine and low-grade spodumene that is usually dumped as waste, improving mining efficiency, sustainability and potential profitability.
Lithium Australia said its LieNA technology has the potential to enhance lithium extraction yields by up to 50% more than current market performance.
Lithium Australia Chief Executive Officer Simon Linge said the agreement with MinRes serves as a “powerful validation” of the company’s technology.
“We are excited by the future opportunity to licence our proven high-value technology to all existing and new lithium mines across Australia and the rest of the world,” he said.
On successful completion of the pilot plant operations and engineering study, Lithium Australia and MinRes will form a 50:50 JV that will own and commercialise the LieNA technology.
The JV will initially license the LieNA technology to a larger demonstration plant which MinRes can elect to independently fund, develop, and operate. The larger plant will aim to extract lithium salt at a commercial scale under the licence.
The JV also plans to license the LieNA technology to third-parties with early target jurisdictions including Western Australia and North America, with potential for expansion into Europe and Africa.
MinRes is the second Australian lithium miner moving to add value along the processing supply chain after Pilbara Minerals and Australian technology company Calix last week announced plans to build a trial plant at the miner’s Pilgangoora project in Western Australia.

Under the terms of the partnership, Posco will develop and construct the BIPV materials while East-West Power will test the new products under real conditions at several sites.
The BIPV panels used in the new building material would rely on PosMac, a special steel manufactured by Posco, that is being used instead of glass on the panels’ backside. This innovation is expected to solve the typical challenges of BIPV applications based on glass-glass modules, creating a strong integration of the modules with a building’s structure.
“PosMac features the highest corrosion resistance of all galvanized steels in the world,” Posco claims. “The coating layer consisting of three elements – magnesium, zinc and aluminium – delivers five to 10 times higher corrosion resistance than regular galvanized steel.”
According to the manufacturer, PosMac is particularly suitable for manufacturing electronics and automotive uses, as well as for marine solar panels that are susceptible to severe environmental conditions.
Posco said this new BIPV technology may also be used for applications in agrivoltaics or rooftop PV, without providing further technical details. “PosMAC has proven to be inevitable in building advanced structures which is the backbone of generating sustainable solar energy and bringing agricultural advancement,” the company said in a statement issued in 2018.

They identified global concern for iridium demand, particularly if proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) catalysts are heavily used. In addition, limitations in renewable energy sources and water availability could emerge regionally. The study suggests that addressing these challenges, such as developing PGM-free catalysts for PEMWE, could contribute to resolving resource conflicts in the pursuit of global H2-powered aviation. They described their findings in “Resource requirements for the implementation of a global H2-powered aviation,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management.
Topsoe has signed an agreement with World Energy GH2 to provide its ammonia loop technology for Project Nujio’qonik, Canada’s largest renewable hydrogen facility. The project in Newfoundland and Labrador will target 250,000 metric tons of renewable hydrogen production per year. 
H-TEC Systems has sold a 1 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) ME450 electrolyser to the University of Stuttgart, in order to start a test center funded by the German government. “One particular focus will be placed on bivalent systems that can be operated with renewably-generated electricity if electricity prices are low in the future or with hydrogen in the event of a power shortage.” said H-TEC Systems. 
Enapter has signed a $10 million (€6 million) deal with China’s Wolong to make modular hydrogen solutions in China. The contract includes the delivery of 5 MW multi-core systems for various customers in China, as well as around 130 compact single-core electrolysers (AEM Electrolyser EL 4.0). Enapter said it wants to gain significant market share in China within the next few years.
Verdagy, a US company focused on advanced electrolysis technology for industrial applications, is set to receive an $8.38 million (€5 million) investment from Galp. It aims to reduce costs and reliance on critical raw materials in comparison to existing electrolysis methods. Galp’s funding is part of a larger financing round that secured about $110 million for Verdagy, led by strategic investors Temasek and Shell Ventures. The investment will propel the development and commercialization of Verdagy’s 20 MW electrolyser module, a key component for systems of 200 MW and higher.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/09/jacana-calls-for-supply-of-large-scale-solar-in-the-territory/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 9, 2023",Jacana calls for supply of large-scale solar in the Territory,"The Northern Territory (NT) government-owned Jacana Energy has announced it will open an expressions of interest (EOI) process for the private sector to build three 30-35 MW solar farms that it anticipates will commence operations from about 2027.
The EOI process calls on interested parties to consider connecting at specific locations within the greater Darwin area as the government looks to increase the amount of renewable energy supplied to Territorians.
“The EOI is the first step in a comprehensive process to procure and safely connect and commission more large-scale renewable energy closer to Darwin,” Jacana said, noting that the solar farms project will help the government achieve its renewable energy targets.
The government’s goal is for half of the Territory’s total energy needs to be met by renewable energy sources by 2030, with the proposed solar farms project expected to contribute as much as 15% towards that target.
“The addition of more large-scale solar is a major part of the Darwin-Katherine Electricity System Plan and our EOI is designed to procure renewable energy in way that aligns with this plan,” Jacana Energy Chief Executive Officer Louisa Kinnear said.
“Kicking off a procurement process now ensures that we will be able to make an investment decision that supports the delivery of renewable energy well before 2030.”
The EOI will open on 22 August 2023 with submissions required by 26 September 2023.
The launch of the EOI process comes despite about 60 MW of available large-scale solar remaining offline in the Territory.
Four solar farms that have been built in the NT in the past few years are yet to commence full operations as the developers look to navigate the technical code as outlined by the Territory government-owned Power and Water Corporation.
The Australian arm of Italian oil major Eni has developed a 25 MW facility near Katherine, and two 10 MW solar farms at Batchelor and Manton, south of Darwin. Victoria-based Merricks Capital also has a 10 MW facility at Batchelor.
The Katherine solar farm, that is coupled with a 6 MW battery, has started exporting small quantities but the others are still working their way through technical requirements.
The Power and Water Corporation has said that all four solar farms have had electrical connections constructed and energised and that it continued to support these solar generators through the completion of their on-grid commissioning.
