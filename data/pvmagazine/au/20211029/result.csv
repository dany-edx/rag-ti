The upcoming event – which kicks off at the end of this week – is causing a buzz in political, scientific, and public realms. But what is COP26 – and what’s so important about it?
In simplest terms, COP26 is the 26th United Nations climate change conference (formally known as Conference of the Parties). This year, it’s taking place in Glasgow, which is why it’s also referred to as the Glasgow Climate Summit.
More than 190 world leaders are expected to attend this summit, which runs from 31 October to 12 November.
COPs usually take place annually (excluding last year’s event, which was postponed due to COVID), but every few years, a COP meeting is considered more high profile than others. For example, at the 2015 COP in Paris, the Paris Climate Agreement was born: a legally binding international climate change treaty aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C or, at most, 2°C, by the end of this century.
This year’s COP in Glasgow is set to be another significant meeting.
“One of the things that sets this COP apart is that there is a new narrative: net zero by 2050,” said Matthew England, a Scientia Professor from UNSW Sydney’s Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC).
The term ‘net zero’, also called ‘carbon neutral’, essentially means the goal of producing less carbon than we take out of the atmosphere. It’s like evening out a set of scales: we are trying to bring balance to the currently uneven way we are adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is one of the measures deemed necessary to meet the Paris Climate Agreement’s targets – it won’t fix the excess greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere, but it will help stop the problem getting worse. Getting everyone to commit to net zero by 2050 is one of COP26’s official goals.
“I think this year is different because of the new net zero narrative, and because, basically, we’re out of time,” England said.
“The latest IPCC report came out only a month or two ago, and this report card said it was a code red alert for humanity. How much more of a declaration do you need from the science community to understand the gravity of this situation?”
Setting net zero targets is a good start, said England. But it needs to be backed with proper plans about how we will get there.
“Chasing net zero by 2050 means we’d need to be seeing some big changes in policy and in particular energy policy right now, because it’s not just something you can wait till 2049 to solve,” he said. “The hard work should absolutely be in full swing now.
“I hope COP26 delivers a meaningful and feasible roadmap to net zero, with a big part of that being leaving fossil fuels in the ground.”
England says this is a key way to play our part – not just in Australia, but globally.
“It would be irresponsible to get ourselves to net zero in Australia but still ship our coal elsewhere for others to burn. Once fossil fuels get into the atmosphere as CO2, they stay there for thousands of years,” he said.
“Climate justice is also about exporting our best technologies to help get all of the developing nations on board without building a reliance on fossil fuels.”
UNSW Engineering Professor Greg Leslie, the Director of the Global Water Institute, said he hopes to see more global collaboration at this year’s COP.
“I want to see a greater commitment from developed nations to cooperate, particularly with developing nations, on issues such as the management of wastewater and nutrient run off that contribute 20% of global methane emissions,” he said.
Wealthier countries attending the summit will have a large role to play in this global cooperation. This is because some of the poorest countries are at the greatest risk from climate change – and they have done the least to cause it.
At 2009’s COP15 event in Copenhagen, developed nations agreed to raise $100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries. At COP26, these wealthy countries will need to deliver on their funding promise.
“The global commitment sends a message, particularly to the global south countries, that they’re not going to be left behind,” Leslie said. “The wealthier countries that have the capital to help really need to lead the way in setting up the system so that all countries can contribute.

Earlier this year, the Sustainable Development Report announced that  Australia ranked last for climate action among UN member countries.
“Unfortunately, fossil fuel lobby groups have been very successful at derailing action over the last 30 years,” England said. “But the biggest problem with CO2 is that once it’s in the atmosphere, the natural reabsorption back into the oceans and land takes hundreds of thousands of years.
“That means the commitments we’re making now to burning fossil fuels is locking in climate change for millennia and millennia.”
Leslie, who looks at climate change from a water resource lens, said if we don’t act on climate now, future water resources will be harder to come by.
“A warmer and drier climate doesn’t spell good news for Australia’s water supplies,” he says. “The demands on our water are going to increase suddenly, and the weather extremes that we’re dealing with are really hard to plan around.
“We’re also going to see all sorts of other changes like more impactful storm surges, more energy in the oceans and incremental sea level rise, more bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, acidification, and fish species getting pushed out of local waters with tropical waters moving south – just to name a few.”
Next week, the Global Water Institute is teaming up with the International Universities Climate Alliance, established and led by UNSW Sydney, to present ‘Future water leaders talk climate, commitment, and consequences during COP26’, an event run by UNSW PhD candidates and early career researchers from faculties across the university.
The researchers will discuss the climate action that needs to happen, how the world might change if we don’t meet our climate targets by the end of the century, and what personal messages they’d like to give to their leaders.
“This event featuring our students and early career researchers is important because they are the future leaders that implement the commitments that countries will make at COP26,” Leslie said. “Their voices must be heard.”
COP meetings offer a space where each nation’s action – or inaction – on climate change is put in the spotlight at an international level.
This can be a very powerful motivator in getting countries with inadequate climate change policies to up their game.
“I really hope that countries who agree to net zero but don’t have clear plans on how they will get there are scrutinised,” England said. “Mapping out a pathway to net zero isn’t something you can delay.”
To put this in perspective, the Paris Climate Agreement goals are to limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C by the end of the century. But according to  England, we’re on track for a 3-4°C rise.
“We’re up to COP26, which means there was a COP1. What is deeply frustrating as a scientist is that even back at the first COP meeting, we’d already had the first IPCC report which very clearly spelled out some of the risks of ongoing burning of fossil fuels,” he said.
“Now, some 30 years later, we’re up to COP26, and we’re still seeing politicians, thankfully a dwindling number, pushing for inaction. If progress stalls again at this COP meeting, there could be dire consequences for society.”

West Australia’s largest completed solar installation with an annual electricity output of 274 GWh, Merredin Solar Farm has been exporting at full capacity to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) since August 2020.
SUN Energy’s purchase of the solar farm marks its first foray into the Australian market as it continues to build a “rapidly expanding” renewable energy portfolio in the region.
Established in 2016, SUN Energy is one of Indonesia’s most prominent solar PV developers with a strong focus on the commercial and industrial sector. The company said it has a portfolio of 40 completed projects and 80 MW under contract and is now actively pursuing regional expansion.

SUN Energy said it had already secured 50 MWp of solar projects in key markets including Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam while the acquisition of Merredin Solar Farm will boost its plan to achieve 2 GWp of operational capacity by 2025.
SUN Energy chief executive officer Philip Lee said Merredin is an integral part of the company’s expansion strategy and provides the group with a strong foothold to grow in the most developed and dynamic renewable energy market in APAC.
“The Australian market is key for us, given the long-term potential for renewable energy and its geographical proximity,” he said.
“The acquisition supports our strategy to become one of the leading renewable energy companies in the region, through a combination of new project development and selective acquisitions.”
The Merredin Solar Farm is located on 460 hectares of former farming and grazing country about 260 kilometres east of Perth. The project comprises more than 350,000 solar PV panels and has an annual electricity output of 274 GWh, enough to power about 42,000 Australian homes.
The project, which is adjacent to Western Power’s Merredin Terminal Substation, has also secured development approval to deploy up to 20 MW/40 MWh of battery energy storage onsite.

SUN Energy said it will work with Risen Energy to jointly explore development of the battery energy storage system (BESS) after the acquisition process is completed.
Risen Energy Australia chief executive officer Archie Chen said the solar PV module supplier and project developer will remain as the operation and maintenance (O&M) contractor for Merredin after the acquisition.
“We are very pleased to team up with Sun Energy for Merredin Solar Farm,” he said.
“This is the second large-scale solar farm that Risen Energy has completed in Australia, and the signing of this agreement is well aligned with our long-term strategy to grow our position as a solar powerhouse and to achieve our new growth targets in Australia.”
Risen, which also owns the 121 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland, has previously announced its ambition to deliver 2 GW of renewable energy to the Australian market and Chen said the company is looking forward “to delivering more renewable energy projects to the Australian market in the coming years”.
SUN Energy’s acquisition of Merredin Solar Farm comes just months after mining giant BHP signed an offtake agreement for the facility to supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs for its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
BHP’s power purchase agreement (PPA) commenced on February 1 and will displace around 364,000 tonnes of CO2 over the duration of the contract, which also has an option for extension beyond its scheduled 2031 end date.
The project also has an agreement with Sunshot Energy for the offtake of Large-Scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) generated by the solar farm.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/29/sa-drives-ahead-with-road-user-charge-for-ev-owners/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 29, 2021",SA drives ahead with road-user charge for EV owners,"South Australia is set to join Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) in introducing a distance-based tax on electric vehicles (EV) after the government’s new Motor Vehicles (Electric Vehicle Levy) Amendment Bill 2021 passed the State Parliament’s Legislative Council on Thursday.
South Australia last year became the first jurisdiction in the world to make moves to levy a tax on owners of EVs but the introduction of legislation was delayed amid community opposition. The Bill has now been passed with SA Best members Connie Bonaros and Frank Pangallo and independent MLC John Darley voting with the government to approve it.
In order to secure the Bill’s passage through the Upper House, the government made some changes as part of a total package worth approximately $22.7 million, including a three-year registration fee exemption for new EVs purchased before July 2025.
The changes also include a $3,000 subsidy available for the first 7,000 (up from 6,000) EVs purchased in South Australia following the passage of the Bill.
Those subsidies will not apply for EVs priced at more than $68,750 or for plug-in hybrid EVs.
A parliamentary committee will also be established to examine the rollout of EVs in the state. This would include examining infrastructure, training and the disposal of batteries and other EV components.
The Bill maintains the introduction of an EV road-user charge with owners of plug-in hybrid vehicles to be charged an indexed fee of 2 cents per kilometre, while the owners of any other EVs will be charged an indexed fee of 2.5 cents per kilometre.

The state has however delayed the introduction of the road-user charge by up to five years. The new levy will come into effect on 1 July 2027, or when the sale of EVs reaches 30% of new motor vehicle sales in SA, whichever is earlier. The levy had originally been due to come into effect on 1 July 2022.
Treasurer Rob Lucas welcomed the successful passage of the Bill as a “critical moment for the future of South Australia”, saying the reforms will help drive the take-up of EVs while ensuring a long-term sustainable model for road funding.
“The pace of change is overwhelming, where the future is zero emissions, the future is electric vehicles,” he said.
“As the state transitions towards a higher concentration of zero and low-emission vehicles, it’s vital to ensure all vehicle owners, regardless of what car they drive, contribute to the upkeep of our roads into the future.”
SA joins Victoria and NSW in introducing an EV road-user charge. Tasmania has also announced an intention to introduce a similar charge from 2027. Other Australian states and territories say they are monitoring the rollout of EVs and have not ruled out new charges to make up for the shortfall in lost revenue from the lack of fuel excise.
The road-user charge would be calculated and billed in arrears as part of the vehicle registration process. The charge will be calculated based on the distance travelled since the last registration renewal. This means that for those who pay their registration annually, the first road-user charge payment will not occur until a year or more after the relevant commencement date.
Noah Schultz-Byard, SA director at public policy think tank The Australia Institute, warned the policy would serve only to slow the uptake of EVs in Australia.

Currently, less than 1% of new vehicle sales in the country are EVs and Schultz-Byard said the SA government’s “deeply flawed EV Tax will pull the handbrake on the uptake of EVs and effective climate action in South Australia”.
“We are lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to EV uptake and the miniscule incentives that have been offered with this tax will not change that sorry fact,” he said.
“The Parliament should be looking at all options for how it can best incentivise and increase the uptake of EVs on South Australian roads, not take us in the wrong direction as this tax will do.”
Lucas said the state government had consulted widely with industry, manufacturers and other interest groups on the Bill.
“As part of our ongoing consultation, we acknowledged the need for further incentives which is why we’ve increased by 1,000 the number of subsidies for the purchase of eligible new battery electric vehicles and are giving three years’ worth of free motor reg to eligible EV motorists,” he said.
The Bill will now go to the House of Assembly, which had already passed the original Bill, to consider the amendments.

Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy said the completion of connection works marked an “important project milestone” with construction of the solar farm to be wrapped up in the coming months. The solar farm is expected to commence operations in 2022.
“The team remains mobilised towards finalising construction over coming months and we’re looking forward to delivering affordable renewable energy to CleanCo and Queensland,” he said.
The massive 460 MWp solar farm, being developed on a 1500-hectare site about 20 kilometres southeast of Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region, will generate 400 MW of solar energy, producing more than 1,080 GWh of renewable energy per year.
Powerlink chief executive Paul Simshauser said grid connection works involved building six kilometres of new transmission line and associated infrastructure at the network operator’s existing Western Downs Substation which links to the nearby Queensland/New South Wales interconnector.
“This newly-built transmission line feeds into Neoen’s Hopeland Substation, which has also now been energised to help transport the renewable energy generated at the solar farm to the National Electricity Market (NEM),” he said.
“We look forward to working with Neoen to undertake final testing and commissioning in coming months as solar farm development continues to progress.”

The massive Western Downs Green Power Hub has the backing of state government-owned renewable energy generator CleanCo which has committed to purchasing 320 MW of the solar power produced, which will help the state make progress on its target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
CleanCo Queensland chair Jacqui Walters said the Hub would add significant renewable energy capacity for Queensland, generating enough energy to power 235,000 homes while avoiding 864,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
“The 320 MW of solar energy we’ve secured from this project joins CleanCo’s unique portfolio of wind, hydro and gas generation and enables us to offer reliable, low-emissions energy at a competitive price for our customers,” she said.
“We have a mandate to bring 1,400 MW of new renewable energy online by 2025 and through projects like the Western Downs Green Power Hub we will do this while supporting growth and jobs in regional Queensland.”
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the solar farm, which had sparked more than 450 construction jobs, is “further proof of Queensland’s credentials as a renewables and hydrogen superpower”.
“An economic assessment by Aurecon estimates the project will generate more than $850 million in overall economic activity for Queensland,” he said.
“The ongoing economic benefit is estimated at around $32 million per year for the Queensland economy, 90% of which is expected to directly benefit the Western Downs region.”
The project is part of Neoen’s ambitions plans to have more than 10 GW of capacity in operation or under construction by 2025.

Israel-based underground compressed-air storage specialist Augwind has finalised the construction of its first compressed air storage system for commercial application.
The 250 kW/1 MWh AirBattery system will be connected to a PV system located nearby and will be used for behind-the-meter services by the collective community of Yahel, in the southern, desert part of Israel.
“As part of the test run operations, all system components were activated independently and in sequence, a number of charge and discharge cycles were performed, culminating in electricity generation,” Augwind CEO Or Yogev told pv magazine. “This is the first time since the feasibility study at Yakum that the AirBattery system is being tested on a commercial scale of 1 megawatt-hour, this is a significant milestone for Augwind in its technological roadmap, ahead of the construction of high-voltage commercial projects in the future.”
The system works according to the same principles of Augwind’s large scale projects. It is based on two compression inflatable polymer tanks that are placed in the ground close to each other, in addition to a series of storage tanks. The tanks are covered by steel frames, which create a sort of cage around them, and these are then placed in holes at a depth of 4m.
Renewable energy is used to power standard water pumps, which inject water into the compression tanks. The tanks are sealed, so the air they contain starts to be compressed up to the top and then shifts to the storage tanks. With on-demand energy, the compressed air is released from the storage tanks to drive a powerful water turbine which is used to generate electricity.
“The 250 kW/1 MWh system is [a] first of its kind combination of pumped-hydro and compressed-air energy storage in a modular and scalable technical approach that can provide distributed, long-duration energy storage for a variety of applications,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The AirBattery is using circular water and air as raw materials, with pumps and turbine for power charge and discharge, and compressed-air as the storage element, implemented with Augwind’s proprietary underground tanks, enabling dual land use above the system.”
Compressed air energy storage (CAES) may become an interesting solution for countries such as Israel, with weak interconnection with their neighbours, according to scientists from Finland’s Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). Crucial for the identification of an ideal location for large scale CAES projects, should be the proximity to renewable energy infrastructure and the electric grid.

Norwegian business intelligence firm Rystad Energy has predicted rising solar module and shipping costs could prompt the delay or cancellation of as much as 56% of the solar generation capacity currently planned worldwide next year.
With the average price of solar modules having risen from $0.20 per Watt-peak last year to $0.26-0.28 since July, up to 50 GW of the 90 GW of solar generation capacity planned for 2022 could be threatened by inflation, according to the Oslo-based consultant.
Modules and shipping costs typically make up between a quarter and a third of solar project capital costs, according to Rystad, and both input costs have soared on the back of a shortage of shipping containers, exacerbated by the Covid crisis; and rising prices for solar panel raw materials polysilicon, silver, copper, aluminium, and glass.
The polysilicon price alone has almost quadrupled in recent months and the shipping costs for solar panels have risen almost sixfold, from $0.005/Wp, in September 2019, to around $0.03 this month.
With Rystad senior renewables analyst David Dixon stating the supply bottlenecks are unlikely to ease within 12 months, the company has calculated the levelised cost of energy from solar projects is likely to have risen 10-15% from the average figure posted last year.
That will leave solar project developers with a stark choice of either reducing their margins, passing on the costs in the form of more expensive solar electricity, or postponing or cancelling solar plants.
