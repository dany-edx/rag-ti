Pacific Partnerships through its energy business, Pacific Partnerships Energy, will develop, invest in, and manage Glenrowan Solar Farm with fellow Cimic Group company UGL to undertake construction, operations and maintenance. Cimic said this week that UGL has already started early works for the project, including design, procurement and construction planning. The project, which has a committed grid connection in place, is expected to commence operations by the end of 2023. Esco will remain involved with the project after signing a long-term asset management contract for the solar farm.
Esco managing director Steven Rademaker said the Glenrowan project is one of seven solar farms totalling more than 800MW that the company has now developed and delivered in the Australian market. Esco also has a project pipeline in excess of 2GW across the National Electricity Market (NEM) and is the asset manager for a 670MWp portfolio of operational utility scale solar projects.
“Achieving this milestone on our Glenrowan Solar Farm is a fantastic outcome for Esco Pacific, bringing our developed project capacity to 820MWp of utility scale solar in Australia and cementing our position as one of the leading developers in the market,” Rademaker said.
“Our team has shown that we can continue to develop and deliver high-quality assets to market, while working with a new Australian solar equity investor.
“We are delighted to have delivered this shovel-ready project to Pacific Partnerships, and we welcome the commencement of construction activities.”
The Glenrowan Solar Farm is the first large-scale solar farm to be owned and developed by CIMIC Group as principal withPacific Partnerships managing director Simon Nicholls revealing the company is now pursuing large-scale renewable generation, storage and generation assets.
“The acquisition of the development rights to Glenrowan Solar Farm is part of our strategy to establish a diversified portfolio of energy and utilities assets within the National Electricity Market,” he said.
The Glenrowan Solar Farm, being developed on a 245-hectare site about two kilometres south-west of the township, is expected to generate more than 260GWh of clean energy per year, enough to power approximately 45,000 Victorian homes.
Victorian network utility AusNet Services has been appointed by Pacific Partnerships to deliver the new grid connection infrastructure.
AusNet said it will, along with its construction partners, design, build, own and operate the transmission assets for the solar farm.
AusNet will build approximately five kilometres of new 33kV grid connection assets from the solar farm to the Glenrowan Terminal Station. AusNet will also install a new 120MVA transformer at the terminal station. Detailed design work is currently underway, with construction expected to commence later this year.
AusNet chief development officer Chad Hymas said the project will be the third renewable energy generator to connect to AusNet’s network in the Glenrowan area.
German investment company Wirtgen Invest’s 149MWp Glenrowan West Solar Farm came online while Spanish renewables developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures 85MW Winton Solar Farm has also been connected.
“We are proud to be supporting Victoria’s transition to renewable energy,” Hymas said. “We are supporting local jobs and delivering …a more sustainable future for Victoria.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/01/transgrid-announces-milestone-for-2-3bn-interstate-transmission-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 1, 2022",Transgrid announces milestone for $2.3bn interstate transmission project,"Transgrid has confirmed that works have begun on the $1.8 billion New South Wales (NSW) section of the 900-kilometre Project EnergyConnect that will link the energy grids of NSW, South Australia (SA) and Victoria, and support the development of new wind, solar PV and energy storage projects.
Project EnergyConnect, a joint venture between Transgrid and SA network operator ElectraNet, will link Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW to Robertstown in SA via Buronga, with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria. The interconnector will provide 800MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions and is forecast to unlock some 5.3GW of new renewable energy projects.
The project shapes as a critical link in the National Electricity Market (NEM) with proponents claiming it will enhance power system security and allow for the further development and integration of renewable generation into the nation’s main grid.
Transgrid chief executive officer Brett Redman, who was among those who attended a ground-breaking ceremony in Buronga in NSW’s far west on Tuesday to mark the start of construction, said the project “will help deliver the grid of the future”.
“EnergyConnect is a once-in-a-generation transmission project that will help to revolutionise the National Electricity Market,” he said. “The project will be a key component of the future grid, which will enable the integration of renewable generation and support the decarbonisation of the nation’s economy.”

Redman said the project, Australia’s biggest electricity interconnector built to date, would increase wholesale electricity competition and help drive down electricity prices.
“Once completed, the project is expected to save NSW energy customers $180 million a year,” he said.
Transgrid is building the 700km section of the transmission link stretching from Wagga Wagga to the SA border. ElectraNet commenced construction of the 200km SA portion of the project, from the border to Robertstown, in February.
ElectraNet interim chief executive Rainer Korte said the project will improve energy security in both states and help accelerate the transition to a grid based around wind, solar and storage.
“EnergyConnect is a landmark project of national significance that will enable more renewable energy and improve the affordability, reliability, and security of electricity supply,” he said. “We are delighted to see the start of construction on this critical project in both South Australia and NSW.”

The project is being built for Transgrid by construction partner SecureEnergy. Early works on the western section have already commenced with major works set to begin next month. The first stage of the works include the construction of a 135km transmission line between Buronga and the SA border, a 22km link to the Victorian border and an expansion of the existing substation at Buronga.
SecureEnergy project director David Whatmough said the size of the project creates significant employment opportunities with an estimated 1,500 jobs to be created during construction.
“The scale of the project means we will engage a workforce which is on an unprecedented scale for a transmission asset construction project in this country,” he said.
“EnergyConnect is one of the first of many that will change the industry across Australia and represents a significant part of the transition taking place in the energy sector.
“From a power engineering construction perspective, it provides a fabulous opportunity to grow the next generation of people who want to work in this industry.”
Project EnergyConnect will involve the installation of more than 9,000 kilometres of cabling, and the erection of 1,500 new transmission towers, using more than 30,000 tonnes of steel. It’s estimated more than 60,000 cubic metres of concrete footings will be poured for the transmission towers and planned substation works which will include upgrades to two existing sites and development of a third site.
Construction of the eastern portion of the project, spanning Buronga to Wagga Wagga, is expected to start in 2023, with the full project expected to be completed by 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/01/hydrogen-industry-calls-on-government-for-transition-deadlines/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 1, 2022",Hydrogen industry calls on government for ‘transition deadlines’,"The Australian Hydrogen Council (AHC) has urged the new Labor government to fast track the introduction of new policies, research and investment, warning market forces will be too slow to develop the local industry in time to make good on the emissions reductions needed to mitigate climate change.
AHC chief executive officer Dr Fiona Simon, who will speak at the Australian Hydrogen Conference in Adelaide today, said hydrogen has huge potential to deliver significant economic, employment, energy and environmental benefits for Australia but the new government needs to lay down policy foundations to develop the industry as “the eyes of the new energy world are fixed on Australia”.
“Our trade partners are closely watching how we develop this market and the work of our members is making people sit up and take notice,” she said.
“But the hydrogen economy can’t wait for market forces alone to drive decarbonisation. We need policy certainty and co-ordination to get this market to scale.
“This could include market mechanisms to value carbon emissions, clean energy and fuel standards, taxation support for research and development, new investment, and targeted transition deadlines.”
Hydrogen has been touted as a critical component of Australia’s renewable future with new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese identifying it as key to his strategy to increase the share of renewable energy in the National Electricity Market to 82% by 2030 as part of his pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by the end of the decade.

While Labor has yet to present a dedicated hydrogen policy, Albanese has vowed to transform Australia into “a renewable energy superpower,” underwritten by a $3 billion investment in renewables, including solar, large-scale renewable projects, green hydrogen and hydrogen electrolyser manufacture.
While Australia is aiming to become a major player in global hydrogen production and trade, Simon said pressure is mounting as the effects of climate change became increasingly evident and energy security remained a priority issue across the world.
“The time for action is now,” she said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel has urged Australia to use “all the tools available” to deploy renewable energy as quickly as possible to decarbonise the global energy system.
Speaking at the Australian Hydrogen Conference on Tuesday, the Australian government’s Special Adviser for Low Emissions Technology said that to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the impact of global warming, human civilisation was undertaking the biggest transformation of energy systems since the taming of fire.
“So substantial that in the naming traditions of the stone age, the iron age, the bronze age, and the industrial age, it could be argued that we are entering the electric age,” he said.
“We need to use all the tools available to us to deploy renewable energy as quickly as possible.
“The key to bringing net-zero (emissions) within reach will be to electrify everything.”
Finkel said electricity would not be ideal in some circumstances, highlighting the need for hydrogen and other products.
Finkel echoed Simon’s push to develop a market for clean hydrogen, calling for a “laser focus” on the development of a market and the need to build demand for the energy source.
“As I look at the hydrogen landscape today, I see an imbalance in supply and demand. Yes, we’ve identified many important uses for clean hydrogen, but they will not develop overnight.”
Finkel suggested one option is for more businesses to co-locate sites of hydrogen supply with demand. He said the option would entail installing combined solar, wind, and hydrogen production capability adjacent to mines and manufacturing plants. Over time, hydrogen could be introduced into the production process.
The Australian Hydrogen Conference, which wraps up today, has brought together energy experts from across the sector to explore the latest projects, challenges, opportunities and lessons and to help shape the industry’s future.

Former shadow treasurer Chris Bowen is set to become the new minister for climate change and energy, taking over the portfolio from Angus Taylor. 
Bowen was elected to the seat of Prospect, NSW in 2004, and is now the member for McMahon following the electoral redistribution in 2010. Bowen has served as the Shadow minister for climate change and energy since a shadow cabinet reshuffle in January 2021. 
That reshuffle saw then shadow minister for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, a senior member of the Labor Left faction and author of Climate Wars (an account of the sordid history of Australia’s internecine climate politics) replaced by Bowen, a member of the Labor Right faction. This softening on Labor’s climate policy and rhetoric was hoped to attract more centrist voters, and judging by Labor’s stunning election victory, the decision paid off.

Work to be done
Energy Networks Australia (ENA) welcomed the appointment of Bowen to the climate change and energy portfolio, with ENA CEO Andrew Dillon saying the sector is looking forward to working with Bowen to deliver Australia’s transition to a net zero emissions energy system. 
“Australia’s energy networks have a vital role to play in decarbonising the energy system. Our members are aligned on the importance of creating a whole-of-system approach that sees transmission, distribution and gas networks working together to achieve Australia’s net zero ambitions,” said Dillon.
“Timely and efficient investment in new transmission is an urgent priority and we look forward to working with the incoming government to ensure its Rewiring the Nation policy delivers the more connected grid electricity customers need,” continued Dillon, who added that the newly elected government’s Powering Australia policy to convene an urgent national energy council meeting of state and territory energy ministers “is strongly supported.” 
After the leadership of Angus Taylor saw much antagonism between state and territory leaders and the federal government, it is no wonder ENA is looking forward to working with a more coherent outfit. 
Realignment with states and territories will be the first cab of the rank for Bowen. So far, investment and support for renewables have been severely lagging at the federal level, which is why states and territories have taken up the reins themselves. 
Once the states and territories and the Commonwealth are on the same page, the big task will be arranging the processes and regulations around the development of the electricity transmission grid, especially if Australia is to meet Labor’s target of 82% renewables by 2030 or the more optimistic scenarios envisaged under the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Integrated System Plan (ISP). 
During the election, Labor proposed $20 billion in finance for the expansion of the transmission grid in order to unlock Australia’s renewable energy potential. But increasing interstate infrastructure and unlocking proposed renewable energy zones will need more than just a proposed figure. 
Of course, none of this mentions the problem pressing every Australian’s pocket right now, or at least, every Australian who hasn’t protected their back pocket with rooftop solar and, even better, a residential battery system. That is to say, surging energy prices. 
Fearing embarrassment, former prime minister Morrison pushed the Australian Energy Regulator’s (AER) release of its new default market offer (DMO) until after the election. Thankfully Morrison was embarrassed anyway. 
Nevertheless, the DMO means surging prices show no signs of stopping. The hikes are, in part, the result of geopolitical and macroeconomic circumstances. But as Bowen pointed out in a speech last week, “Higher prices are a result of nine years of policy failure … the fact of the matter is the lack of energy policy, the lack of investment in new energy, the lack of investment in renewable energy, and the lack of transmission over the last nine years, means that Australians are paying more for electricity than they should be.” 
“Renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy,” Bowen continued. “The good news is that Australia now has a Government which will bring on more renewable energy through our investment in the grid.” 
Giving Australia a climate change policy we can proud of will be a signature reform of the Albanese Government.

“Angus Taylor knew these power prices were going up. Angus Taylor knew that this report was coming out. Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison knew that the result of their policies was Australians paying more in their power prices. They got through an entire election campaign without telling the truth. They sat on this report, they approved its delay until after the election. This is very much the legacy of Angus Taylor, they put power prices up and they’ve been dishonest about it.”
Interestingly, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has already called on the Coalition to give bipartisan support to Labor’s energy policy. Whether the incoming shadow energy minister and the federal Coalition will listen is another matter.
Clean Energy Council (CEC) CEO Kane Thornton posted a letter to the new climate change and energy minister on Twitter last week, urging Bowen to make good on renewable energy pledges. “I hope you’re well rested,” said Thornton, “because there’s a lot to do, and not a minute to waste.” 
“Mind, you do not have to do everything,” Thornton continued. “State and territory governments responded to the policy vacuum and stepped up … If we get it right, we put Australia back on the path to becoming a global clean energy superpower and restore our rightful place as a glowing example of a modern and prosperous economy powered by reliable, low-cost, clean energy. Saturday showed the Australian public is with us, so let’s get to it.”  
Clear policy
Perhaps Bowen’s biggest job will be providing the much-needed clarity of policy that investors have been crying out for. The co-founder of global renewable energy investor Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners (QIP), David Scaysbrook, who had previously cited Australia’s federal policy inertia as a reason investors were weary, said the 2022 Election has put “Australia back on the map in the eyes of global institutions looking at renewables and decarbonising industry.” 
The advantages of a clear policy on climate change have already been demonstrated by prime minister Albanese when he joined fellow leaders from the US, Japan and India at the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) on his first day in office. And again by new Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong, whose climate-oriented visit to Fiji played a major role in 10 Pacific nations rejecting a sweeping new agreement with China. 
Albanese to the Quad: ""We will act in recognition that climate change is the main economic and security challenge for the island countries of the Pacific. Australia will set a new target to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030, putting us on track for net zero by 2050."" #AusPol
— Michael Mazengarb (@MichaelM_ACT) May 24, 2022

Wong’s pitch to the Pacific community strongly emphasised the newly elected Australian government’s determination to act on climate change, a plea well received by Fijian Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama, who described his meeting with Wong as “wonderful” while also taking a swipe at former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s comments referring to the Pacific as Australia’s “backyard”. 
Fiji is not anyone’s backyard — we are a part of a Pacific family. And our greatest concern isn’t geopolitics — it’s climate change.
In that spirit, I had a wonderful meeting with Foreign Minister @SenatorWong to strengthen our Vuvale Partnership with Australia. pic.twitter.com/RH80dPnCAk

Majority rules
With Labor very likely having secured a majority government with a 77th seat, prime minister Albanese won’t have to make deals with the crossbench to find a speaker, a crossbench greatly expanded by the influx of climate-oriented Teal independents. This may mean less pressure on the government to pursue strong policy on climate change.
However, numbers are still tight and this historical crossbench will no doubt play a big role in the next parliament, set to convene at the end of July.

OpenSolar said the Academy delivers not only cutting edge software tools but also the knowledge necessary for solar professionals to grow their businesses and excel at what they do.
OpenSolar co-founder and chief executive officer Andrew Birch said the collaboration with GSES creates a seamless experience between designing and selling solar systems to customers, and participating in a wide variety of training courses such as solar PV and batteries design and installation and Australian standards.
Birch said the platform would be useful not only to keep accreditations up to date for a solar business, but it opens the door to more knowledge for more of a solar company’s employees in the native software environment that they use daily.
“Since the election it’s very clear to us that Australia intends to double down on its leadership in rooftop solar,” he said. “Experienced Australian installers and new people that will undoubtedly now enter the solar workforce will benefit from the leading solar design and sales platform now combined with the leading solar knowledge platform.”
GSES founder and managing director Geoff Stapleton said the platform would build on the company’s existing renewable energy engineering, accreditation, training and consultancy offerings.
“The next logical step for us is to integrate our online, self-paced training with a toolset that Australian installers are using every day to design, sell and install for their customers,” he said. “The partnership is well positioned to support Australia’s growing renewable energy workforce.”

Green hydrogen is considered essential when it comes to decarbonisation and future energy supplies. The hydrogen economy is still in its infancy, but the German government says generation capacity will be increased to 10 GW by 2030.
German consultancy Aurora Energy Research has reported that hydrogen projects with a total output of 21 GW have already been announced in Germany, but only a fraction of them have been realised. The analysts estimate that the industry will need up to 300 TWh of green hydrogen by 2050.
They assumed that the average costs for the renewables-powered production of green hydrogen will fall to around €5 (AU$7.5) per kg by 2025. They also assumed that industrial buyers will not be ready to pay more than €5 (AU$7.5) per kg in the coming years. But from 2030 onwards, they are optimistic that green hydrogen imports will continue to reduce costs. That said, transport infrastructure such as ports and pipelines will need to be set up first.
Aurora Energy Research has determined that at prices of more than €5 (AU$7.5) per kg, the combination of solar with onshore wind farms is the most profitable option. However, maximum project profitability can only be achieved if wind and solar parks are coupled together with small electrolysers for the production of green hydrogen. Aurora Energy Research sees the lowest green hydrogen production costs via the combination of 50 MW of wind power, 50 MW of PV, and 20 MW of electrolysis.
The analysts also assumed that if green hydrogen is generated via power purchase agreements, without direct co-location of a renewables plant, the production costs could also reach €5 per kg.
“Since the locations for the renewable systems can be optimised in these cases and the electrolyser can be built closer to the customers, the costs for hydrogen transport and potentially also for hydrogen storage decrease,” they said.

Chinese state-owned energy group Huaneng, Tsinghua University, and China National Salt Industry Group have commissioned the first salt cavern for compressed air energy storage in China.
The Jiangsu Jintan Salt Cavern Compressed Air Energy Storage Project is located in Changzhou, Jiangsu province. It has a storage capacity of 300 MWh and a power generating capacity of 60 MW. 
The facility features a salt cavern, situated 1,000 meters underground and owned by China National Salt Industry Group. The system has an efficiency of more than 60% and is expected to reach a power generating capacity of 1 GW. Huaneng Group built the plant and is now operating it.
“Its commissioning marks the qualitative leap of China’s compressed air energy storage technology from theoretical experiment to engineering application, and provides a new energy storage scheme for the construction of a new power system with new energy as the main body,” Huaneng said.
The China Energy Storage Alliance (CNESA) noted a number of advantages with non-afterburning compressed air energy storage power generation technology. They include high capacity, long life cycles, low cost, and fast response times.
“The completed project will help to solve the problem of wind and solar curtailment, alleviate the current challenge of energy shortage in Jiangsu province, and promote the commercial development process of advanced technologies and equipment in the domestic energy storage industry,” said CNESA.
