The tender was described by the Clean Energy Council as a “shot in the arm for the clean energy industry” following a marked slowdown in financial commitments for new utility-scale renewable projects over the last two years.
The Victorian government said the auction “at least” 600 MW of new clean energy, including solar and wind, helping the government meet its target of powering all its operations with clean energy by 2025. The ambitious goal includes powering every government school, hospital as well as Melbourne’s entire metropolitan train network with renewably generated electricity.
The auction is part of the government’s plan to drive investment in all six of its Renewable Energy Zones, with this second auction expected to deliver $1 billion worth of economic investment and 2,000 new jobs to the state.

The auction will have strong local content requirements to ensure more of the work generated by the auction is delivered in Victoria, the Victorian government said. It will also include “robust obligations on proponents” to share project benefits with local communities.
“The tender will stimulate a new wave of economic activity in regional Victoria, delivering thousands of new jobs in construction and opportunities for local supply chains,” the Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said. “It will also put Victoria in a very strong position to meet and beat its 40 per cent renewable energy target by 2025,” he added.
The tender closes on 8 November 2021, with successful projects expected to be announced in the middle of 2022.

The Yoorndoo Ilga Solar farm is one of three sites comprising Amp’s 1.3 GW Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia, which will also include solar farms coupled with storage in Robertstown (636 MW) and Bungama (336 MW). Amp has set out an investment in excess of $2 billion for the hub’s creation, which is planned to also generate hydrogen for both the domestic and export markets in future.
Following the recognition of the Barngarla People as native title holders of large parts of the Upper Spencer Gulf and Eyre Peninsula, the land will be leased to Amp and project developer EPS Energy in accordance with the terms of an Indigenous Land Use Agreement.
With land secured, once development and other approvals are completed, Amp says its Yoorndoo Ilga solar farm will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 100,000 homes each year, with a total investment in the Whyalla region exceeding $500 million.
The Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation’s (BDAC) board is supportive of the land deal, saying they are “proud to be part of the renewable energy revolution”.
“This is a history making deal and we look forward to Amp developing these projects on our traditional lands, which we now own in fee simple. We look forward to the benefits of this project to our members and to the broader community of Whyalla overall,” the BDAC said in a statement.
Amp has already secured development and land approvals for both the Robertstown and Bungama projects, and setting an energisation date in late 2022. With land secured for its third and final hub project, the company’s expansion into Australia which began in 2017 is now well and truly underway.
Amp’s currently has 158 MW of operating or under construction solar assets in NSW, including the 39 MW Molong Solar Farm near Orange. Its South Australian hub will significantly increase the company’s presence here, which it clearly sees as a strategic location for investment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/31/solar-could-supply-77-of-australias-electricity-demand-by-2026/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 31, 2021",Solar could supply 77% of Australia’s electricity demand by 2026,"Solar in Australia could supply up to 77% of total electricity demand at times by 2026, the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) has revealed in its annual Electricity Statement of Opportunities report published today.
The report predicts new renewable energy generation and energy storage projects will be able to supply the country as coal-fired plants retire, contradicting concerns around reliability and supply shortfalls.
“No reliability gaps are forecast for the next five years, primarily due to more than 4.4 gigawatts (GW) of new generation and storage capacity, as well as transmission investment and reduced peak demand forecasts,” AEMO chief executive Daniel Westerman said. AEMO is also confident about the following five years to 2031, so long as proposed renewable generation, storage and transmission investments are actually committed.
In fact, AEMO has pointed to coal plant failures, like the flooding at Victorian’s Yallourn plant in June, as the most pressing reliability threat.
AEMO has bumped up its solar forecasts from last year and now estimates 8.9 GW of new distributed PV capacity will be installed by 2025. In addition to utility-scale solar plants, AEMO forecasts 6.5 GW of that capacity will come from commercial and residential solar installed in the NEM, which includes every state and territory except Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
With solar booming, focus has now shifted from fears of supply shortfalls to demand shortfalls, as more houses and businesses power themselves through their rooftop systems.

AEMO is expecting electricity demand in the main electricity market to drop to a record low of between 4 GW and 6 GW by 2025, down from 15 GW in 2019. This drop in minimum operational demand, which is happening even faster than last year’s predictions, has been flagged as a major threat to power system security, with AEMO noting the necessity for reforms as well as government policy to accelerate electrification of homes and transport, which would at least partially reverse the downward demand trend.
“Without additional operational tools, we may no longer be able to operate the mainland NEM securely in all periods from 2025 due to a lack of security services when demand from the grid is so low,” Westerman said. “These conditions may occur earlier than 2025 under abnormal network conditions, such as network and generation unit outages, possibly associated with bushfires or storms,” he added.
Westerman pointed to the Energy Security Board’s recent reform recommendations as addressing some of these issues. Despite delivering a suite of reforms around the integration of distributed energy resources like solar and batteries, headlines have been dominated by the proposal of a capacity market, which many fear the Morrison government will shape into a “coal-keeper” scheme.

Given the capacity market proposal seeks to solve the issue of reliability, the Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said the mechanism seems “unjustified in light of the current reliability outlook”.
Since AEMO’s report last year, a number of planned thermal generator retirements have been brought forward, including the Yallourn Power Station (now scheduled to close in 2028), one unit of Eraring Power Station (2030) as well as the mothballing of one unit of Torrens Island B Power Station expected in October.
If no additional dispatchable energy or transmission projects come into the market, these early closures could cause reliability gaps in Victoria and New South Wales from 2026 to 2031, AEMO said.
Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO)
While early closures have potential to be disruptive, AEMO pointed out that the coal plants themselves are a threat to reliability. “Coal-fired generation reliability remained at historically poor levels last year,” the report said.
“While some plant improvements are expected in the near term, most generators are anticipating a trend of decreasing reliability in the longer term, increasing supply scarcity risk. The accelerated exit of coal and growing risk of plant failures is increasing the need for dispatchable projects,” it added.
This shift away from thermal generation towards clean energy will require a range of new services, AEMO said. It is looking for the market to provide solutions like frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), fast frequency response (FFR) and recovery services, load shifting, and active management of distributed energy resources. Such services are increasingly being provided by big batteries as well as new inverter technologies, with rules currently being introduced to accelerate this.
Storage like batteries and pumped hydro are also increasingly important as solar shifting devices, “soaking” excess solar generation by storing it or having demand flexibility. The aim, AEMO said, is to restrict the curtailment of large and small scale solar systems to be a last resort.

Australia has seen a massive spike in storage projects with investors backing 650 MW of large-scale batteries this year alone, amounting to an annual increase of more than 400%. In fact, the pipeline of publicly announced storage projects, beyond those already operating and committed for operation, includes 21 GW of battery storage and 6.3 GW of medium to long-term duration storage.
Demand flexibility solutions could also be provided through new uses for electricity, AEMO said, including hydrogen production and electrification of industrial processes and transport.
For the first time, AEMO has this year included green hydrogen as a scenario in its modelling. Named the “hydrogen superpower” scenario, it is the next progression from the ‘Step Change’ trajectory Australia is currently following.

“Momentum is building in the industry as the development of a hydrogen economy may simultaneously enable a significant new export opportunity and provide a means to achieve carbon emission reduction objectives,” AEMO’s report said. “There are now more than 10 projects at the 100+ MW scale being actively developed across Australia, and many more at a smaller scale.”
AEMO has also considered a path called ‘Strong Electrification sensitivity’, in which case hydrogen uptake is limited and energy efficiency is also muted, leaving the majority of the emissions reductions to be achieved through electrification.
If there are strong incentives for electrification of transport, residential and industrial sectors, including heating, Australia could add almost 81 TWh of additional consumption by 2031. This is equivalent to 46% of total current operational consumption in the NEM.

“Beyond the next decade, the potential growth due to electrification, hydrogen production and associated zero-emissions industry is forecast to be even more significant, with NEM consumption potentially doubling by 2050,” the report added.
AEMO predicts if the current rate of large-scale wind and solar development continues, there could be sufficient renewable resources available in 2025 to meet 100% of underlying consumer demand in certain periods.
In July, Westerman announced AEMO is readying Australia’s grid for such instances, eager to end the curtailment of clean energy assets which have plagued Australia’s landscape. This is a decisive shift away from the traditionally favoured thermal generators, which are difficult and slow to ramp up and down, towards what Westerman calls “zero-cost renewables”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/31/spanish-consortium-to-simplify-hydrogen-production-through-photoelectrocatalysis/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SPAIN",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 31, 2021",Spanish consortium to simplify hydrogen production through photoelectrocatalysis,"From pv magazine Spain
After almost a decade of work, a team of researchers from Spanish energy companies Repsol and Enagás has managed to develop a pioneering technology for the production of renewable hydrogen from the direct use of solar energy in a process known as photoeletrocatalysis.
The consortium launched the first proof of concept of a photoelectrochemical cell, of no more than 1 cm2, in November 2020 and has now installed the 1 m2 pilot plant at the Repsol Technology Lab, in Móstoles. The next step will be the construction of a demonstration plant in the industrial complex that Repsol has in Puertollano, in central Spain, with the aim of reaching commercial maturity before 2030, the oil company said in a statement.
Both companies have created a joint venture that is intended to bring other investment partners into the project.
Ana Martínez, a researcher at Repsol Technology Lab and one of the project leaders, highlighted the role that hydrogen will play as a key energy vector in decarbonisation. “It will allow, on the one hand, to store renewable energies on a large scale, and, on the other, use it as fuel in different sectors, such as mobility, in the residential and industrial fields and, also, as a raw material in industry,” she stated, noting that the electrolysis had not yet reached a sufficient level of competitiveness.
The project is a 100% Spanish R&D development, led by women and carried out in collaboration with several of the most prestigious hydrogen research centres in the country.
This technology simplifies the production process with respect to electrolysis, currently the most widely used technology for the generation of renewable hydrogen. This renewable electricity is transported to an electrolyser where the water molecule is separated into hydrogen and oxygen. Photoelectrocatalysis, however, integrates the process in a single step. “The device receives solar radiation directly and with a photoactive material it generated the electrical charges that cause this separation”, explained Repsol researcher María Dolores Hernández.
With this alternative, the losses associated with the transport and transformation of electricity are avoided, which means that the photoelectrocatalysis technology improves the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. This simplification in infrastructure and equipment will also reduce investments in this technology, which also has the great advantage of not depending on the price of electricity. “The project’s roadmap is designed so that, in 2030, the gas generated by this technology can compete in costs both with that produced by conventional processes from natural gas, and with that obtained by electrolysis,” continued Hernández.
The Energy Research Institute of Catalonia, the Institute of Electrochemistry of the University of Alicante, the Hydrogen Foundation of Aragon and the engineering company Magrana are involved in the project. “The initiative is led on both sides by women, both the technical team and the business development team,” said Enagás researcher Mónica Sánchez. “In this sense, the project shows a commitment to female researchers and is a clear example of the change in recent years in our role in large technological projects within the business world.”
The plan to reach the industrial and economic maturity of this technology has two additional scaling stages defined: A demonstrator that will start up in 2024 in Puertollano, with an area close to half a hectare and with a production of 100 kg a day of renewable hydrogen; and a final phase, scheduled for 2028, with the installation, also in Puertollano, of a plant, already in the industrial phase, of about 60 hectares and with planned production of up to 10 tonnes per day.
Both companies are incorporating renewable hydrogen into their respective businesses. At Repsol, it will be applied both in its industrial refining and chemical processes.
Repsol and Enagás, which have so far invested €8 million in the development of the project, have proprietary rights to the technology, which has resulted in 65 patent applications in more than 30 countries around the world.

Scientists from Germany’s Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP have developed a new process aimed at lowering the series resistance of monocrystalline PERC solar cells.
The new technique was tested in partnership with German company CE Cell Engineering GmbH. “Contacting surface structures (emitters) of solar cells with high sheet resistance is already technically possible, but costly,” said Stephan Großer, project manager in the diagnostics and metrology group at Fraunhofer CSP.
“The series resistance of the contact structure on the solar cell increases due to high contact resistances, which significantly reduces the efficiency of a solar cell. In the project, we were able to lower the series resistance by using laser-assisted current treatment and elucidate the active principle.”
Through this process, which was dubbed laser enhanced contact optimisation (LECO), the researchers were able to identify faulty semiconductor-to-metal contacts in the PERC cells and to establish where there was insufficient electrical contact formation between the metal and semiconductor. Furthermore, all this happened without damaging the solar cells.
“The optimisation of the contact takes place through a large number of microscopic current-fired contact points, which enable… very low series-resistance between the metallic silver contact finger and the doped silicon wafer,” the research team further explained.
The Fraunhofer CSP is currently evaluating the LECO process parameters for patenting.
