Despite these headlines, Australia is off to a slow start with electric vehicles. They accounted for only 3.8% of all vehicle sales in 2022, rising to 6.8% of new car sales in February 2023.
The federal government is working on the first National Electric Vehicle Strategy to make them more accessible to Australians. With tax exemptions, more affordable models and the expansion of a limited charging network, 3.8 million electric vehicles are expected to be on Australian roads by 2030.
As the numbers grow, an increase in electricity demand for charging is inevitable. Careful planning is needed to manage this growth at a time when concerns have been raised about the power grid’s capacity to meet the demand for electricity.
However, early findings from our ongoing research on the use and charging of electric vehicles suggest they will have a more limited impact during peak demand periods than some have feared. Ultimately, they could improve grid stability, with “batteries on wheels” feeding in electricity at times of need.

The impact on the grid depends on the number of electric vehicles and how much and when they are driven and charged. Another factor in the future will be how they transfer energy back into the grid.
To date, information on how these vehicles are being driven and charged in Australia is limited. The UQ Teslascope Project, launched in 2021, aims to fill this knowledge gap. Our new report offers preliminary insights.
We collected and analysed minute-by-minute data on driving and charging from 230 electric cars across Australia. We found the average daily distance driven is 30 kilometres. That’s about the same as for all passenger vehicles in Australia.
On weekdays, most driving happens during morning and evening peak hours. On the weekends, a relatively high proportion of driving is in the daytime.
 
We estimate each vehicle uses just under 10 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. That’s about 40% of the daily use of a four-person house in Queensland.
Importantly, only 25% of energy consumption from charging occurs during peak hours (6-8am and 4-8pm) when the grid is under the most strain. This suggests owners are generally charging their cars in a grid-friendly manner.
Around 31% of charging occurs overnight (8pm-6am). This could be a result of people taking advantage of lower electricity costs overnight on time-of-use tariffs and/or charging their vehicles at a convenient time and place.

About 44% of charging happens during non-peak daytime hours (8am-4pm). As more than half the study participants had rooftop solar, this suggests owners are already timing their charging to take advantage of solar energy.
Average daily energy use is higher on weekends than weekdays. As expected, more top-up charges (small volume charges that don’t necessarily fill the battery) occur on weekdays.
Our research reveals electric car users are, consciously or not, mostly charging them in ways that don’t stress the grid. As the numbers of these vehicles grow, encouraging a higher proportion of charging events outside peak hours will be beneficial.
Proper management of charging could help better integrate renewable electricity sources with the grid, save millions of dollars in grid investment and open up low-cost charging opportunities to electric vehicle users.
In Australia, almost one-third of homes having installed panels, one of the highest rates in the world. By 2050, two-thirds are expected to have rooftop solar. As the number of electric vehicles and the share of renewable energy increases, incentives to encourage users of these vehicles to charge during specific hours of the day are likely to be beneficial.

In the future, these vehicles may help integrate renewables into the grid by acting as batteries on wheels. The vast majority of cars in our study have 50% or higher battery charge at the start of a driving event. That’s much more charge than an average trip requires. This suggests a good amount of spare battery capacity is available.
This spare capacity could help to smooth variable electricity output from renewables. Vehicles could charge at times of high renewable production, then supply energy back to their homes or the grid during peak demand hours or times of low renewable output. In this way, they could help support a grid with high renewable penetration.
We’ve received funding from the Energy Consumers Australia’s Grants Program to continue exploring how shifting EV charging can benefit consumers and the grid. If you have an electric vehicle, you can help with this research by signing up on our website.

“The agreement with Ampyr Energy provides MPower with the financial framework required to commence portfolio construction,” MPower Chief Executive Officer Nathan Wise said.
“The innovative funding model has been designed to provide the company with funding flexibility in the design and construction phase, while allowing both parties to participate in the upside from the long-term supply of renewable energy to major power grids across Australia.”
Sydney-based MPower said an agreement has already been executed for the first $10 million (USD 6.68 million) in funding which will support the construction of a 5 MW solar project being developed at Narromine near Dubbo in western New South Wales (NSW).
Wise said work on the Narromine Renewable Energy Project is scheduled to commence in the coming weeks and it will take about nine months to get the project to revenue generation.
MPower said the project has already secured all necessary permits and will connect into the Essential Energy network, generating approximately 14,000 MWh of electricity in its first year.
The Narromine project forms part of MPower’s plan to establish a build, own and operate portfolio of up to 20 small utility-scale solar farms and battery energy storage systems throughout Australia’s eastern states.

The company has made it clear that its focus is squarely on the mid-scale sector, with projects of 5 MW or less being particularly attractive as they can avoid more protracted grid connection processes.
“We couldn’t get comfortable with some of the risks around large-scale renewable energy projects, in particular the grid and connection risks that are really part and parcel of those larger projects,” Wise said.
“We identified the advantages of these small utility-scale projects, in particular the relatively short time it takes to both develop and construct them, but also the ease of connection and the ability to export power as and when you generate rather than being under the direct control of the market operator.”
“There is a lot of risk that is circumvented by taking a portfolio approach with these smaller projects rather than investing everything in one larger asset and we’re particularly attracted to the weather diversification, the network diversification and the other elements of the portfolio that you get when you put multiple projects together in a portfolio.”
For Ampyr, the funding agreement marks an expansion of its involvement in the Australian clean energy market.
Ampyr Australia Director Ben Salmon said the company, which late last year announced it would team with oil major Shell to develop a 500 MW/1,000 MWh big battery at Wellington near Dubbo, has identified Australia as a growth opportunity.
“We are excited to be expanding our renewable energy activities in Australia where we see enormous opportunities emerging from the transition to clean energy,” he said.
Construction of the Wellington battery energy storage system is expected to commence later this year. Once operational, Shell Energy will hold the rights to charge and dispatch energy from the asset.

The Whyalla hydrogen plant is to comprise a 250 MW green hydrogen production facility, a 200 MW hydrogen power plant and associated storage infrastructure capable of holding 3,600 tonnes of hydrogen. The government said the design and construction of the  project will help “accelerate South Australia’s green hydrogen industry, unlock the development of a $20 billion pipeline of renewable energy projects and catalyse the creation of new jobs in the supply chain industries.”
Hydrogen Power SA, the government agency looking after the taxpayer-funded project, said it initially received about 60 expressions of interest last year to build the facility and that has converted into 29 formal proposals under a tender that closed last week.
The agency said it had received responses “from organisations across Europe, north and south America and the Asia Pacific, including here in Australia, seeking to help pioneer the green hydrogen industry in South Australia.”
“The proposals tendered included representations from major renewable energy companies, equipment manufacturers and technology providers,” the agency said.
The government process is focused on the supply, construction and operation of the hydrogen plant and equipment, along with offtake agreements for the green hydrogen produced at the facility.

Hydrogen Power SA said it will now undertake an evaluation of the proposals received and expects to announce the successful party by July with the green hydrogen power plant to be operational by December 2025.
South Australia Energy Minister Koutsantonis said the facility will play a major role in the establishing the state as a significant global player in green hydrogen production and give it an early advantage in the rapidly emerging space.
“As the world looks to decarbonise, South Australia is making a once-in-a-generation investment in green hydrogen, an investment that places the Upper Spencer Gulf region at the epicentre of a renewable energy revolution,” he said.
The government said it has already secured land options near Whyalla for the power plant and associated green hydrogen production and storage facilities. The sites are within a 15-kilometre radius to the northeast of the city and close to critical infrastructure and transport links.
The government said the scale of the sites allow for future expansion of the scope and size of operations.

The Charging Ahead – Australia’s Battery Powered Future study, produced by professional services company Accenture, estimates that growth in demand for batteries has increased by 64% in the past two years and will continue to accelerate to the end of the decade.
The study says increased adoption of electric vehicles (EV) is the “key driver” behind the growth with demand for stationary energy storage and a global acceleration in the energy transition also contributing to the surge.
Based on the new forecasts, the study estimates that pursuing a diversified battery industry, which includes downstream processing and manufacturing activities, would create $55.2 billion in additional gross domestic product (GDP), generating $16.9 billion in gross value added (GVA) to the economy by 2030 and supporting 61,400 jobs.
If Australia remains focused on capturing opportunities from mining raw battery materials the report forecasts that $10.4 billion in GVA will be added by 2030 and $25.8 billion in additional GDP will be generated.

The study says that given the country’s mineral wealth, the opportunity for Australia to grow its role in the battery supply chain is large but warned it is facing intensified global competition as other nations have also woken up to the prospect.
“Given the accelerated pace with which battery industries are developing and consolidating, Australian governments will need to act quickly to support battery industries to capture shares in high-value market segments,” the study says.
The Charging Ahead study recommends six strategic priorities to support battery industry development, including alliances, attracting large anchor tenants to Australia, coordination through government strategies and other policies, regional export partnership with neighbouring countries, and increased collaboration between industry and academia.
FBICRC Chief Executive Officer Shannon O’Rourke said the acceleration of global investment in battery industries means Australia’s window of opportunity to compete is narrowing and “the time to act is now.”
“In light of recent geopolitical developments, our report has shown Australian policymakers should explore more aggressive industry policies, target markets that are looking to diversify their supply chains, and partner with geopolitical allies to enable and enhance the potential growth of Australia’s battery industry,” he said.
The study says Australia must leverage its advantages of critical mineral wealth, reliability and security as an export partner and its environment, social and governance (ESG) credentials to capture the opportunity across the value chain.
Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic acknowledged the need for swift action, saying Australian firms will need to work quickly to ensure a window of opportunity did not “close on us”.
Speaking at the National Press Club this week Husic said Australia was in a unique position to take a leading role in the battery industry and needed to take an ambitious approach and avoid “loser talk” that had previously seen Australian innovations made overseas.
“There’s a window of opportunity to become a key player in battery manufacturing and the battery value chain, and then export that on to the world stage,” he said.
“We can’t let that window close on us. We are recognised as possessing some of the greatest stores of critical minerals and rare earths on the planet, and that’s why I’ve said if we mine it here, we should make it here. And we have the know-how and attitude to do so.”

IRENA says developers installed 295 GW of renewable energy throughout the world in 2022, driving up global cumulative installed capacity by 9.6% to 3,372 GW. It was a year of record growth, largely based on newly installed PV systems, according to IRENA.
The organisation says 191 GW of solar was installed last year. It notes that growth is still largely concentrated in a handful of countries and regions such as Asia, the United States, and Europe. Asia accounted for 60% of new capacity additions, where 1.63 TW of renewables are now installed.
China accounted for almost half of the new global renewables capacity in 2022, at 141 GW. A total of 57.3 GW were added in Europe in 2022 and 29.1 GW in North America, according to IRENA. Africa continued its steady growth at 2.7 GW, slightly above the figures for the previous year.
“This sustained record growth demonstrates the resilience of renewable energy amid the current energy crisis,” said IRENA Director General Francesco La Camera.
IRENA says hydropower still accounts for the largest share of installed renewables capacity at 1,255 GW. But last year, only 21 GW were added. Solar is catching up and last year passed the terawatt milestone of installed capacity.
IRENA has listed the top 10 global PV markets in terms of cumulative installed capacity:

Bureau Veritas, a French certification specialist, said that it has noted growing interest in its Hydrogen Label certification scheme, which was launched in February 2023.
The company did not provide specific figures, but it said that different entities from Europe, Australia, the United States, and the Middle East have expressed interest in certification.
“Many operators see the independent certification as a means to demonstrate to respective regulators about the carbon footprints of their green hydrogen generation supporting the claims for the government incentives for producing green hydrogen and also to gain bankability of their projects with investors,” Rajiv Sabharwal, vice president of business development and energy for Bureau Veritas North America, told pv magazine.
The French company will assess renewable hydrogen production assets against environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, while also considering safety processes and greenhouse gas emissions.
“It will also assess the renewable energy that is used to power the electrolyser,” Sabharwal added. “The scheme’s biggest differentiator is its assessment of safety in addition to the life cycle assessment of the carbon footprints of green hydrogen, which aims to facilitate the global trade of hydrogen with a consistent definition of renewable hydrogen.”
He said that North America will be a major hub for the generation, consumption, and export of clean hydrogen, due to the incentive schemes in place in the United States. He added that midstream infrastructure and electrolysers will require significant investments.
“The industry will be challenged by a lack of harmonised regulations, supply chain issues, and availability of trained manpower,” said Sabharwal. “It will need extensive investment to overcome this issue in the next 10 years.”
Bureau Veritas said that the final step in its scheme will be to issue labels after verifying the amount of hydrogen produced by certified assets.
“The label stipulates that the asset must have a carbon footprint below 2 kg CO2 equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen,” the company said. “Quarterly verification of the hydrogen output and the renewable electricity input will be required to maintain the label.”
