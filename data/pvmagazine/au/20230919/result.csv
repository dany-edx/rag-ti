Today, a team of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science announced they were able to achieve a key stage in photochemical upconversion in the solid state. This, they say, is a key breakthrough as it enables the possibility of functioning upconversion devices to be manufactured at a commercial scale.
“I think people are going to immediately start copying us,” UNSW Professor Tim Schmidt, the senior author of the study and an Exciton Science Chief Investigator, said. “I consider this a breakthrough because this approach can be adapted to upconverting into the ultraviolet or from the infrared. There’s so much we can do with it.”
On top of its potential applications for solar, the new approach could prove useful for hydrogen catalysis, as well as advanced healthcare and water purification.
The technical term for upconversion’s ‘gluing’ process is triplet-triplet annihilation, which produces a singlet exciton. An exciton is a quasiparticle which exists when an electron and the hole it is bound to becomes excited by light or another source of energy.
Controlled and reliable triplet-triplet annihilation and the photochemical upconversion it enables could raise the efficiency limit of solar energy devices from 33.7% to 40% or beyond, according to the research team.
Much of the fundamental research on upconversion is performed with liquid samples. For the mechanism to be useful in real-world devices applications, however, it must be effectively demonstrated in a solid state.
In this research, Exciton Science Research Fellow Dr Thilini Ishwara and her colleagues created a thin film of nanostructured alumina stained with a sensitiser.
The pores of the structure wee filled with emitter molecules in concentrated solution, which allows a highly promising photon generation quantum yield of 9.4%.
The next step, the researchers say, is to move beyond the concentrated solution used in this approach and to achieve similar results in an entirely solid state, potentially by using a gel-like substance.
The team’s work has been published in the journal ACS Energy Letters. It was funded by the Australian Research Council.

The USD 2.83 million ($4.4 million) contract will see Redflow work with engineering partner Ameresco to “repower” a solar microgrid located at the Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state. The project aims to extend the duration of energy storage at the existing installation – presumably by integrating a Redflow zinc-bromide battery system. Redflow has flagged a storage capacity between 1.2 to 1.4 MWh.
The end goal is to enable the microgrid to provide a dispatchable solar and storage resources for peak shaving and energy resilience, Redflow says. Deployment and commissioning of the battery system is planned for the second half of 2024.
The US market has been the target expansion area for Redflow for some time now. This particular project stems from Reflow’s involvement in the US Department of Defence (DoD) Extended Duration Storage for Installations program, which is aiming to provide its more than 450 global bases with backup power and energy resilience. 
Importantly, Redflow is directly contracted with the DoD to deliver the project. “We have been working with the Defence Innovation Unit for the past year to support their energy resilience objectives across the military’s global operations,” Redflow CEO and Managing Director Tim Harris said.
“To be selected as the solution provider is validation that Redflow’s LDES solutions hold the potential to deliver significant benefits to US Department of Defence installations worldwide,” he added.

In June, Redflow won another major project in California to build one of the world’s largest zinc-based battery energy storage systems at 20 MWh. The $18 million (USD 12 million) project received funding from the California Energy Commission.
The 20 MWh battery energy storage system will be paired with a 5 MW solar installation as part of a $50 million renewable energy microgrid which will provide power for the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians in northern California.
Redflow produces its zinc-bromide flow batteries at its factory in Thailand, which it is currently in the process of scaling up.
After decades struggling to break into the big time, flow batteries projects have finally started to secure serious backing. Flow batteries are physically much bigger than lithium-counterparts, but promise far better cycling, safety, lifespans and deeper duration storage.

Today, the government announced it has  awarded more than $1 billion (USD 644 million) in battery and inverter supplier contracts for the huge storage projects.
Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, better known as CATL, has been contracted to supply around 950 of its EnerC Plus containerised battery systems for the two batteries.
Of those, around 650 units will be for the 500 MW / 2,000 MWh (or 2 GWh) Collie big battery – which will help replace the district’s two soon-to-be-retiring coal plants.

The other ~300 EnerC Plus battery systems will be used in the stage two extension of the Kwinana big battery. Work on the extension begun in June, and will see a second 200 MW / 800 MWh battery built alongside the existing 100 MW / 200 MWh battery. Stage two of the project is slated for completion at the end of 2024.
In the announcement, WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston noted the first 100 MW Kwinana battery “is now storing energy and discharging into the grid.” CATL also provided the battery systems for that initial project, totalling 600 units, according to Johnston. It would seem those earlier CATL systems had a lower capacity than the newly contracted EnerC Plus units, as the number of units to capacity is inverted between the two stages. That is, 600 units were used in stage one to deliver 100 MW / 200 MWh while just 300 units are set to deliver 200 MW / 800 MWh for stage two.
Both batteries are located at site of the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station about 30 kilometres south of Perth.

Spanish company Power Electronics has been contracted to supply inverters for the big battery projects, with 72 inverters awarded for the Kwinana battery extension and 160 inverters for the Collie battery.
Both projects will be operated and managed by Western Australia’s (WA) government-owned “gentailer,” Synergy. Like Queensland, the state is opting to directly invest in clean energy technologies and retain operating rights. 
“These contracts, worth more than $1 billion, represent a major and important investment by our government,” WA Premier Roger Cook said. In total, the projects were  allocated $2.3 billion in May’s state budget.
Both batteries have four hours of duration – a longer-duration market Australian big batteries have only recently started moving into.
French renewables giant Neoen is also in the process of building a big battery in Collie – which will eventually have an even greater capacity than the government’s at 1 GW /4 GWh. It will be Neoen’s longest-duration battery project so far.

In June, Neoen confirmed it had started construction – around the same time the company was awarded a contract by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide almost all of the project’s Stage 1 capacity to help smooth the state’s solar duck curve.
Stage one involves less than a quarter of the project’s eventual capacity, at 219 MW / 877 MWh. Of that, 197 MW/ 788 MWh (or four hours of storage) has been contracted to AEMO. Given the contract kicks into effect from October 1, 2024, this would appear to be a hard deadline for the first stage to be delivered. 
Neoen’s Collie battery will use Tesla’s battery systems and is to be constructed by UGL, owned by CIMIC Group.
Neoen had previously said it expected the Collie battery to be operational “by or before 2025,″ though it is not clear whether the company meant only stage one or the full scope.
Collie, approximately 200km south of Perth, has been powering WA with its two coal mines and power stations since the 1880s. In 2022, however, the state government announced it would close these two plants before 2030, with the 854 MW Muja plant slated for retirement by October 2029, and the 340 MW Collie plant in October 2027.
Following the closure of these two power stations, the only remaining coal-fired power plant in WA will be the privately owned Bluewaters generator, also near Collie.

Collie has become a focal point for governments in WA as they seek to provide the historic energy hub with a just transition. Funding has poured into the district, including the state government’s $662 million (USD 450 million) funding boost to entice new and emerging industry into the district. A number of renewable energy and technology companies have taken up the offer.
According to people familiar with the situation, community acceptance for Collie’s energy transition program remains mixed, especially among former coal workers. Jobs in renewables are not permanent, pay less and require greater skillsets than jobs in coal mining and power stations.

Rystad Energy says China may have another record year for new PV installations in 2023, driven by the addition of 150 MW of PV capacity. The company cites data from China’s National Energy Administration as showing CNY 134.9 billion ($28.7 billion) of investment in domestic PV construction in the first half of 2023 – the highest among all power generation sources. The Norwegian market research company also predicts 165 GW of potential installations in 2024 and 170 GW in 2025. It expects China’s installed solar PV capacity to double over the next three years, from 500 GW in 2023 to 1,000 GW by the end of 2026. Yicong Zhu, senior renewables analyst at Rystad, attributes this anticipated growth to a “significant boost in large-scale projects” under a national program that was launched in June 2021. “Although most distributed PV systems are installed on rooftops, not all of them are used for residential purposes,” says Zhu. “Around two-thirds of the distributed PV capacity in China is utilised by the commercial and industrial sectors and these projects can vary from tens to more than 100 MW.”
GCL says that one of its subsidiaries, Henan GCL Energy Technology, has signed an investment agreement with the municipal government of Luohe, Henan province. The CNY 6 billion ($1.28 billion) deal involves the construction of a lithium factory with a capacity of 100,000 tonnes.
Canadian Solar Inc. says will have 50.4 GW of ingot casting capacity and 60 GW of wafer cutting capacity by the end of 2024. It also expects to expand solar cell production to 70 GW and PV module production to 80 GW.
Mingyang Group has signed a CNY 10 billion investment agreement with the municipal authorities in Maanshan, Henan province. The wind power specialist says it plans to build a 10 GW heterojunction (HJT) solar cell and module factory in the city. In May 2021, Mingyang invested in 5 GW of HJT cell production capacity in Yancheng, Jiangsu province. It also set up a separate 2 GW HJT cell capacity factory in Shaoguan, Guangdong province.
Three Gorges Group has announced the results of its 2023 PV module framework centralised procurement exercise, with winning bids from JA Solar, Das Solar, Tongwei, Trina Solar, and JinkoSolar. JA Solar secured a contract to supply up to 3 GW of P-type 182 mm modules, with power outputs of 545Wp or higher. Tongwei has been chosen to supply 500 MW of P-type 210 mm panels, with power outputs of 660 Wp or higher. JinkoSolar a deal to supply N-type TOPCon panels, with 182 mm wafers or higher.
Xinyi Solar Holdings says it plans to issue ordinary and new shares, representing up to 10.00% of company shares, pending shareholder approval, as it shifts from the ChiNext Market to the main board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The company plans to allocate about 30% the funds for the fifth phase of investment in a solar glass production line in Melaka, Malaysia. It will use 25% for solar glass production in China’s Yunnan province, and 15% to set up a solar glass production line in Jiangsu province. The remainder will be used as general working capital.

High-profile lithium-ion battery fires have given rise to growing concerns regarding their safety and exposed a lack of understanding about the risks associated with this type of technology. Specifically, fire incidents in battery energy storage systems (BESS) have proved to be harmful to the industry, resulting in postponement and even cancellation of projects in some parts of the world.
A new report released by Firetrace International, a US-based fire suppression technology supplier, says that “there is a real danger public opposition to energy storage could grow significantly as a result of fire risk fears, threatening critical battery deployment and, as a result, net zero goals.”
What is more, BESS fire incidents have also had an impact on the insurance market. In its report, Firetrance presents evidence that the appetite to cover energy storage projects has declined, with some insurers even exiting the market.
“This has resulted in increased premiums, higher excesses, and difficulties in securing 100% cover. Addressing the fire risk of battery storage has thus become a focal point for owners, contractors, and operators,” reads the report titled “How to reduce battery storage fire risk.”
The report looks at different types of fire hazards facing energy storage projects as well as the way in which the industry has already looked to mitigate these risks through planning, design, construction, and the installation of fire protection systems.
In conclusion, the report highlights the three next steps asset manufacturers, developers and asset owners need to take to mitigate the fire risk.
Some of the main causes that can lead to lithium-ion batteries catching fire are inherent cell defects, improper installation, physical abuse, or operation of BESS outside of prescribed parameters, such as charge rate, state of charge or temperature. Once triggered, battery fires are self-sustaining and difficult to put out.
“There are fire suppression companies who claim their systems can suppress lithium-ion battery fires and prevent thermal runaway,” said Brian Cashion, engineering manager at Firetrace International.
“We don’t believe the industry can make these claims yet because there is no publicly available test data proving these claims in real world test scenarios and doing so risks a second wave of public scrutiny. It is crucial we get the solution right,” Cashion stated.
The US supplier notes that this is “very possible with the right planning, design and collaboration”.
Finally, the report highlights the role of regulation in mitigating BESS fires and recommends changes to the current frameworks in the United States.
According to Firetrance, storage fire risk regulations in the US are developing haphazardly on a state-by-state basis, a scenario that is creating considerable confusion and forcing energy storage owners to retrofit fire suppression systems in order to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.
The report suggests that other states should adopt the International Fire Code (IFC) in place in New York and California.
