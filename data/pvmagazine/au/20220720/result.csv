“As well as the weak target that means more fires and floods, the Greens are concerned that the bill as drafted is a barrier to government lifting the weak 43% targets,” Bandt said, noting the party doesn’t believe the bill is ‘Dutton-proof’ and sufficiently guards against the potential for future government’s to lower the targets.
The Greens want to see emissions reductions of 75% by 2030, while the independent ‘teal’ crossbench is aiming for 60%.
The new federal energy minister Chris Bowen has previously said he won’t be negotiating Labor’s policies, but the party’s position coming out of the May election could hardly be described as strong. Labor just managed to scrape into majority government and had the lowest primary vote in its history.
Meanwhile, independent candidates who campaigned primarily on stronger climate action managed to almost triple their presence in parliament, and the Greens had their best result on record. 
The Greens now hold the balance of power in the Senate, giving the party some leverage entering into these negotiations.
In his acceptance speech, prime minister Anthony Albanese pledged to “end the climate wars” – a promise which appears to already be getting put to the test.

The policy is at the heart of the new government’s decarbonisation vision as it seeks to massively upgrade transmission networks to unlock new renewable generation and ultimately get the national grid to 82% renewables by 2030.
At the Clean Energy Summit currently happening in Sydney, Goldwind Australia director John Titchen pointed to the issue, saying the ability to find workers to deliver such projects is a real challenge in the current climate.
“We’re at full employment now – 3.5% – so the constraint on our workforce, how are we going to solve that?” Titchen said.
“How many people are we going to need in order to drive this growth? We’re going to be competing for those people with other sectors. That’s a challenge. 
“We’ll battle through any specific supply chain issues with equipment, but the issue is more going to be on the local front.”
pv magazine Australia has previously reported on the struggle Australian installers have had finding and retaining staff, an issue which has impacted companies across the board. The shortages have recently become so pronounced installers are having to systematically turn down jobs because they don’t have enough staff to complete them.
The renewable energy industry is far from the only sector in Australia reporting skill shortages, but as the appetite for clean energy investments grows in Australia, the lack of personnel could throw up roadblocks. This is of course coupled with the ongoing supply chain issues which are impacting the sector globally.

“The Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility will create approximately 95,000 gigajoules of biomethane, from organic material in wastewater, to supply gas to around 6,300 homes by the end of the year,” NSW Minister for Lands and Water, Kevin Anderson, said.
That production capacity is expected double production by 2030.

“This five year pilot will put gas directly into the supply network and will also help industries across NSW meet their net-zero emissions targets, with the facility able to turn waste material into a new clean energy source,” Anderson added.
The $16 million project is a joint partnership between the federal government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which is providing a $5.9 million grant, the NSW government, Sydney Water and energy infrastructure company, Jemena.
It is expected to remove 5,000 tonnes of carbon emissions each year. 
The project will also involve a Renewable Gas Certification Pilot, the aim of which is to spark a new energy market for clean gas in Australia.
The project is due to be completed by the end of this year and is expected to supply its first renewable gas products to the network soon after.

Octopus says it currently has a secured portfolio of $3 billion across wind, solar and storage, with a visible pipeline for an additional $5 billion. 
The platform for institutional investors, named the Octopus Australia Sustainable Investments (OASIS) Fund, has already secured a $75 million commitment from the Commonwealth government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), as well as from superannuation fund Hostplus and Octopus Renewables’ Sky Fund, backed by European institutional investors.
Alongside the second fund for wholesale investors, named Octopus Renewable Energy Opportunities (OREO), the platforms are set up to manage Australia’s energy transition and will finance the entire renewable energy life cycle from development, through construction and into long-term operations, Octopus Australia says.
The first project jointly acquired by the OASIS and OREO funds is the the 333 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm, Australia’s largest operational solar project. Located in the south east of NSW, Octopus previously jointly held Darlington Point Solar Farm with Edify Energy.
Octopus Australia says it will announce further information on its next acquisitions shortly.
Octopus Investments Australia is owned by the UK-based Octopus Group, which manages 3 GW of renewable energy assets worth over $6.9 billion (£4 billion) across nine countries.
Its funding announcement comes just a week after José Manuel Entrecanales, chairman of Spanish energy and construction giant Acciona, outlined a plan to invest around $26 billion in Australian renewables following our change in federal government.
The major investment plans from global clean energy groups hopefully indicates a renewed sense of confidence in Australia after a period of downturn attributed to policy uncertainty. Earlier this year, a report from industry body the Clean Energy Council found the level of financial commitments for new large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia had fallen more than 17% from $4.5 billion in 2020 to $3.7 billion in 2021.
“This significant reduction is due to continued policy uncertainty combined with the challenges associated with connecting renewable energy projects to the grid,” CEO Kane Thornton said.
With the election of a new federal government in May, it would appear the global thermometer on Australia’s attractiveness is warming.
Inside the country, the trend towards clean energy investments for superannuation funds continues.
Hostplus, which has $86.6 billion in funds under management as of June 2022, has previously worked with Octopus Australia and the CEFC, committing to be one of the first major investors in the development of its Gippsland Renewable Energy Park project, which is seeking to install solar, battery storage, wind and potentially green hydrogen to replace the capacity lost when EnergyAustralia’s nearby Yallourn coal power station closes in 2028.
Hostplus CEO David Elia also noted the superannuation fund is particularly eager to support Desert Springs Octopus, a joint venture between Octopus Australia and Indigenous-owned renewable energy company Northern Territory Indigenous Business Network announced in February this year.
Desert Springs Octopus is seeking to bring renewable energy and other infrastructure opportunities to First Nations Australians, with Octopus Australia’s former Investment Director of Energy Markets, Lumi Adisa, telling pv magazine Australia the joint venture is an opportunity for Octopus to learn from Indigenous communities and their wealth of knowledge on sustainability within different Australian landscapes.
Octopus Australia is currently building the 180 MW Dulacca wind farm, which is acquired from RES in August last year. It is also working with the CEFC to develop the proposed 60 MW (AC) Perry Bridge solar farm and 80 MW (AC) Fulham solar farm both in the Gippsland region of Victoria, as well as the Blind Creek solar-storage hybrid power plant in the NSW southwest.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/20/novel-method-to-turn-existing-solar-parks-into-agrivoltaic-facilities/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,ITALY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 20, 2022",Novel method to turn existing solar parks into agrivoltaic facilities,"From pv magazine Global
An international research team has developed a new approach to improve land use at ground-mounted solar plants, which they claim could be used to add important wildlife habitats or even agricultural activity to land already in use by a conventional PV system.
“We initially developed our approach for existing solar plants installed in the region of Apulia in southern Italy, but it could be utilised in other regions or countries with different vegetation,” Teodoro Semeraro, an environmental scientist at Italy’s University of Salento who led the research, told pv magazine.”It could also be used for new projects that include agricultural use or rooftop installations combining green roofs with solar power generation, where the agricultural aspect would have less importance.”
The approach would see new vegetated land cover cultivated below and around solar installations, as potential habitat for pollinating insects or for agricultural activities including beekeeping and medicinal herb production. This approach would provide a series of additional advantages such as reduction of maintenance costs of green areas in solar parks, fire risk reduction, potential development of small-scale agricultural activities, and positive media coverage, among others.
The scientists pointed out that the selected vegetation to be grown at the solar parks should be able to adapt to the ground’s environmental conditions, water scarcity, and nutritional deficiency. “Our approach may also consider non-indigenous species, but from the point of view of the landscape and the protection of local biodiversity, the use of indigenous vegetation is desirable,” Semeraro stated. “Moreover, the local species are adapted to the climate and the lack of water, which is chronic in Apulia, so they could respond better. But, having said that, the use of non-native species is technically feasible at conditions that respond to specific project needs.”
According to the research, Beekeeping at these sites would not require invasive structures and hives could be laid on the ground during the blooming time. “The biodiversity and ecosystem services could persist over time even after ground-mounted PV systems are dismantled and continuing to support population welfare at both local and larger scale, guaranteeing sustainability,” they further explained, noting that beekeeping may help overcome the issue of monoculture, which is typical of the Apulia region.
The research listed a range of ecosystem services which solar parks could provide without additional human input, on the basis of the intrinsic value of the vegetation in sustaining ecosystem services. This would turn the solar parks into semi-natural areas, or Agro-Ecological Photovoltaic Gardens, which would host melliferous species blooming in different periods to be harvested and marketed as medicinal herbs. Furthermore, the solar panels may reduce the water stress for the vegetation, while improving soil quality thanks to their shading function.
When asked about what exactly defines agrivoltaics and make it differ from conventional ground-mounted solar facilities, Semeraro said that the crucial element is the presence of an agricultural enterprise in a project. “We cannot speak of agrivoltaics if a stakeholder in the agricultural field is not involved in the project or if there is no farm interested in the cultivation or use of the soil,” he stated. “There is a risk that a plant will be created without there being someone who cultivates it.”
The scientists introduced their approach in the study “An innovative approach to combine solar photovoltaic gardens with agricultural production and ecosystem services,” published in Ecosystem Services.
The group includes scientists from the University of Salento and the Institute of Science of Food Production C.N.R. Unit of Lecce, in Italy, as well as from the Glasgow Caledonian University in the United Kingdom.
“A transdisciplinary approach is important to share knowledge across the different stakeholders and bridge the information gaps typical of a sectoral perspective, creating a holistic vision of the involved professional skills and experiences,” the paper reads. “Its proper implementation requires the joint effort of all economic stakeholders together with technical and scientific experts to promote multifunctional land-use in ground-mounted solar farms.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/20/sodium-ion-batteries-for-evs-renewables-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 20, 2022","Sodium-ion batteries for EVs, renewables storage","From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed a sodium-ion battery (NIB) that can purportedly overcome the main challenge with such storage systems – the ability to hold a charge after repeated cycles of charging and discharging.
The researchers said this issue is strictly correlated to the instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is generated on the anode of lithium-ion batteries during the first few charging cycles, in order to prevent electrolyte decomposition and maintain cycling ability. The SEI layer should be well adhered to the electrode material, exhibit good electronic insulation properties, and be able to conduct lithium ions.
“The instability of SEI layers is a critical barrier for the long cycling performance of NIBs,” the US group said. “Electrolytes usually decompose at a low voltage to form the SEI on the anode surface. Ideally, the SEI should be electronically insulating but ionically conducting for ion transport, insoluble and inert with respect to the electrolyte to prevent continuous side reactions between the anode and electrolyte.”
In order to avoid SEI dissolution, the academics replaced the high-polarity carbonate solvent in conventional electrolytes with a new liquid solution with low polarity. It consisted of sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) salt in a solvent mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and tris (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFP). This low-solvation electrolyte (NaFSI/DMC:TFP) was designed to operate in 4.2 V high-voltage sodium-ion batteries.
“The current electrolyte recipe for sodium-ion batteries results in the protective film on the negative end (the anode) dissolving over time. This film is critical because it allows sodium ions to pass through while preserving battery life,” the researchers said, noting that electrolyte also creates an ultra-thin protective layer on the cathode, which ensures additional system stability. “Our electrolyte lowers the solvation ability for SEI components and facilitates the formation of insoluble SEI components, which minimises the SEI dissolution.”
The battery was able to retain 90% of its capacity after 300 cycles, with minimised SEI dissolution.
“Sodium-based batteries would be more environmentally friendly and less expensive once the technology is established,” researcher Nick Hennen told pv magazine. “The sodium-ion battery developed in this work is suitable for solar energy storage because it has advantages of long cycle life, low cost and materials abundance over lithium-ion batteries; it also has the feasibility for large-scale production using the existing infrastructure of  lithium-ion batteries.”
“We also measured the production of gas vapor at the cathode,” said researcher Phung Le. “We found very minimal gas production. This provides new insights to develop stable electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries that may operate at elevated temperatures.”
The US group described the battery in “Low-solvation electrolytes for high-voltage sodium-ion batteries,” which was recently published in Nature Energy. “Our findings provide a promising recipe for a battery that may one day power electric vehicles and store energy from the sun.”
