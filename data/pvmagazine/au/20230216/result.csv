The green hydrogen project will comprise a demonstration-scale 150 kW electrolyser featuring proton exchange membrane technology, as well as a 5 MW battery energy storage system.
The facility will generate green hydrogen from renewable resources while the battery storage system will aid grid stabilisation in the region.
The green hydrogen is to be transported from South Australia to Indonesia in a metal hydride storage system developed by Australian technology company Lavo. The stored hydrogen will then be converted into power and heat for local use.
Lavo Chief Executive Officer Alan Yu said the project will serve to demonstrate the commercial and technical viability of exporting renewable hydrogen in metal hydride storage.
“We’re delighted that the Marubeni Corporation will use Lavo’s Australia developed, designed and manufactured metal hydride technology for green hydrogen production from Australia to Indonesia on a standard commercial cargo ship,” he said, adding it is an important milestone in developing Australia’s hydrogen export supply chain.
“It is significant because it will … demonstrate the inherent safety and economic competitiveness of metal hydride for hydrogen storage and transport,” he said.

Ground was officially broken on the Bolivar project earlier this week, with the plant expected to be operational by August with green hydrogen exports to commence later this year.
The project, partly funded by Japan’s ministry of the environment, is being developed on a site owned by the South Australia government-owned SA Water.
The South Australia government said the use of state-owned land for the project offers the potential for Marubeni to expand its capacity, dependent on future demand for hydrogen.
“South Australia is already a leader in renewable energy, which places our state in a strong position to become a global leader in green hydrogen for the long-term future,” South Australia Trade and Investment Minister Nick Champion said.
“We have a long-standing relationship with the Marubeni Corporation and its choice to establish this hydrogen facility in South Australia is no coincidence – our state has demonstrated capabilities and huge potential for expansion in this industry.”
Marubeni Chief Executive Officer Satoru Harada said this week’s ground-breaking ceremony represented a significant milestone for the company, which has interests in a wide range of sectors including metal and mineral resources, energy, construction, and automotive and industrial machinery.
“Green hydrogen has the potential to revolutionise the way we produce and use energy,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/16/rmit-researchers-reveal-new-method-to-split-saltwater-into-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",RMIT researchers reveal new method to split saltwater into hydrogen,"Researchers from Melbourne’s RMIT University have developed a new way to split seawater into hydrogen and oxygen, without the need for desalination and its associated cost, energy consumption and toxic by-products. They incorporated a catalyst composed of nitrogen-doped porous sheets developed to work specifically with seawater.
The new approach devised by a team in the multidisciplinary Materials for Clean Energy and Environment (MC2E) research group at RMIT uses a catalyst composed of nitrogen-doped porous nickel molybdenum phosphide sheets.
The method, detailed in a lab-scale study published in the Small journal, relies on the presence of large pores in the sheets to increase electrical conductivity while the presence of metal-nitrogen bonds and surface polyanions increases the stability and improves anti-corrosive properties against chlorine chemistry.
The researchers said the catalyst sheets displayed “remarkable performance”, catalysing full water splitting at 1.52 and 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 in 1 m KOH and seawater, respectively.
“Hence, structural and compositional control can make catalysts effective in realising low-cost hydrogen directly from seawater,” the team concluded.
Lead researcher Dr Nasir Mahmood, a Vice-Chancellor’s Senior Research Fellow at RMIT, said the new method overcomes some of the hurdles associated with seawater’s salt-rich nature.
“The biggest hurdle with using seawater is the chlorine, which can be produced as a by-product. If we were to meet the world’s hydrogen needs without solving this issue first, we’d produce 240 million tons per year of chlorine each year – which is three to four times what the world needs in chlorine. There’s no point replacing hydrogen made by fossil fuels with hydrogen production that could be damaging our environment in a different way,” Mahmood said.
“Our process not only omits no carbon dioxide, but also has no chlorine production.”

While other experimental catalysts have been developed for seawater splitting, PhD candidate Suraj Loomba said the RMIT research team had focused on producing highly efficient, stable catalysts that can be manufactured cost-effectively.
“Our approach focused on changing the internal chemistry of the catalysts through a simple method, which makes them relatively easy to produce at large-scale so they can be readily synthesised at industrial scales,” he said.
Mahmood said the technology had promise to significantly bring down the cost of electrolysers – enough to meet the Australian government’s goal for green hydrogen production of $2 per kilogram, to make it competitive with fossil fuel-sourced hydrogen.
“Our method to produce hydrogen straight from seawater is simple, scaleable and far more cost-effective than any green hydrogen approach currently in the market,” he said.
“With further development, we hope this could advance the establishment of a thriving green hydrogen industry in Australia.”
A provisional patent application has been filed for the new method and the researchers said they are working with industry partners to develop the technology.
The next stage is the development of a prototype electrolyser that combines a series of catalysts to produce large quantities of hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/16/crying-over-spilled-solar-how-much-can-a-battery-help/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 16, 2023",Crying over spilled solar – how much can a battery help?,"A standalone battery earns its revenue not only from the arbitrage opportunity between day and night prices but also from participation in Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets.
This remains true when the battery is paired with a solar farm but can be complicated by constraints or trade-offs between FCAS participation and solar export.
When optimising for maximum trading profit, this can play out in ways that seem, at first glance, counterintuitive or even counterproductive.
Here we look at the behaviour that such a hybrid system can exhibit when wholesale market prices are low and solar energy generation is high.
To do this, we have used Cornwall Insight Australia’s Storage Investment Model (SIM) to simulate a 100 MW two-hour battery and a 100 MW solar farm in a hybrid AC-coupled system with a 100 MW transmission connection [1]. The SIM maximises the net operating profit from the hybrid system for each trading day, optimising the dispatch of the solar farm and the battery in each market (wholesale + 8 FCAS) for each half-hour interval.
An average time-of-day capacity enablement profile for 2031 (after the LRET scheme ends) for the hybrid system in each of these markets is shown in the figure below. While the solar farm is actively generating, the capacity offered into the Raise and Lower Contingency FCAS markets is generally lowered accordingly.

However, the top and bottom of the figure in the middle of the day highlight two types of constraints that can suppress the amount of solar energy that can be exported to the grid:
The net effect of each of these types of constraints can be observed in the figure below, where the grey area represents the solar energy spilled. When looking at how large this amount might be, note that this behaviour occurs because there is more profit to be made by instead allowing FCAS participation.

Of course, there would be many ways in which this behaviour may be altered or avoided, depending on the priorities of the project proponent, including but not limited to:

While perennial heavyweights Nextracker and Array Technologies – both headquartered in the United States – continue to dominate the Australian market for overall totals, PVH said it started construction on more than 1 GW of clean energy projects last year, edging out the other top tier manufacturers.
PVH secured supply agreements with multiple large-scale projects including the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm owned by Fotowatio Renewable Ventures’ (FRV), and the 330 MW Wellington North Solar Farm owned by UK-headquartered developer Lightsource BP.
The company said it has also entered into negotiations for its second Victorian Renewable Energy Target (VRET) project with an agreement expected to be signed in the first quarter of 2023.

The Spanish manufacturer said it has supplied or has commitments to supply 17 projects totalling more than 1.9 GW since entering the Australian market in 2019 but despite that success PVH APAC Manager Alejandro Cantos believes the company is still in the early stages of Australia’s renewable energy growth.
Cantos said the renewable technology sector has experienced unprecedented growth but with the federal government targeting net zero emissions by 2050, the number of new energy projects being announced is mounting.
The latest data published by the Clean Energy Regulator shows large-scale wind and solar farm investment commitments grew nearly 50% in 2022 and Cantos said PVH is well positioned to take advantage of that growth.
“We still have room for improvement. Now the difficulty remains in securing our recently acquired first position in the market and we firmly believe the best is yet to come,” he said.  “I firmly believe this nation has everything it needs to become a renewable superpower not only because of its abundance of raw materials and renewable natural energy sources, but also because of its geopolitical standing.”

Cantos attributed PVH’s success to the company’s technical expertise, product offering and a bespoke approach to the “unique” Australian market.
“Whilst PV Hardware was already a dominant player in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, when we arrived in Australia, we immediately realised that this market was completely different and quite challenging,” he said.
“PVH specialises in adapting our structures into new landscapes and projects. Our philosophy is that if no two sites are identical, why should we apply the same solution to both? Every site is different, every project is different, and each brings its own unique set of challenges linked to its own tailored solutions.”

The European Commission’s newly proposed renewable hydrogen rules clarify the principle of “additionality,” which requires more renewables capacity to power electrolysers in order to define hydrogen as “green.” The commission introduced a transitional phase for the “time additionality” requirements for hydrogen projects that will start operating before January 2028. For two years, hydrogen producers will be able to match their hydrogen production with their contracted renewables on a monthly basis. “The decision to allow monthly temporal correlation in a transitional period, to then impose more granular matching (with hourly matching from 2030) will provide a first mover advantage, while preserving the integrity of renewable hydrogen in the long term,” said Arthur Daemers, policy adviser for SolarPower Europe. The commission included an exemption for “low-emission” power grids (nuclear) and for grids with high shares of renewables. The European Parliament and the European Council now have two months to either accept or reject the proposals.
The Port of Corpus Christi Authority (PCCA) and Canada’s AmmPower have agreed to develop green hydrogen as feedstock for green fuel and green derivatives production, storage, and distribution. “PCCA has emerged as the nation’s preeminent gateway for exporting low carbon energy to international markets due to PCCA’s ability to provide access to a deep draft channel, land for site location and close proximity to renewable energy,” said Toronto-based AmmPower. The two entities are now checking the feasibility of a facility in Texas to produce green hydrogen derivatives for domestic and export markets. They have not provided any timeline expectations.
Airbus, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), Air New Zealand, Hiringa Energy, Fabrum, and New Zealand’s Christchurch Airport have launched the Hydrogen Consortium “to support the country to pioneer the commercial deployment of green hydrogen-powered aircraft.” The Christchurch Airport is developing a 400-hectare renewable energy precinct. The first phase will focus on research until the end of this year. Hiringa’s first four production and high-capacity refuelling stations are going online in 2023, with nationwide expansion planned from 2024. Air New Zealand aims to fly its first commercial demonstrator flight from 2026 and begin replacing its Q300 Turboprop fleet from 2030 with low- emission aircraft. Airbus is working to develop and put into service the “world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial passenger aircraft” by 2035. 
DEWA and ENOC have agreed to cooperate in a feasibility study to establish, develop and operate an integrated pilot project for hydrogen in the mobility sector. The two companies, both based in the United Arab Emirates, will jointly build a hydrogen fueling station and work on a roadmap for a green hydrogen strategy. The agreement supports the hosting of COP28 in Dubai later this year.

A statement from Siemens describes the Hub’s aim to be “a future energy grid laboratory accessible to students and industry.”
By using Siemens open digital business platform Siemens Xcelerator, the Hub can be used as a “digital twin of energy grids,” or to “map scenarios, research new findings, develop original and creative hypotheses, and test results.”
The statement goes on to say that as a digital twin of the National Energy Market (NEM), it can be used by to run simulations.
SUT Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research, Professor Karen Hapgood said “Australia’s ambitious carbon reduction targets need a multi-pronged approach by industry, research and government.”
Hapgood noted the Hub will work on a variety of technologies across the green energy sector, but stressed that “We need change fast, and the Siemens-Swinburne team will focus on taking ideas to market – where they can make the most impact as quickly as possible.”

Education is key
The Hub offers great educational potential for Australia’s future energy workforce. While focused on R&D and commercialisation projects, Siemens says it will also deliver short courses for industry professionals and make its software and industry experience available to Swinburne students in engineering technology courses.
“Collaboration between industry and academia is critical to driving better outcomes on key topics of national importance such as the energy transition,” said Siemens Australia and New Zealand CEO Peter Halliday.
Lastly, the Hub is set to feature Siemens’ microgrid management system including technologies and software used by most utilities and independent system operators like the Australian Energy Market Operator.
