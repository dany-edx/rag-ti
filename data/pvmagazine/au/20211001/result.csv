French hydrogen specialist HDF Energy has announced it has secured a 25-year power purchase agreement for its Centrale Electrique de l’Ouest Guyanais (CEOG) project – a PV park and 128 MWh, hydrogen-based storage station in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, in northwestern French Guiana.
The facility will sell power at an undisclosed price to French power utility EDF. “The price of CEOG electricity is competitive with diesel power plant[s] in French Guiana and this, without including the negative externalities of … fossil [power] plants,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine.
The equity for the project will be provided by French investment firm and asset manager Meridiam, which owns a 60% stake in the project, and SARA, a refinery based in Martinique and supplying the French Antilles and Guiana. The non–recourse project financing will be awarded by commercial and development banks.
The facility relies on a 55 MW solar unit, a 16 MW electrolyser, storage tanks and 3 MW of fuel cells. The project is intended at covering the energy needs of 10,000 households of all Western Guiana. The facility will be able to produce a fixed electrical daily output of 10 MW until evening, and of 3 MW during the night.
The CEOG project was launched by developer and French hydrogen specialist HDF Energy in May 2018. At the time, the company said the value of the facility was estimated at around $90 million. The project was originally set to be commissioned last year.
In its Australian release on the project, HDF said the technology it’s using to construct the renewable energy power plant in French Guiana “will soon be available to Australia”.
The company also recently appointed a general manager for the Oceania region, David Clement, saying it already has projects in development for Australia and New Caledonia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/01/genex-taps-tesla-for-queensland-big-battery-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 1, 2021",Genex taps Tesla for Queensland big battery project,"Sydney-based developer Genex announced on Friday it had executed a supply agreement with Tesla to use its Megapack technology for the Bouldecombe Battery Project (BPP) being developed near Rockhampton in central Queensland.
The Bouldercombe battery energy storage system (BESS), which received development approval from Rockhampton Regional Council in May, will comprise 40 Tesla Megapacks which will be integrated with the company’s Autobidder machine learning program for automated energy trading.
Tesla has described the Megapack  – a its third stationary energy storage product after the Powerwall and Powerpack – as the largest, densest battery system in the world with giga-scale capacity. The modular system requires 40% less space and Tesla claims it can be constructed 10 times faster than other systems.
The technology has been deployed in a number of Australian projects including the 50 MW/75 MWh Wallgrove Grid Battery project being built in Western Sydney by Transgrid.
It has also been used by French renewable energy developer Neoen in the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery, which is currently undergoing commissioning near Geelong.

The project suffered a setback in July when fire destroyed two of its Megapacks but safety regulators in Victoria earlier this week cleared the project to resume testing.
Genex chief executive James Harding said the supply agreement with Tesla is a major milestone for the Bouldercombe project and will support the company in rapidly progressing the project to financial close.
“This is a key milestone in the project’s development and one the company has been working towards since Tesla’s appointment as the preferred supplier and integrator in 2020,” he said.
The BPP will be constructed on land adjacent to Queensland network operator Powerlink’s 275 kV/132 kV Bouldercombe substation, about 20 kilometres south of Rockhampton.
Genex said negotiations with Powerlink – which has identified battery storage as key to managing system strength issues in the National Electricity Market – on the connection terms are well advanced with a connection offer expected within the next couple of months.
The company also said it was in advanced discussions with a party for off-take agreements with the battery expected to operate on an arbitrage and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) model, with the ability to bid into all FCAS markets.
Genex, which expects to make a final investment decision on the project in coming months, said financial close is expected by the first quarter of 2022 with the project expected to be fully operational in the first half of 2023.

Harding said the project is part of Genex’s strategy to diversify its renewable energy portfolio which includes the Kidston Renewable Energy Hub, a combined solar, wind and pumped hydro project being developed in north Queensland. The Kidston project includes an already operating 50 MW solar farm and a 250 MW pumped-storage hydro project which is expected to be completed by 2024. It also has potential for further multi-stage wind and solar projects with Genex last year announcing it had secured a partnership with Japanese utility J-Power to progress the development of a 150 MW wind farm at the site.
Genex also owns and operates the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Farm  in the central west region of New South Wales.
“The (Bouldercombe) project is Genex’s first large-scale battery energy storage system and is part of our ‘Como’ strategy to broaden our footprint in energy storage,” Harding said.
“The development of our battery storage strategy in conjunction with our pumped hydro project and operating solar energy assets further positions Genex as the leading Australian renewable energy and storage company.”
The BPP is among a raft of utility scale battery storage projects being progressed across Queensland.
The 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South BESS project being developed by Singapore-based Vena Energy is currently progressing through the commissioning process while state-owned energy company Stanwell is developing a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to the 1.4 GW Tarong Power Station site in the South Burnett.
The state government has also announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries, with a combined capacity of 40 MWh in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/01/new-report-tips-rooftop-solar-pv-to-shine-bright-in-2030/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 1, 2021",New report tips rooftop solar PV to shine bright in 2030,"A new report published by global accounting and financial services firm KPMG suggests Australia’s energy landscape is set to undergo a major transformation before the end of the decade, with the growth in renewables and energy storage to accelerate, the closure of coal-fired power plants to be well advanced, and the introduction of emerging zero-emissions technologies including green hydrogen to ramp up.
The 30 Voices on 2030: The Future of Energy report asked 30 energy industry executives, experts and government figures to look ahead and predict the state of the Australian energy landscape in 2030. As part of the report, KPMG Australia also conducted a survey of 240 energy and natural resources (ENR) businesses in Australia.
KPMG Australia ENR industry leader Cassandra Hogan said the conversation on Australia’s energy transition and decarbonisation has accelerated in the past year and the report serves to highlight the key drivers in the nation’s transition to net-zero emissions.
“The industry is undergoing a profound transformation,” she said. “Supply of energy is shifting to renewables and lower-emissions fuels. Consumers and industrial users are becoming more active participants in the energy market.
“They are choosing, even demanding, new technologies, products and data to meet their needs.
“We’re on that journey but having experts imagine the future can help us get on and stay on the right path.”
Hogan said the report highlights the role technology will play in Australia’s accelerating shift to renewable energy with almost three-quarters, or 74% of those ENR businesses surveyed agreeing that most households will be actively using smart energy monitoring by the end of the decade.
“Consumers will be at the centre of the energy transition, with technology transforming their relationship with the system,” she said.
More than half, or 59% of those surveyed agreed that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations will have been incorporated into core business strategy and specific targets will be law in 2030.

Hogan said the report also highlights the role rooftop solar PV will play in the clean energy transition with 69% of those surveyed agreeing that most Australian businesses and households will have shifted to solar and battery storage in 2030.
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said he expects rooftop solar to continue to play a major role in Australia’s energy future while hydrogen will be more economically competitive by 2030 and will help cut emissions in multiple industries.
“Australia’s energy and natural resources sectors have evolved and reduced emissions much faster than we expected a decade ago,” Taylor said when asked what the energy landscape would look like in 2030.
“The extraordinary uptake of renewables, particularly household solar, towards the end of the 2010s, has been matched by huge growth in the 2020s of a range of new low-emissions energy technologies.
“Energy sources like hydrogen are becoming more competitive with existing technologies, driving down emissions and producing affordable, reliable energy.”
Australia Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox expects that by 2030 households and businesses will have been the major drivers of changes in the energy system while big industry will still have a way to go.
“The transformation in heavy industry is yet to come, but we should see this over this next decade to 2040,” he said of the energy landscape in 2030.
“Most households and smaller businesses are now at the point where the scale of renewable power generation and battery technology is enabling energy consumption to be more of an individual choice.
“Their power generation is cheaper, there are more choices of types of renewable generation and technologies, such as batteries, and inverters are allowing them to better manage and customise what they need or don’t need.”
While the predictions of those surveyed for the report vary on what the energy landscape will look like in 2030, KPMG Australia Energy Transition leader Barry Sterland said one thing they all agree on is that change is coming, and it is coming fast.
“The domestic and international policy landscape shifted even in the time this publication was in preparation,” he said.
“Energy firms need to get ahead of this change to seize the opportunities arising from this rapid change – and to avoid the risk of being left behind.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/01/storing-hydrogen-with-silicon-carbide-nanotubes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,JAPAN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 1, 2021",Storing hydrogen with silicon-carbide nanotubes,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) have developed a new methodology to assess the technical feasibility of storing hydrogen by using carbon nanotubes.
The potential of single-walled carbon nanotubes and other nanostructures as a medium for storing hydrogen has been investigated by the scientific community over recent decades but this technology has so far failed to reach commercial maturity as hydrogen becomes a gas at -252 degrees Celsius, which makes its storage at room temperature using bare carbon nanotubes impossible.
The main issue for this kind of hydrogen storage is that the interaction energies between adsorbed molecules and the nanotube walls are not high enough to store big quantities of hydrogen at room temperature and relatively low pressures. “The interaction between hydrogen and its storage material is simply too weak to persist at room temperature,” the Japanese group stated. “This makes the design of storage materials crucial to achieving the goal of bringing hydrogen energy into daily use.”
The scientists focused their analysis on carbon nanotubes made of silicon carbide, a substrate material that is extensively used in the electric vehicle (EV) industry and the PV sector, which uses silicon carbide in next-generation inverters.
Through diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) analysis, the academics created a model that accounts for Van der Waals forces in the simulation. The Van der Waals forces define the attraction of intermolecular forces between molecules. “Most conventional models consider the interactions between hydrogen and silicon-carbide nanotubes as a whole, but the DMC method uses the power of a supercomputer to reconstruct the interaction mechanism faithfully by following the arrangement of individual electrons,” they further explained.
The proposed methodology is claimed to have established how much energy would be necessary to dislodge hydrogen from its storage, and how far away the hydrogen was likely to be from the surface of the silicon-carbide nanotube. The results of the simulation were then compared to those achieved by traditional prediction methods based on the density functional theory (DFT), which calculates the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and solids.
The researchers found that the DFT analysis without Van der Waals forces wrongly estimated the energy required for hydrogen storage by 4-14%. The analysis that included Van der Waals forces, by contrast, found storage energy was estimated at 9-29%, a percentage range that the scientists defined as “hardly insignificant.”
“Improving prediction reliability for simulations can help accelerate the development of materials for hydrogen fuel storage and lead to a more energy efficient society,” said JAIST researcher Kenta Hongo. “Although the DMC method is computationally expensive, it can be used to clarify the peculiarities, and tendencies of prediction error, of each prediction method.”
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Importance of Van der Waals Interactions in Hydrogen Adsorption on a Silicon-carbide Nanotube Revisited with vdW-DFT and Quantum Monte Carlo, published in ACS Publications.
