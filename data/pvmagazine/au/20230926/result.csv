The expressions of interest, or EOI, process will also be open to hydrogen projects, as well as technologies that can support the decarbonisation of the existing Swanbank E combined-cycle gas-fired power station.
The former coal site is 336-hectares and sits near the city of Ipswich, just west of Brisbane. CleanCo has said the site has an overall transmission network capacity of approximately 1.2 GW, providing significant potential for new energy opportunities that support the state’s renewable energy ambitions.

The eventually-selected projects will complement CleanCo’s plan to install a 250 MW / 500 MWh battery at Swanbank, for which it has been awarded $330 million (USD 211 million) under the Queensland Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Jobs Fund.
Final investment decision on the Swanbank battery is expected in late 2023, with the battery expected to be operational by mid-2025.
CleanCo has also said “other energy and non-energy uses are also being investigated” for Swanbank, including research and development facilities and enhanced community infrastructure.
The Swanbank draft masterplan is now open for feedback, closing October 31, 2023.
The Swanbank site originally hosted two coal-fired power stations with the last of those units decommissioned in 2012. The site is now home to the 385 MW gas-fired Swanbank E power station which is to be integrated into the new renewable energy hub and eventually decarbonised.

As part of the strategy refresher, it has confirmed natural hydrogen will attract a royalty but hydrogen produced from renewable energy-powered electrolysis, better known as green hydrogen, will not.
While Australia’s entire hydrogen industry remains nascent, green hydrogen projects are significantly more developed than natural hydrogen – with South Australia currently the only state with a proper regulatory framework around natural hydrogen exploration.
Western Australia’s government is currently working on its exploration regulations, and appears to be following South Australia’s lead – where a 10% royalty is paid on hydrogen extracted from underground formations.
A Western Australian government spokesperson confirmed royalty plan to the Australian Financial Review, but said the specific rate was still undecided.
Aside from South Australia and now Western Australia (WA), most other states have no yet settled on royalties schemes for the burgeoning industry, although Queensland seems to not charge any hydrogen royalties.
The consultation period on WA’s refreshed hydrogen strategy ends mid-October.
Meanwhile, the federal government has opened consultations on its Guarantee of Origin scheme, which will track and verify emissions associated with hydrogen, as well as renewable electricity and potentially other clean energy products.
Once hydrogen begins to be exported globally, the scheme will be able to guarantee the hydrogen product’s embedded emissions, supporting trade. However, the scope of the Guarantee of Origin scheme has been criticised for not time matching its renewable inputs – an aspect which is of growing importance in the US, UK and Europe.
It is anticipated that the legislation giving effect to the Guarantee of Origin or GO scheme will be in place in 2024.

While Australia’s small-scale market continues to boom, including the installations of rooftop solar and more recently heat pumps, utility-scale projects are stagnating – caught in a web of rising costs, global competition, regulatory and social license hurdles.
An estimated 60,000 new air source heat pumps have been installed so far this year – up 70% compared to the first half of 2022, according to the report. 
Overall, more than 1.1 million small-scale technology certificates (STCs) were created from air source heat pump installations in the first half of the year, accounting for 8% of the total STC creations in that period.
The Clean Energy Regulator’s CEO and Chair, David Parker, described the first half of the year for new large-scale renewable energy investment commitments as “quiet.”
“We’ve downgraded our expectations and now expect 2023 investment may not reach 3 GW,” he said.
While the Regulator had forecast 3.5 GW of new renewable projects would reach FID in 2023, just 0.5 GW managed to do so before July. The second half of the calendar year is expected to be larger than the first half, however, with the Regulator saying industry engagement suggests a figure of around 2.5 GW.

“Wind and solar remain the cheapest options for new energy supply. Unfortunately, rising costs for components, engineering and construction combined with strong international demand for these products and services are slowing progress. Finding ways to streamline grid connection and fast-tracking new transmission will also be critical for success,” the Regulator said in its release. Pv magazine Australia covered these compounding issues in depth earlier this year.
“Discussions with some project developers yet to achieve FID indicate they continue to face challenges with social license and permitting,” the report also notes.
Power purchasing agreements, or PPAs, which are fundamental for large-scale projects as they secure offtake and thus guarantee income, are also increasing in prices and decreasing in duration – which is also impacting the number of projects reaching FID, the Regulator flagged.
“Increased cost and risks [for large-scale renewable projects] are flowing through to the PPAs prices,” the report says. “A higher price is needed on a per megawatt hour basis to get projects to FID. These higher prices may be leading to less demand for PPAs from electricity retailers and corporates.”
“There is an emerging trend towards shorter-term PPAs,” the Regulator added.
The Regulator has also joined the choir of voices noting that a “large step up” is required to reach Australia’s target of 82% renewable energy generation by 2030.
The Regulator’s data solidifies the dismal large-scale trend pv magazine reported earlier this month, as flagged by solar and storage analyst Sunwiz.

Australia’s long-time bright spot, rooftop solar installations in the first half of the year almost totalled 160,000 systems – meaning 2023 is trending towards beating Australia’s previous 3.2 GW record.
In the first half of 2023, 1.4 GW rooftop solar PV capacity was installed. “This is 21% more than the first half of 2022. We usually see installed capacity increase over the year (see Figure 3.1). If this typical trend continues, we could beat the 3.2 GW record set in 2021,” the report says.

Additionally, rooftop systems sizes are growing, with the average system reaching a record 9.3 kW.
“The increased capacity saw the share of renewable electricity rise to over 36% of demand in the National Electricity Market. This is expected to grow to 40% by December,” the report says.
Australia’s love-affair with rooftop solar was borne out over the weekend with generation from South Australian rooftops supplying 101% of the state’s electricity demand on Saturday. Energy advisory Global Power Energy noted South Australia’s achievement is “unparalleled for a large regional network both within the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and on a global stage,” on Linkedin.

Tesla wants to set up a battery storage factory in India and has submitted a proposal to the Indian government. The US electric car and battery manufacturer, which makes the Powerwall range of battery systems, aims to target residential and industrial customers with its battery storage systems. 
Reuters reported that Tesla recently proposed a plan to support India’s battery storage capabilities with Powerwall, a system that can store power from solar panels or the grid for use at night or during outages. The company is keen to tap residential and industrial customers for its battery storage systems.
Tesla has sought a number of incentives to set up a battery storage factory in India. Indian officials have declined these incentives, but have offered to create a fair business model for the company by offering subsidies to customers for Tesla products, according to Reuters.
Tesla recently showcased its new hybrid battery, the Powerwall 3, at RE+. It offers 11.5 kW of continuous power to homeowners and requires an installation time of between 30 to 40 minutes. It comes with an integrated inverter, which simplifies installation. As a hybrid system, it is suitable for new solar installations, but not for households with existing rooftop solar systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/26/solar-module-price-falling-with-no-end-in-sight/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2023","Solar module price falling, with no end in sight","From pv magazine Global
We have all been asking ourselves for some time now: How far can photovoltaic module prices go down before the bottom is finally reached? Apparently, there is still room for further drops, as all prices have fallen again this month.
On average, prices in all module categories have been corrected downwards by around 10%. Never before in the history of photovoltaics have panel prices plummeted so significantly in such a short space of time. For a month or two now, the values have been below the previous all-time low of 2020 and even more so below the production costs of most manufacturers. Generating profit margins seems to be a thing of the past for the time being and for many of them it is now just a matter of minimising damage or even survival.
How could we come to this, and what are the causes of this self-destructive trend?
First of all, it must be noted that module prices rose by more than 50% between October 2020 and October 2022, which is not due to technological developments, but primarily due to the pandemic-related supply shortage coupled with a simultaneous increase in demand. Ultimately, many players in the photovoltaic market made very good money – at the expense of the end consumers. Until recently, photovoltaic system prices were higher than they had been for a long time. Now things have completely changed, which inevitably leads to a drop in prices. The speed and intensity of this change, however, surprise even experienced market participants.
After the shortage issues of the past two years, many installers and wholesalers made generous forecasts and ordered new goods as if there was no tomorrow. The producers, predominantly from Asia, reacted and increased their capacities. Global production capacity usually exceeds the actual expected demand by 30% to 50%, so that fluctuations can be quickly compensated for. The production lines are then ramped up or down as needed. Recently, however, this mechanism has gotten a bit out of hand as many manufacturers have had to switch their cell and module production very quickly from p-type PERC technology to n-type TOPCon, due to patent rights problems in individual regions. However, since the sales restrictions did not apply worldwide, new capacities were built up for TOPCon without replacing the old capacities and without consistently shutting them down.
The prospects appeared to be good in the long term thanks to the supposedly permanently high costs of conventional energy sources. Unfortunately, European politicians were very good at replacing old fossil fuel sources with new ones at short notice, so the suffering from skyrocketing energy costs quickly fell. The pandemic also seems to have finally been overcome and the average European can travel without restrictions again. Not least due to high inflation, many people who recently wanted to invest in photovoltaic systems are now becoming more reluctant. The fact that interest rates on loans continue to rise doesn’t make the decision any easier. The consequence of all the factors listed is a collapse in demand so that the photovoltaics industry has not yet emerged from the summer slump even in mid-September.
The quickly dwindling interest in solar power generation inevitably means that the order books of installers and project planners run empty and pre-ordered modules and inverters cannot be delivered on time. The goods are increasingly piling up at wholesalers and in the manufacturers’ warehouses. There are now said to be 40 GW to 100 GW of unsold modules in European stores, primarily in the Rotterdam area. Determining an exact amount is almost impossible. However, it is enough to know that there is already about a year’s supply of modules in Europe to understand the dimensions and scope of the matter. Storing these goods costs a lot of space and therefore money; losses are increasing day by day, while sales opportunities are decreasing. The pressure increases until the avalanche finally starts to slide and the first ones will begin offering their modules below purchasing or production costs. Competitors are forced to follow suit and the downward spiral is set in motion.
Now one might think that falling prices would have to increase demand. In many cases, the current price level for materials has not yet reached end customers or investors. For many providers, the old inventory, which was purchased at higher prices, is still too large. The wave of devaluation is also just beginning, which is why the price drop is becoming more severe from month to month. Many still hope to get away with a black eye. But the risk of being stuck with the old goods is very high. Those interested in photovoltaics also monitor prices very closely and compare offers. Accordingly, many end customers are now waiting for the offered prices to fall further and are hesitating to place an order.
So everything now depends on where the journey takes you. How low do prices have to fall before demand increases again and a balance is achieved?
The production lines in China are already being shut down, and up to 50 GW are to be built in the country this year – in addition to the 80 GW to 90 GW already installed this year. But even if not a single new module came to Europe from China, we would need many months until the module backlog is cleared. The stored modules are also predominantly products with PERC cells, whose efficiencies are lower than those of modules with the latest technology. I doubt that these are suitable for increasing domestic demand strongly. These products are more likely to be used in markets outside of Europe, where people are happy about inexpensive solar modules. In my opinion, only when the existing glut of modules can be reduced will a healthy price level be able to be established in the market again. By then, however, a market shakeout will probably be seen in and some market participants will fall by the wayside.
Overview of the price points differentiated by technology in September 2023 including the changes compared to the previous month (as of Sept. 18, 2023):
