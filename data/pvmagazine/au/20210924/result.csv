The chart shows the curtailed wind and solar for each five-minute interval alongside the half-hourly price over the two-day period. Curtailment has been categorised as economic, where a generator bids a unit out of dispatch to avoid low or negative prices, or system, where despite a generator’s bid being under the clearing price, Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) does not dispatch the unit to keep within constraints and maintain system security.
On Sunday, 19 September 2021, lower weekend demand and sunny but mild weather resulted in average NEM-wide negative prices throughout the day. At its peak, over 3.5 GW of wind and solar was curtailed (over 20% of the ~15 GW generating at the time), 89% of which was driven by economic curtailment, primarily from Queensland solar (24% of total curtailment) and South Australia and Victorian wind (23 and 21% of total).
Monday, 20 September 2021, saw similar weather but increased weekday demand, with higher prices following naturally. Daytime system curtailment increased as those that chose economic curtailment on Sunday priced themselves back in the market, with increased demand meaning less curtailment needed overall. Curtailment was 66% system-driven, dominated by South Australian wind (38% of total), followed by Queensland solar (11% of total); positively, this curtailment in South Australia will reduce in the coming months as 4 synchronous condensers are integrated and increase the allowable amount of VRE at a given time.
This difference in curtailment types over the two days was driven largely by the difference between weekday and weekend demand. As more rooftop solar is installed in Australia, operational demand will continue to decrease. Sunny weekdays are becoming more like weekends, resulting in more negative price intervals. As a result of rooftop solar seeing no price signal and therefore being dispatched irrespective of price, utility scale solar is seeing decreasing captured prices as it competes directly with these rooftop solar volumes. This is making the investment case increasingly difficult.
Whilst system curtailment will reduce as network upgrades allow for higher penetrations of renewable generation, solutions such as co-located battery storage will be required to capture value from energy otherwise lost due to curtailment. Due to costly and complex regulation and participation requirements, few facilities of this type exist to date in the NEM.
The Australian Energy Market Commission’s (AEMC) recent Integrating Storage into the NEM rule change draft determination aims to remove barriers to entry for hybrid generation and storage facilities, including provision for efficient DC-DC connected systems which to date have not been possible under the NER.
As storage costs reduce, co-location with grid-scale solar facilities could be key to remaining competitive with rooftop solar. Increased demand through electrification (e.g. EVs and heat pumps) and green hydrogen production can also mitigate this problem but is unlikely to be significant in the near to mid-term as adoption slowly increases.
Our Energy Market Perspective and Market Alert subscription products provide detailed analysis on the curtailment trends, network developments, and regulatory changes that can impact new and existing generation and storage projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/24/worlds-largest-solarstorage-project-first-of-many-says-developer/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,INDONESIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY,SINGAPORE",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2021",World’s largest solar+storage project ‘first of many’ says developer,"Singapore-based Sun Cable has revealed the $30 billion Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPL) project, which will supply electricity to Singapore from a massive solar PV farm and battery energy storage facility in Australia’s Northern Territory, is the “first of many” megaprojects it is looking to develop.
The revelation comes after Sun Cable this week announced the generation capacity of what is already shaping as the world’s largest solar PV and storage project would be ramped up, with the solar PV farm increased from the original 10 GW to between 17 and 20 GW. The capacity of the battery energy storage system has also been boosted, from the initial 20 GWh to between 36 and 42 GWh of storage.
The project, being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region, will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore.
Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin told pv magazine on Friday the project is not expected to be fully operational until 2028 but said the group has already begun preparatory work on other “similar size” projects, including some which would be Australia-based.
“We have already commenced work on subsequent projects,” he said.
“This is the first of a kind in terms of the scale and intercontinental transmission, but we want this to be the first of many.”
The revelation came after Sun Cable announced it had cleared a key regulatory hurdle with the Indonesian government approving the route for the AAPL transmission cable, which will pass through Indonesian waters.
Indonesia’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, confirmed his government had recommended the route of the submarine cable and granted a subsea survey permit.

Griffin said the approval notice was a significant milestone that brought Sun Cable closer to generating and transmitting “affordable, dispatchable renewable energy to Darwin and Singapore”.
“Given how much of the route passes through Indonesian waters, securing the support of the Indonesian government is critical,” he said.
“It means we can now undertake the rest of our subsea survey and that’s crucial to getting into the detailed design.
“We are developing the technology that integrates solar, storage and high-voltage direct-current transmission technologies, to meet the large-scale demand for renewable energy.”
Sun Cable said the project, backed by billionaires Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes, has the potential to export $2 billion worth of solar electricity each year and deliver total carbon emissions abatement estimated at 8.6 million tonnes of CO2 a year.
The project will also be capable of supplying up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs from 2028, reducing the city-state’s emissions by about 6 million tonnes annually.
Cannon-Brooks, co-founder and CEO of software giant Atlassian, said securing Indonesian support for the project was a major step towards realising Australia’s potential to become one of the world’s largest renewable energy exporters.
“Australia can become a renewable energy superpower,” he said “We can and should tap into our solar resources that could power the world five times over.
“Sun Cable is harnessing this at scale, and its Australia-Asia PowerLink will create massive local and international renewable energy opportunities.”

Griffin said the decision to increase the capacity of the project, flagged last month, had been driven by customer demand for more consistent renewable energy generation and improvements in solar PV and battery technology.
“It is the result of a couple of years of really deep analysis of where solar and battery storage technology is, optimising the system, and responding to a better understanding of what the market is demanding in terms of electricity supply,” he said.
“Improved efficiencies, particularly around solar technology, means we can have higher installed capacity on the same land mass.
“The other part is responding to our customers who really want a flatter supply 24/7. To meet that we needed to increase the generation and we needed to increase the storage capacity as well.”
While a construction start date is yet to be set, Sun Cable expects to reach financial close at the end of 2023 with the first electricity supplied to Darwin in 2026. The first electricity is set to be exported into Singapore in 2027 ahead of achieving full commercial operations at the end of 2028.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/24/renewable-energy-giants-pan-coalkeeper-policy-as-ministers-meet/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2021",Renewable energy giants pan ‘coalkeeper policy’ as ministers meet,"The Energy Security Board’s (ESB) proposed Physical Retailer Reliability Obligation (PRRO), which will provide a new revenue stream to generators in the form of capacity payments, has come under renewed criticism ahead of today’s meeting of federal, state and territory energy ministers.
The proposal – dubbed the ‘coalkeeper subsidy’ by its critics – has been included by the ESB in proposed reforms designed to support the delivery of affordable and reliable power in the National Electricity Market (NEM) beyond 2025.
The controversial proposal will require electricity consumers, via their retailer, to pay primarily conventional generators such as coal and gas plants not just for the electricity they generate, but also for the size of capacity installed in the power plant, irrespective of how often that capacity is needed to generate electricity.
A report published this week by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) suggests the capacity payments could cost consumers up to $6.9 billion a year, or $430 per household.
The proposal has been slammed in an open letter penned by representatives from leading clean energy companies, including French renewables developer Neoen, China-based solar module manufacturer and project developer Risen Energy, German renewables developer Wirsol and Tilt Renewables, part of leading Australian renewable energy provider Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR).
The group warned the proposed reform could undermine “the already fragile confidence in future clean energy investment” and slow Australia’s renewable energy transition.
“The ESB has proposed the establishment of a capacity market, which could be used to subsidise existing coal plants and unnecessarily prolong the life of these increasingly unreliable generators,” the group wrote.
“This would be a fundamental and unjustified change to the Australian energy market.
“Such a mechanism would fundamentally disrupt the energy system, critically undermining investment confidence in the new renewable energy generation and storage that is essential to providing reliability for the future.”
The group also aired concerns about the ESB’s proposed access reform – the proposed congestion management model that would result in charges for new generators connecting to the grid outside of designated Renewable Energy Zones (REZ).
“This mechanism could create uncertainty for investment in new generation and do nothing to support the development of a 21st century grid and much-needed investment in transmission,” the group wrote.
“We believe that there are far better approaches to addressing congestion in the energy system.”
The group did voice its support for the other reforms proposed by the ESB to improve reliability, saying they could help develop a modern energy system but warned going beyond these is entirely unjustified.
“The proposals for a capacity market and new access model would add to the risk and uncertainty facing clean energy investors,” the group said.
“This would exacerbate the slowdown in new large-scale renewable energy investment that has occurred over the past couple of years.”
Johanna Bowyer, co-author of the IEEFA report, was also critical of the ESB’s capacity mechanism proposal, saying it is likely to not only delay the exit of polluting coal plants, but is also poorly designed to support investment in new dispatchable and flexible capacity like batteries and pumped hydro.
“Further, it won’t address the investor uncertainty facing the National Electricity Market, as it will only push the coal exit uncertainty problem further into the future, will not lengthen contracting terms, does nothing to address early mover disadvantage, and does not address the underlying challenges in the market which are driving government intervention,” she said.
Report co-author Tristan Edis, from research and advisory firm Green Energy Markets, said there are more targeted and more cost-effective mechanisms that could be employed instead which address the ailments facing the national electricity market.
“A strengthened regulatory regime for ensuring owners of large and aged power stations give at least three and half years notice of exit based on providing an upfront bond could reduce the uncertainty around coal exit,” he said.
“Furthermore, legislation could also be enacted to set out a schedule for coal generating units to be steadily retired once set amounts of new reliable replacement capacity are built. This would increase certainty around the exit of coal capacity thereby encouraging investment in new capacity.”
Edis said government underwriting schemes could also reduce the early mover disadvantage in batteries and other technologies and encourage new entrants to build new dispatchable capacity.
“Furthermore, the introduction of an overarching emissions reduction policy for the national electricity market would be likely to reduce the extent of ad hoc and difficult to predict government interventions currently occurring to support renewable energy in order to reduce emissions,” he said.
Clean Energy Council (CEC) chief executive Kane Thornton said today’s meeting of energy ministers looms as a “fork in the road” for the future of Australia’s electricity market.
“The rates of investment in large-scale wind and solar projects has fallen 29% in the last year and is down 70% on 2018, with risks and uncertainty continuing to mount for investors,” he said.
“Now is the time to be ensuring that Australia is a more welcome destination for clean energy investors. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) anticipates that between 6 GW and 19 GW of new dispatchable resources will be needed across the National Electricity Market (NEM) by 2040.
“The good news is that investment in utility-scale batteries is ramping up, with over 600 MW of capacity worth over $400 million committed in the first quarter of 2021. But investment confidence is fragile and requires a concerted set of policies and market reform.”
Thornton said investors are urging energy ministers to ensure that all market reforms help rather than hinder investment confidence for these much-needed clean solutions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/24/fraunhofer-ise-develops-solder-free-aluminium-interconnection-tech-for-shingled-pv-modules/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2021",Fraunhofer ISE develops solder-free aluminium interconnection tech for shingled PV modules,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have developed a busbarless, electrically conductive adhesive-free, and solder-free aluminium interconnection that they claim is a cost-effective and flexible solution for the interconnection of separated cells in shingled solar modules. “We will show a mini-module made with our technology at our Fraunhofer ISE Booth at the upcoming Intersolar in Munich,” the Head of Department Production Technology at the Fraunhofer ISE, Jan Nekarda, told pv magazine.
Conventional processes to connect shingled solar cells usually adopt electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs), with which the rear side busbar of one cell is attached to the front side busbar of an adjacent cell. According to Nekarda, it is still unclear how much cheaper the proposed interconnection technology is when compared to the relevant ECA stringing. “Nevertheless we are confident, that a significant cost reduction will remain, due to the very high silver reduction of our technology,” Nekarda said, noting the Fraunhofer ISE started a cooperation with German PV production equipment provider Manz AG to build a machine for industrial implementation via a publicly funded project.
Through the proposed approach, ECAs and screen-printed busbars on both sides of the cells are replaced by an 8-μm-thick aluminium foil, called FoilMet. The foil is joined to the silicon nitride (SiNX) passivation via laser metal bond (LMB) process, which the researchers describe as a non-invasive technique that creates bonds between the passivation of the cell and the foil without penetrating the passivation.
“The silver (Ag) fingers and the aluminium (Al) fingers are microwelded to the foil using 300- to 700-μm-long line-shaped joints performed with a single 1-kW infrared continuous-wave laser leaving no necessity for busbar-like structures,” the scientists said. “The simplicity of FoilMet, which connects the fingers of adjacent cells without more intermediate layers than a single Al foil, is of great advantage compared to an ECA interconnection, with joints from the Al finger to the Ag busbar, to the ECA, to the Ag busbar, and to the Ag finger, and therefore consisting of a multitude of layers.”
The German group compared the performance of the novel interconnection technology with that of a conventional interconnection relying on ECAs. The measurements showed that the module fabricated with the foil achieved an efficiency of 21%, while the device without the foil reached 20.3%, with the 0.7% efficiency advantage being attributed mainly due to the increased fill factor. “Regardless of the cause leading to the disparity in the filling factor, in general, good interconnections using ECA can be achieved,” explained the scientists, adding, “FoilMet Interconnect, however, demonstrates the ability to reliably create interconnections with low series resistance and strings with high efficiencies.”
They analysed the performance of the foil in a TC200 ageing test to assess the long-term stability of the aluminium interconnection and found that the majority of all shingle strings withstood the stresses of encapsulation.
When asked about the applicability of this new technology in a commercial production line, Nekarda said that unfortunately new processes are never “immediately” applicable to commercial production and need some adaptations. “Compared to other innovations the necessary adaptations seem to be little,” he stated. “The metallisation layout has to be changed and the new machine for stringing has to be implemented in the production line. Since new materials are used extensive testing is needed, too.”
The device is described in the paper FoilMet-Interconnect: Busbarless, electrically conductive adhesive-free, and solder-free aluminum interconnection for modules with shingled solar cells, which was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/24/energyaustralia-eyes-pumped-hydro-to-replace-coal-power-plant/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2021",EnergyAustralia eyes pumped hydro to replace coal power plant,"EnergyAustralia has announced it will fast-track the closure of the Mt Piper coal-fired power station near Lithgow as part of its transition to clean energy and commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
The Mt Piper plant was previously scheduled to close in 2042 but EnergyAustralia revealed in an updated Climate Change Statement published on Thursday that it plans to transition out of coal by 2040.
The announcement comes little more than six months after EnergyAustralia confirmed it would bring forward the closure of the Yallourn power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley by four years to mid-2028.
“The clean energy transformation is accelerating, with more renewable, storage and flexible energy technology available at lower costs than ever before,” EnergyAustralia managing director Mark Collette said.
“While Mt Piper’s ultimate retirement date will be determined by several factors, we are committed to long-term planning and supporting the transition for our workers and our local communities.”
EnergyAustralia’s updated Climate Change Statement includes specific emission-reduction targets, including a goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and an interim target to reduce its direct carbon dioxide emissions by more than 60% on 2019-20 levels by 2028-29.
“We have, and will continue to make, significant investments as part of our commitment towards reaching net-zero emissions,” Collette said.
“This includes projects such as our carbon-neutral gas and hydrogen power plant in NSW, Tallawarra B, and the Wooreen battery at Jeeralang in Victoria.”
EnergyAustralia, which is owned by Hong Kong-based CLP Group, is also investigating the feasibility of developing a pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) facility at Lake Lyell near the Mt Piper site.

The project proposes to use the 34-gigalitre Lake Lyell, which was specifically built to supply water to the power station, as a lower reservoir with a new upper reservoir to be built on the southern flank of the adjacent Mt Walker. It would also incorporate existing transmission assets.
Preliminary studies by engineering firm Arup suggest that a pumped hydro project at the Lake Lyell facility could produce 350 MW of renewable energy with more than eight hours of storage – enough to power more than 150,000 households during peak periods.
“There are many positive elements supporting EnergyAustralia’s Lake Lyell PHES, including land and water access rights, proximity to HV infrastructure and the overall site geometry aligning with pumped hydro technical key requirements,” Arup project director Matthew Lloyd-Smith said.
EnergyAustralia said it is currently undertaking detailed financial modelling for the project and estimates that design and development work could take about two years, and construction three years, which means a pumped hydro facility at Lake Lyell could be operating around 2026.
EnergyAustralia chief operating officer Liz Westcott has said the project could play an important role as part of the future energy mix in NSW and support Lithgow’s future in becoming a renewable energy hub.
“Initial studies show that a Lake Lyell pumped hydro energy storage facility has enormous potential to become a major piece of infrastructure for NSW in a transitioning energy system,” she said.
“Pumped hydro will continue to play an important role in providing reliable, affordable and cleaner power for homes and businesses into the future. It’s a low-emission technology that can store large volumes of electricity for quick release, helping to provide cover at times when renewables aren’t available and fill a large gap that will be left by the retirement of coal power plants.
“The ability to operate in seconds will ensure the lights stay on and energy costs are kept down for customers.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/24/agrivoltaics-for-strip-farming/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2021",Agrivoltaics for strip farming,"From pv magazine Global
A consortium formed by Swedish energy company Vattenfall, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Dutch real estate agency Rijksvastgoedbedrijf (RVB), the Aeres University of Applied Sciences, Dutch organisation Zon in Landschap, and the ERF, the largest private organic farm in the Netherlands, is investigating how to combine PV power generation with strip farming.
Strip cropping consists of cultivating narrow, developed, and undeveloped field strips with the aim of reducing erosion by water and wind. This method is particularly widespread in the regions where soil and wind erosion lead to the erosion of the fertile soil surface. It is also used when the slope is too steep, runs too long or other cultivation methods cannot prevent soil erosion or wind erosion.
The research project will include a 0.7 MW pilot agrivoltaic plant near Almere, in the Netherlands’ northern province of Flevoland. “We will test the system and the business models,” Vattenfall’s head of Solar Development NL, Annemarie Schouten, told pv magazine. “We want to investigate the possibilities to increase the rollout of such systems. These technologies are combined with lane farming, a biodiverse and ecological way of farming, where no pesticides have to be used.”
The demonstrator solar plant, called Symbizon, will be built with single-axis trackers and bifacial modules placed at a height of 2.3 m. “We will use a smart tracking algorithm to search for the optimal point for both the crop growth and energy production,” Schouten stated. “Moreover, the turning modules ensure a non-static shading which is expected to be better for the crops.” Strip farming with various crops will be alternated with strips with solar panels, which will make the site accessible for agricultural machines.
In the solar strips, the consortium wants to cultivate herbs, as these normally need less light. “For the pilot in Almere we will use two different row distances of 13 and 7 m, respectively,” Schouten further explained. This safety distance is used for multiple reasons and most importantly to avoid water runoff in the herb strip, she added, pointing out that extensive water runoff from the modules can harm the crops. Next to the pilot plant, the research team has planned a reference field where no PV modules will be installed.
Other crops, such as potatoes, beans, beetroot, broccoli and grains, may be included in the pilot. “We will have to take into account the height of the crops and assess what the influence of shade on the crop growth will be,” Shouten added, noting that there is always a competition for light in these systems, as light is needed for both the plant photosynthesis and energy production. “The biggest challenge here is to assess what the optimal position of the panels will be in each stage of the growth process of the crops, without compromising the electricity yield,” she added.
The research project has a four-year duration and the agrivoltaic facility is planned to come online in the spring of 2022.
In August, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) presented a new approach for building east-west oriented solar parks, which it claimed can prevent soil deterioration and offer the same yield as south-oriented PV plants.
A month later, a group of scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands assessed the effects of south-oriented, large scale PV plants on vegetation, soil, and microclimate in 13 solar parks in the Netherlands and found that a distance between panel rows of at least 1.5 times panel height is crucial to create the best environmental conditions.
