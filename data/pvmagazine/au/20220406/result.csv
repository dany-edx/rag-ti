The Greens are proposing to allocate $1.2 billion to manufacturers of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components in Australia, seeking to relaunch the country’s now dead car industry.
The proposal would also help Australian buy their first EV, cutting costs by up to a generous $15,000 and providing “ulta-cheap” finance for the balance.
The political party is also looking to legislate tough vehicle pollution standards to drive down transport emissions and end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, following a broader global trend.
Finally, the Greens want to put forward $2 billion for publicly owned EV fast charging network as well as electrifying the Commonwealth car fleet by 2025, driving a second-hand EV market.
The Greens
“We’ll cut pollution, create jobs and be energy independent if we restart [South Australia]’s car industry and make it electric,” Greens leader Adam Bandt said. 
“The Liberals flattened SA’s car industry but the Greens want to recharge it,” he added.
South Australia held its state government elections just over a fortnight ago, in which Labor took power from the Liberal government and the Greens enjoyed a healthy boost to their numbers.
The party is looking to continue its success in the federal election, saying that if its lead South Australian candidate Professor Barbara Pocock were elected the party would be on track to be the biggest third party in the Senate ever, potentially holding a balance of power.

Worley said it will help the project to “optimise” its 25 GW of wind and solar generation. Overall, the project is aiming to produce over 1.8 million tonnes of green hydrogen to transform into as much as 10 million tonnes of green ammonia per annum.
The Green Energy Oman project will have a site area of up to 6,500 km2, according to InterContinental. The final investment decision on the US$30 billion (AU$39 billion) project is expected in 2026.
“Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonise hard to abate sectors where there’s no obvious alternative,” Dr Hans Dieter Hermes, Vice President of Clean Hydrogen at Worley, said.
In February, Worley became part of another international green hydrogen play, signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Swedish-Swiss electrical equipment firm ABB, and American tech giant IBM. The agreement will see the trio develop an “integrated, digitally enabled solution for facility owners to build green hydrogen assets more quickly, cheaply, and safely, and operate them more efficiently.”

Hertz is currently in negotiations with Polestar to finalise orders for Australia, but says there will be a “significant number” of the purchased model, the Polestar 2, joining its Australian fleet later this year.
“The partnership with Polestar is an exciting opportunity to introduce premium EV products into our retail and rideshare fleets,” Hertz’ APAC Vice President, Eoin Macneill, said.
International Energy Agency (IEA)
While EV uptake in Australia has been very slow off the mark compared to China, Europe, and the US, the International Energy Agency noted earlier this year that alongside Korea, Australia shows the “greatest dynamism among smaller markets.”
EV sales in Australia more than tripled in 2021, growing from 6,900 sales in 2020 to 20,665 in 2021. From this notably low baseline, EV’s marketshare for new car sales now sits above 2% in Australia. The global average is 10%.
While a number of Australian states have brought, or are bringing, in new measure to incentivise EV uptake, there hasn’t been a national scheme here that other countries have enjoyed. EVs also tend to have far longer purchase lead times in Australia, which certainly hasn’t helped.
Tesla continues to be Australia’s most popular EV brand.

The 72MW array is the first phase of a bigger 116MW solar project that is set for completion by the end of this year.
AC Energy, the renewable energy unit of Philippines-based conglomerate Ayala Corp., and Citicore Power, which is affiliated with Megawide Construction, said the project is already providing electricity to the local grid. It is now being assessed by National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP).
“This huge solar plant shall be managed and operated in-house by our Citicore Property Managers,” said Citicore CEO Oliver Tan. “We have eight solar farms and one micro-grid solar rooftop under our management.”
The new 72MW solar plant is expected to generate 105GWh of power per year. However, the companies did not reveal any additional technical or financial details about the project.
In February, AC Energy completed and switched on a 40MW/60MWh storage facility at the 120MW Alaminos Solar plant, one of the largest operational PV projects in the Philippines. The nation currently supports large-scale renewables via an auction scheme. A growing number of utility-scale solar projects are now being developed and constructed under power purchase agreements.
The country plans to install 15GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that the Philippines had a total installed PV capacity of 1.04GW by the end of 2020. Much of the country’s build-out has been driven by the national renewable energy law. Most of its solar capacity has also been built and operated under the old feed-in tariff regime, auctions, and net metering programs.

The latest doom-laden report issued by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has highlighted solar as having the biggest potential for energy sector emission reduction this decade.
The “Climate Change 2022 Mitigation of Climate Change” document published yesterday by the IPCC estimated solar panels could reduce carbon emissions by 4.25 gigatonnes per year this decade, with more than half that potential at a lower cost than reference electricity prices, rising to an additional US$50 to US$100 per tonne of CO2 abated. The report noted, however, that estimate does not include the cost of integrating solar into electric grids.
That carbon emission reduction potential compares to around a billion tonnes per year abated by industrial materials efficiency; 750 million tonnes per year from each of building-hosted renewables, such as rooftop solar, and light-duty electric vehicles (EVs), such as passenger cars; and around 250 million tonnes from heavy-duty EVs, including e-buses.
Reiterating the 85% price falls seen for solar in the last decade – and the tenfold rise in deployment volumes – the report stated renewables will remain the best-cost option for generation this decade but will require greater sector coupling and use of energy storage, smart grids, demand-side management, and green hydrogen and its derivatives to fulfil its potential to drive down energy sector carbon emissions.
Only supporting policy, technology availability, finance, and public and political support will enable the ironing out of global imbalances which, for instance, have seen such low take-up of solar in sub-Saharan Africa, the IPCC noted.
The critical importance of the energy sector’s workhorse role in limiting global temperature rises this century was emphasised by the authors of the 64-page policymaker summary of the full, 3,675-page report. “In modelled global pathways that limit warming to 2C… or lower, most remaining fossil fuel CO2 emissions until the time of global net zero CO2 emissions are projected to occur outside the power sector, mainly in industry and transport,” they wrote.
The study estimated transport will be unable to hit net-zero this century, despite the low-carbon contributions of EVs, green hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia and synthetic fuel (synfuel). That means negative carbon emissions will have to be found in other sectors, including from the direct capture of carbon from the air, which the IPCC said would make a contribution of less than 1% to the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts in its renewables-heavy future scenario.
While green hydrogen and its associated fuels will have to come down in price, the report stated: “Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis.” The document added, more will have to be invested in EV infrastructure, and raw materials supply fears will have to be addressed by resource diversification, circular materials flows, and energy and material efficiency improvements.
While electrification can make a contribution to carbon reduction from short haul shipping and aviation, the sector will need to have much more ambitious climate change aims and governance to do its part, the IPCC stated.
The crucial role to be played by low-carbon electricity and energy carriers in reducing the CO2 footprint of global transport is a notable example of the sector coupling called for by the UN body.
Demand management, materials and energy efficiency, circular material flows, and hydrogen will all be needed to decarbonise industry, with synfuels, ammonia and heat pumps making a contribution in light industry, mining, and manufacturing, the report stated.
The IPCC also noted the potential for renewable energy resource-rich areas of the globe to claim new chemicals and steel industry facilities, as has been noted by African commentators who oppose the idea of exporting all African hydrogen.
Solar can also play a part in reducing the carbon footprint of buildings, through retrofitting in established global cities and as stipulated in building codes which could green the building materials supply chain in emerging urban centres. The report stated: “The 2020-2030 decade is critical for accelerating the learning of knowhow, building the technical and institutional capacity, setting the appropriate governance structures, ensuring the flow of finance, and in developing the skills needed to fully capture the mitigation potential of buildings.”
The IPCC reiterated a familiar refrain, that the world must invest three to six times more on climate change mitigation and adaptation to stay below a two-degree temperature rise this century, depending on the scenario modelled. The biggest funding shortfall in such measures concerns the agriculture and forestry sector, the report noted, an industry where more intensive farming and production for less meat-intensive diets could free up more sites for solar and wind plants.
The study said carbon pricing has proven useful to drive emission reductions from low-cost technologies but less so for the more expensive measures needed for hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. The report’s authors did take encouragement, however, from a lack of evidence emissions trading schemes had led to carbon leakage, thanks to their design.
As far as paying the bill to stave off catastrophic climate change, pushing the developed world to meet its commitment to provide US$100 billion per year to developing countries would be a start, as would sharing, and thereby reducing, investment risk in developing markets, the IPCC added.
And the cost of not coughing up? According to the study, the policies in place around the world at the end of 2020 have us on target for a 3.2 C average temperature rise this century.
