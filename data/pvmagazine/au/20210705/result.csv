The Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool (HEFT), developed by researchers from Monash University in collaboration with government agency Geoscience Australia, is a free online tool that assesses the economic viability of potential hydrogen operations across Australia.
Stuart Walsh, senior lecturer in Resources Engineering at Monash University, said the tool has the ability to conduct detailed geospatial-financial analysis of future large-scale hydrogen projects.
It assesses the quality of energy resources including wind, solar PV, concentrated solar power, steam methane reformation (SMR) with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and coal gasification with CCS, and also considers other associated costs including transportation, infrastructure and storage.
“It’s a tool we’ve developed in collaboration with Geoscience Australia to identify regions of potential development of new hydrogen projects,” Walsh told pv magazine.
“In particular we’re looking at those areas which are best suited for developing hydrogen projects from an economic perspective.”
The Australian government has committed to green hydrogen – generated by electrolysis powered by solar PV and wind energy – as a fuel for the future, formally recognising it as a ‘priority technology’ in the Technology Investment Roadmap announced late last year.
The government has set an economic ‘stretch goal’ to produce green hydrogen for $2p/kg. At that price green hydrogen is expected to be cost competitive with gas produced using fossil fuels.
Walsh said that modelling completed using the HEFT, using technology cost reduction forecasts provided by financial research company BloombergNEF, indicated that the goal is achievable.
“It’s definitely possible, especially over that 10-year timeframe,” he said.
“A lot can change over that period but if the Bloomberg numbers hold up, keeping in mind they are a bit optimistic, then our model predicts you can get to that $2 farm gate production target.”

The HEFT modelling indicates off-grid hydrogen production using solar PV could be as low as $2p/kg by 2030. Adding water and delivery costs would lead to a hydrogen cost just below $3p/kg before shipping.
“The Bloomberg figures are generally accepted as being fairly optimistic estimates, but nevertheless they provide one baseline against which you can judge what the potential future cost will be to produce hydrogen in different places,” Walsh said, adding the speed of achieving the $2p/kg goal depends on many factors, including the momentum of technology adoption, costs of renewable generation facilities, the utilisation factor of the electrolyser, configurations of the hydrogen supply chain, and delivery of supporting infrastructure.
“We’ve seen even over the last couple of years the estimated price of what it costs to produce hydrogen has fallen quite dramatically and people are also predicting that it will continue to fall which is in line with those predictions,” he said.
“It’s just very hard to say at this point what those curves will look like into the future.
“The fact that there is uncertainty, I don’t want to give the impression that that necessarily is a bad thing it’s just that we don’t know. The prices are changing rapidly. They are changing for the better but what that will mean in the future is something that we will be waiting to see.”
The federal government is keen to capture a significant share of the growing global export demand for green hydrogen and state governments have also embraced the vision, announcing their goals and actions in support of the development of a hydrogen industry.
Walsh, who teamed with postdoctoral research associate Chanlong Wang and Geoscience Australia’s Laura Easton and Andrew Feitz on the HEFT project, said the tool could support decision making by policymakers and investors on the location of new infrastructure and development of hydrogen hubs in Australia.
“The Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool is an online website and it allows anyone to jump on and work out different areas around Australia which are well suited for different types of hydrogen production,” he said.
“Originally it stemmed from a project we had with Geoscience Australia that was looking at economic potential of developing new mining projects and mineral developments.
“From that we developed a code called Bluecap and we realised quite early on that we could extend the codes we were running in Bluecap into other areas and one of the areas that we were particularly keen on looking at was hydrogen production and renewable resources.”

The HEFT is an open-source modelling tool, freely available via Geoscience Australia’s AusH2 portal. The software has been designed to be as flexible as possible and the modular design allows users to input their own assumptions and cost curves and run an analysis on those.
“In addition to that, we’ve also got the Bluecap code itself which is open-source software,” Walsh said.
“We recognise there are some calculations that are perhaps better done on your own machines, whether that be because of the size of the data involved or the type of calculations that you want to run so we’re making the engine that underlies the Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool available for people download and play with themselves and try their own assumptions and own analyses as well.”
There are also plans to expand the tool’s capabilities with the aim to optimise the development of shared infrastructure to facilitate large-scale hydrogen production and delivery, attracting investment into Australia’s hydrogen industry.
Further inclusions of battery, hydro, pumped hydro energy storage, and delivery infrastructures will be added to the tool. Large-scale hydrogen storage will also be incorporated in future works.
While large-scale hydrogen production has not yet been implemented in Australia, there’s an increasing number of pilot, demonstration and small-scale projects in various development stages around the country.
Walsh expects the rollout of small-scale projects will provide a more concrete base on which to judge green hydrogen production costs and said the early signs are promising.
“We’ve seen some early data that is at least in line with some of the more optimistic estimates so once we see how the projects pan out, it will provide a lot more certainty around the cost estimates,” he said.
Project team member Chanlong Wang is due to present the Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool at the Energy Next Exhibition in Sydney next month.
Originally scheduled to be staged at the International Convention Centre next week, the event has been pushed back to August 25-26 o Covid-19 restrictions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/05/maoneng-lodges-application-for-225-mw-450-mwh-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 5, 2021",Maoneng lodges application for 225 MW/450 MWh big battery,"Maoneng Australia has filed its development application for the $112.5 million Gould Creek battery storage project in South Australia, declaring the utility scale battery will aid the increasing penetration of renewables in the grid and provide stability for the energy market.
The developer has commenced the project’s notification period with the submission of its development application with the state government’s State Commission Assessment Panel (SCAP).
The application proposes the construction of a 225 MW/450 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) on a 30-hectare site at Gould Creek, about 20 kilometres north of Adelaide’s city centre.
The Gould Creek BESS project, which would eclipse the recently expanded 150 MW/194 MWh ‘Tesla Big Battery’ known officially as the Hornsdale Power Reserve, will comprise approximately 240 shipping containers.
Maoneng has not yet provided details about the chemistry of the batteries it intends to build but said the BESS will be capable of providing enough energy to support up to 40,000 households at peak hours.
An operations and maintenance building will also be constructed on the secured  site alongside a 33/220 kV substation.
The Gould Creek project will connect to the high voltage 275 kV transmission grid via ElectraNet’s existing Para Substation, located less than 100 metres away from the proposed construction site.
The project, which is scheduled for completion in 2023, has already received in principle support from the state government with Department for Energy and Mines chief executive Paul Heithersay writing that the development can be considered “essential infrastructure” and has the potential to benefit South Australia.

The development application report, prepared by engineering and energy consultancy firm GHD, stresses that the project will be critical to ensuring the stability of the grid as it transitions to renewable energy.
“The proposed BESS represents a critical electrical infrastructure to the state,” the application documents read.
“As South Australia transitions to a greater share of intermittent renewable energy sources, grid stability facilities such as grid-scale batteries are required to ensure the safe and reliable provision of electricity.
“The system will support the safe and efficient operation of South Australia’s energy grid.”
The Gould Creek BESS is another addition to the growing list of big batteries in the pipeline for the National Electricity Market (NEM), including a 250 MW/250 MWh battery being constructed by energy giant AGL at the site of its coal-fired Torren Island Power Station in South Australia.
Data supplied by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows that financial commitments for new utility-scale battery projects in Australia increased four-fold between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, from 150 MW to 600 MW in the first three months of this year.
As well as those projects to have reached financial close, the CEC said at least 15 other large-scale battery storage projects have been announced this year, representing more than 6.6 GW of capacity and $4.3 billion in investment.
That number is likely to increase with the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposing a new rule in April to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the NEM, services that will come largely from batteries.
The Gould Creek project builds on Maoneng’s Australian portfolio which includes a deal to develop four large-scale batteries, each 50 MW/100 MWh in capacity in New South Wales (NSW), for energy giant AGL.
The deal includes a 15-year contract that will allow AGL to call on capacity from the batteries at a fixed price. The batteries are expected to be installed by 2023.
That project adds to the 300 MW Solar Offtake deal Maoneng signed with AGL in December 2017 by which AGL sources energy from, among other solar projects, the 200 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm in south-west NSW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/05/aer-report-highlights-reliability-issues-for-future-energy-market/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 5, 2021",AER report highlights reliability issues for future energy market,"A new report from the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) shows the National Electricity Market (NEM) is undergoing a “profound transformation” with a record investment in rooftop solar driving the need for a significant package of reforms to ensure the market framework remains fit for purpose.
AER Chair Clare Savage said the latest State of the Energy Market report shows the NEM is transitioning from a centralised system of large coal and gas generation, towards a mixture of smaller scale, widely dispersed wind and solar generators, and battery storage.
The AER’s annual assessment of the market, released on Friday, reveals more than 3.7 GW of large-scale solar and wind generation capacity entered the NEM in 2020 and there was also record investment in rooftop solar, with almost 2.5 GW of new capacity installed across New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania.
The new additions delivered record levels of wind and solar generation in 2020, accounting for more than 19% of total electricity generation across the five NEM jurisdictions.
The growth in renewables also contributed to wholesale power price falls in Australia of up to 58% with average prices dropping below $70 MWh for the first time since 2015.

The influx of renewables is expected to continue with the report forecasting that over the next two decades up to 24 GW of new rooftop solar PV capacity will come online, along with up to 50 GW of new large-scale wind and solar capacity.
Energy storage is also expanding, through grid-scale and household batteries, and pumped hydro facilities while technologies including hydrogen and electric vehicles (EVs) are also set to impact on both supply and demand in the grid.
“Energy consumers are adopting their own behind-the-meter energy solutions, embracing distributed energy resources (DERs) that include rooftop solar PV installations, small batteries, electric vehicles and demand response,” Savage said.
The AER said the growth in renewable energy generation is also contributing to financial stress on fossil fuel generators, with the profitability of coal and gas plants challenged by low or negative prices in the middle of the day, when solar generation is at its maximum.
There was a record 3,662 instances of negative spot prices across the NEM in 2020 with minimum demand falling in every NEM jurisdiction, driven by the growth of rooftop solar.
“Almost 24% of all consumers in the NEM now partly meet their electricity needs through rooftop solar and sell excess electricity back into the grid, compared with less than 0.2% of consumers in 2007,” Savage said.
“These systems combined represent around 17% of the NEM’s total generation capacity with rooftop solar PV meeting 6.4% of the NEM’s total electricity requirements in 2020.”
The AER has forecast that the continued penetration of renewables will lead to the retirement of 16 GW of thermal generation, or 61% of the current coal fleet in the NEM within the next two decades.

Savage said the transition to renewables and the associated reduction in output from the fossil-fuel plants has however made the grid more susceptible to erratic frequency shifts and voltage instability.
Shortages of system strength have emerged in South Australia and Tasmania, and parts of Victoria and Queensland. South Australia also faces an inertia shortage, reinforcing the need for investment in on-demand types of generation and batteries to keep the system stable.
“We know that with the growth of renewable generation there needs to be investment in dispatchable resources to stabilise the grid, such as demand response, quick-starting flexible hydro or gas generation and battery storage technology,” Savage said.
Savage said the AER and other regulatory bodies would also have a critical role to play in maintaining system reliability, pointing to the Australian Energy Market Commission’s (AEMC) introduction of new frequency services to manage the rising incidence of frequency deviations.
The AEMC also announced a series of draft reforms in April designed to make transmission networks responsible for providing system strength services.
A further focus of recent reforms has been on planning and coordinating transmission and generation investment with renewable energy zones (REZs) identified as part of the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Integrated System Plan.
AEMO is also considering providing transmission authorities in the NEM with permission to restrict solar PV output as a way of mitigating the threat to the security of the NEM.
The powers, which are already in place in South Australia and were used for the first time in March, can instruct network operators in the state to back off rooftop solar generation, forcing them to draw power from the grid.
Alongside the coordinated reforms, governments are directly intervening in the market through various funding mechanisms for new generation or storage capacity –  including the 300 MW / 450 MWh Victoria Big Battery storage facility near Geelong –  to meet short-term reliability and security requirements and carbon emissions targets.

The international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 58 of Solar cell efficiency tables in Progress in Photovoltaics.
“In Version 58, we report 10 new results largely since January 2021,” Green told pv magazine. “Those of most interest will likely be the 4 new perovskite cell, minimodule and tandem cell results, although new efficiencies for more commercially relevant silicon heterojunction and TOPCon cells are also reported.”
Since 1993 when the Tables were started, the research group saw major improvements in all cell categories. “Copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) and multijunction cells have seen the most consistent gains, although perovskites have recently seen similar overall gains compressed into a shorter timescale,” Greener specified.
He also explained that the most important criterion for inclusion in the tables is that the results be independently measured at a test centre on the group’s list. “As well as efficiency, we now publish the cell’s current-voltage and spectral response curve and sometimes include cryptic comments on measurement procedure or general comments on likely cell stability,” he emphasised. “The industry has shown that improved efficiency is the key to lower cost, stressing its fundamental importance, although stability is also a key factor as well as, for mass deployment, abundance and non-toxicity of the cell’s constituent materials.”
According to the scientist, the more mature cell materials, such as silicon and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are close to demonstrating their full potential, although still plenty of scope for improvement by combining with other materials in multijunction cells. “Organic solar cells have seen a recent burst in performance that I think will take them to over 20% efficiency while other earth-abundant, non-toxic cells such as those based on kesterite (CZTS) still have massive scope for improvement,” he added.
Referring to the importance of independent third-party certification of the achieved efficiencies, Green said that history has shown, on multiple occasions, that it is unwise to trust cell results based on “in-house” measurements. “All of our recognised test centres are carefully vetted prior to inclusion on our list and have been involved in round-robin testing with one another, ensuring consistency of measurements to well within the uncertainty estimates included with the published results,” the professor stated.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE), Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), and the US Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have developed a novel valuation framework for hydrogen storage that they claim can help utilities, regulators, energy suppliers and researchers assess the economic benefits of storing the clean fuel.
Called the Hydrogen Energy Storage Evaluation Tool (HESET), the new framework is an adapted version of PNNL’s Energy Storage Evaluation Tool (ESET), which was created by the research group in 2013. It is able to assess individual system components, different hydrogen flow pathways, various grid and end-user services, and multi-dimensional couplings.
“This tool is unique in that it allows for modelling of stacked revenue streams, like grid services and several different hydrogen end uses,” said PNNL researcher Di Wu, noting that stored hydrogen may be used for grid services such as frequency regulation, capacity value, deferral of transmission or distribution equipment upgrades, demand charge reductions, and demand response.
According to Wu, hydrogen storage differs from other forms of energy storage, as it is able to interact with multiple sectors at a relatively low cost per volume for long-term storage.
The research team has already tested the novel tool on different configurations of electrolysers with capacities ranging from 1 to 10 MW and discovered that, if properly sized, the system is not only economically feasible but it may also provide up to 1.5 times return on investment. “Economic benefits from bundling grid services can make a hydrogen energy storage project more cost-effective,” Wu further explained. “Value streams must be identified and appropriately monetised to make hydrogen storage a more financially competitive option and thereby adopted at scale.”
