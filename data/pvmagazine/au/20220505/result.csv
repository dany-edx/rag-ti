Australia’s first coordinated renewable energy zone (REZ) is to be centred around the town of Dubbo in the NSW central west. The Central-West Orana REZ is planned to unlock at least 3GW of new network capacity by the mid-2020s, enough to power 1.4 million homes.
The network operator will be responsible for designing, financing, building, operating and maintaining the network infrastructure for the clean energy zone. The new grid connections will include energy hubs and new high-capacity transmission lines.
The short-listed tenderers for the Central-West Orana REZ transmission network include ACE Energy, comprising Spanish renewable energy company Acciona, Cobra and electricity distributor Endeavour Energy.

Also making the shortlist is Network REZolution, which comprises CIMIC Group companies Pacific Partnerships, UGL and CPB Contractors, along with APA Group, Australia’s largest natural gas infrastructure business.
The third of the short-listed tenderers is NewGen Networks, comprising infrastructure investor Plenary Group, Spanish infrastructure giant Elecnor, SecureEnergy (the joint venture of Elecnor and Australian engineering and construction company Clough), and the NSW Government-owned network operator Essential Energy.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), which has been tasked with implementing the government’s REZs, said it will soon invite the shortlisted tenderers to respond to a Request for Proposal, with the contract to be awarded next year.
Deputy Premier Paul Toole said the announcement of the shortlist was an exciting milestone for what he described as a “modern-day power station”.
“The network operator will play a critical role in the REZ by connecting power from energy suppliers, including wind and solar farms, and distributing it to energy consumers across the state,” he said.
The Central-West Orana REZ is the first of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW Government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, which it expects will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state. REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, South-West and Illawarra regions.

The revised transmission line will boost capacity of the Central-West Orana REZ.NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said the Central-West Orana REZ will play a pivotal role in the state’s plans to deliver a cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy sector ahead of the planned retirement of the state’s aging thermal-generation fleet.
“Combining generation and storage with poles and wires, the REZ will capitalise on economies of scale to deliver energy to homes and businesses in NSW,” he said.
The Central-West Orana REZ was originally expected to deliver 3GW of new solar, wind and storage capacity but that appears certain to be revised.
A call for registrations of interest in the Central-West Orana REZ last year attracted 113 registrations, totalling 27GW and valued at $38 billion, a response that Kean labelled “astounding”.
Since then, the government has announced a revised transmission corridor that could help it almost quadruple the size of the planned clean energy zone.
“As the new route can accommodate additional transmission lines, it gives us options to deliver nearly four times the amount of renewable power to the grid with the same infrastructure,” Kean said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/05/regulator-investigating-potential-1-7-million-solar-panel-fraud/,"LEGAL,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 5, 2022",Regulator investigating potential $1.7 million solar panel fraud,"Commonwealth government agency, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER), confirmed on Thursday it had this week executed search warrants on three Perth addresses connected to a Western Australia-based solar panel retail and installation company.
The CER is investigating whether the Perth-based company has fabricated information about who installed almost 550 solar panel installations. The CER said approximately $1.7m in STCs had been created for these installations.
While the CER did not identify the company or the timeframe during which the installations occurred, it said the execution of the search warrants comes after an extended period of investigation.
The regulator said the search warrants aimed to uncover evidence of fraudulent activity and of false information being provided to the CER resulting in the improper creation of Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs).
The CER said it will decide at the completion of the investigation if it will pursue a prosecutions but warned if criminal charges are laid, a person could face up to 10 years in jail for fraud-related offences.
The CER said in a statement it “is absolutely committed to the very highest standards of integrity and treats any breaches seriously”.
“Agents, installers, and retailers who fail to adequately ensure that STCs are eligible for creation or are party to the provision of false and misleading information, may face criminal, civil or administrative action,” it said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/05/greens-propose-to-electrify-entire-town-in-ambitious-new-pilot-providing-household-evs/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 5, 2022","Greens propose to electrify entire town in ambitious new pilot, providing household EVs","Greens leader Adam Bandt has this morning unveiled a new component of the party’s climate and energy policy in the lead up to the federal election later this month, announcing plans for a pilot program to electrify the entirety of a suburb and a regional town. 
“These suburbs and towns will become a model,” Bandt said during the Smart Energy Convention in Sydney this morning.
Bandt said the pilot project would seek to show that by 2025 it will be cost effective for households to be completely electric, largely powered by rooftop and community solar and batteries. It would also demonstrate the possibility of having a jurisdiction that has zero energy emissions, while developing trade and industry knowledge for the future roll out.
The project would involve the installation of solar power, electric heating and cooking and providing an electric vehicle (EV) for every home that wants to participate in a specific area and could include the installation of community batteries at a local substation level.
“This hasn’t been achieved anywhere in the world,” Bandt said. “It’s time to get off the gas, get batteries in our homes, and solar on the roof. We will show this works at scale, creating jobs and powering up a community.
“That’s why we want to create a pilot project for a suburb and regional town to power past coal and gas, and unlock all the benefits of clean, renewable energy,
“This will not only bring down costs for people, it will create jobs and industry know-how to be able to get ready for the transition we need to get off coal and gas.”
The program would be financed by a $235 million fund The Greens are proposing to allocate for its realisation, as well as using funding from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), Bandt said.
The Greens would task the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) with administering the project, partnering with a local distribution network.
The pilot is a new element of the climate and energy policy plan The Greens released last week, which seeks to see Australia at net-zero emissions by 2035.
Bandt said the pilot project was inspired by the work of Saul Griffith at Rewiring Australia which is advocating for complete electrification as the priority step for decarbonisation.

“Rewiring Australia is working with parties and candidates across the political spectrum to help them understand the benefits that electrification will bring for electorates across Australia,” Griffith said.
“Electrification is the fastest, most cost effective way to slash emissions. It also demolishes household energy bills by $5,000 per year, bringing serious financial relief to folks who are feeling the pinch.
“The Greens have clearly grasped the opportunity offered by electrification. More than three million Australian homes already enjoy the incredible benefit of solar panels thanks to modest investment from Government to foster that industry. Now we can go further and fully electrify our homes and cars.”
Bandt said the pilot project would be possible because of the massive penetrations of residential rooftop solar in many areas of Australia. To better use this clean electricity produced by households during the day, the project would include the roll out of residential and community storage capacity, which would also be integrated with energy management technologies. 
Australian households currently contribute almost one third of Australia’s carbon emissions, making their decarbonisation through electrification a clear target for climate and energy policy.
Bandt also noted that Australia currently has 114 new coal and gas projects in its pipeline, projects which are largely supported by both the Morrison Government and the Labor Party. “That’s why this election is so important,” he said, adding that the Greens would put a freeze on these projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/05/development-deal-for-queensland-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 5, 2022",Development deal done for Queensland green hydrogen project,"Queensland government-owned generator CS Energy and natural gas producer Senex have agreed to form a joint venture (JV) to develop the Kogan Renewable Hydrogen Demonstration Plant near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Darling Downs region.
The hydrogen plant will be built next to CS Energy’s coal-fired Kogan Creek Power Station, though its 600-700kW hydrogen electrolyser will be exclusively powered by a co-located 2MW solar PV farm. The project will also include a hydrogen fuel cell of up to 50kW, hydrogen storage and out-loading facility.
A battery energy storage system will also form part of the energy hub being created at Kogan Creek with CS Energy recently announcing it plans to build a 100MW/200MWh battery at the site.
The solar-powered hydrogen facility, which is set to produce 50 tonnes of green hydrogen annually, is expected to be operating before the end of 2023. CS Energy has already signed an offtake agreement with Japan’s Sojitz Corporation for the green hydrogen produced at the plant.
IHI Engineering Australia, a subsidiary of IHI Corporation Japan, has been appointed to construct the Kogan Creek plant, with work due to start on site in September this year.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de de Brenni said the project is an opportunity for CS Energy to stake its territory in the hydrogen sector with the state government providing the publicly owned utility with $28.9 million to help finance the demonstration plant and an associated refueller network.
“Green hydrogen is key to diversifying our energy sector, building on our long-term energy know-how in regional Queensland and attracting significant international investment in job-creating heavy manufacturing,” he said.
“Today’s announcement will contribute to the success of the Kogan demonstration plant and support Queensland’s ambitions to become a hydrogen and renewable energy superpower.”
CS Energy
Under the joint venture agreement, CS Energy will operate and hold 75% equity in the plant, with Senex Energy to hold the remaining 25% equity.
CS Energy chief executive officer Andrew Bills said both companies recognised the enormous potential of green hydrogen to contribute to a low-carbon future in Australia.
“CS Energy is excited to welcome Senex Energy as our partner at this key point in the project as we move to the construction phase later this year,” he said.
“There is a strong strategic alignment between CS Energy and Senex Energy around the opportunities the energy transformation will bring. Senex Energy’s experience in the gas sector will be invaluable during the demonstration and as we evaluate future opportunities to increase renewable hydrogen production to commercial scale.”

Senex Energy CEO Ian Davies said the company’s participation in the project underlined its commitment to the supply of reliable, affordable and sustainable energy.
“To ensure Queensland’s and Australia’s energy security, and reach net zero targets, we need all forms of energy to work together. The natural gas sector is the ideal partner for development of a renewable hydrogen industry and that’s why we’re investing in this project,” he said.
The Kogan Renewable Hydrogen Demonstration Plant is among a host of renewable energy projects being progressed near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Down, with the region emerging as a key renewable energy hub in the state.
The region is home to the biggest solar farm proposed in the state so far, with French renewables developer Neoen continuing work on its massive $600 million Western Downs Green Power Hub that will include a 460 MWp solar farm and a 200MW/400MWh big battery.
Singapore-based Vena Energy has also established itself in the region with its 100MW/150MWh Wandoan South big battery project nearing completion while Spanish renewables developer X-Elio expects its 200MW Blue Grass Solar Farm developed just north of Chinchilla to achieve full commercial operations early this year.
