As a reminder, the current settlement price (SP) is determined by averaging six dispatch interval prices within a half-hour period. From October 2021, the dispatch price (DP) will be the settlement price. While the NEM already dispatches on a 5-minute basis, there is no certainty as to how (if at all) price outcomes and the operation of NEM participants will change under the new rules.
Under 5MS, one-off price spikes (and floors) which could have been averaged out in 30 min settlement would now be fully costed. Put differently, there is no opportunity to use the power of averaging to alter settlement in the 5MS world – bids will need to more accurately reflect a participant’s willingness to supply.
History may not be the best predictor of 5MS impacts, since current behaviours align with the current settlement process, however it does highlight edge cases and scenarios which may results in a material difference in outcomes post October 2021 (Figure 1, above).
 
It’s important to note that in ~85% of dispatch intervals in 2020, the two pricing methodologies are similar. However, in 15% of intervals there is a difference of at least $10/MWh between the two prices (3% where diff. > $50). While small in proportion, this still accounts for ~5,000 dispatch intervals where DP is at least $100 higher than SP. The opposite is also true where ~3,500 dispatch intervals had DP is at least $100 less than SP.
Some of these discrepancies may be legacy artefacts of the current settlement methodology, however it is likely that the current dynamics observed in dispatch continue which could be material given the potential for significant financial impacts when the price deviates in either extreme – note that as the generation mix increases in intermittency so too does the potential for significant swings in price outcomes in the 5MS world. Therefore, there is an increasing importance for effective hedging tools/ strategies/ products to avoid significant financial impacts of unforeseen price events – however time will tell which methods, strategies or technologies will rise to the top in mitigating the risk.
One product is the 5-minute cap product which the ASX recently listed. After the first month there has been some decent volume traded. Open interest is over 1,200 at time of writing with most volumes traded in QLD and VIC. Focusing on Q122, while a long way away, early trading would suggest an expectation of increased volatility with cap products trading between $15.15 (in QLD) and $22.50 (in VIC). For context, under 5MS a single period at the Market Price Cap (MPC) will contribute ~50c to cap product value. which would indicate expectations of around 30-40 intervals at the MPC. As we approach go-live, the potential impacts of 5MS will become clearer however, it’s very likely that the first year of 5MS will see conservative operations while participants adjust their strategies to the new paradigm.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/22/solar-discrimination-sees-electricity-retailer-fined-300000/,"LEGAL,RESIDENTIAL PV,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 22, 2021","Solar discrimination sees electricity retailer fined $300,000","Victoria’s Essential Services Commission has issued Powershop, a subsidiary of Meridian Energy, 15 penalty notices after it discovered the company had exclusively offered cheaper tariffs to non-solar customers between 10 September 2019 and 7 April 2020.
The average monetary disadvantage solar-owners faced over the eight-month period was between $25.13, with the highest discrepancy being $302.53.
The issue stemmed from Powershop’s Kogan Energy brand, where it was found that Kogan Energy’s Market Offers were not being made available to solar customers. Instead, solar customers could only access the tariffs under the Kogan Energy Solar Market Offers, which were more expensive.
The Commission’s Chair, Kate Symons, said it was a clear violation of the state’s energy rules under Victoria’s Electricity Industry Act 2000.
“The Act requires licensees to offer to sell electricity to solar customers at the same tariffs and on the same terms and conditions that it offers to non-solar customers,” she said.
Powershop Australia’s CEO, Jason Stein, has since apologised, describing the company as “honestly gutted.”
“We unreservedly apologise to our 161 customers that were impacted by this failure on our part and more broadly to our customers who will be disappointed to learn of these penalty notices,” Stein told SolarQuotes.
“The whole team is honestly gutted that we made this mistake as it is absolutely not within our DNA, culture or our approach to business to negatively impact customers or to contravene industry regulations.”
The Commission said the $300,000 fine is intended to send a strong message to Powershop and all electricity retailers that solar discrimination will not be tolerated, though it noted Powershop’s timely co-operation and acknowledgement of wrongdoing played a role in keeping the number of penalty notices to 15.
The Commission’s Chair, Symons, added that with the number of solar customers in Victoria now exceeding half a million households, retailers need to support the transition towards renewables, not put obstacles in the way.
“Rooftop solar panels now contribute almost a third of the state’s residential electricity demand and are a vital part of Victoria’s future energy mix,” she said.

In order to reach its 2025 target, Coles today announced it has signed power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with both Engie and Neoen to source electricity from the two companies’ renewables portfolios.
Coles said when added to its onsite solar and preexisting large-scale generation certificate deals, it has sourced more than 70% of the renewable electricity required to meet its 2025 target – that is, once the PPAs with Neoen and Engie commence. Precisely when the deal starts is not yet clear, however.
Specifically, Coles will purchase large-scale generation certificates generated from Engie’s Willogoleche Wind Farm and Canunda Wind Farm in South Australia. 
Coles will also purchase power from Neoen’s renewable power plants in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia – specifically which projects are not mentioned.
“[The PPAs] put us in a great position to be powered by 100% renewable electricity by the end of FY25,” Coles Chief Sustainability, Property and Export Officer Thinus Keeve said in a statement.
Notably, Coles already has an agreement in place with Lal Lal Wind Farms which is under construction in Victoria. It also has a 10-year PPA with Queensland state-owned generator CleanCo to source more than 90% of its Queensland energy requirements from the Western Downs Green Power Hub.
Coles has committed to be net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to reduce combined Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (that is, both direct and indirect emissions) by more than 75% by the end of financial year 2030, from a 2020 baseline.
Coles group includes its supermarkets, Coles Express outlets and alcohol retailers Liquorland, Vintage Cellars and First Choice Liquor in the commitment.
The move means that all three of Australia’s major supermarket chains will be 100% renewably powered by 2025 at the latest, with Aldi already meeting its target.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/22/agl-boss-quits-following-decision-to-split-the-business/,"EMPLOYMENT,QUICK HITS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 22, 2021",AGL boss quits following decision to split the business,"Brett Redman’s departure concludes almost 15 years with the company, where he acted as CEO for the last two years.
In March, AGL Energy announced it would split its business into two entities with separate strategies. ‘New AGL,’ as it is being called, will be forward-facing and green, while ‘PrimeCo’ will continue as Australia’s largest and brownest electricity generator. The split came after mounting pressure about AGL’s poor environmental record and slumping fossil fuel assets. AGL is Australia’s biggest polluter, a title it is naturally trying to distance itself from.
The decision to split sparked controversy, apparently not only among the public but also internally. In a statement released this morning, AGL said: “Redman has advised the Board that he believed he could not make a long-term commitment beyond the proposed structural separation announced on 30 March, 2021. As a result, the Board agreed it was appropriate to put in place alternative leadership arrangements now to facilitate the proposed structural separation.”
Redman’s resignation as a Director is effective immediately, though he will remain available to AGL until the expiry of his notice period on 21 October, 2021.
AGL’s current Chairman, Graeme Hunt, has been appointed Interim Managing Director & CEO effective immediately and will step down as Chairman.
It will now be up to Hunt  to lead AGL’s structural separation.
Non-Executive Director Peter Botten has been appointed as Chairman, also effective immediately.
“At the end date of his notice period, Mr Redman will receive benefits in accordance with the terms of his service agreement and AGL’s relevant incentive plans, under which he will be treated as a “good leaver” as defined in AGL’s executive remuneration framework,” AGL’s statement concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/22/rule-maker-proposes-rewards-for-ultra-fast-services-in-the-electricity-market-for-first-time/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 22, 2021",Big battery market gets a leg up as rule maker proposes rewards for fast grid responses,"Electricity market rule maker, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) is proposing to bring new, ultra-fast frequency services into the national electricity market in a bid to secure the system as the penetration of renewables grows.
The AEMC says the fast frequency services will come largely from batteries – but also from wind and solar PV through their inverter systems. There is also potential for energy users to change their demand for electricity in response to market needs, also known as demand response, it says. These new services will need to respond in two seconds or less – compared with the existing fastest services that operate over timeframes of six seconds. 
The new market ancillary services for fast frequency response (FFR) would be procured through spot market arrangements, which the AEMC says is consistent with the Energy Security Board’s spectrum for how essential system services should be procured.
The need for quick response services is increasing as fossil fuel-based power plants, which have traditionally acted as a buffer against changes in frequency, are being retired. The AEMC says its draft blueprint is a way of rewarding how valuable rapid-fire services are to the market as it looks for industry to grow in this direction.
“These ultra-fast services have never been provided before and this will introduce more flexibility into the fleet as well as spur on market innovation as solar, wind, demand-response and batteries compete to provide these sought-after services,” AEMC Chief Executive, Benn Barr, said in a statement.
“That’s good for consumers because it will keep costs down compared to an alternative of producing more of different types of frequency response which aren’t as granular. This, plus the benefits of competition and innovation will lower costs to consumers.”

The AEMC also said its fast frequency response work released today aligns with the Energy Security Board’s wider program to develop essential system services – a key plank of its post 2025 market design, which is poised to significantly shift Australia’s electricity system design.
“The foundation of a low-carbon future for the energy sector is building new ways to keep the system in balance and stable through the transition,” Barr said.
“System security is the most critical issue in the national electricity market and a key priority area for the Commission. Our draft determination released today paves the way for valuing new types of fast-response services that can keep the system in a secure operating state – balancing electricity supply and demand in real time. Achieving that balance through stable frequency means the system can ride through most power disturbances.”
Electricity frequency variations, which occur when supply and demand don’t match, must stay within a range of around 50 hertz to avoid blackouts. While small imbalances in supply and demand are common and easily accommodated, larger imbalances are harder to control.
As Australia’s energy mix shifts towards renewables, which generate power intermittently, the level of inertia in the system is forecast to decline – meaning more and faster services to control frequency are needed.
“Today’s draft determination is part of a suite of long-term security and reliability measures the Commission is working on as we think ahead to the services that will be needed in a new-look power system and shift the focus away from emergency solutions. It is the first of the new markets that will be put in place to value system services and introduces arrangements to allow the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to procure fast frequency response services to better tailor the speed of response in the power system,” the AEMC’s release this morning read.
The draft determination follows an initial rule change request from Infigen Energy and extensive consultation with stakeholders.
Submissions to the draft are due by 3 June 2021. If approved, the changes will be in place within three years, which allows AEMO time to develop a product specification and make required IT and system changes, it said.
The Commission is also working on a separate rule change request from AEMO to improve incentives for primary frequency control during normal operation, with a draft determination expected by 16 September 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/22/australian-aerospace-firm-to-launch-into-space-race-with-green-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 22, 2021",Australian aerospace firm to launch into space race with green hydrogen,"An aerospace firm based in Queensland (QLD) called Hypersonix Launch Systems (Hypersonix) has announced plans to use locally produced BOC green hydrogen as it looks to shoot the Sunshine State into the space race. 
Hyersonix plans to use the green energy fuel produced via solar electrolysis in its Spartan scramjet engines, rocket engines used to blast small satellites carrying payloads into lower earth orbit (LEO). 
This is certainly not the first hydrogen fuelled rocket, nor is it the only hydrogen fuelled rocket in the news this month, after Aerojet Rocketdyne (Aerojet) completed its final acceptance test for the RS-88A, described by Aerojet as the world’s most powerful hydrogen-fuelled rocket engine. The rocket passed the final test before it can be used on the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle on the B-1 Test Stand at NASA’s Stennis Space Centre in Mississippi. 
Nevertheless, Hypersonix CEO and co-founder David Waterhouse said he was pleased that both Hypersonix and BOC “share a desire to bring the principles of Green Space to the small satellite launch market, and this is something that sets us apart. We are determined to go to space, but in a way that is sustainable for our planet by design.” 
Hypersonix has already secured an Accelerating Commercialisation Grant from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, with which it plans to design and construct a re-usable satellite launch vehicle scramjet engine, a re-useble engine powered by a renewable fuel. 
Waterhouse said that hydrogen is the obvious fuel of choice “because of its proven versatility and performance compared to fossil fuels. Its environmental credentials are hard to beat, with the only emissions being water vapour.”
Fellow co-founder and head of research and development at Hypersonix, the appositely named Michael Smart, added that Hypersonix’s “deep-tech solution will ensure that our precious oceans do not become dumping grounds for single use rockets and boosters, and that our SPARTAN scramjet engines do not add further CO2 or Methane emissions to the atmosphere.”
BOC’s Bulwer Island Renewable Hydrogen Production and Refuelling pilot project has funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) with the aim to develop the foundation of hydrogen mobility in Australia. “Both the automotive and the aviation sectors are well along the path to making the use of hydrogen fuel as a clean fuel option for day-to-day use,” said Chris Dolman, business development manager of clean hydrogen at BOC. “BOC is set to produce green hydrogen for both local and export use.”
The involvement of green hydrogen in the space race is an important progression. As the history of NASA has shown, the necessity of innovation demanded by space exploration births enormous benefits for life on earth. And considering the privatisation of space is already well and truly underway, the sooner green hydrogen can show its true colours against the background of space, the sooner its inherent drive for innovation will trickle down into below orbit aviation and accelerate green hydrogen uptake, and therefore emissions reduction, in that tricky sector.

Scotland-based geo technology company Storegga, Anglo-Dutch energy company Shell, and U.K. listed, independent energy company Harbour Energy have signed a deal to become equal partners in the Acorn project, calling it “one of the largest and most mature U.K. CCS and hydrogen projects.” Storegga will take part through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pale Blue Dot Energy. Apart from the CCS part of the project, which aims to store at least 5 metric tons per year of CO2 by 2030, Acorn wants to use North Sea natural gas and reform it into “blue” hydrogen. The associated CO2 emissions would be stored under the sea at the CO2 storage site. This is an example of the U.K.’s hydrogen strategy.
Australia-based energy company Origin Energy has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Port of Townsville, in Queensland, to collaborate on the potential expansion of the port and the development of new infrastructure, including a liquefaction facility. “Origin is collaborating with Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries on a 300 MW early-export project that would produce 36,500 tons per annum of green, liquid hydrogen using renewable energy and sustainable water,” Origin Energy said in a press release. The three companies expect the first exports, mostly to the Asian markets, to materialise “from the mid-2020s.”
Australia-based mining company Province Resources has signed a memorandum of understanding with French renewable energy developer Total Eren. The two companies could have equal shares in Province’s HyEnergy Zero Carbon Hydrogen project, proposed in northwest Western Australia. Total Eren, 30% owned by France-based multinational energy company Total, has more than 3.3 GW of renewable energy power plants worldwide. The project is to be developed in two stages, totalling up to 8 GW in installed renewable energy capacity. “Given the recent drive by state and federal governments to quickly develop and advance the green hydrogen industry in Australia, I am confident this project will be of strategic national importance,” commented Province managing director David Frances.

Switzerland-headquartered technology company Hitachi ABB Power Grids has signed a letter of intent with Helsinki-based P2X Solutions to electrify a 20 MW hydrogen production plant. The purpose of the €50 million project is to build Finland’s first industrial scale green hydrogen production plant. “Once the first large scale green hydrogen production plant has been demonstrated, P2X’s goal is to promote the Finnish hydrogen economy with more production plants and possibly replicate the projects in Europe as well,” reads a note released last week, adding that the plant is expected to be operational in 2024. Hitachi ABB Power Grids recently signed deals for energy-transition projects in Germany and China.
New Delhi-headquartered Uttam Group of Companies, a manufacturer of ultra-lightweight composite cylinders and systems for compressed natural gas and hydrogen, has closed on the purchase of U.S.-based Catalina Composites. The new entity, based in California, will now be known as Uttam Composites. The company will invest at least $20 million (€16.6 million) in staff, equipment, and research and development of high-pressure cylinder production for hydrogen and compressed natural gas. “Uttam’s advantage is that our cylinders are not only the lightest but [also] the most durable on the market, because of our proprietary manufacturing process,” Uttam chief executive officer Karan Bhatia told pv magazine. The acquisition should allow Uttam to expand to the U.S. and Europe, in addition to increasing its presence in the Asian market.
The Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association (FCHEA), the hydrogen organisation representing more than 50 companies in the United States, has called for the public and private sectors to step up investments in hydrogen. “The growth of the hydrogen industry will also lead to the creation of well-paying engineering, manufacturing, sales and service jobs. That’s why it’s essential we invest in hydrogen now,” Morry Markowitz, president of the FCHEA, commented in a statement released last week. According to the organisation, the U.S. is at risk of losing its competitive edge as other countries have already announced hydrogen investments worth hundreds of billions.
South African integrated energy and chemical company Sasol, and Toyota South Africa Motors, have announced a partnership to “commence exploration of the development of a green hydrogen mobility ecosystem in South Africa,” starting with zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell (FC) heavy-duty, long-haul trucks. Toyota’s subsidiary is developing prototype FC trucks in Japan. “In addition, the parties are evaluating the installation of a hydrogen refuelling station for the demonstration project,” read a press release. Last week, Sasol and French multinational industrial gas provider Air Liquide launched a request for proposal (RFP) process to procure 900 MW of renewables in South Africa.
Aberdeen-based engineering and technical consultancy Vysus Group has secured a contract to deliver technical safety and risk studies for a new hydrogen refilling station in Spain. “Iberdrola plans to build the facility in the Port of Barcelona, Spain, in November 2021. The plant will produce, store and supply [green] hydrogen to heavy vehicles – specifically Barcelona Metropolitan Transport buses. Initially, it will produce 160kg of hydrogen per day, increasing production to 1,200kg per day. The project is currently in the design and purchasing stage,” read a note released last week.
Spanish multinational financial services company BBVA has joined the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, the organisation promoted by the European Commission which gathers industry, national and local public authorities, civil society and other stakeholders together, for a total of 900 participants. In addition to BBVA, other participants from the financial sector include Citi, Deutsche Bank, ING, and Natixis. BBVA “recently announced that it will reduce its exposure to coal-related activities to zero, ceasing to finance companies in these activities before 2030 in developed countries, and before 2040 in the rest of the world,” read a note released on Monday.

An international consortium of solar energy researchers has created a new platform for analysing the performance and reliability of PV systems located in different climate zones. The research project, called PV Camper, is aimed at creating is a cloud database that combines highly accurate meteorological values and photovoltaic performance data from different geographic and climatic areas.
Through the database, all researchers will be able to access daily updated data from a total of 13 testing facilities on almost every continent. They will also be offered a common baseline characterisation and operating and management protocols as well as offers for joint research and development activities. The data may be used, for example, to improve the design and optimisation of photovoltaic systems in certain operating environments for industrial clients.
The PV Camper consortium includes research institutes from the USA, Brazil, South Korea, Great Britain, Morocco, Singapore, Qatar and, in Germany, the Fraunhofer Centre for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP and the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences are participating.
“Linking and exchanging high-quality data is essential to advance photovoltaic research and to open up new markets and applications for solar technologies,” said Ralph Gottschalg, head of Fraunhofer CSP and chairman of PV Camper. “We are creating one of the world’s largest and most useful databases with quality-assured, comparable performance data from photovoltaics and [are enabling] them to be exchanged in a trusting manner.”
Gottschalg expects the project will reach a wide global dimension. “The collaboration will make it possible to transfer research results better to different climate zones and to optimise new types of technologies specifically for use there,” said the Fraunhofer researcher.
