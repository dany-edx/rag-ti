News is breaking of a plan to develop a $1 billion, solar-powered green hydrogen facility in Abu Dhabi which would use the energy storage gas to produce green ammonia.
With specially-formed developer Helios Industry stating on its website it is at a “very advanced stage of developing their commercial scale production facility to produce green hydrogen,” English language Emirati newspaper The National this afternoon sketched out more details about the proposed fab.
Helios describes itself as “a privately-owned special project vehicle company (SPV), established in Abu Dhabi, [in the] United Arab Emirates, to design, develop, finance, construct, own and operate a green hydrogen and green ammonia production facility project at Khalifa Industrial Zone [in] Abu Dhabi.”
While the Abu Dhabi-based company provides few further technical details about the plan, The National, which is owned by United Arab Emirates deputy PM and Manchester City Football Club boss Sheikh Mansour, said the facility would be powered by clean electricity from an 800 MW solar field at the Khalifa Industrial Zone, which is a port.
The newspaper, which also reported the $1 billion investment figure, said the planned project would be able to generate 40,000 tons of green hydrogen which, in turn, would be used to produce 200,000 tons of green ammonia.
No details have yet emerged about when the project can be expected to take shape.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/26/large-scale-solar-pv-slows-as-big-battery-investment-takes-off/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2021",Large-scale solar PV slows as big battery investment takes off,"New figures released by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) show that financial commitments for new utility-scale battery projects in Australia increased four-fold between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, from 150 MW to 600 MW in the first three months of this year.
“Big batteries have come of age, with investors recognising the increasing cost competitiveness as well as the role they play in providing energy security and supporting renewable energy across Australia,” CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said.
“The projects committed in this quarter represent a 300% increase in committed large-scale energy storage capacity compared to Q4 2020 and investment to the tune of $400-450 million.”

The dramatic increase in new investment in utility-scale batteries comes at the same time as financial commitments in large-scale solar PV and wind projects have slowed to the lowest level in the past five years.
The CEC said just one large-scale renewable energy project was financially committed in the first quarter of 2021.
The New England Solar Farm in Uralla, New South Wales was financially committed in the first quarter of 2021, with the 400 MW of new capacity 45% lower than the previous quarter and 30% lower than the 2020 quarterly average.
“This is a deeply concerning trend when, in light of the speed of the clean energy transition worldwide, the brakes are being put on Australia’s promise as a renewable energy superpower,” Thornton said.
“Confidence for new investment in the sector is really in limbo at the moment.
“Projects are experiencing significant and often unanticipated delays through the grid connection process, and as we saw last week with the announcement of a new gas-peaking plant at Kurri Kurri, government intervention in the energy market adds to the uncertainty for investors.”

Early works have already commenced on the first 400 MW stage of the New England Solar Farm with joint venture UPC/AC Renewables Australia (UPC Renewables and AC Energy) confirming lead contractor Elecnor has already begun early works through its subsidiary Green Light Contractors, including substation and road design.
The New England Solar Farm will eventually become a 720 MW solar PV installation combined with a 400 MWh battery energy storage system on site.
The developers are hopeful the first stage of the project will be connected to the National Energy Market (NEM) and producing clean solar energy by July 2022, with a tentative date near the end of 2023 for the entire project to be operational.
The first stage of the project also includes 50 MW/50 MWh of lithium-ion battery storage.
The CEC said the New England battery is one of three large-scale battery projects to reach financial close in the first quarter of 2021.
Neoen has also achieved financial close on the 300 MW / 450 MWh Victoria Big Battery storage facility being developed near Geelong while energy giant AGL has commenced construction on the 250 MW/250 MWh Torrens Island Battery in South Australia.
As well as those projects to have reached financial close, the CEC said at least 15 other large-scale battery storage projects have been announced this year, representing more than 6.6 GW of capacity and $4.3 billion in investment.
The rollout of big battery projects comes after the CEC recently published analysis of the costs of battery technologies as a provider of vital peaking services to the national grid, finding that they are already becoming financially competitive with conventional gas peakers to provide the grid support services.
“Large-scale batteries are now undoubtedly the best option to meet periods of high electricity demand,” Thornton said.
“Batteries can provide a premium peaking service in periods of high demand traditionally met by peaking gas plants. Batteries can ramp up quickly, have near zero start-up time and provide a better frequency response.
“In this respect, the capability of large-scale batteries is unrivalled.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/26/cefc-green-hydrogen-cost-projections-labelled-too-conservative/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2021",CEFC green hydrogen cost projections labelled ‘too conservative’,"The Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s (CEFC) study into the competitiveness of renewable hydrogen across 25 Australian industry sectors found it is nearing cost competitiveness for heavy trucking, buses and remote power, with the potential to become commercially viable across other sectors of transportation as early as 2030.
CEFC hydrogen lead Rupert Maloney, speaking at the Australia Hydrogen Conference in Sydney on Wednesday, said he expects the price of hydrogen produced using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, to be comparable with that of blue hydrogen (fossil-fuel sourced with carbon capture) between 2025 and 2030, but closer to 2030.
Maloney expects the price of green hydrogen to not come into line with that of grey hydrogen (produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas or coal) until 2045 while the study indicates the forecast costs for low-carbon hydrogen will not achieve cost parity with natural gas before 2050.
This led Maloney to the conclusion that the economics of replacing natural gas with hydrogen would be “challenging,” though he also acknowledged the figures and modelling CEFC used were “relatively conservative.”
“We are not a grant-giving entity, we’re investors,” Maloney said of the CEFC’s financial role.
The report says farm gate production cost of green hydrogen is currently forecast at $3.88 per kilogram. That is predicted to drop to $2.81/kg by 2030, still above the forecast production costs for blue hydrogen ($2.80/kg) and grey hydrogen ($2.29/kg). It is predicted the price for green hydrogen will decline to $2.09/kg towards 2050, undercutting blue ($2.80/kg) and grey alternatives ($2.29/kg).
Andrew Horvath, chairman of Australian hydrogen research and development company, Star Scientific, was surprised by the projections, telling pv magazine the CEFC numbers are “too conservative.”
“Technology has a momentum, and their numbers don’t account for that,” he said.
Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who spoke at the conference as well, also had more ambitious forecasts for cost curve reductions of green hydrogen, predicting a steeper drop in price over the next decades.

Turnbull told the audience at the Australia Hydrogen Conference that green hydrogen is the only hydrogen Australia should be focusing on.
The Australian Hydrogen Market Study, prepared by global energy analysts Advisian for the CEFC, examines the competitiveness of renewable hydrogen compared with existing energy technologies in the Australian landscape in particular. The 105-page study cumulates over six months of work, Maloney told the conference.
CEFC chief executive officer Ian Learmonth said large-scale development of green hydrogen will be critical in driving down installation and commissioning costs, similar to the development experienced by Australia’s large-scale renewable energy sector.
“There is enormous excitement around the potential to create green hydrogen to deliver a cleaner and more enduring energy source. As with any new technology, costs will decline over time,” he said.
“The purpose of this analysis is to give industry participants and investors an understanding of the potential economics for the uses of hydrogen in the Australian context, including potential early adopters.
“Our experience in developing the solar and wind sectors shows that prices decline rapidly as a new industry reaches scale and technical proficiency. It is encouraging to see a similar trajectory for the exciting hydrogen sector.”
The study found the key factors effecting the production cost of green hydrogen are the cost of renewable power; electrolyser costs; and intermittency of power supply.

The study anticipates that current electrolyser capital costs of around $1.1 million per MW would decline to around $500,000 per MW by 2050.
Advisian said there could be further upside to these forward cost curves, with several market commentators and manufacturers forecasting a more aggressive reduction in capital costs over a shorter timeframe.
The continued decline in solar and wind generation costs also shapes as a key to lower hydrogen production costs with the cost declines in large-scale solar developments in Australia providing a comparable model.
Advisian said the competitiveness of hydrogen could be further accelerated as a result of other market factors, including the levelised costs of hydrogen being lower than forecast; oil, gas and coal prices being higher than forecast and the willingness of energy users to pay a premium for a clean energy alternative as part of their broad emissions commitments.
The CEFC said that there is also great potential for Australia to play a part in a globally traded hydrogen market.
“There are opportunities for Australia to play a leading role in the developing a hydrogen economy,” Maloney said.
“Our high quality and low-cost renewable resources provide a comparative advantage which will be a key driver in achieving competitive hydrogen production costs.
“We have a proud history and strong reputation for exporting energy to the world, including as one of the world’s largest exporters of LNG. This same skilled workforce can be used to develop and ultimately export new energy vectors such as green hydrogen.”
Australia’s current hydrogen production is about 650 kilo-tonnes per annum (ktpa) and virtually all of this hydrogen is made using natural gas steam methane reforming (NG SMR) and is immediately consumed by the associated ammonia synthesis (~65%) and crude oil refining (~35%) plant.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/26/callide-catastrophe-sparks-calls-for-big-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2021",Callide catastrophe sparks calls for big batteries,"A fire at the Callide C coal-fired power station on Tuesday caused chaos in Queensland’s electricity system with an estimated 477,000 homes and businesses from Cairns in the north to the Gold Coast in the south left without power.
CS Energy, the state government-owned energy company which operates the 1.5 GW Callide Power Station near Biloela in central Queensland, said a fire had occurred in one of the turbine halls at the plant just before 2pm on Tuesday.
CS Energy said the event had immediately forced both units at Callide C offline. That caused such instability that all operating units at Callide B also tripped.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said the “significant power system event” had also tripped multiple transmission lines and forced power stations at Gladstone, Stanwell, Yarwun and Mackay offline, resulting in about 3.1 GW disappearing from the Queensland grid.
A Powerlink spokesperson said the impact occurred within milliseconds of the incident at Callide.
The incident sparked outages across the state, blacking out hospitals, airports, shopping centres, sewage treatment plants, traffic lights, businesses and households. Most of those who lost power were back online within hours.
A spokesperson for New South Wales energy provider Essential Energy said tens of thousands of residents bordering the Gold Coast had also lost power but it was returned by 3.30pm.
In the wake of the incident AEMO issued a “lack of reserve” (LOR) notice at 4.45pm and a forecast LOR3 notice at 5.07pm identifying the potential for electricity demand to exceed supply in Queensland. It later called on households to avoid using heavy appliances to “minimise stress on the system” until at least 9.30pm to mitigate the risk of further brownouts or blackouts. This notice was later cancelled at 7.13pm due to sufficient power supply from generators returning to service around the state.

Queensland Energy minister Mick de Brenni said on Wednesday morning the grid had been stabilised and he was confident there would be no more outages linked to the plant fire.
“We don’t expect to see any blackouts as a result of this incident,” he said.
“The power in Queensland is stable. We worked closely across all agencies and with the national Australian Energy Market Operator to make sure they were able to bring on additional supply.
“We have a diverse and publicly owned generation network in Queensland – everything from nearly 700,000 households with rooftop solar, solar farms, wind farms, pumped hydro and a fleet of coal-fired generators and they’re all operating all full steam this morning.”
Queensland Conservation Council director Dave Copeman said the incident had reinforced the need for more utility scale batteries to be established within the state to shore up grid stability.
Copeman said Queenslanders want reliable cheap, clean electricity and the best way to guarantee it is by investing in renewable energy and storage such as large batteries.
“This illustrates the devastating impact that relying on large, geographically concentrated thermal coal units can have, particularly as they age,” he said.
“The piece of infrastructure transmission operators most needed when this failure occurred was a large-scale battery. It could have been delivering power to support the grid within seconds and may have prevented the wider network failures.”
Batteries have emerged as a critical component of Australia’s energy network with the Energy Security Board’s (ESB) Post 2025 Market Design Directions Paper stating the projected influx of new renewable energy over the next two decades will need to be supported by between 6-19 GW of new flexible and dispatchable resources.

Queensland already has a number of grid-connected batteries operating, including at the Lakeland Solar Farm (1.4 MW/5.3 MWh) in Far North Queensland, and one at the Kennedy Energy Park (2 MW/ 4 MWh) near Hughenden.
Those facilities are set to be bolstered with Singapore-based developer Vena Energy having already commenced construction of a 100 MW/150 MWh grid-scale battery near Wandoan in the Western Downs while AGL Energy plans to build a 100 MW/150 MWh battery next to the 453 MW Cooper’s Gap wind farm near Kingaroy.
French renewables developer Neoen is planning to build 150 MW of battery storage as part of its proposed 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub to be constructed near Chinchilla and has also submitted plans to develop a 100 MW battery project in Queensland’s far north.
The Queensland Government has also announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries, with a combined capacity of 40 MWh in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial.
Copeman said those batteries will be increasingly important as coal-fired power plants are retired.
Commissioned in 2001, the 825 MW Callide C is one of Australia’s newest coal-fired plants but Copeman said it the technology has failed to keep pace with the rapidly transitioning energy network.
Image: CS Energy
“When Callide C was built in 2001, it was talked about as having a 25-year life span. It’s now 20 years old,” he said.
“Queensland coal has been forced to operate more flexibly than it was designed to as solar has entered the market in recent years.
“This potentially makes units more vulnerable to failure.
“Even if this incident was unrelated, it still shows the potential disruption to Queensland’s electricity supply possible in future.”
Rystad Energy senior analyst Dave Dixon said Queensland’s fleet of coal generators only has a very small ramping capacity, compared to Victoria and NSW. It can manage only 500 MW a minute, due to its reliance on coal, compared to more than 2.5 GW in NSW.
Dixon highlighted that batteries can ramp up to 100% of capacity in less than a second.
Investigations into Tuesday’s blaze have already commenced with CS Energy CEO Andrew Bills saying that an initial inspection had revealed unit C4 at Callide C, which is jointly owned by CS Energy and Intergen, had experienced major damage and failure of the turbine.
Bills said it will take some time to fully understand the cause of the failure and what will be required to repair the unit, but warned it could be a year before it is back online.
“It is too early to say with certainty when unit 4 will be operational again, however based on currently available information, we have informed the market operator this morning that the unit will be available in 12 months,” the company said in a statement.
“We are assessing the damage to other three units. This will be our priority today so that we can work out a plan to bring those units back safely.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/26/gladstone-and-toowoomba-newest-additions-to-national-network-of-hydrogen-technology-clusters/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 26, 2021",Gladstone and Toowoomba newest additions to national network of hydrogen technology clusters,"Queensland (QLD) has had its foot firmly on the hydrogen pedal since it became the first Australian state to establish a ministry for hydrogen with Premier Palaszczuk’s re-election in November 2020. On the back of partnerships with toward green hydrogen production, such as that with Japanese engineering company IHI Corporation, QLD is backing the evolving potential of Gladstone as a green hydrogen export hub by establishing both Gladstone and Toowoomba as hydrogen technology clusters. 
In February, National Energy Resources Australia (NERA), an industry-led not-for-profit organisation set up in 2015 as part of the federal government’s Industry Growth Centre initiative, actioned its instructions from the 2019 National Hydrogen Strategy. This saw the investment of an initial $1.75 million in 13 regional clusters across all states and territories designed to establish Australia’s global identity in hydrogen technology and expertise.
According to a statement from NERA: “Technology Clusters are geographic concentrations of interconnected businesses and organisations in a particular field, that both collaborate and compete to increase productivity and innovation.”
The Hydrogen Technology Cluster Australia (H2TCA) network’s newest clusters, Gladstone and Toowoomba, have received a $100,000 commitment from the QLD government, further evidence if evidence were needed that the Sunshine State is not going to let its sunshine go to waste. 
After all, according to a 2019 Deloitte report, Australia’s potential hydrogen sector could create thousands of jobs and increase national GDP by up to $26 billion. Goldman Sachs has called green hydrogen a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” and estimated that green hydrogen alone (not including grey and blue) “could give rise to a €10 trillion addressable market globally by 2050 for the utilities industry alone.”
The newest clusters will join the already established H2Q cluster in Brisbane on the forefront of QLD’s hydrogen industry strategy to nurture innovation and develop skills and technologies necessary for the establishment of a major export industry. 
The $100,000 injection will be evenly split between the Gladstone Engineering Alliance (GEA) and the Toowoomba and Surat Basin Enterprise (TBSE). 
QLD Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni said these additional clusters “will drive the development of Queensland’s hydrogen supply chain in a way that delivers jobs for regional Queenslanders in areas like components and materials manufacturing for this new technology.” 
De Brenni emphasised that the conversation in QLD has “very much shifted from ‘if’ to ‘when’ commercially viable domestic and export-scale renewable hydrogen becomes a reality here in Queensland. If we can position Queensland as the hydrogen technology leader, innovator and exporter of this resource,” de Brenni continued, “we will well and truly cement our position as a renewable energy superpower. 
The Gladstone and Toowoomba clusters, which will be officially announced at the Australian Hydrogen Conference today, are another step in the direction of Australia’s renewable hydrogen future. NERA CEO Miranda Taylor said the new clusters “will be able to work together with the existing H2Q cluster in Brisbane, as well as other regional clusters in H2TCA, to ensure long-term local cohesion and sustainable capability across the emerging hydrogen value chain. Australia wants to be exporting more than just molecules.”
According to NERA the two clusters will focus on supply chain activation, research, technology development, education, skills and capability, community social licensing, green hydrogen and global opportunities. 
Of course, Gladstone is already the locus of interest for international developers such as London-based Eco Energy World, who is planning a $500 million project to combine its ready to build 300 MW solar plant north of Gladstone, Queensland, with a 200 MW hydrogen plant and 100 MW of battery energy storage. Not to mention the Sumitomo Corporation, who has signed a signed a contract with an EPC for a solar-powered green hydrogen production plant in Gladstone.

From the roof terrace of the reception building, there’s a good view of the Phase 4a factory on the right-hand side. “It is the latest one”, says  Kevin He, who works in investor relations at silicon producer Daqo New Energy. On the left hand of the video shows is what is supposed to become Daqo’s Phase 4b factory. The former facility consists to a large extent of pipes, tubes, vessels and whatever one imagines heavy industry to be. At the new factory site, only cranes can be seen. The Phase 4b fab is still just a construction site and is expected to be fully ramped up by the end of the year, explains Kevin He. Last week, the company invited analysts for a tour of the site and released a 90-minute video of the visit.
The video is instructive for anyone who wants to learn about modern silicon production and does not have the opportunity to visit such a factory themselves. The elephant in the room, however, is not mentioned by Kevin He or anyone else in the video: the allegations that forced labor is used in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Indeed, the Financial Times described the tour as a “charm offensive.”
screenshot, Daqo video
Daqo CEO Longgen Zhang, however, did comment on the matter in a press release on the visit: “As stated repeatedly, we do not condone the use of forced labor under any circumstances.”
In the video, the camera, accompanied by soft background music, moves through empty stairwells into a control room equipped with an impressive wall of screens. The group enters a bus that drives across the site and then walks into factory floor with the furnaces. Green floor, white walls, lots of pipes and technology – employees are notable in their absence.
“Our visitors were able to see that our chemical process, which is highly automated, digitalised, technology-intensive, is not conducive to employing unskilled labor,” Longgen Zhang explains in the press release.
Obviously, it is not possible to prove that forced labor does not exist with a company tour and therefore it is no surprise that the discussion continues on various sides.
A few days after the factory visit, the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom published a report containing what is probably the most detailed collection of links to official documents related to many of the well-known solar-grade silicon and polysilicon manufacturers based in Xinjiang.
The report’s authors claim that the information proves the clear links between the solar companies located in Xinjiang and forced labor programs. The researchers’ main argument is that the regional government has attracted many polysilicon manufacturers by granting a series of fiscal and economic incentives since 2015. Manufacturers that invest in the region have little opportunity to avoid the local government programs known as “surplus labor” and “labor transfer” involving the Uyghur and Kazakh indigenous minorities, the report claims. These programs, it adds, include forced labor practices.
“After 2016, by which time the camp system had begun to emerge, companies that ‘absorbed surplus labourers’ to work in their facilities received significant incentives, including subsidies for the cost of building new factories, transport of the products made there to the coast, training for the new labor recruits (including Chinese language training), transport of new workers, and salaries of workers,” the researchers say. They speak of a pervasive impact of Xinjiang labor transfers on the entire solar supply chain.
Concerning Daqo, however, the Sheffield publication only concludes from the IPO prospectus that it “may indicate that the company employs state-sponsored labor transfers in its own facilities, as “placement” is a term the central government and Xinjiang regional and local governments sometimes use for labor transfers.” Also this is, obviously, no smoking gun.
The allegations of forced labor in the Chinese solar industry became a major issue in the Netherlands when Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Sigrid Kaad discussed the matter on May 18, answering questions submitted in Parliament in April by members of the centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the Labour Party (PvdA) and the green GroenLinks party.
Kaad cited a report by US-based Horizon Advisory, often used as a source to support the allegations, but said the government thus far did not have sufficient evidence to verify the validity of the information provided by the study.
The minister did not exclude the possibility that subsidies could have been given to solar projects relying on PV panels whose production could have stemmed from a supply chain that may have involved Uyghur forced labor. Kaad stated that the current requirements of the Netherlands’ subsidy programs for solar and renewable energy did not require companies to investigate or certify the entire supply chain of a product.
“I will also raise the issue during the Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) of 20 May 2021,” Kaad said, adding that she had also discussed the matter with French Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness Franck Riestener and European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders.
In Germany the law is clearly evolving in the direction of making companies more accountable for their supply chain. A week earlier, the scientific service of the German Bundestag, which is supposed to provide MPs with independent information, had already published a 128-page paper on the legal implications of the situation in Xingjiang for German companies. Although it finds “no explicit indications of a physical-biological intention to destroy,” it does see “an intention of social destruction” with respect to the Uyghur population.
This is particularly explosive in Germany in view of the fact that the Bundestag is about to vote on a supply chain law under which companies could face fines if they violate their “human rights due diligence obligations”. If they cannot counter “human rights risks within their supply chain” in any other way, they may have to end business relations with particular suppliers. Even criminal liability of company employees cannot be ruled out, the paper states.
In this respect, the end of the discussion is likely to be a long way off and the impact on the photovoltaic supply chain very difficult to assess at present. Just the existence of risk that human rights are being violated is relevant to companies when administering their supply chain, even if there is no evidence of human rights violations by an individual supplier.
It is therefore no surprise, as the Financial Times reports, that Daqo executives plan to request an independent third-party audit.

Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic is building a pilot hydrogen plant combined with photovoltaics and storage at its fuel cell factory in Kusatsu, Shiga Prefecture, in central Japan.
The plant is described as an “in-house” system relying on hydrogen fuel cell generators with a combined capacity of 500 kW, a 570 kW solar array, and lithium-ion batteries with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 1.1 MWh. “The power generated with this system supplies the entire power used in manufacturing departments of the fuel cell factory located within the Kusatsu site,” the company said in a statement.

The system is expected to begin operations in the spring of 2022 and to be based on 100 Panasonic’s pure hydrogen fuel cell generators with a power output of 5 kW and a rated power generation efficiency of 56%. Each generator measures 834×417×1,766 mm and weighs 205 kg.
The PV system will occupy an area of 4,000 m2 and the fuel cell generators 6,000 m2.
“Through this demonstration, Panasonic will accumulate know-how and establish a track record in energy management, including the operation of pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, and aim to commercialise the RE100 solution, which uses power generated in-house from renewable sources to supply 100% of the electricity required for business activities,” the company said in a statement.
