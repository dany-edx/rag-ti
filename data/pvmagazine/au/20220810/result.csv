The technology is owned by Canadian-based company Jericho Energy Ventures via its subsidiary Hydrogen Technologies. It works by burning hydrogen and oxygen in a vacuum chamber to create high-temperature water and steam.
As part of the deal, Line Hydrogen plans to provide Jericho and its customers with a priority supply of green hydrogen, look to enter into offtake agreements for the Bell Bay green hydrogen project the company is currently developing.
Line Hydrogen said it will also investigate opportunities to manufacture the DCCTM Boiler, as it’s called, either in Tasmania or elsewhere in Australia.
The first DCCTM Boiler is expected to be commissioned in Tasmania in 2023 to match Line Hydrogen’s green hydrogen production.
While the installation may mark the first deployment of Jericho’s technology in Australia, using hydrogen to decarbonise industrial heating has long been in the work for New South Wales technology company Star Scientific.
Its approach is markedly different from Jericho’s, however, in that it does not combust hydrogen but rather deploys a catalyst reaction to generate temperatures over 700 degrees celsius.
Star Scientific’s Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser, or HERO, technology will soon be used in an 18-month pilot with Mars Food Australia to generate heat for industrial-scale sanitation in food manufacturing.

The connection marks the launch of one of two systems in Australia’s first ‘solar hydro’ power plant which has promised to deliver some of the country’s deepest and lowest cost storage.
Global supply chain challenges, RayGen said, have pushed out the expected timeline for the accompanying 3 MW / 50 MWh electro-storage system, but the company is confident it will be fully operational and delivering up to 17 hours of storage to the National Electricity Market (NEM) by the first quarter of 2023.
Once operational, the company expects to be able to provide the Commonwealth’s Low Emissions Technology stretch goal of firmed renewables for under $100 / MWh. The project will be delivering that storage to Victoria’s West Murray region, which is notoriously congested causing numerous renewables projects in the region to be curtailed.

Based in Melbourne, RayGen’s proprietary PV Ultra solar towers and electro-thermal energy storage technologies have received backing from major players in the last years, including becoming a focus for Dutch renewables company Photon Energy Group. 
It has also been backed by Australia’s largest electricity “gentailer” AGL Energy, Norwegian oil company Equinor, Schlumberger New Energy and Chevron Technology Ventures. 
How the technology works is by focusing sunlight with a field of aligned mirrors, or heliostats, onto a tower-mounted receiver containing an array of PV Ultra modules made of gallium arsenide PV cells. Around one third of incident sunlight is directly converted into electricity by the PV cells, while the remaining two thirds is captured in the form of heated water, used to actively cool the modules during operation.
The heat extracted from the PV Ultra modules is then stored in two insulated water reservoirs with a 90°C temperature difference. The ability to co-generate electricity and heat, the latter a captured by-product, makes the facility highly efficient.

In total, each PV Ultra receiver contains approximately 400 PV Ultra modules, each generating 2.5 kW of electricity and 5 kW of heat. This produces 1 MW of electricity and 2M W of heat per field setup.
The initial timeline for the Carwarp project to be fully commissioned was mid-2022, but the cold water pumping system was held up in Shanghai due to Covid-19 lockdowns.
For the time being, the project will be delivering solar electricity into the NEM with the company saying it expects the last remaining storage components to be delivered in the next fortnight.
Once complete, the storage system will also participate in wholesale energy and Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets once operational.
Australian Renewable Energy Agency
Both Carwarp and RayGen’s 1 MW pilot project in Newbridge, Victoria, have been partially funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which allocated $15 million to Carwarp.
The project is wholly owned by RayGen and has an operational design life of 30 years.
Working with Photon Energy, RayGen’s technology is also planned for deployment in a major project in South Australia. The proposed SA project would have a total solar generation capacity of 300 MW with a grid connection capacity of 150 MW. The target energy storage capacity is 3.6 GWh, equivalent to 24 hours of full load, to the grid, from storage.
Photon, which entered a strategic partnership with RayGen in 2020 and in 2021 made a $3 million equity investment in in the company, said it has already secured 1,200 hectares of land for the project but as of late last year had not revealed the specific location.

AGL Energy has previously said it it will assess whether RayGen’s technology could be installed at its Liddell facility, a major coal-fired plant in New South Wales scheduled to be fully decommissioned by April.
Just yesterday, AGL and Fortescue Future Industries upped their vision for Liddell, revealing they are looking to install up to 2 GW of capacity there to support the planned hydrogen hub.

The 100% acquisition, Genex says, is part of its strategy to grow its portfolio of storage assets – which already includes the Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project being developed in the mid-north of Queensland as well as the 50 MW / 100 MWh Bouldercombe Battery, it the state’s mid coast.
This particular focus has been expedited by Australia’s recent market conditions. “The events in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in recent months have only highlighted the urgent need for dispatchable energy storage capacity to manage the transition to a net-zero economy,” Genex said in its ASX statement about the acquisition.

The company is targeting a final investment decision (FID) on the Bulli Creek project by the second half of 2024. 
The development rights for Bulli Creek extend to 2 GW of capacity, with Genex noting the project’s planning, environmental and heritage approvals have already been secured by previous developer Solar Choice.
Of its five stage approach to development, the first stage includes the battery with stage two involving the roll out of between 475 MW to 675 MW of solar PV.
The subsequent stages, it added, would involve additional solar deployments until the entire 5,000 hectare site in used.
Genex purchased the project from Solar Choice, which had been developing Bulli Creek since 2013. The project piqued its interest, the company said, because of its premium location just four kilometres from Queensland network Powerlink’s Bulli Creek 330kV substation, a connection point for the Queensland to New South Wales interconnector. The network strength and projected marginal loss factors also played a role.
Genex is already in “advanced discussions” with potential joint development partners, it said, “which will including providing a significant contribution to the external development costs and equity funding of the capital expenditures.”
The company says its ongoing development of the Bouldercombe Battery has enabled this network, which has already seen Genex link with Tesla.
The project acquisition follows an eventful few weeks for the company, which was subject to an unsolicited takeover bid of more than $300 million from a consortium of private equity firms led by Australian technology billionaire Scott Farquhar’s Skip Capital.
Genex confirmed that Skip Capital, through its Skip Essential Infrastructure Fund, has already built up a 19.99% stake in the renewable energy company after a series of transactions completed in July.
The takeover offer came just hours before Genex revealed it had achieved record revenue last financial year totalling more than $26 million.

Genex has Australian portfolio of “more than $1 billion of renewable energy generation and storage projects.” Among those assets is the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Farm in New South Wales, as well as the 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm – consistently one of Australia’s best performing solar farms.
Kidston is, of course, linked to Genex’s Kidston Clean Energy Hub – which has the 250 MW / 2,000 MWh pumped hydro facility as its centrepiece. Genex is proposing up to 270 MW of additional solar and up to 150 MW of wind generation for the site.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/10/australias-energy-prices-set-to-remain-high-until-2026/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 10, 2022",Australia’s energy prices set to remain high until 2026,"According to new research from Cornwall Insight Australia’s (CIA) price forecast model, the Benchmark Power Curve (BPC), the annual median energy price for states in the National Electricity Market (NEM) will be around $200/MWh until 2026. 
CIA’s modelling and analytics manager, Saliw Cleto, described the last few months in the Australian energy market as “very interesting” and expects to see energy bills rise to “unprecedented levels.”
“Our modelling forecasts that there will be little respite over the next three years,” said Cleto, “with most states, especially New South Wales, left with average median prices above 2021 levels.”
The BPC, which looks at power prices up until 2042, forecasts that after FY2025, prices will return to the 2021 levels of ~$40-80/MWh nationwide. Until then, however, the surging prices are set to continue as a result of the global energy crisis. New South Wales is expected to be hit hardest with a median price forecast at ~218/MWh over the next three years.

“The general rise in energy costs post-pandemic was already pushing up prices, however, the move away from Russian gas across the EU has sent shockwaves through the global energy market,” continued Cleto. “As energy supplies tighten, costs will inevitably rise – something which we estimate to change over the next three years significantly.” 
Beyond 2026 
CIA’s predictions beyond 2026 foresee median prices flattening across the country, and that is because in the medium term the continued increase in renewables should help stabilise prices. 
However, longer-term prices are set to become less stable with this increase in renewables filling in the gaps left by retiring coal plants.

“As well as global pressure,” says Cleto, “Australia is going through a huge energy transition where more volatility in the market is expected. Coal plants are still, by far, the biggest supplier of energy in the country; however, a combination of aging plants and expected early closure means access to coal energy will decline, and the pace at which renewable energy gets commissioned and enabled (by transmission and distribution network upgrades) will be more important than ever.” 
“The government, generators and suppliers must all work together to ensure a stable energy market is delivered as we move away from coal and towards a more sustainable future,” concluded Cleto.

A range of different additives and extra layers could change the way a solar cell surface interacts with light, and thus improve its performance. Among these is light scattering, where sunlight hits tiny particles embedded into the cell, and is reflected around the device rather than straight back out of it.
A group of US scientists led by Penn State University have demonstrated a 1% efficiency increase in perovskite solar cells by adding a nanoscale light trapping structure to the front of the cell. The achievement is also notable they started out investigation a completely different route to solar cell optimisation, and ultimately discovered most of the gains thought to come from this are actually attributable to an accompanying light scattering effect.
“Some researchers in the literature have hypothesised and showed results that up-conversion nanoparticles provide a boost in performance,” said Shashank Priya, professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. “But this research shows that it doesn’t matter if you put in up-conversion nanoparticles or any other nanoparticles – they will show the boosted efficiency because of the enhance light scattering.”
Up-conversion is a process where a material added to a cell converts infrared radiation into visible light, which can be absorbed by the solar cell. This has long been pursued as a possible to way to reach efficiencies beyond what is thought to be theoretically possible in a single junction device. In this case, scientists at Macquarie University in Australia provided another crystalline material that does not exhibit the up-conversion effect, allowing the Penn State researchers to compare results.
They described their work in “Homogenisation of Optical Field in Nanocrystal-Embedded Perovskite Composites,” which was published in ACS Energy Letters. The results showed that the materials were equally effective in improving the perovskite solar cell’s conversion efficiency. And with further calculations, the researchers were able to prove that the efficiency boost primarily came from light scattering, with up-conversion only having a negligible effect.
“We started to basically play around with nanoparticle distribution in the model, and we started to see that as you distribute the particles far away from each other, you start to see some enhanced scattering,” said Thomas Brown, associate professor at the University of Rome. “Then we had this breakthrough.”
The group says it will now investigate the optimisation of the size, shape and distribution of particles in nanostructures to optimise performance even further.
