“Here’s an opportunity,” he tells pv magazine Australia. “It’s about recasting regulatory framework so it’s fit for purpose.”
“The world is watching us,” he adds. “We actually get to be leaders.”
“It’s not just one tweak. Everything needs to move together in concert to create the new orchestra or architecture for the future energy market because this one is not going to work, and it’s not working.”
Our current regulatory framework, built for a centralised fossil fuel system, uses a top down approach. Now, as electricity is increasingly generated on rooftops and in paddocks, the system needs to reflect this shift from a handful of mega generators to a collection of small technologies. That is, it needs to be designed for the bottom up future.
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH THE ELECTRICITY – IN THE SIMPLEST LANGUAGE POSSIBLE?
(A thread 🧵)
Today AEMO suspended the National Electricity Market (NEM). This sounds scary. and is in fact a huge deal, but we aren't about to be cast back to the stone age. pic.twitter.com/gxAc2z4vAA

In the days days, the operator (AEMO) and ministers have come out against gas and coal generators’ role in exacerbating the situation, and therefore jeopardising an essential service, Dufty is quick to point out the companies are simply following a logic made accessible to them.  “They’re doing what they’ve been told to do for a hundred years”: maximise profits.
“Maybe the villain is the framework,” he posits.
Under Australia’s current framework, he says, the cost of the crisis will eventually wash up with consumers, but this doesn’t have to be the case. “Where it falls depends on how governments intervene,” he says. “In unusual times, you probably need unusual transition methods.”
He believes the electricity system is moving from a goods market to service market, which means companies operating within it should have a duty of care. This is especially true since the market delivers an essential service.
Moreover, Dufty says there needs to be a laser focus on consumer households and delivering value to them.
“Follow the money,” he says, “in the next 10 years, if you have five million Australian households investing in electricity assets like PV, EVs [electric vehicles], batteries and the like, that’s $250 billion worth of energy assets installed behind the metre.”
“The investment in energy is going to happen and those consumers will want value for their investment.”
The role of industry and the framework which governs it is to make sure that value is realised.

St Vincent de Paul were one of the primary proponents of two-way pricing, which quickly came to be dubbed a ‘sun tax’ and fiercely criticised. Be that as it may, the vision is not without merit – especially when taking into account future technologies beyond solar. The Australian Energy Market Commission agreed, heralding in the change last year.
The changes, for Dufty, are imperative because they shine a light on the other side of the electricity grid balancing equation, the side often left out of the discussion: load flexibility.
Creating and compelling load flexibility, that is changing when electricity is used, is the other side of the generation drama. As others have pointed out before him, jamming more solar into the situation simply won’t work. The penetrations are already so high that much of the energy generated in the day is simply going to waste and causing greater imbalances in the night.
“There isn’t one magical solution,” he says, “diversity is the key here.”
Dufty is adamant what’s good for individual households and what is good for society and the larger electricity network don’t need to compete. But to ensure those two forces aren’t mutually exclusive, the regulatory framework needs to change drastically.
“This is not incremental change. We might have step by step,” he says, but in the end it must amount to a full redesign, especially in terms of consumer protections.
Likewise complementary frameworks like the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) need to be reviewed to ensure they remain fit for purpose as well, Dufty says.

“In fact, the transition is even more important now,” Bowen said on Thursday. “Navigating out of the current energy crisis and ensuring we don’t find ourselves here again in a decade means we have to shift the focus to planning a smooth transition.”
His comments come after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) on Wednesday suspended the electricity wholesale spot market in the entire National Electricity Market (NEM) until further notice. It is the first full suspension of the market since its inception in 1998.
The intervention, prompted by soaring power prices and energy supply challenges means AEMO is now in charge of directing supplies from energy providers to the grid. The operator will also set energy prices for every jurisdiction in the market.
AEMO said it had taken the historic step “because it has become impossible to continue operating the spot market while ensuring a secure and reliable supply of electricity for consumers”.
While some commentators have suggested the only solution to the current crisis is to keep coal-fired generators going, Bowen rejected the claims, saying the situation had been caused in no small part by an under-investment in renewables and storage.
“The problem is there is not enough investment in renewable energy. There hasn’t been enough investment in storage,” he said.
“Yes, you can say the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. The rain doesn’t always fall either, but we can store the water and we can store renewable energy if we have the investment. That investment has been lacking for the last decade. That is the problem.”
The situation remained critical on Thursday with AEMO issuing a level three lack of reserve notice for New South Wales (NSW). The operator also warned Queensland and Victoria should expect shortfalls in the system later today but pressure on the grid is expected to ease from Friday and through the weekend as more power units come back online.

AEMO said the suspension of the market is temporary and will be reviewed daily with Bowen saying it will be lifted when the operator is confident the market will operate properly.
“It will continue for not a day more or less than is necessary,” he said.
“I’ve been very clear with the chief executive of the operator. He has my full support for any action he deems necessary. The government will back the operator and the regulators 100%.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the energy crisis could prompt a reworking of the NEM rules, including the incentives for generators to pump electricity into the system.
“There are weaknesses, clearly, that have been exposed, and all of the lessons of what is happening will be examined,” he said. “If there need to be any policy adjustments, then they’ll be made.”
Meanwhile, Albanese has formally committed to the United Nations (UN) that Australia will cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, up from the 26% to 28% target set by the previous government.
Albanese said on Thursday he had written to UN Framework Convention on Climate Change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa Cantellano to inform her of Australia’s new 2030 target.

Albanese said legislation to enshrine the new target in law would be introduced to the new Parliament, which will sit for the first time on July 26.
Clean Energy Council (CEC) chief executive Kane Thornton welcomed the new emissions reduction target, saying it gives the green light to renewable energy investors.
Thornton said the CEC’s latest Clean Energy Outlook – Confidence Index revealed that 79% of investors had indicated an improved 2030 emissions reduction target would increase their confidence for future investment.
“Today’s formal agreement provides clarity and a positive investment signal to accelerate the decarbonisation of Australia and take advantage of the enormous economic opportunity in play,” he said.
“The current crisis in the National Energy Market has clearly illustrated the perils of dragging our feet on energy policy.
“Our aging coal-fired power fleet and transmission network is not fit for purpose and are now failing Australian businesses and households.
“A 21st-century economy needs a modern electricity network that supports reliability, security and lower emissions technologies, and delivers low-cost energy to consumers. Today gets us closer to that goal.”

Tasmanian Energy Minister Guy Barnett said the government was calling on developers of renewable electricity generation projects, including green hydrogen and offshore developments, of 10 MW or greater, or existing and new industries or businesses which require electrical loads of 1 MW or greater, to register their interest to join the state’s electricity network.
Barnett said the ROI will seek key project information to support the coordination of generation with transmission and storage investment and details provided through the process will help build a comprehensive profile of the project development pipeline for renewables in Tasmania.
“This information will be used to inform the build out and implementation of Tasmania’s first Renewable Energy Zone later this year and support the matching of new generation and load growth to achieve our renewable energy future,” he said.
Barnett said the information provided by industry will guide decisions about the optimal location and size of the state’s first REZ with details to be announced later this year.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has in its Integrated System Plan identified four potential locations for renewable energy zones in Tasmania, including in the state’s north west, north east, central highlands and an offshore zone off the north west coast.
Barnett said the ROI is a key action of Tasmania’s Renewable Energy Coordination Framework and will assist with investigations into support mechanisms that may be needed to achieve the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Target of 200% by 2040.
“The Framework prioritises the actions necessary to coordinate the large-scale development and investment required to grow our renewable energy sector sustainably over the next 20 years,” he said.
“We are also taking action to progress major energy projects such as Marinus Link and Battery of the Nation that will help further grow the supply of clean, reliable and affordable energy.”
Barnett said Marinus Link has now completed its tender pre-qualification process for the design, manufacture, and installation of its high voltage direct current cables and converter stations with a final investment decision expected in December 2024.
The call for registrations of interest will close on 12 July 2022.

The Aurora project, first floated by United States developer SolarReserve more than five years ago, has already secured state government approval for the development of a 70 MW solar PV array and 150 MW concentrated solar thermal plant coupled with up to 140 MW/280 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), as well as connection to the adjacent 275 kV transmission line.
Under the terms of the joint venture, Vast Solar will contribute 50% of all development costs associated with the development of the first phase of the Aurora project.
The focus for Stage 1 will be on the establishment of a connection agreement and initial development of a 140 MW battery with up to two hours of storage, with the final investment decision for procurement and construction targeted for early 2023.
In addition to co-developing the BESS, the agreement provides for further development of Aurora in future stages, including allowing for 14D to independently progress a pilot of its Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS), and access rights within the precinct for Vast Solar to independently progress a CSP project in the area.
Vast Solar chief executive officer Craig Wood said the agreement is the next step in the company’s plans to build a 20MW CSP plant near Port Augusta.
The Sydney-based company last month announced it had secured up to $110 million in concessional finance from the federal government to develop the CSP facility which would produce dispatchable renewable electricity “available on demand for eight hours or more”.

Wood said he expects the technology to play a key role in Australia’s transition to a renewables-dominated future with rapid investment in renewable dispatchable energy is an urgent priority and is the only sustainable solution to Australia’s energy crisis in the medium term.
“As per recent comments from the federal energy minister and AEMO, dispatchable renewable energy capacity is what is required to curb the high prices currently being experienced in Australian energy markets,” he said.
“We are excited to be working with the federal government and ARENA (Australian Renewable Energy Agency) to finalise funding for the project, and with state and local governments and other partners to expedite the Aurora project.”
Vast Solar, which is also developing a 50MW hybrid solar thermal project at Mount Isa in Queensland, said the South Australian project will feature the same modular tower CSP technology that the company has deployed at Jemalong in New South Wales (NSW). The 1 MW pilot plant, which was constructed adjacent to a 50MW solar PV project, has been delivering electricity to the grid since early 2018.
Unlike traditional CSP technology which uses molten salt both as a heat transfer and for storage, Vast Solar has developed technology that uses sodium for heat transfer and molten salt for on-demand storage, both of which create steam to drive a turbine. The technology allows plants to be configured with 4-16 hours of storage and generators of up to 500 MW.
14D chair Tony Sacre welcomed Vast Solar’s involvement with the Aurora project, saying the companies share a vision for the development as a long-term renewable energy project in Port Augusta.
“Vast Solar is a highly complementary Australian partner for 1414 Degrees and we welcome their addition as joint owners of Silicon Aurora,” he said. “We are now in an excellent position to continue with the development of the Aurora project.”

Speaking at the Austrian World Summit on climate change, Guterres called for the financing of fossil fuel exploration or production to be abandoned wholesale, in favour of the clean energy alternative.
“I call on all financial actors to abandon fossil fuel finance and invest in renewable energy,” he said. “The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a liveable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels, especially coal, and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition.”
The energy crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine has seen a perilous doubling down on fossil fuels by the major economies.
New funding for fossil fuels is delusional.
It will only further feed the scourge of war, pollution & climate catastrophe. https://t.co/ppM3pOaqna
— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) June 14, 2022

Guterres’ comments come with Australia in the grips of an energy crisis. On Wednesday, The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) took the drastic step of suspending the electricity wholesale spot market in the entire National Electricity Market (NEM) for the first time since the market’s inception in 1998.
The historic move came after skyrocketing power prices and energy supply challenges had prompted AEMO to set an energy price cap, limiting the price of wholesale electricity to $300 a megawatt per hour. The operator had then directed energy generators to increase supply to ease shortages, amid claims some did not want to run plants under the price threshold.
The surge in wholesale power and gas prices have been attributed to a “perfect storm” of international and domestic factors. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to a global gas shortage, while extreme weather events in New South Wales and South-East Queensland have also contributed, as have scheduled and unscheduled outages at several of Australia’s ageing coal plants, with at least 25% offline.

Australia’s energy consumption is dominated by fossil fuels, with figures published by AEMO indicating coal accounts for 23GW of capacity in the 60GW NEM, which covers all of Australia except for the Northern Territory and Western Australia. As a share of total generation in FY22, black and brown coal generators supplied more than 60% of total generation in the NEM.
Newly installed Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has set a target of renewables providing power for about 82% of Australia’s electricity needs by 2030 but he has yet to commit to phasing out coal use or to block the opening of new coal mines or scrap existing fossil fuel projects. Data published by independent research coalition Climate Action Tracker last month showed 114 new coal and gas projects in Australia’s investment pipeline.
Guterres this week warned of the negative impact of new investments in coal, oil and gas on climate change, arguing “our energy mix is broken”.
“The energy crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine has seen a perilous doubling down on fossil fuels by the major economies,” he said.
The paradox, he said, is that cheaper, fairer and more reliable energy options should have been developer sooner, and faster, including wind and solar.
“Had we invested massively in renewable energy in the past, we would not be so dramatically at the mercy of the instability of fossil fuel markets,” he said.

Guterres said the cost of solar energy and batteries have declined by 85% over the past decade, while wind power has become 55% cheaper.
“On the other hand, oil and gas have reached record price levels. And investment in renewables creates three times more jobs than fossil fuels,” he said.
Guterres outlined a strategy for global action on renewable energy, including a tripling in investments in renewables and a shift in energy subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
He also called for improved global access to supply chains for renewable energy technologies components and raw materials, the removal of intellectual property barriers limiting the sharing of technology, and the removal of “red tape that is holding back the renewable production revolution”.

Rōpū Matatau, a consortium led by engineering consultancy Mott MacDonald New Zealand, plans to build a pumped-hydro storage facility on Lake Onslow, New Zealand.
The group of companies, which also includes engineering consultancy GHD and environmental planning and design consultancy Boffa Miskell, recently secured a contract to investigate the engineering, environmental planning, and geotechnical feasibility of the project.
During the project’s first phase, the consortium will evaluate the feasibility of different pumped hydro configurations at the lake and other possible locations around the country. It will also consider different pumped hydro systems as a technical solution to resolve New Zealand’s “dry year problem.” In addition, it will investigate the nearby availability of materials for dam construction, the geology of the possible dam wall area, tunnelling costs, early geotechnical details, and environmental and cultural impacts.
“The Lake Onslow option referenced by the Interim Climate Change Committee could be anticipated to provide at least 5 TWh of annual generation/storage,” the government said. “It is estimated to have a construction timeframe of four to five years, with commissioning and filling taking a further two years”
In the second phase, Rōpū Matatau will perform geotechnical and engineering field work, analyse local geology, and determine the exact location of the project.
“Te Rōpū Matatau has been granted resource consents and other permits to undertake geotechnical, geological and hydrogeological investigations, which will inform the Lake Onslow feasibility study,” the government said.
Preliminary work began at the first site in April and is expected to continue at various times throughout the year at a number of sites near Lake Onslow. The feasibility study will likely be concluded by the end of the year.
According to New Zealand’s University of Canterbury, the pumped hydro storage facility could have a head of 650 meters and a “very large” storage capacity. It would also require an atypical scheme design, due to the 20 km distance from the Clutha River.

An international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 60 of “Solar cell efficiency tables” in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The scientists said they have added 15  new results to the new version of the tables since January. They also noted that an appendix describes new approaches and terminology.
Since 1993, when the tables were first published, the research group has seen major improvements in all cell categories.
“Copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) and multijunction cells have seen the most consistent gains, although perovskites have recently seen similar overall gains compressed into a shorter timescale,” Green told pv magazine in an interview last year.
He said that the most important factor for inclusion in the tables is that all results should be independently measured at test centres on the group’s list.
“All of our recognised test centres are carefully vetted prior to inclusion on our list and have been involved in round-robin testing with one another, ensuring consistency of measurements to well within the uncertainty estimates included with the published results,” said Green.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
