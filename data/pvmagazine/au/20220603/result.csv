Future electricity prices are also increasing to previously unimaginable levels. The market is pricing electricity contracts for next financial year at $238 per megawatt hour – around 180% higher than what it traded at the beginning of this year.
The Labor government yesterday ruled out triggering an emergency mechanism to restrict gas exports, a mechanism many say would help ease household prices. In any case, we propose three additional ways it can start to ease the pressure on prices.

The Australian Energy Regulator recently approved household electricity price rises of up to 20%. The regulator noted prices are increasing due to a jump in wholesale prices (which we predicted back in March).
Wholesale prices are the price of generating electricity and have historically represented around 35% of the final bill for households. There are three key drivers of wholesale prices:
Contrary to much of the existing commentary, it is a combination of the second and third drivers that has resulted in prices increasing to unprecedented levels.

First, let’s look at input costs. The price of coal and gas has surged as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Due to formal sanctions and informal shunning of Russian exports, thermal coal prices have increased five-fold to an unprecedented $A500 per tonne. This has increased the cost of energy from coal-fired generation to over $150 per megawatt hour.
Gas prices have also increased substantially as a consequence of sanctions against Russia. Prices jumped from $6-12 per gigajoule in the first three months of 2022, to around $50 per gigajoule at the end of May.
They’ve been so high that governments and regulators have intervened and capped prices at $40 per gigajoule. This means electricity generation from gas has increased in cost to around $300 per megawatt hour.
But the second – and less spoken about – impact is the significant reduction in supply of generation during April, May and now June.
Many coal power stations were partially or totally taken offline in April. We saw a step change in pricing overnight on April 1, when prices changed from around $100 per megawatt hour in March to around $200 per megawatt hour in April.
Whether offline for maintenance or to maximise generator profits, it’s not clear why so many coal generation units have not been available to generate.
The chart below (sourced from Australian Energy Market Operator operational data) shows the total black coal generation offered at various prices in April and May is materially lower than the previous 18 months (and, in particular, relative to the previous April and May).

The fact so many coal units have been unavailable has led to a significant increase in gas-fired generation to fill the gaps, despite it being so expensive to run.
As such, the generator setting the price in the wholesale electricity market during April, May and now June was almost always a gas-fired plant, resulting in prices rising to such unprecedented levels.
1. An inquiry into why so many coal plants weren’t available
At the very least it would seem prudent to task the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with an inquiry into why so much coal generated power has been unavailable during April, May and June.
If it is for maintenance purposes, it will be important to learn how better to schedule this to ensure similar outcomes don’t occur in the future.
An inquiry will also be able to determine if a coal plant has been unavailable due to market power driving prices higher. To be clear, the problem is not with removing coal over time – just that in this case, the shortage of capacity was unexpected.

2. Turbocharge renewable energy efforts
The new government should accelerate investment in new electricity supply by increasing the legislated renewable energy target, which has delivered 20% renewable energy, but can be increased substantially to reduce our exposure to high fuel costs.
This should also involve amalgamating emerging state-based initiatives, such as the New South Wales government’s 12GW energy roadmap, making it easier for investors to coordinate across different states.
An updated national target could also create room for emerging projects, such as offshore wind, to accelerate their development.
A stronger renewable energy target will increase electricity supply, and place downward pressure on prices.
3. Implement a capacity reserve
The new government should work with the Energy Security Board to implement a reserve mechanism for new “dispatchable” capacity – such as batteries, pumped hydro, hydrogen-ready turbines – to drive investment and ensure they’re in place before coal is phased out.
This is much more efficient than recent proposals for a capacity mechanism suggested by coal-fired power station owners to pay existing coal generators for their capacity. It’s clear from the current situation that Australia’s ageing coal plants cannot be relied upon.
We all need to remember electricity is an essential service. Acting quickly is crucial to avoid households falling into hardship, and businesses closing their doors.

An expert on the energy crisis engulfing Australia,"Meanwhile, Origin Energy this week confirmed it could not source enough black coal to power Australia’s largest coal plant at full capacity, deepening shocks to the energy market.
The electricity price surge is so dire, small energy retailers such as ReAmped Energy are advising customers to switch energy providers or be hit with much higher bills.
So what on Earth is going on? It has a lot to do with Russia’s war on Ukraine, which has disrupted the global energy market. Sanctions on Russian coal and gas exports mean there’s simply not enough supply to meet demand. As a consequence, the global price of gas and coal has soared.
Australia is a net exporter of gas and coal. This means we export most of our fossil fuels overseas. As the global price of coal increases, the cost of generating domestic electricity from coal is increasing.
What’s more, many of Australia’s coal generators are ageing, which means they fail more often. At present, nearly 30% of our coal generation is offline.
The price spike comes as coal plant owners look for the exit. Australia’s largest coal plant, Eraring, has been operating for 35 years. In February, Origin announced it would shut Eraring seven years ahead of schedule in 2025 because renewable energy was impacting profitability.
Origin’s new challenge is securing enough coal to run Eraring at its full 2.8 gigawatt capacity. The problem is set to persist into 2023.
This is not only due to a difficult global environment, but also domestic delivery difficulties due to supply chain disruptions.

In an attempt to meet rising electricity demand, some energy generators have increased gas-powered generation. However, given Australia exports so much of its domestic gas resources, any additional gas for domestic consumption must be acquired from the rising international market.
To make matters worse, this week’s cold snap along the east coast led to a spike in demand for electricity as people heated their homes.
 
So what’s the overall effect? To give you an idea, a few months ago gas was trading at approximately A$10 a gigajoule. This week, wholesale prices in Victoria reached up to $800 a gigajoule – more than 80 times normal levels.
This gargantuan spike caused the Australian Energy Market Operator to step in, temporarily capping prices at $40 a gigajoule until June 10.
These extraordinary prices will likely continue once the Australian Energy Market Operator’s cap is removed.
The Australian Energy Regulator has warned wholesale power prices are likely to remain high for at least two years. This will hit energy retailers and consumers hard.
However, those likely to experience the most pain are small energy retailers on the east coast because of the so-called “default market offer”.
Established in 2019, the default market offer serves as a price safety net for residential and small business customers by setting a price cap on how much energy retailers can charge households and businesses.
When advertising or promoting offer pricing, retailers must show the price of their offer in comparison to the default market offer price.
The default market offer for 2022 was released last week.
Alarmingly, it shows that from July 1, default offers will rise by 14% in New South Wales, 11% in Queensland and 7% in South Australia. In Victoria, the Essential Services Commission determines the default offer, and set the cap at 5%.
So, while consumers will pay a bit more under the increased price cap, energy retailers will pay a lot more in a dramatically rising wholesale electricity market.
Large retailers such as AGL may cope, but smaller players will be hit hard and may not be able to survive given these price hikes are on top of rises in 2021.
This is what led ReAmped Energy, a small energy retailer with 70,000 customers, to advise customers to look elsewhere.
The state of the energy market reflects a deepening global resource crisis. However, in Australia, the writing has been on the wall for a long time.
Australia exports 85% of its gas. Between 2000 and 2015, Australia’s gas exports tripled. Between 2015 and 2019 they tripled again.
As more Australian gas is exported overseas, the domestic electricity price has risen. Exporting most of our gas means we often do not have enough for domestic consumption and purchasing it on the international spot market is costly.
The price of electricity rose a whopping 130% between 2015 – when liquefied natural gas exports began at Gladstone in Queensland – and 2019.
Despite these increases, robust export controls have not been implemented. Unlike Western Australia where liquefied natural gas producers must reserve 15% for the domestic market, the east coast has no reservation policy.
Adding to this is the failure to support a swift integration of renewables into the national grid through stronger, focused regulatory mechanisms and improved policy has not occurred.
All this has created, as new federal climate and energy minister Chris Bowen put it, a “perfect storm”.
Speaking this week, Bowen blamed the previous government’s stalling on renewables and changing energy policies, saying: “Their ad hoc-ery, their changes of policy approaches, have left Australia ill-prepared and our energy markets ill-prepared for the challenges we are facing today in relation to gas and energy supply”.
One response could be for the government to trigger an emergency domestic gas pricing mechanism and declare this to be a shortfall year, a 2017 mechanism which hasn’t yet been used.
If 2022 is deemed to be a shortfall year, export restrictions would be imposed upon liquefied natural gas producers to protect domestic supply. This could help pricing, because gas reservations can change the supply balance and allow domestic prices to adjust.
It may also assist with supply, given the recent cold snap resulting in the Australian Energy Market Operator to issue a separate warning of gas supply shortfalls in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.
However, Bowen this week ruled out using the emergency mechanism to deal with the energy price hikes. He said it wasn’t designed to limit prices, and wouldn’t have any impact until January next year.
We are only in the early days of June, and more colder-than-normal weather is forecast for coming winter months. Whether it uses the domestic gas pricing mechanism or not, the federal government must take steps to address rising energy prices and make the coming winter easier for Australians to bear.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/03/sa-scraps-renewables-schemes-despite-declaring-climate-emergency/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 3, 2022",SA scraps renewables schemes despite declaring ‘climate emergency’,"South Australian Treasurer Stephen Mulligan on Thursday delivered his first state budget, making good on millions of dollars of commitments to the hydrogen industry while cutting funding to a series of other renewable energy initiatives, including the $100 million Home Battery Scheme.
The $100 million Home Battery Scheme was launched in 2018 with a goal of supporting the installation of 40,000 solar energy storage systems across South Australia. When first rolled out, the initiative offered a $6,000 subsidy that was later wound back to $2,000.
South Australia (SA) Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said the take-up had been less than half the expected 40,000 and was one of the reasons why the program had been cut.
“They (the former government) thought that by diminishing the subsidy it would increase the uptake of batteries,” he said. “It just didn’t work.”
The $4.25 million Switch for Solar program and the $12.25 million Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Subsidy, both initiatives of former South Australian government, were also scrapped in Labor’s first budget since its election win in March.

The Switch for Solar program was designed to allow eligible concession holders to exchange 10 years of their energy and cost-of-living concessions for a solar system installed with no up-front cost. At the end of the 10 years, participants would again receive their concessions and keep the system.
The program commenced in May 2021 with a trial involving 1,000 participants. With the trial proving a success, the program was expanded in February this year to 5,000 low-income households but Koutsantonis described the program as “a scam”.
“Quite frankly, the most appalling policy of the former government was to take pensioners and take their concessions off them,” he said. “Taking concessions off elderly people is wrong. You shouldn’t do it.”
The Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Subsidy, which was to provide up to 7,500 subsidies of up to $2,000 each to households installing eligible EV smart charging systems, has also been cut.
The scrapping of the programs comes after the state government’s climate emergency motion passed both houses of state parliament on Tuesday night, which Climate Minister Susan Close said reaffirmed the urgent need to decarbonise the state’s economy and shift to renewable sources of energy.
Close said 10 years of inaction and climate culture wars at the state and federal levels had left Australia exposed to the effects of climate change, as well as stymying investment in the renewable energy sector.
The most recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report confirmed that some parts of Australia had already recorded increased average temperatures of 1.4C since 1910, she said.
“We really need to focus on supporting projects and policies which are climate-friendly and encourage growth in resilient low-carbon businesses,” Close said. “It’s time to act and that starts with acknowledging the seriousness of the climate crisis.”

Close pointed to hydrogen as a key component of the state government’s energy strategy and that was backed by the treasurer who in the budget made good on Labor’s election commitment to build a hydrogen production facility in Whyalla, through its Hydrogen jobs plan. It is expected to be complete by December 2025.
“As the nation experiences surging wholesale electricity prices, driven largely by soaring coal prices and the failure of national energy policy over the last decade, South Australia remains at the forefront of energy transition,” Mullighan said in his budget speech.
“The budget provides $593 million to construct a 250MW hydrogen electrolyser facility, a 200MW hydrogen power station and a 3,600-tonne hydrogen storage facility in the Whyalla region.”
On Tuesday, Premier Peter Malinauskas announced the opening of market sounding for the delivery of the Whyalla project. Submissions close on July 15.
The budget also includes $30 million to support the development of a Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hub at Port Bonython, as part of a $140 million partnership with the federal government and private industry. There is also $8.3 million over four years for the implementation of the Department of Energy and Mining’s hydrogen plan.

The completion of the capital raise follows the revelation that 5B had made dozens of employees redundant two weeks ago.
5B co-founder and chief executive officer Chris McGrath said about 50 staff , mainly from the company’s operational side of the business had been offered redundancies.
McGrath blamed challenges on multiple fronts for the staff cuts, including supply chain and logistics disruptions brought on by the pandemic, as well as the soaring cost of materials.
5B said the capital raise will help it to overcome the headwinds, allowing it unlock the full potential of its re-deployable, modular, prefabricated Maverick solar technology, a solar array in which modules come preassembled onto concrete blocks that replace conventional mounting structures.
A single Maverick is a ground-mounted solar array block of up to 90 PV modules, which can be made with any standard framed 60 or 72-cell PV module. With modules oriented in a concertina shape at a 10-degree tilt and electrically configured, each Maverick weighs about three tonnes. When deployed, one block is 5.5 meters wide and 16.7 meters long (40 modules).
The Maverick features “plug-and-play” wiring designed for faster, easier and safer on-site deployment ideally suited for mining, commercial and industrial, and large-scale solar power generation.
The Sydney-based 5B said it has more than 50MW of its Maverick solution deployed across more than 100 sites and five continents, along with an order book of more than 100MW.
Only last month it set a new speed record for solar deployment with 1.1MW deployed in a single day by a crew of 10 people at AES’ Andes Solar II B solar farm in Chile’s Atacama Desert. the installation was carried out by 5B’s Latin American deployment partner SolarMovil which installed 22 Maverick arrays in a single day as part of a larger deployment of 219 Mavericks with a total generation capacity of more than 10MW.
“It has been an incredible couple of years for us, in spite of the state of the world, we have successfully launched our Maverick solution into the United States, Latin America, Europe and India, while building a global supply chain and deployment ecosystem to support this,” McGrath said.

McGrath said 5B is now looking to build upon that foundation, turning to automation and advanced manufacturing across its technology platform. This is expected to drive a further step change in speed and capacity increase, as well as cost reduction, and see 5B break through its first gigawatt of sales.
“Our next generation deployment vehicle for Maverick is going to take our current solar deployment record, and 10x it again,” he said. “This will completely remove the speed of deployment as a constraint in solar projects. The challenge will then become other parts of the project development, supply chain, and build cycle.”
The capital raise comes just months after 5B announced a $33.4 million tech innovation program to accelerate the delivery of what the Federal government as called “ultra low cost solar”. The program is supported by a $14 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
The funding, which comes less than a year after 5B closed a $12 million funding round, includes a heavy portion devoted to the realisation of solar installation robots.
And in December 2021, 5B acquired an Adelaide manufacturing plant ahead of the global gigawatt-scale push of its Maverick solar arrays.

Energy minister Chris Bowen said on Thursday energy markets were facing a “geopolitical situation around the world” and the federal government would do “whatever it takes” to ensure energy markets are reliable and affordable.
“Action is necessary and action is being taken,” he said.
Gas prices in Australia have rocketed from $10 a gigajoule a few months ago to as high as $800 a gigajoule this week. Prices are already high due to the war in Ukraine while outages at some coal-fired power stations have furthered the strain on gas prices domestically. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), more than 30% of the coal power capacity in the National Electricity Market (NEM) was estimated to be offline last month.
“Australian energy markets are facing a perfect storm,” Bowen said.
“There are a number of factors at play in relation to the very serious and challenging situation with electricity supply and gas supply in particular.
“The former government promised a gas-fired recovery and left us a gas bonfire.”
Bowen said he had spoken to state and territory energy ministers on Thursday and intended to convene a meeting of the ministers early next week in order to be advised by AEMO and the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) on the current supply situation and further actions.

“The Albanese Labor government will take whatever action is necessary to ensure ongoing reliability and affordability for the energy markets … based on expert advice,” he said. “The situation is serious but it is being managed by our regulators professionally.”
AEMO on Wednesday triggered the Gas Supply Guarantee Mechanism for the first time since it was introduced in 2017 in order to secure gas for power generators and stem off a potential shortfall in southern states. The mechanism calls for the market to release supply and come up with a plan to address a potential shortfall.
The AER has also announced increases to the benchmark power price, with the default market offers rising between 8.5% and 18.3% in New South Wales, up to 12.6% in south-east Queensland and 9.5% in South Australia. The changes are due to come into effect from 1 July.
There have also been calls for the government to initiate the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM), known as the gas trigger, to divert exports and shore up domestic supply.
Bowen said he would not rule in or rule out using the gas trigger but pointed out a myriad of problems with the mechanism.
“It cannot come into force until 1 January, even if it were pulled today. It is not a short-term answer,” he said.
The surging gas prices have seen wholesale electricity prices soar, increasing 141% in the 12 months to the end of March, causing havoc in the retail electricity market.
Electricity provider ReAmped, which has about 70,000 customers across NSW, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, this week sent a letter to customers telling them it is in their best interests to switch to another retailer as soon as possible to get a cheaper price.
“The wholesale energy market has just become so extreme that we’re now seeing a situation where wholesale prices are above retail prices,” ReAmped chief executive Luke Blincoe said. “So, unless you’re a generator, there is simply not a sustainable position in the retail marketplace.
“We‘re saying to our customers ‘the best way we can save you money is actually ask you to switch away’. And now is the opportune time to do that while there are still some deals available.”
Blincoe said customers are facing a doubling of prices from July.
“It‘s too far to say it’s in crisis right now, but there’s reason to be very concerned,” he said. “I think we are on the precipice now and if these wholesale prices hold for much longer, I think there‘s reason to be very concerned.”

India’s cumulative rooftop solar capacity reached 7.6 GW by March 31, with 456 MW added in the first quarter, according to a new report by Mercom India.
Rooftop solar installations rose 34% year on year in the January-March period. They accounted for 15% of 3 GW of quarterly solar installations.
The commercial and industrial segment once again accounted for most of the rooftop solar installations in the first quarter. The industrial segment contributed 47% of total quarterly additions.
About 71% of rooftop solar installations were under the capex model. The operating expenditure/renewable energy service company model contributed 29%, said Mercom.
“States have been empaneling vendors and commissioning the allocated capacities under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s Phase II Rooftop Solar Program, driving capex installations,” said the report.
Gujarat leads other states in cumulative solar rooftop installations, with about 1.8 GW installed on March 31. Maharashtra and Rajasthan rank second and third, said Mercom.
Overall project margins have fallen with the rise in component prices, the imposition of basic customs duty (BCD) on module and cell imports, and the hike in the goods and service tax. In the first quarter of 2022, the average cost of a rooftop solar system increased by 6% on a quarterly basis from the final three months of 2021. Year over year, rooftop solar system costs increased by 17%.
“It was another great quarter for the rooftop solar market as post-covid installations continued to surge. Rooftop installations have topped 400 MW for four quarters in a row, which is a first,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group. “However, future growth is dependent on system costs. If the prices continue to go up and project economics deteriorate, demand is bound to contract in the short term.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/03/downsizing-gallium-nitride-inverters/,"INVERTERS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 3, 2022",Downsizing gallium nitride inverters,"From pv magazine Global
String inverters based on gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors could represent a valid alternative to devices based on silicon (Si) or silicon carbide (SiC) in the future if the industry manages to reduce their size. A consortium led by Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology IEE is now coordinating a research project to assess how components of GaN inverters can be further miniaturised, in order to achieve lower production costs.
“The aim behind the usage of GaN for power electronic inverters is not primarily focused on efficiency improvements,” Sebastian Sprunck, group leader for components and measuring systems at Fraunhofer IEE, told pv magazine. “Si and SiC-based converters, already reach or exceed 98 % efficiency in certain applications and improving on those values may be possible from a technology point-of-view, but is rarely economically feasible.”
He said the primary goal when using GaN in power electronics is usually the optimisation and miniaturisation of the entire inverter device, including passive components such as cooling systems, casings, and mounting structures.
“When components are miniaturised through this approach, we can potentially harness benefits such as lower material consumption and costs, as well as lighter products, which would reduce costs and efforts required for packaging, delivery and installation,” Sprunck said. “We’re amongst the first research projects to apply GaN to high-power solar inverters, therefore we can only extrapolate possibilities which we need to validate over the course of our project.”
The achievable size reduction is dependent on several parameters and is subject to ongoing study.
“In general, we’re hoping on similar reduction factors that were demonstrated with SiC in comparison to Si technology, only now comparing GaN with SiC. However, it is not possible to directly compare such factors across differing power and/or voltage classes,” Sprunck explained. “Some preliminary results for the power inductors of the GaN-HighPower project are already available and we are now evaluating them.”
The consortium is now developing its first GaN inverter prototype. It aims to test it in late 2022 or early 2023, with a more integrated demonstrator planned for late 2023. The project aims at converter powers above 100 kVA.
Sprunck noted that GaN is already under investigation in several lower-power applications.
“High power applications such as industrial PV projects of over 100 kW are not typical for GaN, at least not in the short term and it’s currently a challenge to apply these devices to such high power converters, which is one of the reasons we’re conducting this project in the first place,” he said. 
The use of gallium nitride in inverters could also allow for higher switching frequencies and smaller passive components such as power inductors or capacitors, which are often the largest, heaviest components in power converters.
“If they can be miniaturised, then often the inverter case can be as well,” Sprunck said. “Other projects utilising GaN power semiconductors in lower-power applications have shown that these effects can lead to lower manufacturing costs. One of the tasks of this project is to investigate if these effects can also be harnessed for high-power applications.”
Infineon Technologies, SMA Solar Technology, and Vacuumschmelze (VAC) also participated in the research project. In addition, the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences is preparing the integration of new components into a technology demonstrator, while TH Köln University of Applied Sciences is helping with the design and optimisation of power electronic inductors.
