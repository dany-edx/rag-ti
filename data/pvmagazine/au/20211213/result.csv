The trial is supported by a $9.7 million funding commitment made in this year’s federal budget.
Unlike the Smart Energy Council’s hydrogen certification scheme, the government-backed scheme does not focus solely on certifying green hydrogen but rather will measure and track emissions from a range of hydrogen production methods and technologies, issuing certifications based on that source data.
“The GO scheme will allow consumers to choose products based on the hydrogen’s carbon emission intensity. GO certificates will follow the hydrogen supply chain, providing transparent information to consumers on the carbon intensity of products they purchase,” Clean Energy Regulator Chair, David Parker, said.
The scheme will include projects producing hydrogen from renewable electricity, biomethane, and coal and gas with carbon capture and storage.
What the scheme does offer, importantly, is high level government-backed legitimacy as well as a centralised database which will prevent fragmented verification methods which could lead to confusion.
The Regulator said it will now start working with hydrogen players which are either operating hydrogen pilot projects or have well-advanced plans, using these to test the practical application of the scheme’s design as well as its carbon emission methodologies over an 18-month period.
pv magazine Australia has previously been told the scheme will work something like a ticket, which can be distributed by third parties but are validated on a single shared registry. Using such a model, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) would issue a set of numerically identifiable certificates which could then be traced and marked within a single registry. This system would prevent double counting as well as the need to cross check contracts, and would allow for automised reporting.
Such a scheme, pv magazine has been told, would also leave room for third party involvement, similar to the way GreenPower leverages off the Regulator’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) registries.
The hope is that such a model would prevent the fragmentation of having several different verification schemes run by different bodies, which could confuse international buyers. Given that the regulator already oversees Australia’s clean energy schemes, including our extensive small and large-scale solar certificates, the body seems an obvious choice to issue hydrogen certificates also.
Parker, the Regulator’s chair, said it is working with other countries through the International Partnership on Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) to design an assurance system trusted by international trading partners and domestic supply chains.
Parker added that trial participants will “help develop emission accounting approaches” suited to their production techniques, though did not elaborate on the important point of carbon accounting, aside from noting the trials would see the Regulator collect and verify data to calculate the gross and net carbon intensity of hydrogen and related products. 
“The GO trials will play a significant role in determining international standards for measuring carbon emissions from hydrogen production and establish Australia as a global player in the emerging hydrogen industry for years to come,” Parker said.
“We expect the GO scheme to evolve to guarantee the origin of a range of low emission products, so these trials are an important step in reducing Australia and our trading partner’s emissions,” he added. Parker appears to be referring here to industries like steel and aluminium which are expected to replace coal in their processes with hydrogen in future.
The trials, according to the Regulator, will go on to inform the federal government’s policy design and legislation to support the industry’s development.
A government-backed hydrogen Guarantee of Origin scheme was listed as a priority under the National Hydrogen Strategy. “Industry feedback indicated that a local scheme must be internationally aligned and accepted by our trading partners. This will enable customers who buy Australian hydrogen in the future to make an informed choice and easily identify the product best suited to their needs,” Federal Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, said.
With Australia on track to become one of the globe’s hydrogen leaders, there is concern fossil fuel companies will find refuge in the burgeoning industry given there are both clean and “dirty” ways to produce hydrogen. Australia’s federal government, and some state governments, have backed fossil hydrogen projects, many of which are greenwashed to appear as cleaner than they are.
While the Regulator’s scheme will include both fossil and renewable projects, it could make transparent the emissions associated with each project, hopefully alleviating greenwashing which has already emerged as a problem in the industry.
The federal government estimates Australia’s hydrogen production for export and domestic use could also generate more than $50 billion in additional GDP by 2050.

The national broadband network, better knowns simply as the NBN, services 8.3 million households and businesses across Australia, with NBN Co the team charged with rolling out high(ish) speed internet network and the providing those services wholesale to retailers.
“NBN Co is the first Australian telecommunication company and the first government business enterprise to join RE100,” Jon Dee, Australia Coordinator at RE100, said.
On its journey to 100% renewables, NBN Co has entered into a 80 GWh per annum renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) which is forecast to deliver around 19% of its power demand in the financial year of 2023. It plans to reach its 100% target, it said, through a mix of both PPAs and contracts for renewables.
The government business is also targeting a 25 GWh annual energy use reduction by December 2025, having brought in initiatives to reduce emissions in 2020, 90% of which are reportedly either completed or near to completion. 
NBN Co
The shifts is part of NBN Co’s Towards-Zero Carbon Ambition released today in its second Sustainability Report. The ambition includes the uptake of electric or hybrid vehicles by 2030, with NBN noting the technology will be sought out “where suitably available”.
The ambition also builds on NBN Co’s solar rollout, which has seen panels installed at many of the corporation’s facilities across the country.
NBN Co joins 110 other major companies in Australia to have joined RE100, pledging to source 100% of their electricity from renewables.
“Between them, the Australian members of RE100 use over 5.5 terawatt hours of electricity per year,” Dee said. “That’s enough electricity to power 800,000 Australian homes. Having that electricity transitioning to 100% renewable energy will help in the creation of a cleaner, greener Australia.”

The opening was attended by Western Australian Minister for Energy, Bill Johnston, who described the facility as “impressive”, and considering it is over five times the size of the previous facility in Kewdale, Johnston is probably not guilty of overstating it.
HSA says that its new facility is not just world-class but world-leading, describing it as the largest facility in the world that is focused on the design and construction of sophisticated SPS.
The expansive facility provides more than enough space for the company’s 130 staff (up by 30 since last year), a figure that should also expand through the support of apprenticeship programs, opportunities, and training in the renewables sector.

HSA executive director, Mike Hall, said the new facility is a natural result of the company’s rapid growth since 2015, “and the investment in this world-class facility is recognition of the growing demand of clean energy sources and solutions.”
“We are incredibly proud to be well positioned and have the scale to meet the increasing demand of SPS and larger grid connected Battery Energy Storage (BESS).”
Minister Johnston pointed out that Hybrid Systems is already a valued contractor for the WA government, “having provided more than 100 SPS to Western Power. They are playing an important role in WA’s rapidly-growing renewable energy future and helping the McGowan Government achieve its goal to rollout 1,000 SPS by 2025.”

The new facility will allow for this significant capacity expansion as Hybrid Systems looks to provide Western Power with SPS systems for customers in regional and remote locations.
The entirety of HSA’s SPS design, manufacturing, assembly, installation, commissioning, operating and maintenance, including the solar panels, battery storage and backup generator, is handled in-house.

Targets and mandates to reach 100% renewable electricity over the coming decades are being introduced in regions the world over, as well as incentives and requirements promoting electrification in various segments such as heating and transport.
But in many regions there is still reluctance to move away from fossil fuels and fears that the intermittent nature of wind and solar generation is likely to cause problems to regional energy supplies. In the United States, for example, blackouts caused by extreme weather in California and Texas over the past two years are still sometimes blamed on renewables, despite the analysis showing renewables were not more vulnerable than fossil-fuel infrastructure in either case.
A new study from Mark Jacobson and colleagues at Stanford University seeks to analyse grid stability across the United States based on 2050-2051 energy demand forecasts and a 100% renewable energy-powered grid. Jacobson has worked for more than a decade on modelling energy systems driven by renewables, and is a strong advocate of policies that support 100% wind, water and solar generation for all energy needs, not only in the electricity sector.
The latest study looks at meeting continuous energy demand at 30-second intervals over a two-year period, simulating six different US states with very different climate and energy profiles – Alaska, Hawaii, California, Texas, New York and Florida – as well the currently interconnected regions of the country, and the contiguous United States as a whole.
Full details of the study are found in the paper Zero air pollution and zero carbon from all energy at low cost and without blackouts in variable weather throughout the U.S. with 100% wind-water-solar and storage, published in Renewable Energy. The group modelled scenarios involving the massive scale up of offshore and onshore wind, rooftop and ground mount PV and concentrated solar power, as well some new geothermal plants, but only already existing hydroelectric generation.
The study suggests that such a system would avoid blackouts or grid instabilities thanks to a number of reasons – partly that the system would reduce energy demand by up to 60%, partly that, as previous studies have shown, wind and solar tend to complement each other in terms of availability at different times – both daily and seasonally. And finally, additional roles for energy storage and demand response fill the gaps when there is little availability of wind or solar.
In addition to stability, the study found the same system would result in a 63% reduction in energy costs across the United States, and a reduction in required land use from 1.3% of U.S. land currently occupied by fossil fuel operations to 0.84% needed for electricity infrastructure in a 100% renewables scenario.
The cost for implementing such a transition is estimated at between US$9 trillion and US$11 trillion (AU$12.5 trillion – $15 trillion), depending on the level of interconnection between regions. The study’s authors estimate that based on the energy cost savings alone, this investment could be paid back in as little as five years. It also estimates that this energy transition would create close to 5 million more permanent jobs than it would lose, and the cleaner air and fewer pollution-related illnesses would prevent more than 50,000 deaths per year and save around US$700 billion (AU$980 billion) annually in health costs.
While the study mentions seasonal heat storage to meet demand in colder climates, it finds that no long-term electricity storage would be needed to keep the U.S. grid running. They note the strategy of connecting short-duration batteries in succession can provide longer-term storage, and can be discharged simultaneously to deal with strong demand peaks. “In other words, short-duration batteries can be used for both big peaks in demand for short periods and lower peaks for a long period or anything in-between,” said Jacobson.
“There is so much to be gained if we can gather the willpower to undertake the transition at a pace fitting the urgency of reaching a zero-carbon system,” added co-author Anna-Katharina von Krauland, a PhD student in civil and environmental engineering at Stanford. “I suspect that these ideas, which might sound radical now, will soon become obvious in hindsight.”

The number of materials with the potential for use in each of the many layers in a solar cell is enormous. And even once they have chosen one to work with, scientists need to understand its interactions with the other materials present, and the effects of changing parameters such as layer thickness, dopant concentration and a wealth of others in order to get the best out of the cells they are working on.
With so many possibilities, this can be a time-consuming process. And scientists today are increasingly able to turn to artificial intelligence to guide them in the next steps to take in practical lab work. And developing a system to do just that for solar cell design was the focus of a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who worked with experts at Google Brain to develop a system to evaluate the potential of different solar cell designs, and also predict which changes would provide improved performance characteristics. “We developed a tool that will enable others to discover more quickly other higher performance devices,” explained MIT researcher Giuseppe Romano. “Our tool can identify a unique set of material parameters that has been hidden so far because it’s very complex to run those simulations.”
The model is described in the paper ∂PV: An end-to-end differentiable solar-cell simulator, published in Computer Physics Communications. With data on a solar cell configuration, it outputs a predicted efficiency, and shows which of the input parameters affects the prediction the most. It can evaluate multiple variables for each layer including doping concentration, dielectric constant and bandgap. And its researchers point to layer thickness as a particularly important variable. “…the thickness is critical,” said MIT scientist Sean Mann. “There is a strong interplay between light propagation and the thickness of each layer and the absorption of each layer.”
MIT is making the model available as an open-source tool that can be taken up by researchers and industry. According to the institute, it is ready to be combined with other algorithms and machine learning processes to quickly assess many possible changes to device design and pull out those with the most potential.
And since it is based on open-source code, future users will be able to optimise it further for more complex cell architecture, such as tandem and multijunction devices. The current version, “can cover the majority of cells that are currently under production, and there are ways to approximate a tandem solar cell by simulating each of the individual cells,” said Romano. “But once it’s up there, the community can contribute to it, and that’s why we are really excited.”
