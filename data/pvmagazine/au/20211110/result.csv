It found comprehensive adoption of existing rooftop PV technology alone could radically transform Melbourne’s carbon footprint, with further gains from the widespread deployment of emerging ‘solar windows’ and photovoltaic technology integrated in building facades.
Precisely, the modelling found photovoltaics could provide 74% of Melbourne’s building consumption needs. Rooftop solar would constitute 88% of this supply, with wall-integrated and window-integrated solar delivering 8% and 4% respectively. 
The potential contribution of window-integrated solar rose to 18% at the neighbourhood scale, reflecting high building heights and window to wall ratios.

While not yet widely used, solar windows are being developed by a number of companies, including Western Australian based ClearVue – which claims to be the only company with a completely clear and industry-sized window on the market today. ClearVue has actually been working with researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science to crack the 5% efficiency mark on its windows, and is tantalisingly close thanks to the centre’s pioneering nanoparticle research.
While Australia leads the world in rooftop solar, with over 810 watts installed per person, the National Survey of PV Power Applications in Australia report released last week found Australia added “very little building-integrated PV (BIPV)” in 2020.
In terms of the Melbourne study, the research team looked at the 37.4 km2 area of central Melbourne, of which 35.1km2 was residential and commercial buildings as of 2019. The researchers say they determined the annual solar radiation on Melbourne’s building surfaces to identify suitable areas for PV installation, taking into account technical limitations and cost factors. Detailed modelling enabled the incident solar radiation and PV potential of the urban areas to be simulated, with a large range of factors taken into consideration, including the impact of shadows casted by shading systems and balconies, as well as the performance characteristics of the various solar technologies. 

In terms of how Melbourne’s landscape fits with its electricity consumption, data was obtained from Jemena, CitiPower & Powercor distribution companies, and accessed through the independent Victorian research body, the Centre for New Energy Technologies (C4NET). Having spent years obtaining and providing data for research purposes, C4NET has recently opened itself up to queries from anybody, with the goal of expanding knowledge around electricity use to accelerate decarbonisation.
The researchers hope that by using the modelling they’ve developed, policy makers, energy providers, construction companies and building owners will be able to optimise the PV potential of both new and existing structures.

The newly signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) will see Gelion supply Mayur Renewables with its zinc-bromide Endure batteries, which the company is currently bringing into full commercialisation. It is initially looking to deliver 100 MWh of energy storage to Mayur from 2022 to 2027.
Gelion Technologies
In addition to the battery offtake, Mayur will also act as sales agent and sole distributor for Gelion in Papua New Guinea.
“The heat-resistant Endure battery is ideal for conditions in PNG and we look forward to supplying Mayur with energy storage capability to support and boost their operations,” Gelion CEO Andrew Grimes said.
Mayur’s Managing Director Paul Mulder said Gelion can also support its nation-building vision for PNG. “It’s fantastic to get in on the ground floor with Gelion, which has the technology and lower-installed cost to enable Mayur to increase renewable energy penetration at a faster rate than with existing technologies,” he said. 
Gelion is marketing itself as a safer alternative to lithium-based battery chemistries, as well as being far more “abuse tolerant.” Despite its newness, Gelion is seeking to bring the Endure batteries into the market at a remarkably competitive $100 per kWh. It says its novel manufacturing approach and highly engineered design have allowed it to enter with such a low cost offering.
Mayur Resources
“Only 13% of PNG is electrified. Most of the current power generation capacity relies on diesel or heavy fuel oil, which is not sustainable in today’s energy market. Gelion’s robust and scalable zinc-bromide Endure batteries, coupled with large-scale solar energy could provide remote PNG communities with an affordable, renewable and robust solution for their energy needs,” Mulder added.
The partnership announcement follows the completion of Mayur’s renewable energy study for its recently granted Special Economic Zone in Papua New Guinea, which confirmed a solar capacity of around 500 MW could be installed. In terms of scale, that’s just shy of the island’s total installed power capacity, which sits at 580 MW. Mayur says the solar farm would not only provide a source of renewable energy for its planned Central Cement & Lime (CCL) Project, but would also provide energy for other industrial users and could also be used to power local communities without access to electricity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/10/aussie-company-claims-its-hydrogen-plane-is-just-18-months-away-as-fortescue-too-moves-on-aviation/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 10, 2021",Aussie company claims its hydrogen plane is just 18 months away as Fortescue too moves on aviation,"Two major hydrogen-based aviation moves have been announced today – one from billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries, and the other by a relatively unknown player, Aviation H2. 
Despite its newcomer status (precisely when Aviation H2 was established is difficult to say, as the company doesn’t seem to have its own website), Aviation H2 today released the news it’s appointed Dr Helmut Mayer and Christof Mayer to lead the development of an emissions-free aircraft, which it claims could be flying in “as little as 18 months.” This short lead time, it says, will be made possible by “modifying existing aeroplanes to be powered by hydrogen-based technologies, which are already transforming the motor vehicle industry.”
Aviation H2 is entirely owned by Liberty Energy Capital Pty Ltd, an Australian investment firm with “significant positions” in 18 renewable energy companies, including H2X Global, Patriot Hydrogen, Sweetman Renewables, Verdant Earth Technologies, Port Anthony Renewables Limited, and more. Liberty Energy Capital says it’s poised to have a $490 million equity in renewable energy companies across Australia over the next three years.
Branding itself as a renewable energy investor, Liberty Energy Capital’s portfolio is noticeably heavy on biomass-to-hydrogen projects holding almost every company which has biomass-based projects in Australia. Biomass is not zero emissions technology. Liberty Energy Capital also holds a 30% stake in Pure Hydrogen, a somewhat misleading name given the company owns three gas projects, including the Windorah Gas Project in the Cooper Basin, one of Australia’s most prolific onshore petroleum basins.
On its website, Liberty Energy Capital say it is “100% owned by Sirius Capital Pty Ltd, itself owned by a group of Family Office’s”. Strange grammar and punctuation aside, family offices usually refers to private wealth management advisory firms that serve ultra-high-net-worth individuals. 
Despite the rather mysterious origins of the company, Aviation H2 says the newly appointed Mayer brothers have 60 years of combined experience in large-scale machine design for industrial purposes. “The Mayer brothers currently have three potential solutions for converting a traditional aircraft into a renewable model and will conduct a series of tests to identify which state-of-the-art technology is best suited for powering an aeroplane in a way that can be commercialised,” it said in its statement.
On the more established side end of town, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) today announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Los Angeles-based company Universal Hydrogen, which is focussed on reducing carbon emissions in aviation.
Under the agreement, FFI will supply green hydrogen to Universal Hydrogen to power regional and other aviation sectors until 2035. The pair will also conduct a scoping study to develop green hydrogen production and logistics hubs in southeast Queensland, Iceland, and New Zealand.

The MoU will see FFI take the lead on green hydrogen production and supply activities while Universal Hydrogen will take the lead on delivery logistics to airports and on-airport fuel services.
FFI Chairman Andrew Forrest said its collaboration with Universal Hydrogen will lay the foundations for a zero-emissions aviation industry in the near-term future. “Electrifying our planes will only go so far and will only be appropriate for smaller aircraft, due to current limitations around battery technologies. Green hydrogen, in contrast, is a practical solution we can use right now,” Forrest said.
Universal Hydrogen’s CEO Paul Eremenko said the agreement will help it not only ensure its supply of green hydrogen, “but to support the entry into service of a hydrogen single aisle airplane in the 2030s.”
“Through the investment of companies like FFI, we expect green hydrogen to be at cost parity with jet fuel on an equivalent energy basis by the mid-2020s, and to be significantly cheaper in the years that follow,” Mr Eremenko said.
Universal Hydrogen, in which FFI is also an early investor, is building a flexible, scalable, and capital-light solution to hydrogen logistics for aviation through its modular capsule technology. According to the companies’ statement, these capsules can be filled with gaseous and liquid hydrogen and are delivered from the point of production directly to the aircraft using existing freight networks and cargo handling equipment. Universal Hydrogen says it is also developing a powertrain retrofit kit to enable regional passenger and cargo airplanes to be converted to fly on hydrogen. The first test flight of Universal Hydrogen’s technology is anticipated in 2022, with revenue services planned for 2025.
The MoU announcement today comes after FFI was recognised by US President Joe Biden at COP26 as one of several companies to join his “First Movers Coalition.” 
Fortescue Future Industries has this year announced what can only be described as a litany of partnerships and global green hydrogen projects, establishing itself as one of the most consequential players not only in Australia but globally. From his roots in iron ore exporting, Forrest has performed a major sustainability pivot in the last few years and is today highly critical of Australian governments’ support of blue, grey and other “greenwashed” hydrogen projects, which unfortunately abound.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/10/long-duration-thermal-storage-system-based-on-silica-sand/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,ITALY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 10, 2021",Long-duration thermal storage system based on silica sand,"From pv magazine Global
Magaldi Green Energy, a unit of Italy-based dry bottom ash handling system provider Magaldi Power Spa, has developed a thermal storage system for long-duration storage based on a fluidised sand bed.
The Magaldi Green Thermal Energy Storage (MGTES) can be charged with renewable electricity or thermal energy such as waste heat generated by industrial thermal processes. Its discharge phase consists of the production of green thermal energy — steam or hot air — which can be used directly in industrial plants or for the generation of electricity using steam turbines. 
“Our storage technology can be used in the steam section of existing thermoelectric power plants based on the Rankine cycle or combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) plants,” Letizia Magaldi, executive vice president at Magaldi Green Energy, told pv magazine.
The system consists of a blower, a fluidisation air blowing system, a fluidisation air suction system, an air filter and fan, an air pre-heater, and an integrated thermal energy storage module. Silica sands are the system’s storage media.
The fluidisation system is the core of the technology and is claimed to have high thermal diffusivity. The manufacturer ensures it is well insulated and that thermal losses are lower than 2% per day. The absence of convection and the insulation of the tank are said to limit the heat exchange with the outside of the casing, thus minimising energy losses. The system is discharged by reversing the integrated heat exchanger within the fluidised bed and the stored energy is released as superheated steam.
The system’s operating temperature can reach up to 1,000 degrees Celsius and its roundtrip efficiency is reportedly over 90% for heat production and between 35 and 45% for electricity generation.
Magaldi Green Energy claims the MGTES has a 30-year lifetime and describes it as a customisable solution with different capacities. “By varying the mass of solid particles contained in each module, it is possible to configure a storage capacity between 5 and 100 MWh,” it further explained.
The system Capex is estimated by the company at around $65,000/MWh. “We expect to reduce costs by at least 50% over the next 10 years from economies of scale and design improvements,” Magaldi stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/10/uk-indian-authorities-launch-plan-for-transnational-solar-super-grid/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA,UNITED KINGDOM",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 10, 2021","UK, Indian authorities launch plan for transnational solar super-grid","From pv magazine India
The International Solar Alliance (ISA), the Indian presidency of the ISA, and the U.K. COP presidency unveiled plans for the first transnational network of solar power grids last week at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.
The global super-grid project, known as the Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG) initiative, aims to harness solar energy wherever the sun is shining. It is spearheaded by the Indian and U.K. governments of India and implemented by the ISA, in partnership with the World Bank Group.
Under the plans released in Glasgow, the ISA plans to push for a network of interconnected green grids in the years ahead. As part of its first phase, the project will drive interconnectivity across the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. The second will focus on African power pools, while the third will drive global green grid interconnections.
The GGI-OSOWOG plan announcement was accompanied by the One Sun declaration endorsed by 80 ISA member countries.
“Realising the vision of One Sun One World One Grid through interconnected green grids can be transformational, enabling all of us to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement to prevent dangerous climate change, to accelerate the clean energy transition, and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,” it stated. “These efforts can stimulate green investments and create millions of good jobs. By sharing the sun’s energy, we can help to build a more peaceful and prosperous world.”
The GGI-OSOWOG initiative will bring together a global coalition of national governments, international financial and technical organisations, legislators, power system operators, and knowledge leaders to accelerate the construction of the new infrastructure needed for a world powered by clean energy. In doing so, the project aims to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy such as coal by enabling them to purchase affordable solar power from other countries.
As the chief agency leading and delivering the project, ISA aims to help mobilise $1 trillion of funding by 2030 to assist developing countries in expanding their solar power grids to meet their energy access, energy security, and energy transition needs. The initiative is widely seen as a big and bold move ahead on the ISA’s solar transition roadmap and will go some way towards realising its vision for a solar energy future.
The global grid concept was first announced by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2018 during the first assembly of the ISA. In May 2021, the United Kingdom pledged technical, financial, and research support for the OSOWOG project.
The ISA, launched at COP21 in Paris, recently expanded its membership scope to include all UN member states. There are 90 signatories and 193 prospective members. The ISA provides a dedicated platform for cooperation, through which the global community, including governments, bilateral and multilateral organisations, corporates, industry, and other stakeholders, can contribute to help achieve the common goal of increasing the use and quality of solar energy in meeting energy needs of prospective ISA member countries in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable manner.
