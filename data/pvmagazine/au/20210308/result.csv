The Solar for Business Program is an extension of the Victorian Labor Government’s Solar Homes program, which has found its rooftop balance after a teetering start and accelerated the Victorian rooftop-solar count to more than 510,000 residential systems in January this year.
Minister for Solar Homes, Energy, the Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio, celebrated the launch of the program at a photo opp with Craig Ross of Dandenong-based small business CR Electrics, who already has solar on the roof of his premises. She chatted with Ross, and with Mathew Delaney from Advanced Energy Management, who designed and installed CR Electrics’ solar system.
“Solar panels are helping Craig save on his power bills, allowing his business to recover from COVID-19 and contribute to our climate revolution,” wrote the Minister in a Facebook post.
Businesses with fewer than 20 employees and operating from owned non-residential premises will be eligible for a rebate of up to $3,500 on solar systems of up to 30 kW, if supplied by retailers and installers registered with the Solar Homes Program. 
The 15,000 business rebates will be spread over three years, and eligibility will soon be expanded to include business operating from rental premises.
They apply only to installations which occur after the formal opening of applications in May, and businesses can register their interest in advance online.
A further $5 million is being provided by the Government, through the Small Business Energy Saver Program, to help small businesses replace inefficient equipment: swapping old electric water heaters, with gas, solar or heat-pump options, for example; replacing old upright fridges, freezers and chilled display cabinets with more efficient models; ditto for outdated air conditioners; and so on across a range of eligible items.
This Program is described in terms of a “bonus” that discounts the cost of upgrades; the full amount discounted will depend on the amount and type of approved equipment upgraded.
By way of example, “Replacing an old electric hot-water unit with a medium-sized heat pump could cost a local hairdresser $840 instead of $4,000”, says the Small Business Energy Saver website, which also provides a link to accredited providers.
“These new programs will drive down energy costs and help boost Victoria’s economic recovery,” asserted D’Ambrosio.
They form a newly released part of more than $46 million set aside in the 2020-21 State Budget to support clean energy and energy efficiency for small businesses.
This latest solar boost follows on the heels of last week’s Victorian Government announcement of $8.8 million to power more of the state’s schools with rooftop solar.
Like the Solar For Business Program, the Greener Government School Buildings program is an extension of a previous successful pilot.
In total, the program is aiming to install 8,200 kW of solar PV on public schools, saving the public purse some $2 million a year in energy costs, and displacing 11,500 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum.
Each Victorian energy initiative has multipurpose goals in terms of boosting the economy by lowering costs, providing jobs in retail and installation of solar, and driving towards the state goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 to mitigate climate change.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/08/a-chilling-draft-of-2021-22-mlfs-hits-nsw-solar-farms/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 8, 2021",A chilling draft of 2021-22 MLFs hits NSW solar farms,"Lower and lower is the forecast for MLFs to be endured by solar farms in New South Wales over the year commencing July 1, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Draft Marginal Loss Factors FY 2021-22, published for consultation last week. Solar operators in other states will be sifting through mixed results in the changes from the previous year’s revenue curbing.
New South Wales is particularly hard hit because local generation has increased, and demand that draws imports from Queensland and Victoria will add to congestion in the network until major transmission upgrades between states, and those funnelling output from renewable energy zones come online in future years.
The Riverina region gets the roughest end of the stick, according to AEMO’s calculations, with several solar farms provisionally sentenced to a drop of between six and eight points in their MLFs.
Spark Infrastructure’s 120 MW Bomen Solar Farm, for instance, goes from an MLF of 0.9417 to 0.8766; and the John Laing-owned 175 MW Finley Solar Farm takes another hit from 0.8800 to 0.8304.
UK infrastructure investor John Laing provides an example of the havoc that unexpected drops in MLFs can cause to balance sheets.
After sustaining $128 million in losses on three of its renewable energy projects in the 2018-19 financial year, John Laing decided to freeze investment in standalone solar and wind farms, and put its Australian renewable assets up for sale. 
On Thursday last week the company delayed its sale of Finley and the 200 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm (which fares slightly better in the draft 2021-22 MLFs, going from 0.7907 to 0.8038), after showing further losses in its full-year results for 2020. Losses from individual solar farms or even countries are not specified in the John Laing report, but the company cited one £10 million (AU$ 18 million) loss due to “further transmission issues in Australia”, as well as project performance losses of £89 million (AU$160 million) “particularly on solar assets in Australia and on the UK biomass assets”. In light of revised expectations, it will reorganise financing of the two large solar farms in preparation for sale in 2022.
In contrast to NSW solar farms, generators in Central Queensland, are set to bask in MLF increases of up to six points; and those in north-western Victoria, which have been through the wringer in recent times, are also winners in this draft document.
That is to say, the five so-called West Murray solar farms that had their output curtailed by half in September 2019 due to system strength issues in the region have enjoyed restored operations thanks to an inverter fix engineered by SMA in April last year, but have still been laboring under lower than expected returns due to MLFs. AEMO forecasts these will now bounce back from a low base by up to five points in the coming financial year. 
The market operator’s draft document cites the “revision of intra regional limits” and “resulting changes in projected flows on Murraylink” interconnector, allowing more exports into South Australia, as the cause of the upward revision for renewable generators in the West Murray region. 
MLFs refer to the amount of energy from each generator that is expected to be lost during the transmission process, and accordingly weights what individual generators will be paid for energy exported to the grid. An MLF of 1 entitles a generator to 100% payment for its output. MLFs lower than one indicate a percentage reduction in the payment that generator will receive; for example, an MLF of 0.9 indicates that according to AEMO’s calculations 10% of energy exported will be lost in transmit, and the generator will be paid for only 90% of its output.
AEMO’S draft publication of proposed MLFs allows generators and other stakeholders to give feedback on their lot, given that the calculations, based on forecasts of intra regional generation, can have a substantial impact on revenues over the year ahead. 
Submissions this year must be received by AEMO before 12 March in order to be considered in the preparation of the final report which will be published on 1 April.
“Year-on-year changes in MLFS are driven by projected changes in the NEM,” AEMO explains in this year’s draft document.
Augmentation, such as building new transmission lines, decreases impedance in the network, particularly in the area local to the augmentation; if impedance between the generator’s connection point and the Regional Reference Node (RRN) is decreased, the MLF assigned to that generator will move closer to 1 or slightly higher.
Changes to projected power flows in any area also influence allocated MLFs: if power flows increase due to increased generation or increased demand, likely congestion will cause MLFs to decrease; if projected power flow from a connection point to the RRN decreases, MLFs will improve, again rising towards 1.
Variations in MLFs for 2021-22 compared to previous settings are mostly due to changes in projected power flow over the network, says AEMO.
“The key drivers for these changes,” explains AEMO, “are additional generation capacity and generation that commenced operation within the 2020-21 FY being commercially operational for the entirety of 2021-22.”
One region’s good fortune is often connected to another’s pain: for example, Northern Victoria’s MLFs for 2021-22 are higher than the current year, because of projected increased exports to New South Wales. Western Victoria’s MLFs, on the other hand, are lower, driven by increased imports over the Heywood Interconnector from South Australia.
In Queensland, MLFs in the south west have been driven lower by a large local increase in generation: the APA-developed 110 MW Darling Downs Solar Farm for example, which has a long-term offtake agreement with Origin Energy, is set to earn somewhat less in the coming year, with its MLF reduced from 0.9825 to 0.9766.
Northern and Central Queensland, however, will benefit from reduced overall generation leading to improved MLFs. In the north, for example, Edify Energy’s portfolio: Daydream (180 MW), Hamilton (69 MW), Hayman (60 MW) and Whitsunday (69 MW), which last year came under threat of curtailment to zero exports to the grid due to system strength issues, will, at least in the MLF stakes, all creep up towards 1 from variations on 0.8.
Calculations to arrive at MLFs are complex, and AEMO has consistently worked to improve transparency of its rationale, more frequently publishing updates and providing information on regional trends — the supply and demand landscape is continually changing.
True relief on MLFs won’t be felt until major transmission upgrades start to free up the system, starting in late 2021 with the Queensland-NSW transmission link, and major battery energy storage systems, such as Neoen’s Victorian Big Battery come on line to regulate release of energy into the network.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/08/the-solar-is-over-yardarm-at-four-pillars-gin-distillery/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 8, 2021",The solar is over yardarm at Four Pillars gin distillery,"A few powerful reasons lay behind Australian distillery Four Pillars’ decision to install 65.88 kW of solar on the roof at its Healesville Victoria headquarters. Among them, its eligibility for low-cost finance from the Sustainable Australia Fund (SAF), which also allows the business to repay the capital cost of the system as part of its council rates over time — in this case over 10 years — and so quickly realise savings on its electricity outlay.
“With terms of up to 20 years and low interest rates, the repayments are so low that the business is often making money from upgrades from the very first year,” says Scott Bocskay, CEO of SAF.
Four Pillars has become a destination, a household name and internationally recognised for excellence, since three partners launched the boutique distillery with one copper still, named Wilma after co-founder Cameron McKenzie’s late mother, in 2013.
In recent times, McKenzie says when Four Pillars was heating the expanded business’s production stills — which now include Jude, Eileen, Beth and Coral — “no-one in the street” could “cook a piece of toast”.
The partners’ decision to go solar has significantly reduced the burden on the grid around Healesville, and over the 10 years of the finance agreement will reduce carbon emissions by some 1,600 tCO2-e — which is the equivalent of powering 185 homes for a year.

The solar installation was carried out by Cherry Energy Solutions, part of the Echo Group acquired last year by Hong Kong-owned EnergyAustralia, and went so far as to use black-framed panels to match the style of the boutique distillery building. Cherry Energy Solutions is one of the trusted local installer partners selected by SAF to meet its high required standards of system design and workmanship.
Expected to save Four Pillars $12,800 in energy bills each year, the solar system was financed through an Environmental Upgrade Agreement, via SAF, which evolved out of the Sustainable Melbourne Fund in 2019 when it negotiated a $200 million line of finance from the Victorian-based, customer-owned Bank Australia.

The City of Melbourne is legendary for its foresight in having established a unique new form of financing — no upfront cost, low interest, long payback period — in 2002 that would increase the sustainability of the city’s buildings. It was intended to “overcome many of the barriers to environmental upgrades, including business cashflow and the split incentive between landlords and tenants”, explains the SAF website.
In 2020 the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) further boosted SAF’s funding pool by $630,000, to extend the number of councils eligible to participate into South Australia and New South Wales, and also to support the development of an online platform that would make Environmental Upgrade Finance easier to implement. More than 40 councils around Australia are now partnered with the SAF program.
From Four Pillars’ perspective, the process of applying for and deploying the loan facility has been “easy, transparent and rewarding”, says McKenzie.
“Like all growing businesses,” he adds, “we have various loans and finance arrangements for building works and equipment. This was the easiest and fastest project we’ve ever worked on.”
The distillery’s agreement is with SAF, and Yarra Ranges Council which administers the repayments. McKenzie says the business barely notices these outgoings, “as they come through on our rates notice”.
Four Pillars is the seventh Environmental Upgrade Agreement provided within the area of Yarra Ranges Council, which has been particularly active in helping businesses unlock the savings enabled by this form of funding, while also reducing the region’s carbon emissions.
Aurrum Aged Care, in Healesville, for example, used Environmental Upgrade financing to install a 96 kW, 300-panel rooftop solar system, and found that during hot summer days at times of peak power consumption the facility could renewably produce 85% of its electricity needs.
“It’s an absolute win-win for the businesses that have jumped on board, says local mayor Fiona McAllister.
Aside from solar installations, other examples of projects that may qualify for Environmental Upgrade Finance include energy-efficient lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, as well as projects that minimise water use and waste — the finance is only available for upgrades to non-residential buildings.
In an example of how businesses can deploy the funds saved by non-upfront payment for environmental upgrades, Four Pillars is planning a $6 million expansion of its facility, to be designed by sustainability specialists, Breathe Architecture, which will incorporate more solar as well as waste reduction initiatives.
“If there’s an option anywhere in the business to be more sustainable, we’ll always try,” says McKenzie, who adds,“Environmentally, it’s 100% the right thing to do, and we get great feedback from customers who walk through the door.”
