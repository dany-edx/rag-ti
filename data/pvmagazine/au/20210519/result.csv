The company reached a record revenue in the 2020 financial year, hitting $512 million. That same year, Zhang opened Discover Energy, moving into a disparate role as an electricity retailer. “At its core, Discover is really a tech company though,” Aaron Chen, Discover Energy’s Director of Corporate Finance, told pv magazine Australia.
Sitting across from me in the bustling Smart Energy Conference held in Sydney’s International Convention Centre last week, Zhang and Chen laid out their interlocking vision for the two companies – for which IT (Information Technology) is the centrepiece. “The company’s DNA is very different,” Zhang told pv magazine Australia.
One Stop leases tens of thousands of square metres in almost every state, using it to house the solar equipment like PV panels, storage batteries and inverters it then supplies to solar installers and retailers. As crucial as the physical aspect of the business has been launching One Stop, it’s hardly the most important part of Zhang’s businesses’ future. IT, he says, is really where the money is.

Which is why he started Discover Energy. The point of venturing into the electricity retail space, Zhang and Chen explained, is to understand Australia’s electricity markets, to be up close to the action, to see what happens there. “As a tech company, we need data. You only get data if you have customers,” Chen said.
“The more customers, the more data, the more accurate [your algorithms become].”
Who knew maths equations would prove so sexy in this brave new world? But sexy they are. Algorithms and IT are really the brains of the software system, which are in turn the brains of how any computer-driven system operates.
“Software as a service – that’s the key,” Zhang said. One of the key areas Discover is using its software is in its Virtual Power Plant.
Bella Peacock
As abstruse as the name sounds, Virtual Power Plants, or VPPs, are essentially software platforms that connect the capacity of home batteries distributed around the grid and join their forces so they have enough power to meaningfully engage in lucrative spot markets. Through a VPP, a home battery goes from being a solar shifting device to an electron trading platform that can generate a profit for its owners.
There are a number of VPPs operating today in Australia, with state governments backing numerous trials and energy giants like AGL and Origin also trying their hand.
Discover’s VPP, however, is the only platform in Australia that can integrate all battery brands, according to Zhang – giving it an important point of difference. “We are a truly hardware agnostic platform,” Chen added.
The pair frame Discover’s platform as the ‘android’ of the VPP world – able to integrate with any hardware. (Many of Australia’s other VPP operators rely on software provided by, for instance, Tesla, which naturally only pairs with its own battery hardware – a business strategy more akin to Apple.)
Discover’s strategy has been to slowly spread through Australia’s states with all their technical variations. It’s been operating its VPP in South Australia (the most lucrative market, given the world-leading solar penetration) for two years now, aggregating a capacity of 5 MWh. The company then moved into New South Wales and Queensland before launching in Victoria and the Australia Capital Territory (ACT) in April of this year. Zhang believes Discover’s is the first VPP to launch in the country’s capital.
Discover currently has 735 VPP customers across the nation. Its target is get to a total of 2000 by the end of this year. Given there were roughly 10,000 home battery installations in Australia last year, his target is characteristically ambitious, but he’s adamant that Discover’s capacity to integrate with any battery brand and hardware gives his company the upper hand.
Bella Peacock
Operating virtual power plants across the country has provided Discover with the data it craves and the revelations it impels.
For instance, it’s found that at any given time around 15% of batteries won’t be able to answer the VPP’s call to discharge their power at the most profitable moment because in reality it’s already being drawn by its ultimate overlords, the household’s owners.
On top of that, another 10% to 15% of household batteries won’t respond simply because they have bad internet connections, leading to roughly a 30% non-response rate overall.
Not only does such knowledge breed more accurate algorithms, it has also proved helpful for Zhang in other ways by granting him a powerful position of influence.
Discover Energy
Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator estimates that around 80% of solar panels installed in Australia are sourced from China. We also rely on China for much of our other solar equipment too – a fair portion of which travels through One Stop’s warehouses on its way to our rooftops.
Zhang is acutely aware, therefore, of his position as “middle man,” as he called it. That is, he is able to communicate with parties in China about what Australia actually needs to deal with its unique technical issues.
From the get go, Zhang’s business strategy has always been B2B (business-to-business) focussed, so it’s hardly surprising that he is bringing that practice to Discover, which is far more customer facing than One Stop.
Leveraging his position at Discover, Zhang said he’s able to influence the next generation of batteries entering Australia from the Chinese market. Why? Because he has useful information, information Chinese manufacturers need.
One example is the knowledge he’s gleaned about Australia’s wanting internet leaving home batteries unable to participate in spot markets through their VPPs. The revelation led Zhang to lobby Chinese manufacturers to integrate 4G internet dongles into the next generation of home batteries hopefully solving the issue.
This intimate knowledge of Australia, from its solar needs to the behaviour of its wifi, coupled with connections to Chinese manufacturers has put Zhang is a prime position of influence, a fact not lost on him.

Zhang sees VPPs as one of the solutions to smoothing Australia’s increasingly unsteady grid. “New things always bring new problems, they just need new solutions,” he said. Ultimately, it’s about finding non-network solutions to solve the networks problems, he adds – like a VPP.
Naturally, the role of VPPs will grow as battery uptake grows – for which Zhang also has high hopes. He forecasts that in the next three years, the price of installing a solar + battery system at home will drop from the $13,000 to $10,000 it generally costs today, down to between $7,000 to $8,000.
To this end, Chen says its in government’s best interested to keep incentivising home battery uptake, as the more distributed storage assets are connected to the grid and aggregated in a VPP, the most firming capacity the grid will have at its disposal.
Community batteries, Zhang notes, also have an important role to play here. Importantly, these are often located on sites with far better internet connections than most households, allowing the larger batteries to trade on millisecond markets rather than the typical six second turn around of home batteries. Discover are currently working with Ausgrid to develop at algorithm for community batteries to trade on markets, Zhang adds.
The rise of VPPs is also, of course, beneficial for battery owners. Zhang said 90% of Discover’s VPP customers are on credit. That is, their bill is not so much a bill as an energy trading report (it’s also set out as such, a marketing feature Zhang loves). At the moment, the lion’s share of that profit is going to customers in South Australia, but as other states grow their battery penetration, there will be power in numbers.
While customers are the brawn, software is the brain – which is precisely where Zhang is focussing his attentions.

Simultaneously, rooftop solar has meant traditional periods of peak grid demand during high summer are at the lowest levels in five years, shifting national consumption patterns and causing wholesale electricity prices to hit nine-year lows.
The arresting statistics come from the Australian Energy Regulator’s Wholesale Markets Quarterly report for the first quarter of this year, with the agency’s chair, Claire Savage, describing the report as underlining the effect of Australia’s energy transition.
Unlike much of the developed world, Australia’s peak energy draws come from cooling rather than heating, with millions of Australians turning on energy hungry air-conditioners in the middle of summer days to get relief from smouldering temperatures. With around 20% of Australian households now fitted with PV panels – up from 0.2% in 2007 – the National Electricity Market (NEM) is simply not experiencing the draw it would from this traditional behaviour with one in five Australians bypassing the grid altogether, powering their aircon with energy harvested on their roof.
The highest peak electricity demand this financial year occurred on Sunday 24 January, 2021 – the hottest summer’s day for much of the country’s east. The pressure placed on the grid that day was lower than each of previous five summers. Energy consultant and honorary ANU associate professor, Hugh Saddler, remarked this phenomenon was “undoubtedly caused of the growing supply from rooftop solar,” in his National Energy Emissions Audit for the Australia Institute.

Tellingly, rooftop solar is now generating more energy for the grid than coal plants. “Rooftop solar made a larger contribution to the grid during the 2020-21 peak demand than either Liddell (output 750MW) or Yallourn (output 1,300MW),” Saddler said in his Australia’s Institute report, in reference to two of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power stations.
The rise of solar in Australia has plunged wholesale electricity prices to depths not seen in almost a decade. “There were fewer prices above $300/MWh this quarter than in any other Q1 since 2012, and there were also near record numbers of negative prices in Victoria and South Australia,” the Australian Energy Regulator noted.
“As a result, black coal generation fell to its lowest ever Q1 level, and gas generation fell to its lowest Q1 level since 2005,” the Australian Energy Regulator’s report said, noting that both Victoria and NSW consumed less than 1 PJ of gas last quarter. In other words, gas-fired electricity hit its lowest level in 16 years, and was overtaken by solar.
Green Energy Markets
Nonetheless, the Morrison government last night pledged $600m of unallocated funding from last week’s budget to build the controversial 660 MW Kurri Kurri gas plant in the Hunter region of New South Wales.
The massive announcement, which left many staggered, comes just a day after the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector. In the report, the IEA say in no uncertain terms that to reach net zero by the middle of the century, there must be “from today, no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants.”
Morrison must have missed that one.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/19/geopolitical-impact-of-long-distance-transport-of-electricity-and-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 19, 2021",Geopolitical impact of long-distance transport of electricity and hydrogen,"pv magazine: Prof. Overland, there is growing interest in the long-distance transport of energy in the form of electricity or hydrogen. However, large-scale infrastructure and clean fuel shipping will inevitably raise geopolitical concerns. Could this impact be similar to that associated with the long-distance transport of fossil fuels?
There may be some similarities, but I think there will also always be differences. Everybody has some renewable energy, so there is unlikely to be the same complete dependence on long-distance imports as many countries have had for fossil fuels. As it has been formulated elsewhere, renewable energy exporters will often be competing against their customers.
The importers will be buying their energy because it is a bit more convenient and cheaper than producing their own, but if the risks and nuisances become too great, they might as well produce their own. So the exporters will need to treat their customers very nicely and cautiously. International trade in hydrogen might be a bit like overseas trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and to some, but a lesser extent similar to trade in oil. However, whereas natural gas and oil are only located in high concentrations in a minority of countries, more countries have an abundance of renewable energy that could be used to generate hydrogen.
Thus, the producers in a global hydrogen economy would not have quite the same privileged position as the producers of oil and gas. It is also worth noting that the global markets for oil and natural gas are quite different, and whereas the former is basically fungible and can be moved anywhere in the world, the latter does not have a fully integrated world market yet.
Despite the growing trade in LNG, LNG trade relationships are sometimes referred to as “floating pipelines,” and there are frequently large differences between the price of LNG in different parts of the world. Hydrogen will likely be more like LNG than oil due to the small initial market and large up-front capital requirements in infrastructure.
The May edition of pv magazine is out! Pick up your copy today for a big look at the switch to large-format cells and modules. Coverage also includes TOPCon vs. HJT, co-location for green hydrogen production, price trends amid polysilicon shortage, and trends informing Southeast Asian PV growth.
Could long-distance cables or pipelines be comparable to the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is being built to bring Russian gas to Europe? Could electricity or hydrogen transport raise the same international tensions as gas pipelines?
NordStream 2 is controversial for several specific reasons. Because it increases EU dependency on Russia, because it is a tool for Russia to reduce its dependency on and thus gain power over Ukraine. Because Germany and German and other natural gas companies are pushing hard for it, although many other Europeans do not see it as being in the EU’s interest. And above all, because it locks in infrastructure for future expanded imports of fossil fuels.
Taking into consideration all of these points, the international trade in renewable energy is very unlikely to be similar to NordStream 2. However, in principle and at a general structural level, trade in renewable energy could be similar to gas pipelines, especially if the energy is moved in the form of electricity via subsea cables.
A 14 GW solar project coupled to 33 GWh of storage is currently being planned in Australia’s Northern Territory. The developer hopes to sell the generated energy to Singapore via a 4,500-km, high-voltage direct-current transmission network, including a 750-km overhead transmission line from a solar project in Darwin and a 3,800-km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore, via Indonesia. What are the potential geopolitical consequences for Australia and the broader region, assuming that the project actually gets built?
I don’t think this project is realistic. The cables are incredibly long and expensive and they would traverse the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a part of our planet that is particularly prone to volcano eruptions and earthquakes. If Singapore really needs to buy renewable energy from Australia, it would likely make more sense to transport it as hydrogen. This would give both the Singaporeans and the Australians more flexibility, in case there are any disruptions or changes of plans.
Singapore could also work more on other options. Despite lack of space for renewable energy installations, the Singaporeans could do a lot more to develop their own energy system, by raising energy efficiency and facilitating accelerated rooftop and floating solar power development. They could also work harder to build trust and source electricity from neighbouring countries and then have a smaller portion of expensive long-distance hydrogen with an option to ramp up in case of a need. This long-distance element could be partly from Australia and partly from other sources for further risk mitigation.
Another 10 GW wind-solar complex coupled with 20 GWh of storage is currently being developed in Morocco. The electricity produced by the huge plant could potentially be exported to the United Kingdom via a 1.8 GW submarine cable that would cross the territorial waters of Morocco, Spain, Portugal and France. Assuming that this ambitious project is completed, would this mean the success of the Desertec dream? What kind of geopolitical impact could this have on North Africa and Europe?
The Morocco-U.K. project is slightly different from Desertec – and perhaps not quite as rational, since the U.K. is not on the Mediterranean – but the principle is similar. I think something along the lines of Desertec is inevitably going to be realised sooner or later, and probably sooner rather than later. North Africa has incredibly rich renewable sources, both in terms of sunshine and wind. Equally importantly, North Africa has huge amounts of available suitable space for solar and wind power and very large markets nearby in Europe. In that regard, the starting point is much better than for the Australia-Singapore project.
Where could the most strategic links for power and hydrogen transmission be built? Are there specific regions that would benefit more from such infrastructure?
I think the North Africa-Europe axis is the most promising one. Central and Western Europe have very little free space due to population density, farming and sprawling infrastructure. They have very high energy consumption due to wealth and cold climate. They have purchasing power – they do not want to become overly dependency on eastern neighbours.
Europe is also the global leader in climate policy and renewable energy installation and needs more energy sources and connections to stabilise its own supply of intermittent renewable energy. As explained, above, North Africa has correspondingly good conditions for renewable energy developments, and the distance to Europe is not that great. Another possible axis might be Mexico-USA, but the USA has quite a lot of space and resources of its own and is thus different from Europe. Australia-Asia as discussed above might also be an option, but Australia is far away, especially from the large markets like China, Japan, and South Korea. Mongolia/Russia/Central Asia-China/Korea/Japan is another possible axis. I don’t think any of these axes have the same potential as North Africa-Europe, but they may still be developed later on.
Could hydrogen pipelines be a better option than electric cables? Hydrogen could also eventually be transported via existing gas pipelines, provided that they are suitable for the transport of the clean fuel.
There are different views among experts, but most seem to be tilting toward the view that natural gas pipelines can be repurposed for hydrogen relatively easily. So, yes, that could give hydrogen an advantage. However, hydrogen also has a disadvantage in that its production is not very efficient.
It also seems unlikely that hydrogen will ever play a major role in person vehicles, as batteries are advancing fast, and even for heavier transport, the question is open. I think the really promising initial niches for hydrogen are in handling intermittent renewable energy and in certain industrial processes. Where and whether it will grow from there and whether it can compete with other options like batteries and interconnections is hard to say.
What kind of alliances might arise around these big projects? What are the biggest potential obstacles?
Since I see the North Africa-Europe axis as most promising, I think that is also where there is the greatest scope for the development of international relationships based on energy projects. Such developments will probably create some losers, but I think they will be so indirect and far down the line that it is difficult to see what they could do to oppose such projects. Perhaps Russian engagement in Libya could be seen in such a perspective, but I don’t think the Russians are thinking along those lines at all at the moment.
Is there any chance we might see a hyper-connected world with an increasing number of cables and pipelines, if more large-scale projects are built to bring down costs?
I think we will see a lot of integration within countries, within regions and between regions. For starters, north and south Germany need better connections. But I don’t think there is going to be a need to connect the whole world. For example, connecting the Americas to the rest of the world would be expensive and introduce new risks that would outweigh the advantages. The Americas are big enough on their own to handle the intermittency.
Is it possible that energy, including both renewable electricity and hydrogen, will be consumed mostly on site or close to production, rather than transported to other distant locations? What conditions will be needed to make this happen?
This is a very interesting question. Embedded renewable energy is a new area I am working on. If we look back at the fossil fuel past, we can see that such hopes and promises were often not realised. One of the main purposes of OPEC was to use oil and gas resources to promote industrialisation in the OPEC countries. But little ever came of it, despite some exceptions like Qatalum – the world’s largest aluminium producer, based in Qatar and using Qatari natural gas.
In addition, renewable energy resources are more evenly distributed in the world than fossil fuel resources. Although some countries have a lot of sunshine or wind and space, almost all countries have some and few are as disproportionately resource-rich as the Qataris are in terms of gas. I think there are still good prospects for renewables-based industrialisation, but it will require a very proactive and competent approach on the part of states rich in renewable energy resources.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/19/why-rooftop-solar-failed-to-find-its-legs-in-india/,"MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 19, 2021",Why rooftop solar failed to find its legs in India,"Rooftop solar adoption has failed to gather the desired momentum in India despite the government push. Major reasons are policy conundrums, ill-designed institutional and governance structures, distorted market mechanisms and technical challenges such as those involving grid connectivity, according to a new report by Asian Development Bank.
Against the ‘40 GW by 2022’ rooftop solar target, India achieved a meagre 12% (4.4 GW) by December 2019. Out of the total RTS deployed in the country, the residential sector has been the worst performer, at 16%, compared to other competing sectors such as industrial and commercial.
The report cites persistent policy-level inconsistencies as a primary cause of the slowdown. Poor and piecemeal implementation of net metering policies at the sub-national scale is a major roadblock for the uptake of RTS PV in India. Most of the state regulations on net metering set the maximum capacity limit at 1 MW per metering point for RTS systems to be connected to the distribution grid, which hinders large-scale deployment. Often this capacity ceiling is imposed based on the poor financial health of the distribution utilities. These arbitrary caps hinder the uptake of RTS PV.
Apart from regulatory and technical constraints, there are also societal and informational constraints. Poor understanding of the benefits of RTS among users is a major challenge, which is compounded by the high upfront capital cost to deploy such projects, particularly for residential consumers.
The report stated while RTS systems require bottom-up approaches focusing on intense consumer engagement, the current policy and regulatory regime is designed on the principles of a top-down approach with a uniform set of policies and regulations that lack flexibility. The most recent evidence of such policy-level obstruction is the withdrawal of net metering policies in certain states for commercial and industrial consumers. There is no adequate understanding of how the existing intervention types are performing in varying policy, regulatory, and governance environments.
The existing information asymmetry is a major challenge for the large-scale uptake of RTS projects, especially in the residential segment. Poor understanding and information of the benefits of RTS by users have become the prime reasons for unwillingness to deploy such systems. In one study surveying five Indian cities, close to 50% of respondents were found to be unaware of the RTS technology and its applicability in household context.
In addition to the general information asymmetry, there is also a substantial lack of knowledge about the specific products, processes, and approval systems inherent with these systems. Lack of credible and objective sources of information has led to consumers relying on vendors for information.
This lack of information is further compounded by the high upfront capital cost to deploy these systems, as these are often not within reach of the larger section of the society. Although there has been a dramatic reduction in the RTS cost in recent years, the initial cost continues to be a major hurdle even for small projects.
Further, banks and financial institutions are reluctant to lend funding for these projects due to their small scale. Traditionally, banks charge a high interest rate to developers (10%–12%, or up to 14%) depending upon the associated risks, nature of the project, and credit rating of the borrower.
Lack of technical capacity often acts as a barrier to scaling up these interventions, particularly in rural settings. The needed market eco-system has not been created, and the much-needed supply chain has not yet been established.
The report stated policy-level inconsistencies could be addressed by modifying the net metering policies and their obstructive provisions. The removal of capacity constraints would be attractive not only to existing consumers, but to new consumers as well.
Even if it is not possible to have uniform policies across states, policies could be formulated considering state-level nuances characterised by factors such as unmet RPOs and the strength of distribution utilities, it added.
A  structured approach could go a long way in arresting some of the challenges currently encountered. The best way to minimise the regulatory burdens and procedural complexities is to institutionalise a single window facility for the entire eco-system of RTS PV deployment that would encompass connectivity, net metering, electricity inspection, and limitations on sanctioned load.

The manufacturer will invest €15.5 million (AU$24 million) in implementing R&D activities related to the module technology at its facility in Thalheim, Germany. “The additional €15.5 million come[s] on top of last year’s pledge to invest €20 million (AU$31 million) into machinery and equipment for next-generation PV technology development,” it said in a statement.
The new n-type tech, which is described as an evolution of its Q.antum cell technology, was dubbed Q.antum Neo and the module that the company wants to manufacture with it should be called Q.Tron. It said the new product will reach efficiencies well above the levels of current p-type modules on the market. It did not provide any further technical details.
Hanwha Q Cells’ flagship products that are helping to drive the uptake of Q.antum technology include the Q.Peak Duo solar module range. The series includes the most powerful product developed by the company to date, the Q.Peak Duo XL-G9.3, which is available in five versions with power outputs ranging from 440 W to 480 W and efficiencies of 19.7% to 20.6%.
The Q.antum cell technology is based on a nano aluminium coating that enhances the module’s electrical properties.
