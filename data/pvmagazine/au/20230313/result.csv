With data from industry consultancy SunWiz showing 45% of South Australian dwellings host solar power systems, rooftop PV is the largest generator in the state but most systems are not currently equipped to communicate directly to a network or respond to market signals.
SAPN said it will work with Simply Energy and AGL to change that, with the retailers to develop and trial new incentives that reward customers for enabling their existing rooftop solar systems to be responsive to wholesale energy market pricing.
The trial, backed by $1.02 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), will focus on two new technical options for the integration of retailer signals with distribution network service provider’s dynamic operating envelops in order to reduce the load on the grid during busy periods, lowering peak demand and moving energy loads to when there are high amounts of renewable energy.
AGL and Simply Energy will each demonstrate and test the commercial application of two respective technical models. By developing a retail product and enrolling 50 customers each, they will provide incentives for customers for reducing their solar exports in response to market price signals.
The project will test the market design and technical solutions, as well as address cyber security concerns. The ability for the two models to work concurrently allowing for alternate operational approaches by retailers will also be examined.
Mark Vincent, SAPN’s executive general manager of strategy and transformation, said a key focus of the project will be on helping inform design of the integration between these new customer offers and SAPN’s flexible export connections for rooftop solar.
The flexible export technology, which is to be progressively rolled out as a standard service offering from July 2023, requires all new solar systems to be capable of remotely updating their export limits – a capability that will be built into inverters.
South Australian rooftop solar owners can currently export 5 kW of electricity to the grid but the new inverter standards will give households the option to export up to 10 kW, in return for allowing the network operator to remotely curtail those export limits to manage grid stability.
“SA Power Networks has been working across the energy sector with inverter manufacturers, solar companies, energy retailers and regulators to develop a smart way to allow even more solar on our network so that everyone can benefit from the availability of cheaper daytime energy,” Vincent said.
“In the longer run, we are enthusiastic about how customers can benefit from actively participating in the energy market and assist in managing the peaks and troughs of demand.”
“This trial is a crucial step in understanding how we can take that next step.”
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the smart management of rooftop solar is a potential long-term solution to increasing amounts of renewable energy entering the market.
Miller indicated that if successful, the solutions developed during the South Australian trial could be adopted in other states in the NEM and potentially unlock wholesale market and network benefits.
“SA Power Networks’ project represents a small, but focused trial that will help inform the design of future mechanisms for the orchestration of rooftop solar PV as well as other customer owned energy assets,” he said.
“This will highlight how Australia’s growing solar PV capacity can be managed in a way that delivers state-wide benefits.”
AGL Chief Customer Officer Jo Egan said the company’s involvement in the project will allow it to explore how customers could be rewarded for enabling access to their solar system.
“Flexible export limits for distributed energy resources will be one way to manage constraints and optimise available capacity,” she said. “This will ultimately give customers new incentives and access to solutions that continue to decarbonise how we live.”
ARENA said the final details of the SAPN project are currently being developed and field trials are expected to commence later this year with the project expected to be completed November 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/13/australian-tech-helps-drive-mack-trucks-electric-transition/,"EV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 13, 2023",Australian tech helps drive Mack Trucks’ electric transition,"SEA Electric, founded in Australia in 2012 but now headquartered in the US, has partnered with Mack Trucks in a deal which will see it supply its all-electric drivetrain to power the manufacturer’s first on-highway electric model.
The five-year agreement will focus on the next generation of Mack’s medium-duty MD range. Specifically, the Mack MD6 and MD7 models will be equipped with SEA Electric’s SEA-Drive 120 and 180 power systems which utilise nickel manganese cobalt oxide lithium-ion batteries in 150 kWh or 240 kWh configurations to power the system’s permanent magnet synchronous motor and electric accessories.
The MD Electric will have a maximum 370km range in the 240 kWh configuration, while the 150 kWh models will have a 225km range. The trucks can be charged through AC or DC charging units, while regenerative braking helps extend the operating range.
SEA Electric founder and Chief Executive Officer and Founder Tony Fairweather said the partnership with Mack is the culmination of “more than a decade of research and development that has proven the SEA-Drive power-system around the world.”
“In testing, the SEA-Drive equipped Mack MD6 successfully completed a gruelling durability assessment, equivalent to more than 500,000 miles on one of the toughest and most challenging tracks,” he said.
“In the future, this agreement has the potential to see significant scale, which is very exciting for the industry as it transitions to a sustainable future.”
Mack Trucks Global President Martin Weissburg said the partnership signals an important step forward for medium-duty customers wanting to adopt zero-emissions technology in their fleets.
“This is another important step in our efforts to drive decarbonisation and a more sustainable future, and we plan to continue investing in technologies that help improve the environment and society,” he said.

With the European Commission’s keenly anticipated Net-Zero Industry Act set to be published on March. 14, the ways in which aspirant and exiting European manufacturers can be supported was a central theme of presentations and panel discussions at the 2023’s SolarPower Summit in Brussels. While the Net-Zero act looks likely to introduce domestic content provisions for the public procurement of solar, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria could also be applied in policy measurers to support European solar producers.
That fostering European solar manufacturing is an urgent necessity in terms of securing long-term energy security was oft-repeated theme during discussions at the summit.
International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol was unequivocal in his advocacy for a substantial expansion in European solar making. He made the call at the SolarPower Summit’s plenary session.
“It is time for Europe to look at the manufacturing of solar,” said Birol, before adding that despite the region’s urgent need to install PV it will remain an importer of solar technology, but that “Europe can have a share.”
“20 years ago, Europe started solar manufacturing,” noted Fatih, likening the solar production race as being a marathon, in which Europe excelled over the race’s first quarter. “But no one wins the gold medal after the first 10km. It is important for Europe to come with incentives, regulatory and financial instruments [to support solar manufacturing].”
It is far from the first time that the case for European PV manufacturing, on the grounds of energy security, has been made. The European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson famously said that the European Commission would do “whatever it takes” to support manufacturing efforts at the SolarPower Summit in 2022.
Simson addressed summit attendees again this year, where she said switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy “should not mean replacing one dependence with another.” As such, the commissioner added: “Europe needs to up its game and diversify its supply. We have achieved a lot, but the work is not done yet. The Commission will be by your side every step of the way.”
European policymakers had strengthened the EU Solar Industry Alliance, Simson noted, with an aim to achieve 30 GW of PV module production capacity by 2025 – including upstream components such as ingots, wafers, and cells. She added that solar manufacturing will be supported under the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan.
The European Commission opened the way for additional support during the SolarPower Summit with European Union rules regarding the state aid for industry being relaxed for solar and other clean technology producers.
The measures are a part of the European Commission’s Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework and it appears to be a positive development that will allow EU member governments to provide financial support to prospective and existing manufacturers.
Difficult to access
However, there was some criticism of existing EU support measures from solar manufacturers during the summit.
Both Meyer Burger and Enel Green Power are pursuing gigawatt-scale integrated cell and module manufacturing facilities in Germany and Italy respectively. However, these projects pale in comparison to massive new factories being developed in India, and the flurry of activity across the Atlantic in the United States. Both countries offer generous market protections and subsidy programs for manufacturers, including India’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt and Eliano Russo, the head of Enel’s 3Sun Gigafactory, acknowledged that their manufacturing projects were the beneficiaries of public funds.
Of the €600 million ($971 million) that has been invested in its 3Sun facility, Russo said that roughly one-third had come from public funds – from the EU Innovation Fund and Italian government grants. However, he added that it took a great deal of time and resources to access such funding.
“We are still in discussion to get financial close,” said Russo. “A company like Enel can surmount these challenges [but] all of these inefficiencies require a lot of attention.”
Meyer Burger’s Erfurt said that of the €340 million ($550 million) that the Swiss-based company had invested in its manufacturing operations, €35 million came in the form of regional-government grants – from the German states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. “But compared to China and the IRA it is a drop in the ocean,” he said.
Erfurt added that €15 million of the subsidies his company had received were by virtue of Meyer Burger having proven that its solar cell production is “the most environmentally friendly” technology. The company is producing silicon heterojunction (HJT) PV cells, which are thinner than standard crystalline silicon (c-Si) cells and use a lead-free cell metalisation and interconnection technology – the latter branded Smartwire by Meyer Burger in the company’s previous life as a solar production equipment supplier.
“We’ve been able to raise €850 million from the private sector,” in the form of capital investment and certified green convertible bonds. By contrast, Erfurt argued, “my observation is that the downstream industry isn’t ESG yet” and that they were deploying PV modules that were tainted with forced labor, that there was lead in the modules, and that some modules had a “very high carbon footprint.”
As simple as ESG
It is conceivable that ESG metrics and criteria could be used by policymakers to offer protection to European solar producers.
Christian Westermeier, from German polysilicon producer Wacker Chemie, said that while European “ecolabels” could be a helpful tool in distinguishing European solar products, he called for a standardisation of labelling initiatives.
“Europe has set the benchmark for ESG and for solar it’s an obligation to follow ESG rules”, said Westermeier. “Such a label could give orientation for consumers and investors and create a level playing field for the goods that we are producing in Europe.”
This is a message to Brussels that is shared by German inverter producer SMA. The company is in the process of doubling its production capacity and doesn’t see a reason to stop there. “All we are asking for is a level playing field,” says Katharina Eickelberg, who heads communications and sustainability at SMA. “We are ready to start.”
SolarPower Europe reports that the “sold out” SolarPower Summit attracted over 350 attendees.
