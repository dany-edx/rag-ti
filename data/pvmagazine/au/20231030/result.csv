The technology is vital for testing performance at various points in the solar asset lifecycle: at solar farm commissioning, when it provides a useful baseline; for identifying underperformance before the end of the panel defect liability period; for subsequently verifying to insurers the damage caused by severe weather events; and for verifying performance at any change of ownership of the farm. And of course it pinpoints problems, assists in targeting maintenance and reduces risks such as fire due to faulty panels, throughout the life of the asset.
QE-Labs is a commercial spin-out of technology developed at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), part of the National University of Singapore.

“Our team spent a decade researching PV panel technologies, doing indoor testing, and certifying performance and reliability of panels in our tropical Singapore environment,” QE-Labs CEO, Dr Yan Wang, told pv magazine Australia at All-Energy in Melbourne last week. “Then developers who were experiencing yield losses started sending us modules from their solar farms for testing.”
It wasn’t long, says Wang, before all parties realised that this method of bringing panels to the lab was too laborious and time-consuming, which also made it expensive — “the unit price was too high”.
And as McCann points out, the sampling method of nailing underperforming culprits across an entire solar farm was like, “Looking for a needle in a haystack.”
Researchers at SERIS realised that electroluminescence (EL) imaging — their preferred inspection technology, which “produces something like an x-ray of the solar panel”, explains Wang — could be taken into the field. But how much better would it be, if imaging didn’t have to be set up for each panel?
McIntosh and McCann, working in their Australian lab to assess the performance of panels in the Australian utility solar sector had come to a similar conclusion: “We knew that drones would revolutionise the way we gather data, and if they could be used to take electroluminescence images, we’d be able to bring huge scale to helping asset owners assess the condition of their solar farms,” McIntosh told pv magazine Australia.
He and McCann had just decided that developing their own autonomous EL system would not be “commercially smart”, when they were introduced by solar colleagues in Germany to QE-Labs. “It’s a really good fit,” says McCann of the resulting collaboration: “They’ve got the drones and the tech, and we’ve got the site experience and the ability to fly and work in Australia.”
McIntosh became a licensed commercial drone pilot and began PV Lab’s fly-by-night operation. That is to say, another benefit of electroluminescence imaging is that it is carried out in the dark, out of solar-generation hours.
QE-Labs’ innovation includes:
1) Integration of a specialised InGaAs fast-image-capture camera with a custom-built long-flight-duration drone, and development of software that compensates for flight wobble, and keeps the drone adjusting to accomplish its mission of capturing a complete image of each panel even if it gets blown off course by wind.
2) Application of AI and quantitative analysis algorithms to sift for anomalies in the tens of thousands of images generated.
3) A user-friendly interface — an app — that allows asset owners to hunt down specific faults such as cracks, faulty solar cells and corrosion. Integrated GPS guides users to the exact faulty panel(s). Inbuilt machine learning also identifies user preferences in the sense that some operators may consider some faults more important to repair than others; a green-amber-red traffic light system indicates performance glitches of low to high importance to individual operators.

Among other test cases, in late 2021 QE-Labs completed the world’s largest drone electroluminescence inspection, of 60MWp Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm, on Tengeh Reservoir in Singapore. Over two weeks of night shift, it covered a total area of some 45 football fields.
At the time, Head of Operations and Maintenance at Sembcorp, Willie Soh, praised the accuracy of QE-Labs’ work and its “ability to rapidly pinpoint defects in our PV modules, which could have been caused from a variety of factors”. He said Sembcorp would continue to use the drone-mounted technology to ensure that its “PV system is running in optimal condition at all times”. The Sembcorp inspections were successfully carried out despite the solar farm being surrounded by public infrastructure that strictly bans the taking of images – negotiating approvals and proving QE-Labs’ best-practice use of high accuracy technology were key to this process.
In Australia, PV Lab was keen to prove the efficacy of the QE-Labs platform with a solar farm using an inline fuse system. Says McIntosh, “Inline fuse farms are becoming increasingly popular in Australia and elsewhere, and we wanted to demonstrate the technology would work in that context. So we developed a kind of new logistical solution to actually image each individual string.”
The inspection was of a 45,000-module solar plant at the end of its defect liability period. Although the facility wants to remain anonymous, the plant operations and asset manager said, “The ability of drone EL mapping to accurately pinpoint problematic modules is a game changer for us,” allowing the operator to selectively replace “worst-performing modules wherever they are in the plant”, which results in “significant improvement of the overall system performance”, and maximises energy output.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/30/new-market-player-snaps-up-370-mwh-victorian-battery-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,ITALY,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",New market player snaps up 370 MWh Victorian battery project,"Sostoneo, launched only last month by Italy-headquartered insurance and asset management provider Generali Group, has acquired 100% of the $400 million (USD 254 million) Koorgangie Energy Storage System (KESS) project being developed near Kerang in Victoria by Edify Energy.
The 185 MW/370 MWh Koorgangie project, being built within the planned Murray River Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), is supported by a 15-year term offtake agreement with Shell Energy and includes a 20-year system support agreement with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for the provision of system strength.
Developed and structured by Sydney-headquartered Edify and due to begin operations in early 2025, the KESS will utilise Tesla Megapacks, equipped with grid-forming inverters that operate in ‘virtual machine mode’.
Edify founder and Chief Executive Officer John Cole said this will allow the battery energy storage system to operate in a manner akin to a conventional generator and provide crucial system strength services to increase the renewable hosting capacity of the Murray River REZ.
“We love the fantasticness of KESS,” Cole said, noting “it’s ability to provide system strength services to AEMO while not compromising on its ability to perform in the energy market for the benefit of Victorian electricity consumers and providing a path to a 100% renewable electricity future.”
The KESS project is the first investment in Australia for Sosteneo following its launch last month.
The company, which includes former Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) CEO Ivor Frischknecht, and Umberto Tamburrino, formerly at Elliott Green Power, among its team, said the project forms part of its plan to grow a clean energy portfolio spanning Australia, New Zealand and Europe.
Frischknecht, managing partner and chief investment officer for Sosteneo in the Asia Pacific, said the KESS project delivers on the company’s strategy of investing in greenfield infrastructure projects that produce or enable clean energy use and accelerate the transition to net zero.
“With revenues secured through long-term agreements with Shell Energy and AEMO, the KESS project is well-aligned with our objective of delivering stable commercial returns to clients whilst making an active contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy system,” he said.
While the KESS project has long-term deals in place with Shell and AEMO, it will benefit from part of a $480 million investment the Victorian government is making through its Renewable Energy Zone Fund in 12 projects to address capacity constraints and strengthen and modernise the state’s grid.
The project will also contribute to Victoria’s drive to meet legislated energy storage targets of at least 2.6 GW of storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 GW by 2035.

Headquartered on the New South Wales Central Coast, Star Scientific formalised the announcement by signing a letter of intent with the New Mexico state government.
Star Scientific global group chairman Andrew Horvath said the document commits the company to an intensive process to secure a suitable site in Albuquerque where it plans to invest $100 million to create a sprawling research and manufacturing complex.
“The facility in New Mexico will mirror the facility we will build in Australia, and it will service customers in the United States, Canada and, initially South America,” Horvath said. “We will be developing GHG-free process-heat systems for industry and stand-alone power systems while continuing research on other projects.”
Star Scientific, which has an 8,500 square metre research and development facility in Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast and another office in Switzerland, is seeking to advance the rollout of its HERO technology, a coating substance which can be applied to ceramics or certain metals and which, upon contact with hydrogen and oxygen, increases in temperature from zero to above 700 degrees Celsius in three minutes.
Hovath said the technology can be used for off-grid power, desalination, and heavy industrial production where high temperatures are needed.
“Because it’s not burning, it’s a reaction, all that energy is excitement energy and it goes straight through the substrate. So our energy transfer is above 90% into whatever you’re transferring it to, whether it’s water, CO2, whatever medium,” he said.
“HERO allows us to make saturated steam for energy production, or in fact any sort of heat-driven energy production – be it in industry, be it in food or be it in mass energy production.”
Star Scientific said it is looking to acquire about 20 hectares in Albuquerque where it plans to construct up to 10 buildings for administration, design, testing, manufacturing as well as laboratory research.
The company expects to employ about 200 people at the facility and is currently in negotiations with the New Mexico Economic Development Department for an incentive package that would include assistance from the Job-Creation Fund under the Local Economic Development Act, as well as assistance for job training.
Horvath said he is hopeful the company can break ground in New Mexico in late 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/30/rooftop-solar-share-rises-to-new-high-in-nem/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Rooftop solar share rises to new high in NEM,"Data from GPE NEMLog shows that rooftop solar contributed a record 48.8% share of generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) at 1.25pm on Sunday, surpassing the previous record of 48.4% set on the first day of this month.
Record shares of rooftop solar were also set on Sunday in Victoria, where rooftop PV reached a new high of 60.1% at 12.50pm. Likewise, New South Wales (NSW) also recorded a new high with rooftop solar contributing more than half of its generation for the first time, achieving a record share of 50.5% at 11.45am.
Geoff Eldridge, data analyst at GPE NEMLog, said each record represented a 3% increase from previous figures.
The surge in rooftop PV contributions led to record-low operational demands in both Victoria and NSW, and across the NEM more broadly.
In Victoria, operational demand dropped to a new minimum of 1,915 MW, a decrease of approximately 153 MW from the previous low. In NSW, the largest state grid in the country, operational demand fell to 3,719 MW, down 272 MW from the previous low.
Across the NEM, operating demand plummeted to a new low of 11,009 MW, a decrease of approximately 215 MW from the previous record low set on 1 October 2023.
The surge in rooftop solar and the resultant reduction in overall demand had a flow-on effect for utility scale solar projects. In South Australia, utility scale solar output fell to less than 1 MW during peak solar production as a record 455.8 MW of utility scale solar was curtailed.
The new records are the latest in a string of renewable energy share records in the grid this spring.
On October 24, the share of renewables across the NEM hit a new instantaneous renewable penetration record of 72.5%. At that time, rooftop solar supplied 41.5% of total electricity generated.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/30/strategies-to-develop-solar-neighborhoods/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 30, 2023",Strategies to develop ‘solar neighborhoods’,"An international group of scientists have devised strategies to develop and build what they call “solar neighborhoods.”
In a recently published academic paper, the researchers defined these neighborhoods as virtual entities that use stored datasets of monitored solar and energy variables. This includes solar energy production, solar energy gains, solar energy potential, level of illuminance and sunlight exposure with specific decision-making tools. “A solar neighborhood is primarily a neighborhood, hence an urbanized area either with a single function or with a mix of human activities and, in which the full and optimal exploitation of the sun is prioritized,” the paper said.
“The article aims to identify the existing barriers and challenges in solar energy planning and to present the most common strategies, methods, and approaches for solar neighborhood planning and design through the insights from developers, architects, consultants, researchers, urban planners, municipalities, and other institutions,” the researchers said.
The future development of such neighborhoods is dependent on enhanced research on several topics, the paper adds. Topics include the ability to create more reliable and detailed digital twins of buildings and cities, as well as digital simulations that allow for better assessments of neighborhoods before breaking ground.
“Many aspects are expected to be facilitated in the years to come by a broader digitalization of the building environment, supported by an extensive application of the Internet of Things (IoT), co-simulation approaches, advanced computer, and orchestration of real monitored data,” the paper said. “The combination of high level of detail (LoD) models of urban surfaces and high-resolution data can pave the way for digital twin platforms to conduct real-time solar analysis with multiple goals.”
To combat this, scientists have heightened the need to implement high LoD models for vegetation elements, urban furniture and architectural features of buildings and neighborhoods. They also highlighted the need to implement the dynamic behavior of the environment – such as snow reflection – into the simulations.
The researchers called for developing simulations for emerging surface treatments and technologies. This includes electrochromic windows, retroreflective coatings and thermochromic substrates. “They have implications within the complex urban phenomena such as overshadowing effects and solar inter-building reflections,” the paper said.

The research group has also stressed in the paper the need for better aesthetic solutions to support the social acceptance of solar neighborhoods. They also recommend the development of business models for solar neighborhoods to ensure their long-term viability and the promotion of legal reforms to support these processes.
A legislative agenda supporting solar neighborhoods, they claim in the research, needs to include incentives and subsidies for the adoption of solar technologies, especially passive ones. It should also include regulations that will streamline the development and standardization of measurement and certificates. In addition, the research group highlighted the need for guidelines for architectural design that balances aesthetics with solar technology deployment and collaboration between local governments, businesses and communities.
The planning strategies were presented in the study “Ten questions concerning planning and design strategies for solar neighborhoods,” published in Building and Environment. As its headline suggests, it deals with 10 different aspects of solar neighborhood development.
The research team comprises scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the University of Savoy Mont Blanc, Italy’s Institute for Renewable Energy, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland, Concordia University, Lund University and the Australian PV Institute.
