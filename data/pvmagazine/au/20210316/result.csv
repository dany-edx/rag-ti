The agreement, which is effective until the end of the year, will see the two companies investigate applying LE System’s proprietary technology to Technology Metals Australia’s vanadium project. It will also explore manufacturing vanadium redox flow battery electrolyte in Western Australia, as well as selling high purity iron-vanadium concentrate to Japanese customers.
Technology Metals Australia’s (TMT) primary exploration focus is a project called the Gabanintha Vanadium Project (GVP), located 40 km south east of Meekatharra in the mid-west region of Western Australia. It seeks to develop a processing technique to produce high purity vanadium pentoxide, with the goal of becoming one of the world’s largest single primary vanadium producers, catering to the rapidly expanding flow battery market as well as steel markets.
In 2019, the company received a $2.7 million grant from the Australian Federal Government’s Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive Scheme which went towards its Gabanintha Project.
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are rechargeable flow batteries which use vanadium in different oxidation states to store energy. Far from a new technology, flow batteries have enjoyed a resurgence of attention as an energy storage solution driven by the fact VRFBs are non-flammable, offer virtually unlimited cycling without degradation and are easily scalable.

The agreement will see LE Systems apply its proprietary processing technology to extract vanadium and other metals from TMT’s Gabanintha Vanadium Project’s waste streams, a concept which the companies said they had been working on together “for some time.”
“Successful application of the proprietary processing technology to the GVP waste streams would provide LES with access to a low cost stable supply of vanadium products and provide Technology Metals with potential environmental management benefits, supporting the Company’s key objectives of sustainability and environmental responsibility,” the company’s ASX statement, published Monday, read.
A partnership with LE System, which is on track to becoming a key VRFB electrolyte provider, opens up new pathways for TMT’s downstream processing strategy. Specifically, the MoU will see the two companies investigate opportunities to use proprietary technology to manufacture VRFB electrolyte in Western Australia.
“With the necessity of large capacity storage batteries rapidly increasing, the successful technology collaboration and business cooperation between TMT and LE System are very important to us,” LE System Chief Executive Officer, Junichi Sato, said in the statement.
Under the MoU the parties have agreed to investigate the opportunity to jointly produce electrolyte for the VRFB market in Western Australia. While initially focused on the use of vanadium sourced from GVP waste streams, there is nonetheless potential to expand to using the high purity vanadium to be produced from the project.
“This opportunity would have scope to establish a significant downstream value adding industry designed to target what TMT sees as the rapidly emerging stationary storage battery market opportunities in Australia,” the statement reads.
The third aspect of the MoU is the two companies working together to scope the Japanese market with the hopes of selling high grade, high purity iron-vanadium concentrate.
The MoU will be effective until 31 December, 2021, with both parties to decide whether they plan to continue their partnership. The agreement was facilitated by negotiations by the Western Australian Governments’ Japan-based representative of the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation, with the company saying it will continue to working closely with Australian government agencies.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/16/woolworths-completes-commercial-scale-rooftop-solar-installation-at-sa-distribution-centre/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 16, 2021",Woolworths completes commercial-scale rooftop solar installation at SA distribution centre,"Woolworths’ newly-expanded Adelaide Regional Distribution Centre boasts a rooftop solar array comprised of 3,500 panels. Somewhat unusually, Woolworths have described the system as “1.6 MVA,” choosing to use megavolt amperes rather than noting the more conventional megawatt capacity.
First announced in 2019, $57 million upgrade to the supermarket’s South Australian distribution centre has seen it grow to the size to four Adelaide Ovals, totalling 94,000 square metres.
Woolworths Group told pv magazine Australia that the solar system was supplied and installed by Todae Solar and used Jinko JKM380M-72 PV modules. Florian Hess acted as a solar systems consultant, assisting the primary building contractors,  Hutchinson Builders, with the technical installation review, commissioning of the works and coordination with the Energy Regulator, South Australian Power Network. Bestec Consultants also assisted Woolworths with the design of the solar system.
The commercial-scale rooftop solar system at the site is “the largest solar installation in the Primary Connect network,” which is run by Woolworths. The company said the solar system will supply 20% of the sizeable centre’s electricity demand annually. Woolworths have not released any information on whether there are plans to integrate battery storage solutions at the site.
Last year, Woolworths announced it would switch to 100% renewable electricity by 2025, making it one of Australia’s largest corporations to make the RE100 pledge as the campaign reached new heights in 2020.
Woolworths is Australia’s sixth largest electricity user and its renewable energy commitment will drive around 880 MW worth of solar and wind projects. As of November 2020, the supermarket chain has installation solar systems at more than 150 of its locations nationally.

In July 2020, Woolworths converted 3,000 square metres of rooftop at its headquarters in Bella Vista, New South Wales into an urban solar farm, selecting the recently-acquired Epho to install a 572 kW, 1,400 panel solar system.
“As the operators of Australia’s largest retail supply chain, we want to help build a better tomorrow for generations to come,” Woolworths Group’s Primary Connect Managing Director, Paul Graham, said in a statement.
“We’ve made a multi-million dollar investment in renewable energy at this site with a massive solar installation, which is set to offset around 20 per cent of our annual energy needs.”

FFI, now chaired by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, has enormous renewable energy ambitions, particularly in green electricity for hydrogen and ammonia production. To that end, FFI realises that one of the best ways to demonstrate and create supply and demand of green hydrogen is to show how it can eliminate fossil fuels in a supply chain, starting with FMG. 
FMG Chairman and Australia’s richest man Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest said that the iron ore producer has “joined the global battle to defeat climate change. We are trialling and demonstrating green hydrogen technologies in global-scale commercial environments, while also rapidly evolving into a green hydrogen and electricity producer of similar scale.” 
FMG’s original decarbonisation commitment was to reach net zero operational emissions by 2040, including a 26% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from existing operations by 2030 relative to 2020 levels. That overall target has now been brought forward to 2030, with annual emissions data and reports provided annually. Significantly, FMG’s mining rivals, BHP and Rio Tinto, both have net zero targets set for 2050. 
“Our commitment to demonstrate green hydrogen’s economic value in world-scale operations,” continued Forrest, “and become a major energy exporter, while implementing the considerable facilities to support both, means that Fortescue has emerged not simply as a thought-leader and investor, but uniquely as an executor of major green hydrogen projects.” 
To this end, Forrest believes FFI can provide the two “missing links” in the battle against climate change, the demand and supply of green hydrogen. However, this does not mean the iron ore side of the business is being ignored, though Forrest admitted the “green energy initiatives may one day significantly outscale our iron ore business due to the global demand for renewable energy”.
According to FMG CEO Elizabeth Gaines, the ambitious decarbonisation of the company’s entire mobile fleet and fixed plant will be accomplished through “the next phase of hydrogen and battery electric energy solutions” across Australia including several key projects by 30 June 2021. These projects, which are in addition to FMG’s investment into renewable energy infrastructure such as the Chichester Solar Gas Hybrid Project and Pilbara Energy Connect, include: 
“Each of these projects will contribute to the world’s inexorable march to carbon neutrality,” Gaines continued, “Fortescue will establish that the major steel, truck, train, ship and mobile plant industries can be operated with renewable, environmentally friendly energy. This will be possible as a result of these ground-breaking Fortescue trials. Each will be tested by Fortescue using commercial-scale equipment to prove that the demand for direct green electricity, green hydrogen and green ammonia could one day be as large as the fossil fuel industry.” 
Forrest and his executives spent much of the pandemic on a private green journey, putting serious miles on the engine of the FMG jet in a four-month global effort to secure green energy partnerships. Now it looks like those miles are starting to pay off as projects take rapid shape. FMG has already agreed to partner South Korean steelmaker Posco in a cooperative green hydrogen business.

The deal will see Redflow supply a 2 MWh energy storage system made up of 192 zinc-bromine flow batteries to Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility (Facility) in San Bernardino County, California.
Anaergia’s COO Yaniv Scherson said the selection of Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow batteries was a no-brainer as they are “uniquely suited to meet the demands of the Rialto site.”
Anaergia recovers value from waste at its bioenergy facility which already comprises its own 2 MW biogas-fueled cogeneration microgrid. The Redflow system will help to reduce peak energy usage between 4-9pm and maximise the microgrid’s efficiency.
The storage is laid out via 12 “Energy Pods”, each of which contains 16 Redflow batteries linked to external inverters. With each battery storing approximately 10.5 KWh, the overall capacity should sit around 2 MWh.
Once the Facility is fully operational, it will be the biggest landfill diverted organic waste digester facility in North America, capable of converting 700 tonnes of organic waste from Los Angeles and Southern California daily, as well as 300 tonnes of biosolids into renewable natural gas and Class A fertiliser.
Redflow managing director and CEO Tim Harris said the Facility was an “ideal use case for Redflow zinc-bromine flow batteries. Our batteries thrive on heat and hard work – exactly what Anaergia requires from them. This project also enables Redflow to establish a presence in California, where we can offer commercially-proven zinc-bromine flow battery solutions to the broader Californian and US energy market. These markets are expected to accelerate the transition to renewable energy under the new administration of President Biden. We are very excited about the potential for Redflow in California and the broader US market.”
No doubt there will be many takers in California for Redflow’s energy storage system with a recent study by the California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) suggesting that the state will need 150 times more long-duration energy storage, between 45-55 GW, to reach its net-zero by 2045 target.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/16/arena-funds-upowrs-effort-to-improve-der-with-customer-insights/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 16, 2021",ARENA funds UPowr’s effort to improve DER with customer insights,"Distributed Energy Resources (DER) technology company UPowr Pty Ltd (UPowr) has landed a $446,000 grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) for a project designed to explore how consumer experience and feedback can be reconstituted into the design of DER orchestration initiatives.
DER orchestration programs are those which help make things like virtual power plants (VPPs) possible. The orchestrate distributed systems such as rooftop solar and storage via behind-the-meter assets for better efficiency and optimisation.
Upowr is using its own digital platform for DER orchestration in a $943,155 project open to rooftop solar customers in Victoria (VIC), New South Wales (NSW) and potentially Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA) who are interested in adding an energy storage system to their solar fit-out.
The project will then use behavioural science to follow participants with the ultimate aim of developing a customer segmentation framework for the tailoring of unique DER offerings. Based on how these participating customers interact with their systems, what value they get out of them, what they feel lacks and what insights they provide on the journey as a whole.
It is hoped that the trial will provide a strong business case for customer insights in the modelling and design of DER products and, ultimately, the more widespread uptake of DER products.
According to UPowr CEO and co-founder Stu Philpot, “residential solar has created challenges for the industry. But the way it’s currently being addressed – by reducing feed-in-tariffs, export limits and external ‘shut-down’ requirements, is not creating value for the customers who have installed solar.”
“Batteries that are part of an orchestration program,” continued Philpot, “optimised to do the right thing by the customer and the grid, can solve these challenges and still ensure that customers get value. Our challenge is to do more in making these programs aligned to customer values to encourage and incentivise more people to participate.”
UPowr CCO Kiya Taylor added that the industry needed to stop focusing on physical products and start focusing on the “problems we’re solving and the value we’re creating for each customer who might buy one of these products. This is an opportunity to reframe the value proposition, the words we use and the stories we tell as an industry.”
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said that knowledge of consumer preference is vital for the future design of DER initiatives like VPPs, especially in Australia, the world-leading market for rooftop solar penetration.
“Despite our record-breaking solar installations, only 73,000 household batteries have been installed alongside them to store solar energy and dispatch it later,” said Miller, and “It is estimated that only 10% of these batteries are controlled by energy providers including retailers, aggregators and networks who can optimise the charging and discharging of batteries, so it’s vital that we continue to find ways to incentivise customers to join these programs.”
“As DER will play an increasingly important role in our electricity grid,” Miller continued, “we need to put consumers at the centre as it is their behind-the-meter assets including rooftop solar, home batteries, electric vehicles, smart appliances and home energy management systems that will be crucial to scaling up VPPs and demand response.”
The trial, which begins in April 2021 and consists of three phases, is expected to last until February 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/16/an-aluminium-battery-that-can-charge-in-a-fraction-of-a-second/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,UNITED STATES",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 16, 2021",An aluminium battery that can charge in a fraction of a second,"From pv magazine Global.
Aluminium-ion batteries promise significant improvements over today’s lithium-ion technology. The ability to exchange three electrons per ion, compared to lithium’s one, brings the potential for higher storage capacity. Al-ion batteries could also rely on more cheap/abundant materials, avoiding many of the issues that continue to plague Li-ion supply chains.
Various challenges, in particular relating to the shelf-life of the batteries, have kept Al-ion confined to the laboratory for now. New research published in early 2021, however, represents a significant leap in performance for the technology. A battery capable of both high storage capacity and ultrafast charging could open new applications for energy storage, bridging the gap between a battery and a supercapacitor.
Scientists at China’s Dalian University of Technology and the University of Nebraska in the United States collaborated to fabricate a battery consisting of a pure aluminium anode, a graphene cathode, and an organic electrolyte. The batteries are described in the paper Ultra-fast charging in aluminium-ion batteries: electric double layers on active anode, published in Nature Communications.
Key to achieving this performance was an improved understanding of a mechanism known as ‘electric double layers’ – layers just a few nanometers thick which form at the interface between the metal electrode and electrolyte. By dipping the aluminium into Galinstan – a metal alloy that is liquid at room temperature – the group increased the surface energy of the anode allowing more aluminium ions to tunnel through the electric double layers.
With this approach, the group could demonstrate a battery with a 200 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g-1) capacity, which they claim is a jump forward from the previous record of 120 mAh/g-1 for an Al-ion battery. The battery could also charge at a rate of 104 C – meaning a duration of 0.35 seconds to reach the full capacity at 1000 A g−1.
The group notes that these performance figures denote a device that “eliminates the gap between a supercapacitor and a battery.” And they plan to continue working on understanding more of the specifics of how their anode works, as well as exploring combinations with different cathode materials. Ultimately, they envisage applications in emergency backup power, for example, “energy backup for electric buses that are running between stations, restart a suddenly stopped elevator, or even to minimise the power-off-induced loss in manufacturing or production lines.”
