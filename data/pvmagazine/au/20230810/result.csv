Jamie Cullen, chief executive officer of Perth-based Pacific Energy, said the new 17.9 MW Tuckabianna power plant replaces the existing diesel-fired power station and is the first of four new hybrid facilities being developed for Westgold.
“Tuckabianna is part of a larger project to consolidate six existing power stations into four high-efficiency hybrid power stations that incorporate gas, solar and battery storage systems,” he said.
“Collectively this represents one of the largest fully integrated hybrid power systems in the Australian mining sector.”
The other three power facilities at Westgold’s Bluebird, Fortnum, and Big Bell mining sites are scheduled to be installed and operational by the third quarter of 2024.

With a combined capacity of 82 MW, including nearly 30 MW of solar and 11.4 MW of battery storage, the new facilities are expected to collectively save 38 million litres of diesel per annum and lower annual carbon emissions by about 57,000 tonnes.
Westgold Managing Director Wayne Bramwell said the new power plants, which he expects will drive down operating costs, are at the heart of the company’s clean energy transition initiative.
“This new hybrid power facility at Tuckabianna incorporates renewable energy and is a great first step along this journey, with power generated from these facilities energising our mines and processing hubs for decades to come,” he said.
The solar farms, battery storage and gas-fired power stations will be owned and operated by Pacific Energy under an electricity purchase agreement. The gas will be provided by Clean Energy Fuels Australia (CEFA) under an supply agreement.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/10/switch-to-all-electric-tipped-to-save-households-4320-a-year/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 10, 2023","Switch to all electric tipped to save households $4,320 a year","A new report from Energy Consumers Australia (ECA) highlights that the households set to benefit the most from the transition from an energy mix dominated by fossil fuels to renewable energy will be those that electrify their heating, cooking and transport and have energy efficient homes while those who remain on fossil fuels will face escalating bills.
The Stepping Up report, based on modelling by the CSIRO and consultancy Dynamic Analysis, shows that by 2030 the average difference in total energy costs, including transport, between a typical fossil-fuelled home and an all-electric home in the National Electricity Market (NEM) will be about $2,250 (USD 1,470) per year. Households that install rooftop solar and a battery will make additional savings.
The ECA said by 2030, a fossil-fuelled household’s average annual fuel costs would be $11,110 while a household that quits gas appliances and switches to electric vehicles (EVs) would spend $8,860 per year. Installing solar and a battery would provide an additional $1,250 in annual savings. The report authors said the savings are annual averages over the 20-year lives of appliances, vehicles, solar panels and batteries installed in the years specified.
By 2050 the difference in annual energy expenditure between a fossil-fuelled household and an all-electric household is $2,850 per year plus an extra $1,470 in savings if rooftop solar and battery energy storage is installed.

While welcoming the projected financial benefits of electrification, ECA Interim Chief Executive Officer Jacqueline Crawshaw said the report highlights that some low-income households, renters and apartment dwellers may struggle to access these savings.
“Our research shows there are savings for consumers after they go all-electric, but there are costs and other barriers that make it difficult for some people to do so,” she said, adding that “households that face barriers to electrifying their homes need support.”
“We need to make sure that no-one is left behind in Australia’s energy future and that the last households to electrify are the ones that choose to wait, not those who couldn’t afford to,” she said.
The ECA is calling for a new national partnership of all three levels of government to coordinate the energy transition for consumers.
Crawshaw said support for households will require a combination of information to enable consumer choice and agency in deciding the electrification path that is right for them, and funding or financing options to help meet the upfront costs.
“There needs to be a clear national plan for households to go all-electric that gives people the information they need to make the transition, provides them with funding and support, and identifies the policy changes needed to ensure no one gets left behind in Australia’s energy future,” she said.
“Households make up nearly 25% of energy usage in Australia. The energy transition is not just about wind turbines and solar farms – it’s about cars, hot water systems and stovetops.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/10/battery-capacity-overtakes-pumped-hydro-in-nem/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Battery capacity overtakes pumped hydro in NEM,"Data published by Rystad Energy Senior Analyst David Dixon shows the operational charging capacity from utility batteries in the National Electricity Market (NEM) now stands at 1,451 MW, outstripping the 1,340 MW attributed to pumped hydro.
The ascension of grid-scale batteries comes after the energisation of Genex Power’s 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe Big Battery project near Rockhampton in Queensland and French developer Neoen’s 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery in the Australian Capital Territory. Both projects are now working through the commissioning stages.
The batteries are the latest in a slew of big battery projects to connect to the NEM in recent months. These include French renewables giant Engie’s 150 MW/150 MWh Hazelwood battery in Victoria, and the 250 MW/250 MWh Torrens Island and 41 MW/412 MWh Tailem Bend batteries in South Australia. Edify Energy’s Riverina Energy Storage System, a project combining three separate battery facilities totalling 150 MW/300 MWh in New South Wales (NSW), has also been energised.

Dixon said he expects the gap between battery storage capacity and pumped hydro to increase further over the next few years with “several more utility battery projects expected to enter the market.”
“By 2026 the operational capacity of utility batteries in the NEM will be greater than 6 GW,” he said.
Among those projects set to enter the market are Akaysha Energy’s 850 MW/1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery project, and the 460 MW/920 WMh first stage of Origin Energy’s planned 700 MW/2,800 MWh Eraring Battery, both in NSW.
Neoen is also continuing to grow its energy storage portfolio, having commenced construction of the 200 MW/400 MWh Blyth Battery storage system in South Australia and the 200 MW/400 MWh Western Downs Battery in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/10/breaking-through-status-quo-bias-with-co-designed-solar-power-plants/,"MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",BERNADETTE GEYER,"AUGUST 10, 2023",Breaking through ‘status quo bias’ with co-designed solar power plants,"A study by a group of researchers from the Netherlands has found that participation and input from local stakeholders in the development of solar power plants may have a noticeable positive influence on the local acceptance of the facilities.
The team assessed how “status quo bias” – when people resist any change to their environments – is potentially the main barrier to the transition to clean energies and how PV plant projects can overcome that bias, which is typically not based on scientific or technical grounds.
“The current approach to developing renewable energy projects often faces local opposition and has been said to increase injustice,” the researchers stressed. “One way of addressing procedural justice is to include local stakeholders in the design process. However, it can be difficult for lay audiences to understand the technical complexities of solar power plants.”
To counter the resistance of local citizens with a “Not in My Back Yard” (NIMBY) attitude, the study built on the results of a research project called “In My Backyard Please.” For the new study, the selection of a use case project considered seven factors: a Dutch location, relevance, design opportunities, landscape user experience, possible local resistance, stage of development, and willingness of local stakeholders to cooperate.
In consultation with project partners, the researchers selected a use case in Nauerna, in the northern part of the Netherlands, which they claim “showed potential due to the presence of an invested community that, on one side, wanted to work on a solar power plant, but on the other, showed some signs of resistance to landscape transformation.”
They conducted interviews to gauge the “level of place attachment” of local stakeholders and then carried out a landscape analysis to map the area’s energy potential. Two co-design sessions were organised in March 2020, and participants were invited to share their own ideas for how the solar installation would be designed.
Project partners then used these ideas to develop three design concepts and to create a full-scale prototype that showed different construction options on the site of a landfill. The researchers then conducted interviews with 21 inhabitants from the 92 resident households to assess not only feedback on the prototype but also potential change in community attitudes and support for solar plant development, along with “the value of using a full-scale prototype to visualize design ideas in the context of a participatory design process.”
“The majority of participants (85.7%) reported that the full-scale prototype provided them with more insight into the impact and design possibilities of a solar power plant at the selected location,” the study notes, noting that 81% of the participants said “the prototype positively influenced their opinions,” with the same percentage responding positively to a question about the construction of the solar plant in their proximity.
The academics said their findings show the importance of the participation of local stakeholders early on in the process of gaining acceptance for the development of solar power plant projects. They said that designers need to take into account status quo bias when co-designing SPPs.
The study did, however, also find that inhabitants who would have a direct view of the project tended to respond more negatively to the design. Those who would have a direct view of the site from their living rooms responded negatively when asked if they would want the project to be built in their backyard.
The findings of the research are available in the paper “Seeing is believing, experiencing is knowing: The influence of a co-designed prototype solar power plant on local acceptance,” which was published in Solar Energy. The authors include researchers from Wageningen University and Research, and the project was supported with funding from the Dutch Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO), within the TKI Urban Energy program.
“Our results suggest that local commitment to the development and support of a solar power plant can be strengthened by ‘possibilities to participate’, the opportunity ‘to affect outcomes’, and to co-design a solar power plant that considers the wishes of local communities,” the academics concluded.
