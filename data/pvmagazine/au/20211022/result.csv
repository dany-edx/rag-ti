Ergon said the MIST Facility, the first large-scale facility of its kind in Queensland, is designed to advance the development and uptake of new technologies for power generation and electricity distribution supply by leveraging state-of-the-art equipment and testing capability.
The complex has been fitted with cutting-edge technology which will enable the testing of a wide range of renewable energy solutions, including community-scale solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS), microgrids and stand-alone power systems (SPS), to ensure they can be seamlessly integrated into the electricity network or used as off-grid alternatives.
Ergon’s Intelligent Grid New Technology manager Michelle Taylor said the facility, which houses a super-computer capable of complex testing of large-scale systems of up to 1 MW, would play a key role in advancing renewables and the successful integration of new technology into the electricity network.
“Cairns is now home to one of the most sophisticated research and development hubs of its kind in Australia, with state-of-the-art technology and the technical expertise to do complex testing of community-scale solar and batteries, microgrids and standalone power systems (SPS),” she said.
“This is a world-class facility with potential benefits for everyone in the power supply chain, from electricity distribution networks and product developers to the end users and academic researchers.”
Ergon said the new MIST Facility will incorporate and build on the success of the network operator’s Innovation Lab launched in Cairns in 2016, where testing of solar PV systems and battery storage has assisted the development of national safety standards for residential solar PV systems and batteries and an intelligent grid.

Egron’s principal engineer technology innovation Alan Louis said the new MIST Facility meant they are now armed with the tools to think even bigger.
Louis said the facility’s super-computer allows for real-time digital simulation and a large array of connection options. It will be used to simulate and model more efficient, resilient and reliable options to supply electricity to remote communities and customers on the fringes of the grid across Queensland.
“Testing technology in simulated conditions before you deploy it saves times and money, especially when we’re talking about remote communities where we want to integrate more renewables to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels for financial and environmental reasons,” he said.
“In this facility we can test the standard diesel generating sets that are part of our traditional isolated networks and improve interactions with solar installations and battery storage systems.
“As the world moves away from fossil fuels and embraces alternative energy solutions, we’re working to ensure Queenslanders stay ahead of the curve.”
Louis said the facility will help new technologies connect to the NEM without impacting the security of the network or quality of supply.
“With a facility of this calibre, we can prepare customers, communities and our workforce for the future,” he said.

The unveiling of the MIST Facility comes just weeks after the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced the launch of a $50 million funding program to support microgrid pilot projects across regional Australia.
The new grant funding will seek to build on the success of transitioning a number of remote and island energy systems to renewables, including systems on Lord Howe, Flinders and Rottnest islands.
The grant funding under the new Regional Australia Microgrid Pilots Program – or RAMPP – will be allocated in two stages, an initial $30 million through to 2022 and a further $20 million through to 2023.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said he expected the program would showcase the benefits of microgrids, “whether it’s maintaining electricity supply during and after emergencies such as bushfires and floods, or improving the reliability and security of power supply in remote communities.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/22/rooftop-solar-sparks-record-decline-in-wholesale-power-prices/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 22, 2021",Rooftop solar sparks record decline in wholesale power prices,"A new report released by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) reveals that renewable energy generation, including rooftop solar PV and grid-scale variable renewable generation (VRE) supplied more than 60% of the underlying demand in the National Electricity Market (NEM) during a half-hour period in September, helping deliver a dramatic decline in wholesale electricity prices.
In the latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report, which covers the period 1 July to 30 September, AEMO says the penetration of renewables, including grid-scale wind and solar, hydro, battery discharge, and distributed PV reached a record high during a half-hour period on the afternoon of September 24, supplying 61.4% of total electricity generated in the NEM.
Rooftop solar dominated the mix, accounting for 31% of total generation, followed by wind and grid-scale solar at 28%.

The previous renewable energy generation record of 55.2%, set in Q2 2021, was successively increased several times during the quarter while the average renewables share for the quarter reached 31.7% of total generation, surpassing the previous record (29.7%) set in Q4 2020.
AEMO said the continued uptake of distributed PV and growth in grid-scale VRE across the NEM had provided several other new highs for renewable output.
Grid-scale VRE generation averaged 3,984 MW for the quarter, an increase of 828 MW on the same time last year, the highest quarter-on-quarter increase on record.
Large-scale solar output also set a new output record, contributing 3,884 MW of underlying demand on 8 September, 462 MW higher than the previous record set in Q1 2021.
The situation was similar in Western Australia’s Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) where renewables also reached new heights. Renewable generation supplied a record 70% of the underlying demand on September 7. Across the quarter, approximately 25% of underlying demand was met by renewable generation, an increase of more than 4% compared to Q3 last year.
AEMO said renewable output had been boosted by commissioning and ramping up of new wind and solar generation over the seasonally windy quarter, higher distributed PV (+341 MW on average) combined with higher rainfall driving increased hydro output from Tasmania.
AEMO chief markets officer Violette Mouchaileh said the increase in renewable energy supply, combined with a reduction in demand due to mild weather during August and Covid-19 restrictions, had put downward pressure on electricity prices in the NEM.

Negative spot price occurrence was mainly confined to middle of the day, with some overnight
increases in the southern states.Across the quarter, 16% of NEM trading intervals were zero or negative, more than double the previous record of 7% in Q4 2020.
Mainland NEM prices averaged $37/MWh during September, resulting in a quarterly average of $66/MWh, down from $95/MWh in the previous quarter but still above Q3 2020’s $42/MWh.
In Victoria, where households and businesses have only just exited an extended period of Covid-induced lockdown measures, average spot prices between 10am and 3.30pm fell from $30/MWh in Q3 2020 to just $0.01/MWh during August and September.
This comes after South Australia achieved average daytime prices below zero consistently between 10am and 3,30pm during the March 2021 quarter, the first time in the NEM’s history.
“The continued growth in distributed PV pushed minimum operational demand levels to record lows,” Mouchaileh said.
“In New South Wales (NSW), minimum demand from the grid fell to 4,872 MW, the lowest level since Q1 2000, while South Australia’s minimum demand record fell by 21% to 236 MW.”
The occurrence of negative spot prices was up across the entire NEM, with records set in all regions including NSW where negative prices have been rare (Figure 17).
AEMO said increased periods of low midday demand due to distributed PV coupled with high grid-scale solar output were key drivers of the record number of negative price intervals which increased substantially across all regions.
The largest increase was in the southern regions, with South Australian spot prices negative 25% of the time, followed by Victoria (21%) and Tasmania (19%). In Queensland and NSW, negative spot price occurrence was also up but at much lower levels of 10% and 5%, respectively.
“This trend of falling prices through the quarter was in sharp contrast to international energy prices for LNG and coal which continued to rise throughout the quarter reaching record levels,” Mouchaileh said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/22/lg-launches-hybrid-inverter-for-residential-battery-range/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 22, 2021",LG launches hybrid inverter for residential battery range,"South Korean battery manufacturer LG Energy Solution has launched a new inverter in the Australian market, adding a 5 kW hybrid inverter to its Residential Energy Storage Unit (RESU) Home battery energy storage range.
LG Energy Solution said the new LGES-5048 hybrid inverter would be available in Australia from November, describing it as a highly efficient AC-coupled or DC-coupled unit that when coupled with a battery can deliver back-up power and keep essential appliances running during grid interruptions or power outages.
LG said the hybrid inverter is designed for either new solar and storage installations, or to add storage to an existing solar system. The company said the RESU Home battery and LGES-5048 inverter pairing allows up to 7.5 kW of solar PV capacity for new systems and up to 7.5 kW expansion of existing solar PV systems, including those installed on three-phase power.
The company said the inverter, which measures 516mm x 440mm x 184mm and weighs in at 30kg and has 97% efficiency, and max voltage of 580 W DC. It has an operating temperature range of -25~60°, fan-less design, low noise emission and comes with a 10-year warranty. Customers also have the option to add automated remote control, such as with Virtual Power Plant (VPP) participation.

The LGES-5048 is designed to fit with LG’s RESU Home range of lithium-ion residential battery energy storage solutions which includes the RESU6.5 (6.5 kWh), RESU10 (9.8kWh), RESU12 (11.7 kWh) and RESU13 (12.4 kWh) versions with each inverter able to connect up to two battery units.
LG Energy Solution residential general manager Philip Crotty said the range of battery and inverter pairing capacities allows system designs to be tailored to each household’s unique requirements, catering for a “clear trend” towards larger solar PV systems backed by battery storage as solar feed-in tariffs are reduced or eliminated.
“Exporting excess solar power is increasingly disallowed in some regions with high solar penetration and excess solar power is simply of higher value to the consumer than it is to the utilities,” he said.
“These changes reduce the value proposition for solar PV-only and increase the value proposition of solar PV plus battery storage.”
Crotty said there is a growing demand for home batteries with more than half of existing home battery users looking to scale up their energy capacity for increased energy resiliency.
He said the Covid-19 pandemic had contributed to the rise in residential demand, having triggered a worldwide stay home and work from home culture, with indoor activities like video conferencing, streaming, chatting and gaming increasing in popularity.
“There is a trend towards larger capacity batteries and customers who want to leave open the possibility of expanding their batteries in the future,” he said.
“This is particularly notable for those who have already experienced the benefits of having batteries and want even more flexibility in their power system.”
