Rewiring Australia, the work of Australian-American entrepreneur, scientist and energy analyst Dr Saul Griffith, has released modelling that outlines how households and communities can financially benefit from replacing fossil-fuelled devices with solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, induction stoves, electric vehicles (EVs) and household and community batteries.
The modelling, set to be publicly released by Griffith during an online webinar tonight, shows the full electrification of households across greater Brisbane by 2030 would save the average household $4,700 per year in energy and vehicle costs, totalling $3.9 billion across all households.
Rewiring Australia said in addition to the cost savings, the economic flow-on effects across the region could spark the indirect creation of up to 24,100 new jobs with an estimated $200 million to be spent upgrading homes, installing zero emission appliances, solar and EV chargers.

While acknowledging the inevitable upfront costs, Rewiring Australia founder and chief scientist Griffith said households making the jump to solar, storage and EVs would provide a massive economic boost to greater Brisbane.
“Our research shows that Australia can lead the world by electrifying our homes and vehicles and powering them with renewable energy,” he said.
“If we make the necessary investment to seize the future it will look like more jobs for tradies, more money spent in local shops, cleaner air and healthier people.
“At the moment, $3.3 billion is being drained from the greater Brisbane economy and winding up in the pocket of those who peddle fossil fuels. If we electrify and decarbonise we keep that money in the local community and make the world cleaner and safer.”
Rewiring Australia said the first step in the electrification process would be to install solar, or “supersize the existing system” while it is “vital to have a smart inverter and upgrade the switchboard to manage how the house exports and imports to the grid”.

The organisation said the biggest financial outlay would be to replace petrol and diesel cars with EVs and use the batteries as part of the household energy system. Gas-fuelled devices would also be replaced. Rewiring Australia said this would deliver immediate savings.
“An electric car costs about 6 cents per kilometre to drive if charged from the grid, compared to a petrol car which costs about 12 cents per km (when petrol is at $1.43/L). Charging an electric car with rooftop solar reduces this even further, to about 1 cent a km, over 10 times less than a petrol car,” the organisation said.
“Heating the water for a shower with a gas-fuelled water heater costs about 89 cents with standard gas prices (2019). An electric heat pump water heater costs just 21 cents to provide the same hot shower using grid electricity. Using rooftop solar, that shower costs just 5 cents, over 10 times less than a gas shower.”
Rewiring Australia said the savings modelled for electrification take into account the upfront costs of purchase and assume that they are financed over the lifetime of the asset.
Griffith said the benefits of the electrification process are amplified when entire suburbs, communities and regions electrify their homes.
“When entire communities and cities upgrade and electrify, the benefits will be amplified and shared,” he said. “Less money will be sent out of the community and offshore from Australia. Billions of dollars can be retained in local communities and thousands of additional local jobs generated.”
Griffith said the technology to decarbonise and electrify households exists today and “the more that consumers buy electric vehicles, solar, batteries and electric appliances, the cheaper and better they get”.

Rewiring Australia said the initial modelling is based on the potential uptake across the southeast Queensland federal electorates of Brisbane, Longman, and Griffith, but the program is also planning to analyse other seats across the country.
The release of the modelling comes after The Greens proposed the electrification an entire Australian town and a suburb in a major city of the party’s climate and energy policy in the lead up to the federal election later this month.
Party leader Adam Bandt said the pilot project, to be enabled by a $235 million fund, would seek to show that by 2025 it will be cost effective for households to be completely electric, largely powered by rooftop and community solar and batteries.
“This hasn’t been achieved anywhere in the world,” he said. “It’s time to get off the gas, get batteries in our homes, and solar on the roof. We will show this works at scale, creating jobs and powering up a community.”
A study released last year by Rewiring Australia found a $12 billion investment would retrofit 11 million Australian households for full electrification by 2030 leading to national savings of more than $40 billion and removing one-third of domestic carbon emissions.
Griifith said the full electrification of Brisbane households would reduce the region’s emissions by 42.4%.
“Electrification attacks the three huge national problems – climate heating, cost of living and national security,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/09/mugga-lane-solar-park-to-sell-after-administrators-appointed/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 9, 2022",Mugga Lane Solar Park to sell after administrators appointed,"Scott Langdon and David Osborne from independent advisory and investment firm KordaMentha have been appointed as voluntary administrators of the Mugga Lane Solar Park and said the sale process for the Canberra asset “will commence immediately”.
Maoneng said on Monday it could not provide any further details about the process but KordaMentha said in a statement “the appointment of voluntary administrators was necessary due to the recent external effects on the financial arrangements of Mugga Lane Solar Park”.
It is understood the Sydney-headquartered Maoneng had been seeking to refinance the facility, which is backed by a long-term offtake agreement with the ACT government.
Maoneng, which has plans to build more than 2,000MW of utility scale solar and battery energy storage system projects across Australia, said the situation at Mugga Lane will not affect it development plans.
“Mugga Lane Solar Park is a group subsidiary asset operating under a special purpose vehicle structure,” a Maoneng spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
“The appointment of KordaMentha, the voluntary administrators, only relates to Mugga Lane Solar Park, and does not affect other group operations or any related entities.”
The appointment of voluntary administrators comes just days after Maoneng unveiled plans to build an almost 1GW solar PV farm and battery energy storage facility in the Hunter region of New South Wales. Maoneng said the proposed Merriwa Energy Hub would be one of the largest renewable energy hubs in the country, comprising a 550MW solar farm and a 400MW/1,600MWh battery energy storage system (BESS).
The proposed $1.6 billion Merriwa Energy Hub is the latest addition to Maoneng’s pipeline of renewable energy projects. The company also retains an interest in the 200MW Sunraysia Solar Farm being developed in southwest NSW, and is also developing the 240MW/480MWh Mornington battery project in Victoria and the 225MW/450MWh Gould Creek storage project in near Adelaide in South Australia.
The Mugga Lane Solar Park is one of Australia’s oldest utility scale solar farms. Built on a 52-hectare site in the south of Canberra, the asset was completed in March 2017 and generates approximately 24,500MWh of electricity a year.
Langdon said the facility “will continue to operate on a ‘business as usual’ basis and there will be no disruption to operations or any stakeholders”.
“The voluntary administrators will work collaboratively with the director to run an international sale process and maximise competitive tension and the financial outcomes for all stakeholders and creditors,” he said. “A sale process for the project will commence immediately.”
Langdon said he expected a high level of interest in the asset and encouraged “anyone interested in purchasing the Mugga Lane Solar Park to contact our office immediately”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/09/solar-tech-advances-to-trigger-switch-for-skyscrapers/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 9, 2022",Solar tech advances to trigger switch for skyscrapers,"The heart of downtown Melbourne is known for many things: little “Instagrammable” lanes of graffiti, trendy cafes, trams, museums, and of course, its cluster of skyscrapers shooting up out of nowhere like the Emerald City of Oz. But what those walking the streets of Victorian capital can’t see 145 meters above their heads is that there are 500 Trina Solar modules operating as a 223 kW system atop Towers One, Two and Four of Walker Corp.’s Collins Square Tower site.
Putting solar panels on rooftops is hardly newsworthy; indeed, Australia is the world leader of solar rooftop installation. But putting solar atop skyscrapers is not so common, partly because the generation profile has not been worthwhile. After all, the point of tall buildings is that the roof represents only a tiny fraction of the structure’s overall square footage.
However, thanks to recent advances in solar panel energy density, that profile has changed. Recognizing this, Walker Corp., one of Australia’s largest private development companies, teamed up with Venergy Australia to deliver the SolarEdge-optimized solar system to its Collins Square Tower development.
“With the advances in solar technology, energy-dense panels now available exceed 450 W per panel, enabling significant and meaningful renewable projects in CBD locations that couldn’t otherwise be achieved on the constrained rooftop,” said Venergy Australia CEO Matthew Wilkins.
Venergy integrated the 223 kW solar system with the building’s regenerative lifts and its trigeneration of 600 kW gas turbines across five commercial towers, bringing the site’s total generating capacity to 2 MW.
Cameron Forbes, engineering and sustainability manager for Walker Corp., told pv magazine the company strives to ensure its towers are equipped with “advanced solar technology” that can be fully integrated with “our existing energy monitoring and management systems, enabling our team to constantly track the panels’ performance”.
The Collins Square Tower solar setup is not the only sky-scraping solar array in town. In fact, Cbus Property announced in November 2021 that it’s planning to clad a $1 billion commercial office tower in Melbourne’s central business district with a “solar skin” that is capable of generating 20% of the project’s base building electricity requirements.

Looking at these two projects, we see two differing ways to integrate solar into high-rise buildings: rooftop solar and building-integrated PV (BIPV). But by combining the two, we may be looking at the future of energy-integrated construction in vertical cities – namely, the two-punch generation combo of integrating both energy-dense rooftop panels and BIPV.
That combo is precisely what the Monash University-based ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science found, in collaboration with the University of Lisbon. Researchers 3D modelled the viability and impact of window-integrated photovoltaics alongside other solar technologies at a city scale. Published in the journal Solar Energy, the study found that buildings in Melbourne could provide 74% of their own electricity needs if solar technology was fully integrated into roofs, walls and windows. Rooftop solar would constitute 88% of this supply, with wall-integrated and window-integrated solar delivering 8% and 4%, respectively.
The research team, including study co-author Professor Jacek Jasieniak, looked at a 37.4 square kilometres (sqm) of central Melbourne, of which 35.1 sqm was residential and commercial buildings as of 2019. They then determined the annual solar irradiation on Melbourne’s building surfaces to identify suitable areas for PV, taking into account cost factors, technical limitations, shading and shadows. And at city scale – including warehouse-sized rooftops in city surrounds such as ports and stadiums, like the famous Melbourne Cricket Ground – the rooftop capacity potential is staggering.
“Our goal was to showcase that actually there is huge potential (for urban PV, particularly rooftop), it’s just enormous,” said Jasieniak. “But people don’t think about it because people tend to think at the scale of a building rather than the scale of a city.”
“As technology evolves, what we will find is that the incremental costs to add the PV components into the buildings is going to make the value proposition for integration very strong,” continued Jasieniak. “Our driver for this study was to understand the opportunity for window-integrated solar cells, and what came out of the study was that actually, for most buildings, rooftop is very attractive. It’s the low-hanging fruit out there.”
But Jasieniak notes that rooftop primacy will remain the case as long as walls and windows (BIPV) still require a technology revolution. Compared to rooftop, the cost of a solar window is “an order of magnitude higher than what you would pay for a solar cell on a roof.”
However, the study co-author noted, “if your building is costing you, say, AUD 1 billion, and you’re spending AUD 40 million on solar cells which over the course of their lifetime will bring back electricity, that is the important part to consider. The upfront cost is not the driving force, it should always be the levelized cost of electricity. It’s always a question of payback period, it won’t be seven years, but does it really need to be in a commercial building that will last at least 40 years? I don’t think so.”
Jim Stewart, associate director at Fender Katsalidis – the Australian architectural firm behind the world’s second-tallest building, Kuala Lumpur’s 678.9-meter Merdeka 118 building, topped with a 140 kW solar array for its Park Hyatt Kuala Lumpur hotel – told pv magazine that clients are encouraged to consider PV solutions, as “most buildings over 180 meters tall are not demolished within 50 years.”
“Rooftop solar arrays have become common place in skyscraper design and development,” Stewart said. “And, in the Australian context, their economic viability has been proven and accepted. Space is always limited however, so ever-increasing densities allow us to push further in terms of design flexibility and system capacity. In the context of high-rise development, PV is a mature and affordable technology with the ability to power building services and reduce peak loads on the grid; a ‘no-brainer’ indeed.”
Along with the sheer potential of PV in vertical cities come challenges. Firstly, most PV installations would be brownfield retrofits on existing rooftops, which can be problematic, as tall buildings often have other infrastructure already.
Another challenge is that tall buildings tend to be rented, making it difficult to clarify whose responsibility and direct benefit PV would be. “But there’s a value proposition in that,” argued Jasieniak. “There has been a business-sentiment shift – companies are now demanding 10-star building requirements, and at that level you need onsite energy generation.”
But builders are also required to change and support PV integration. “A lot of these building companies just do what they’ve done for a long time,” argued Jasieniak. “Innovation to building practices is needed to support construction at scale.”
Nevertheless, Jasieniak sees a future where tall buildings boast rooftop PV, with BIPV further down the line, and possibly net-zero carbon buildings. Before then, he says there are tough questions in terms of policy, and value shifts in both individual companies and for developers and builders in terms of PV integration. “I think there is a market segmentation opportunity there, too.”

The total cost of the project is estimated at $20.6 million.
SeaLink chief operating officer Donna Gauci said the vessel, that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, would operate as a shuttle between Gladstone and LNG facilities on nearby Curtis Island.
“Using our extensive experience in sustainable transport solutions, we will design and construct a world-first internationally compliant hydrogen-powered passenger ferry to join our SeaLink Gladstone fleet operating out of the Gladstone marina,” she said.
“The new hydrogen-powered ferry will be a major addition to our passenger transport in Gladstone, capable of carrying up to 200 passengers and travelling at speeds of up to 20 knots (37kph) up to a range of 50 nautical miles.”
SeaLink is part of the Kelsian Group. One of Australia’s largest land and marine transport services, the group operates about 4,000 buses, 120 ferries and 24 light rail vehicles.
Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the $5 million grant is the HIDF’s largest investment so far in the state’s growing hydrogen supply chain but a second round of grants would see about $20 million allocated to hydrogen projects.
“Projects are being progressed across Queensland from the north to the border with New South Wales and will keep bringing world-leading energy technology to Queensland because it creates opportunity for new jobs,” he said.
“We are creating a long-term, thriving domestic hydrogen ecosystem which will give some of the world’s largest companies access to competitively priced renewable energy options here on our shores.
“This is part of the Palaszczuk government’s commitment to a clean energy future, one where innovation drives economic growth and delivers highly skilled jobs for Queenslanders.”
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the ferry project is just the latest green hydrogen project announced for the Gladstone region which is expected to play a key role in the emerging industry because of its existing gas infrastructure.
“Gladstone is set to become one of Australia’s major hydrogen hubs and hydrogen-powered transport options are one of the diverse uses emerging for hydrogen,” he said.
Gladstone is also the site of Fortescue’s hydrogen electrolyser plant while state government-owned electricity generator Stanwell has teaming with a consortium of Australian and Japanese energy companies to investigate the commercial viability of developing a 3GW electrolysis plant with the view to producing green hydrogen for export to Japan and use in local industry.
London-based Eco Energy World has also announced plans for a 200MW green hydrogen plant with 100MW of energy storage in Gladstone while Japanese trading giant Sumitomo also plans to build a hydrogen production plant in the region.

The platform takes a step beyond monitoring the system, by proactively advising homeowners on ways to optimize their energy usage. It is capable of recognizing patterns of electricity consumption and suggests further actions for energy bill savings.
One example is the SunPower One system recognizing “always on” devices in the home that would benefit from switching off during periods of peak demand and high electricity prices. It can also identify malfunctioning appliances that may need repair or replacement based on abnormal electricity signals.
With compatible products, the system enables smart use cases that increase self-consumption of solar PV production, scheduling electric vehicle charging times for when excess solar is produced or stored, or running heating and cooling systems at cost and energy-optimal times.
“We expect the SunPower One solution will reimagine and revolutionize the consumer experience Beyond the Panel, keeping homeowners informed with actionable energy insights within their household, helping make their homes more efficient and more sustainable,” said Jeff Waters, CEO of Maxeon Solar Technologies.
Maxeon’s SunPower One will be packaged with the company’s SunPower Reserve home battery. The company said its group of integrated products will continue to grow over the course of the year, adding products like electric vehicle charging, and will unlock additional software capabilities for value-added services for the customer.
The system will also assist installers by reporting opportunities identified by the homeowner’s energy usage behaviours, making suggestions for more products and services for increased energy savings. The SunPower One tool also provides an installer-specific digital sales, design, and quoting platform.
“We have the freedom to think outside the box and leverage next-generation technologies to leapfrog the traditional offerings on the market today. Our customers are our north star, and we will continue to prioritize solving their pain points,” said Ralf Elias, chief product officer at Maxeon Solar Technologies.
Maxeon’s SunPower One platform will launch in Australia in the third quarter of 2022 and will roll out to other markets globally throughout 2022. The United States and Canada will not be part of the 2022 launch.

US battery manufacturing got a boost this week with the announcement of US$3.1 billion (AU$4.4 billion) in funding from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The infrastructure investment is intended to increase American-made batteries and components, bolster domestic supply chains, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs. The plan is to support the creation of new, retrofitted, and expanded commercial facilities as well as manufacturing demonstrations, and battery recycling. According to a recent PV Intel report, California is an example of a burgeoning US battery market with a big  increase in solar-plus-battery installations just in the past year.
The Department of Energy (DOE) also announced a separate US$60 million (AU$85 million) to support second-life applications for batteries once used to power EVs, as well as new processes for recycling materials back into the battery supply chain. These funding opportunities are part of the government’s strategy to bolster America’s supply chain and reduce the reliance on competing nations. Currently China is the leader in the global lithium-ion battery production market, according to a Wood Mackenzie report. And while the US is supporting its battery industry, China is investing heavily to build out more manufacturing facilities to extend its dominance. Secondarily, these initiatives support the president’s goal of electric vehicles making up half the vehicle sales in North America by 2030.
“Positioning the United States front and centre in meeting the growing demand for advanced batteries is how we boost our competitiveness and electrify our transportation system,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “President Biden’s historic investment in battery production and recycling will give our domestic supply chain the jolt it needs to become more secure and less reliant on other nations – strengthening our clean energy economy, creating good paying jobs, and decarbonising the transportation sector.”
With increased proliferation of electric vehicles, the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade. In addition to ramping up R&D and manufacturing, responsible and sustainable domestic sourcing of the critical materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, will help avoid or mitigate supply chain disruptions and accelerate battery production in America.
“I secured provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support the domestic critical mineral supply chain used in battery production,” said US Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada). “Nevada’s innovation economy is at the forefront of battery manufacturing and recycling, and the infrastructure law could bring vital new investments to the state.”
The “Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing” and “Electric Drive Vehicle Battery Recycling and Second Life Applications” funding opportunities are aligned with the National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries, authored by the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries, and led by DOE and the Departments of Defense, Commerce, and State.
These funding opportunities are the first to be released as a collaboration between DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the new Office of Manufacturing and Supply Chains, created by the DOE’s organisational realignment to ensure that the Department has the structure needed to effectively implement the clean energy investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Energy Act of 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/09/ripple-effects-of-russia-ukraine-crisis-on-renewables/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE,RUSSIA,UKRAINE",MARIJA MAISCH,"MAY 9, 2022",Ripple effects of Russia-Ukraine crisis on renewables,"From pv magazine 05/2022
As the invasion of Ukraine continues, governments across Europe are seeking to sever ties to Russian energy. New renewables capacity is needed now more than ever.
A survey run by US renewables transaction infrastructure provider LevelTen showed that more than 30% of developers in Europe are doubling down on efforts in countries in which they are already present, while less than 9% are scaling back investment in light of the Russia-Ukraine war. However, proximity to the conflict acts as a deterrent for some.
“What we’re seeing is that some developers are a bit shy to do investments in the countries bordering Ukraine and Russia,” says Frederico Carita, developer services manager at LevelTen. “But some developers are saying business as usual – this depends on the risk profile of the company and the country itself.” The key is if developers are new to a region or not.
According to LevelTen, the war has sent European PPA prices sky-high. The Polish market was a particularly interesting one to watch due to its auction scheme, which allows developers to bid by volume and leave exposure to very high merchant and/or PPA prices. The latest auction in December allocated 870 MW of solar and the new year was off to a good start.
“Now, the photovoltaic sector in Poland is facing new challenges,” says Ewa Mageira, the president of the Polish Photovoltaic Association. “We are getting signals that suggest problems with timely implementation of projects. Many Ukrainians employed in the PV sector are returning to their homeland to take up arms.”
According to Mageira many auction winners are likely to miss the deadline for the first generation of energy from new installations. Fortunately, amendments are being negotiated to allow for an extension from 24 to 33 months, putting solar on par with wind installations. Renewables will see a boost from Russian sanctions, yet both Poland and Hungary are looking for ways to increase domestic coal-based power production.
Hungary has broken rank with the EU and rejected energy sanctions against Moscow. Good news, however, came in March that the nation’s energy regulator was seeking to procure around 864 GWh of renewables.
However, according to Hungarian renewable energy specialist Ferenc Kis, the response was tepid with only 20 projects submitted, down from over 200 bids in 2020 and 2021 and fivefold oversubscribed capacities. The trend of ever-decreasing prices was reversed.
“There are numerous reasons behind this, and I would be hesitant to relate them to the Ukrainian war,” Kis says. Instead, he points to this being the first auction in Hungary to require a battery storage component with a capacity at 10% of the planned power production unit. “At the same time, a more regulated and likely more transparent bid-bond scheme was introduced by the DSOs, and the first announcements of MW-scale corporate PPA contracts have signaled that the next chapter of the solar market is starting.”
In Hungary, the first merchant plant was recently commissioned by Netherlands-based Photon Energy. The developer already has plans for new merchant projects in its key European markets – Romania, Hungary, and Poland, and despite the war, business is proceeding.
“So far, we cannot see a direct impact on our work, however we can see that the recent increase in raw material prices is reflected in our investment cost, but this was already observed before the war,” says Martin Kysly, the company’s spokesperson.
In Romania, the war in Ukraine seems to have had little impact on the solar sector. “On the contrary, I would say the confidence of investors was slightly boosted as everyone has realized that Romania must invest in renewables as quickly as possible,” says Mihai Balan, executive director of the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association.
Balan notes that previous expectations for at least 3 GW of renewables to be added by 2026, with solar accounting for around 2 GW, now seem conservative. The reason behind such optimism is a combination of recent positive developments, including the removal of the ban on PPAs after almost 10 years, 1:1 quantitative compensation for prosumers with installations up to 200 kW, and the country’s first renewables tender for the deployment of 950 MW of capacity.
“We believe that more than 65% out of this capacity will come from solar, because of its shorter deployment time and given the obligation to have these projects connected to the grid by 2024,” Balan says.
In the meantime, nothing has changed in the field according to Balan, and the industry is on track to bring the first 100 MW of solar this year, which will include the first utility-scale PV projects in Romania in seven or eight years.
In early April, US power electronics manufacturer Enphase confirmed its plans to begin producing micro-inverters in Timisoara from the first quarter of 2023.
Meanwhile, in neighboring Moldova, the appetite for solar continues to grow. In early April, the energy regulator launched an auction to deploy 230 MW of large-scale renewable energy projects, including 70 MW of solar.
“This time we saw a huge interest, especially in ground-mounted PV that was allocated within hours,” says Vitali Zveaghintev, the founder of Zaw Energy Srl. However, most developers in Moldova are looking to build solar outside of any support schemes.
According to Moldovan energy policy analyst Sergiu Tofilat, there are plenty of entrepreneurs in the country willing to invest in renewables, but their major concerns are not related to the war in Ukraine.
“Developers are more concerned about some legislative loopholes we have here. For instance, our TSO has issued approvals for more than 1 GW, which is more than Moldova’s peak consumption. Most of those who have received approvals do not plan to build any projects, but just want to resell them.” Zveaghintev confirms that the interest in renewables has increased on the back of the rising electricity and gas prices. But he also explains the troubles developers are facing, including the interrupted supply of metal support structures and high voltage equipment from Ukraine.
“The fact that no cargo ships are coming to the Black Sea is a big issue and all deliveries that we were getting via the Odessa port are now being directed over Greece, Holland, or Turkey by trucks. This is impacting not only us as EPCs, but also potential investors,” Zveaghintev says.
