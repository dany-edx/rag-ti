https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/17/1-gw-hybrid-solar-and-wind-farm-to-drive-wa-hydrogen-plan/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 17, 2021",1 GW hybrid solar and wind farm to drive WA hydrogen plan,"ASX-listed minerals company Province Resources is looking to become an Australian leader in green hydrogen production, revealing plans to establish a hybrid solar PV and wind farm near Canarvon in WA as part of a proposal to produce renewable hydrogen for the domestic and export markets.
Province said on Wednesday its HyEnergy Renewable Hydrogen Project includes plans for a 1 GW wind and solar PV facility with the energy used to produce approximately 60,000 tonnes of green hydrogen or up to about 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia.
“The bulk of the energy will be used for large-scale production of green hydrogen products for domestic and export markets with potentially a smaller proportion of generation capacity to be dedicated to large energy users in the Pilbara region,” Province said in a statement.
The Perth-based company announced the plans after revealing it had entered into a conditional agreement to acquire fellow WA-based outfit Ozexco, which holds seven exploration licence applications in the Gascoyne Region of WA. Some of the tenements are considered prospective for salt, potash and mineral sands while others could become home to a renewable green hydrogen project.
In a ASX announcement, Province said the location is ideal for the development of a large-scale renewable energy facility.
Canarvon’s solar is amongst the highest irradiance in the world, averaging 211 sunny days per year with an average solar exposure of 22 Mj or 6.24 kWh per day. And, due to being on the western edge of the continent, it has excellent wind resources.
The region also benefits from low intensity land use and low population density while existing infrastructure includes the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline (DBNGP). WA’s geographical proximity to Asia is another strategic benefit.
“We believe that the project will contribute significantly to the national, state and local objectives of new investment, new jobs, renewable energy sources and new export markets. We look forward to working with government, stakeholders and local communities to realise this exciting project,” the company said.
It is expected the project will be delivered in three stages. The first stage will include a pilot trial of green hydrogen and green ammonia production. The trial will also investigate potential gas blending into the DBNGP.
Stage 2 will see the project scaled up to supply into the DBNGP with the aim of helping meet the State Government’s objective of up to 10% green hydrogen in the pipeline by 2030.
The third stage will deliver full-scale production for both domestic and export markets and the development of a liquified hydrogen loading facility in the Canarvon area.
Province said it will look to commence feasibility studies for both renewable power generation and green hydrogen production within the next 12-18 months while also seeking to secure a binding memorandum of understanding with an independent power producer for the wind and solar energy required for the hydrogen production.
Province isn’t the only enterprise eyeing off the development of a renewable hydrogen project in WA.
The State Government has given environmental approval to the first stage of the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, a 15 GW hybrid solar and wind plant. The approval is a massive step forward for the project, which will eventually reach 26 GW Asia Renewable Energy Hub, is backed by Sydney-based developer CWP Renewables and the Macquarie Group.
Hydrogen Renewables Australia and Denmark Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) have also proposed developing a renewable hydrogen production facility near Kalbarri, detailing plans for up to 5 GW of combined solar and wind projects to supply it.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/17/australian-first-hydrogen-energy-facility-for-springfield-city/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 17, 2021",Australian-first hydrogen energy facility for Springfield City,"LAVO and its joint venture partner Nedstack confirmed on Monday they had signed a MoU with Springfield City Group (SCG) to develop a $20 million hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing facility and deploy LAVO hydrogen technology in the $18 billion master-planned community on Brisbane’s doorstep.
LAVO CEO Alan Yu said preparations for the facility, which is supported by a grant from the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, are already underway. Construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2021 with a targeted timeline for completion by early 2022. Production is expected to commence later in the same year.
“We are very excited to be working with the SCG and helping deliver on its vision of a city that leads in innovation, design, entrepreneurship and, importantly, sustainability,” Yu said.
“This MoU demonstrates the immense potential of the LAVO System, and we look forward to the exciting collaborations that we will undertake alongside SCG.
“In the meantime, we continue to work closely with our production and manufacturing partners to bring this incredible technology into homes by July 2021.”
The development will allow for the local production of Dutch company Nedstack’s polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology for LAVO and other customers across the Australasia region.
Nedstack’s PEM fuel cells are a critical component in the LAVO System, launched late last year and described by the company as the first and only commercial-ready hydrogen energy storage system in the world designed for everyday use by residential homes and businesses.
LAVO said the hydrogen battery, which was developed in conjunction with researchers at the University of New South Wales and stores 40 kWh of energy, provides a more complete, versatile and sustainable energy storage solution than any alternative currently on the market.
In a statement, the company said the “technology has a storage capacity three times greater and a lifetime more than two times longer compared to market alternatives”.
“LAVO’s technology is truly a game changer for the energy storage market, and we believe it will have a real, positive impact on the way people power their lives,” Yu said.
Designed to be portable, the LAVO System employs canisters containing a patented metal hydride which absorbs hydrogen providing stable, long-term storage.
The LAVO System will initially be aimed at residential and commercial markets, including off-grid regional and rural properties, and telecommunication towers. Across these segments the company estimates the market for its technology exceeds $2 billion in Australia, expanding on a global scale to $40 billion.

SCG chairman Maha Sinnathamby said land for the hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing plant has been set aside in Springfield City’s 40-hectare Vicinity business park.
Sinnathamby said the MoU would also allow SCG and LAVO to work together to identify other renewable energy opportunities, including the integration of LAVO technology into utility scale solar farms developed in the master-planned community.
“As our relationship grows, we look forward to exploring many more opportunities to apply LAVO’s innovative technology and expertise more broadly to deliver on our blueprint for a clean-green future,” Sinnathamby said.
Sinnathamby said SCG had adopted an eco-friendly strategy for Springfield City – where the population of 46,000 is expected to triple over the next two decades – which includes “producing more energy than we consume by 2038”.
Under the strategy, at least a third of Springfield City will be set aside as ‘green space’ and residents will have widespread access to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and a hydrogen bus network and see 100% of their power delivered through renewable sources.
“We have one chance – and the responsibility to our residents both now and into the future – to get this right and be an ongoing exemplar for others to follow,” Sinnathamby said.

In a Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) filing, Sterling and Wilson Solar said it had increased its holding in GCO Solar to 100% after earlier securing a 76% stake in the company.
One of the largest solar EPC and operations and management (O&M) solutions providers in the world with an international portfolio of more than 10.6 GW of solar PV projects commissioned and under construction. This includes a 1.1 GW solar PV plant in Abu Dhabi – the world’s largest single-site solar plant – and a recently announced $127.5 million EPC order in Egypt. The company also manages a portfolio of 7.4 GW of O&M projects globally.
Present in Australia since 2015, Sterling and Wilson has already secured multiple projects here, including the recently completed 200 MW Wellington Solar Farm in central New South Wales.
The Wellington solar farm, the first of oil giant BP’s portfolio of solar projects to begin operating in Australia, started registering on the National Electricity Market late last year.
It is the first large-scale solar farm to be completed in Australia by the Indian outfit but it will most certainly not be the last with Sterling and Wilson Solar announcing in September it had secured orders in Australia worth $300 million.
Sterling and Wilson Solar director and global CEO Bikesh Ogra said the company had signed on for two more large-scale solar projects which will have an installed capacity of more than 300 MW.
“We are delighted to have won two major solar projects in Australia,” Ogra said. “Our total order book in Australia now stands at about $1.2 billion with five projects and a portfolio of more than 1.1 GW, making us the largest home-grown solar EPC player in the region.”
While Sterling and Wilson did not name the projects at the time of the announcement, saying only that the orders had been secured from global independent power producers (IPPs), the 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm in Queensland is part of the deal.
That announcement followed Sterling and Wilson Solar’s revelation in May 2020 that it had signed an EPC contract worth an estimated $525 million. It also signed an O&M contract for a maximum period of 20 years worth an estimated $85 million. Again, Sterling and Wilson did not identify the project but it has since been confirmed it is engaged in Neoen’s 400 MW solar project in Queensland’s Western Downs.
Ogra said the order was Sterling and Wilson Solar’s largest in Australia to date and the company expected a substantial portion of its international revenue would come from the Australian market.
“With the continent’s regulatory environment becoming more conducive towards renewable energy and the prevalence of high electricity tariff, the commercial viability of solar projects is improving,” he said.
“Our vision for the market is to maintain our leadership position in the EPC segment and contribute to the country’s mission of clean energy.”
While Sterling and Wilson Solar is among the largest EPC players in the market, GCO Solar has also enjoyed its share of success.
Among the projects it has completed is AGL Energy’s 102 MW Nyngan Solar Farm, which at the time of construction was the largest solar plant in the southern hemisphere.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/17/solar-and-storage-to-take-over-from-uranium-mine-for-kakadu-rejuvenation/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 17, 2021",Solar and storage to take over from uranium mine for Kakadu rejuvenation,"Distributed energy producer EDL will build, own and operate hybrid microgrid in the remote Northern Territory (NT) mining town of Jabiru. Working with the NT Government, EDL’s Jabiru Hybrid Renewable Project (the Project) will help the community transition from its recent history as a uranium mining town to a new future as a tourist destination in the heart of the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park (Kakadu). 
Jabiru is held in native title by the Mirarr people. The town, as it is recognised today, has only existed since 1982, when it was established as a living community for the nearby Ranger Uranium Mine. 
The project, which integrates 3.9 MW of solar generation and a 3 MW/5MWh battery with 4.5 MW of diesel generation will be EDL’s 100th site since it began 30 years ago with the development of the Pine Creek Power Station on the other side of Kakadu.

“Once completed, our hybrid renewable power station will provide Jabiru with at least 50% renewable energy over the long term, without compromising power quality or reliability,” said EDL CEO James Harman. “We are proud to contribute to the Territory’s 50% renewable energy target by 2030 through this sustainable energy solution.” 
The Ranger Uranium Mine, owned by Energy Resources Australia, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, was once one of the most productive uranium mines in the world. However, The mine ceased production on January 8 2021, after years of losses primarily attributed to the market slump following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.

The now-abandoned mine is completely enclosed by Kakadu, making the nearby Jabiru an ideal hub for rejuvenated tourism and services to this treasure trove of both natural and human wonders. Indeed, Kakadu possesses more than 5,000 recorded sites of indigenous art stretching back more than fifty thousand years. 
According to the Katherine Times (KT), Kakadu is set to undergo a $276 million upgrade as part of a plan to rejuvenate tourism to the home of the world’s oldest living culture. Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley told KT “The park’s Traditional Owners want to see culturally appropriate tourism grow and we will work with them to achieve that outcome.” 
EDL will begin construction on the project in the coming months and expects the hybrid system to be generating energy by early 2022.
