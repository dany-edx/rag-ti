Australia has installed more than 33,000 Tesla Powerwall home battery systems to date, accounting for a nearly 12% share of the company’s total global installations.

On the other hand, Australia has only around 26,500 Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) on the road so far – though Denholm said momentum is growing rapidly. “I personally wouldn’t be surprised if we double that number by the end of the year,” she said. This would equate to more than 50,000 vehicles.
While its EVs are coming from a smaller base, the growth across all of Tesla’s key markets in Australia has been massive –increasing roughly six-fold since 2019. This is slightly higher than its average global growth, which Denholm outlined was around five-fold.
Amusing as Australia’s storage predilections may be, Denholm also iterated another point of difference: Australia currently produces 50% of the globe’s raw lithium, making it the largest producer, but accounts for just 7% of the refined lithium products.

She urged leaders to focus on translating the country’s mineral wealth into a large-scale battery manufacturing industry. “The world the world simply cannot build battery cells fast enough,” she said.
“I can’t think of a technology that’s more important than lithium-ion batteries right now,” Denholm added. “To meet the challenge of climate change this entire industry needs to scale at sprinting pace.”
Tesla alone expects to need more than 3 TWh of lithium-ion batteries for EVs and energy storage by 2030 – three times the current global capacity which sits at around 1 TWh.
Instead of continuing to “hedge our bets with coal” through the introduction of measures like a capacity market, Denholm believes Australia would profit from focussing on battery storage and bringing more of the value chain onshore.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/19/entirely-novel-mechanochemical-breakthrough-for-storing-hydrogen/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 19, 2022",‘Entirely novel’ mechanochemical breakthrough for storing hydrogen,"Research conducted at Deakin’s Institute for Frontier Materials has discovered a new method called “ball milling” to store gas in a special nanomaterial at room temperature. The method relies on mechanochemical reactions, meaning machinery is used to produce unusual reactions, and the team believes the discovery could help solve the key challenge of hydrogen storage, which is currently a major barrier to uptake.
The breakthrough marks such a departure from accepted wisdom on gas separation and storage that one of the lead researchers, Dr Srikanth Mateti, said he had to repeat his experiment 20 to 30 times before he could truly believe it himself.
“We were so surprised to see this happen, but each time we kept getting the exact same result, it was a eureka moment,” Dr Mateti said. 
The special ingredient in the ball milling process is boron nitride powder, which is small but has a large amount of surface area for absorption.
The boron nitride powder is placed into a ball mill – essentially a grinder containing small stainless-steel balls in a chamber – along with the gases that need separating. As the chamber spins at progressively higher speeds, the collision of the balls with the powder and the wall of the chamber triggers a mechanochemical reaction, resulting in gas being absorbed into the powder, the researchers explain.

Different types of gases are absorbed into the powdered material at different speeds, meaning they are easily separated from one another through repetition of the process.
“The boron nitride powder can be re-used multiple times to carry out the same gas separation and storage process again and again,” Dr Mateti said.
“There is no waste, the process requires no harsh chemicals and creates no by-products. 
“Boron nitride itself is classified as a level-0 chemical, something that is deemed perfectly safe to have in your house. This means you could store hydrogen anywhere and use it whenever it’s needed.”
The researchers described the method as having a “remarkably high gas storage capability.” This, they say, is due to the novel way gas molecules stick to the powder during the ball milling process, which does not break the gas molecules.
The ball-milling gas absorption process consumes 76.8 KJ/s to store and separate 1000L of gases. This at least 90% less than the energy used in the petroleum industry’s current separation process, known as cryogenic distillation.

Once a gas, like hydrogen for instance, is absorbed into the solid state material, it can be transported safely and easily, the researchers say. When the gas is needed, the powder is simply heated in a vacuum to release the gas unchanged.
The breakthrough is the culmination of three decades of work led by Professor Ying (Ian) Chen, the Chair of Nanotechnology at Deakin’s Institute for Frontier Materials, and his team. 
“The current way of storing hydrogen is in a high-pressure tank, or by cooling the gas down to a liquid form. Both require large amounts of energy, as well as dangerous processes and chemicals,” Professor Chen said.
“We show there’s mechanochemical alternative… It doesn’t require high pressure or low temperatures, so it would offer a much cheaper and safer way to develop things like hydrogen powered vehicles.”
As it stands, the Deakin team have only been able to test their process on a small scale, separating about two to three litres of material. They are hoping to attract industry support so the discovery can be scaled up to a full pilot.
A provisional patent application for their process has already been submitted, with the breakthrough findings published in the journal Materials Today.
“We need to further validate this method with industry to develop a practical application,” Professor Chen said.
“To move this from the laboratory to a larger industry scale we need to verify that this process is cost saving, more efficient, and quicker than traditional methods of gas separation and storage.”
More specifically, the researchers said for the method to be able to scale, they must perfect the milling process. “There’s a sweet spot in milling which creates the weaker chemical reactions we want – without producing stronger reactions which can destroy the gas molecules,” Professor Chen and Dr Mateti wrote in an accompanying article in The Conversation.
“We will also have to figure out how to get the best storage rate for each material based on milling intensity and pressure of the gases.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/19/this-is-australias-most-important-report-on-the-environments-deteriorating-health-we-present-its-grim-findings/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 19, 2022",This is Australia’s most important report on the environment’s deteriorating health. We present its grim findings,"From the Conversation
Climate change is exacerbating pressures on every Australian ecosystem and Australia now has more foreign plant species than native, according to the highly anticipated State of the Environment Report released today.
The report also found the number of listed threatened species rose 8% since 2016 and more extinctions are expected in the next decades.
The document represents thousands of hours of work over two years by more than 30 experts. It’s a sobering read, but there are some bright spots.
Australia has produced a national state of environment report every five years since 1995. They assess every aspect of Australia’s environment and heritage, covering rivers, oceans, air, ice, land and urban areas. The last report was released in 2017.
This report goes further than its predecessors, by describing how our environment is affecting the health and well-being of Australians. It is also the first to include Indigenous co-authors.
As chief authors of the report, we present its key findings here. They include new chapters dedicated to extreme events and Indigenous voices.
There have been continued declines in the amount and condition of our natural capital – native vegetation, soil, wetlands, reefs, rivers and biodiversity. Such resources benefit Australians by providing food, clean water, cultural connections and more.
The number of plant and animal species listed as threatened in June 2021 was 1,918, up from 1,774 in 2016. Gang-gang cockatoos and the Woorrentinta (northern hopping-mouse) are among those recently listed as endangered.
Australia’s coasts are also under threat from, for instance, extreme weather events and land-based invasive species.
Our nearshore reefs are in overall poor condition due to poor water quality, invasive species and marine heatwaves. Inland water systems, including in the Murray Darling Basin, are under increasing pressure.
Nationally, land clearing remains high. Extensive areas were cleared in Queensland and New South Wales over the last five years. Clearing native vegetation is a major cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, and has been implicated in the national listing of most Australia’s threatened species.
Climate change is compounding ongoing and past damage from land clearing, invasive species, pollution and urban expansion.
The intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are changing. Over the last five years, extreme events such as floods, droughts, wildfires, storms, and heatwaves have affected every part of Australia.
Seasonal fire periods are becoming longer. In NSW, for example, the bushfire season now extends to almost eight months. Extreme events are also affecting ecosystems in ways never before documented.
For example, the downstream effects of the 2019-2020 bushfires introduced a range of contaminants to coastal estuaries, in the first global record of bushfires impacting estuarine habitat quality.
This includes traditional fire management, which is being recognised as vital knowledge by land management organisations and government departments.
For example, Indigenous rangers manage 44% of the national protected area estate, and more than 2,000 rangers are funded under the federal government’s Indigenous rangers program.
Work must still be done to empower Indigenous communities and enable Indigenous knowledge systems to improve environmental and social outcomes.
Australia’s investment is not proportional to the grave environmental challenge. The area of land and sea under some form of conservation protection has increased, but the overall level of protection is declining within reserves.
We’re reducing the quantity and quality of native habitat outside protected areas through, for instance, urban expansion on land and over-harvesting in the sea.
The five urban areas with the most significant forest and woodland habitat loss were Brisbane, Gold Coast to Tweed Heads, Townsville, Sunshine Coast and Sydney. Between 2000 and 2017, at least 20,212 hectares were destroyed in these five areas combined, with 12,923 hectares destroyed in Queensland alone.
Australia is also increasingly relying on costly ways to conserve biodiversity. This includes restoration of habitat, reintroducing threatened species, translocation (moving a species from a threatened habitat to a safer one), and ex situ conservation (protecting species in a zoo, botanical garden or by preserving genetic material).
In this report we document the direct effects of environmental damage on human health, for example from bushfire smoke.
The indirect benefits of a healthy environment to mental health and well-being are harder to quantify. But emerging evidence suggests people who manage their environment according to their values and culture have improved well-being, such as for Indigenous rangers and communities.
Environmental destruction also costs our economy billions of dollars, with climate change and biodiversity loss representing both national and global financial risks.
Previous reports mostly spoke of climate change impacts as happening in future. In this report, we document significant climate harms already evident from the tropics to the poles.
As Australia’s east coast emerges from another “unusual” flood, this report introduces a new chapter dedicated to extreme events. Many have been made more intense, widespread and likely due to climate change.
We document the national impacts of extreme floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and wildfires over the past five years. And while we’ve reported on immediate impacts – millions of animals killed and habitats burnt, enormous areas of reef bleached, and people’s livelihoods and homes lost – many longer-term effects are still to play out.
Extreme conditions put immense stress on species already threatened by habitat loss and invasive species. We expect more species extinctions over the next decades.
An extreme heatwave in 2018, for example, killed some 23,000 spectacled flying foxes. In 2019, the species was uplisted from vulnerable to endangered.
Many Australian ecosystems have evolved to rebound from extreme “natural” events such as bushfires. But the frequency, intensity, and compounding nature of recent events are greater than they’ve experienced throughout their recent evolutionary history.
For example, marine heatwaves caused mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. Such frequent disturbances leave little time for recovery.
Indeed, ecological theory suggests frequently disturbed ecosystems will shift to a “weedy” state, where only the species that live fast and reproduce quickly will thrive.
This trend will bring profound shifts in ecosystem structure and function. It also means we’ll have to shift how we manage and rely on ecosystems – including how we harvest, hunt and otherwise benefit from them.
Indigenous people of Australia have cared for the lands and seas over countless generations and continue to do so today.
In Australia, a complex web of government laws and agreements relate to Indigenous people and the environment. Overall, they are not adequate to deliver the rights Indigenous people seek: responsibility for and stewardship of their Country including lands and seas, plants and animals, and heritage.
For the first time, this report has a separate Indigenous chapter, informed by Indigenous consultation meetings, which highlights the importance of caring for Country.
Including an Indigenous voice has required us to change the previous approach of reporting on the environment separately from people. Instead, we’ve emphasised how Country is connected to people’s well-being, and the interconnectedness of environment and culture.
Australia needs better and entirely new approaches to environmental management. For example, the inclusion of climate change in environmental management and resilience strategies is increasing, but it’s not universal.
As well as climate stresses, habitat loss and degradation remain the main threats to land-based species in Australia, impacting nearly 70% of threatened species.
More than a third of Australia’s eucalypt woodlands have been extensively cleared, and the situation is worse for some other major vegetation groups.
Experts say within 20 years, another seven Australian mammals and ten Australian birds – such as the King Island brown thornbill and the orange-bellied parrot – will be extinct unless management is greatly improved.
Of the 7.7 million hectares of land habitat cleared between 2000 and 2017, 7.1 million hectares (93%) was not referred to the federal government for assessment under the national environment law.
Only 16% (13 of 84) of Australia’s nationally listed threatened ecological communities meet a 30% minimum protection standard in the national reserve system.
Three critically endangered communities, all in NSW, have no habitat protection at all. These are the Hunter Valley weeping myall woodland, the Elderslie banksia scrub forest, and Warkworth sands woodland.
The report also highlights where investments and the hard work of many Australians made a difference.
Individuals, non-government organisations and businesses are increasingly purchasing and managing significant tracts of land for conservation. The Australian Wildlife Conservancy, for example, jointly manages some 6.5 million hectares actively conserving many threatened species.
By building on achievements such as these, we can encourage new partnerships and innovations, supported with crucial funding and commitment from government and industry.
We also need more collaboration across governments and non-government sectors, underpinned by greater national leadership. This includes listening and co-developing solutions with Indigenous and local communities, building on and learning from Indigenous and Western scientific knowledge.
And we need more effort and resources to measure progress. This includes consistent monitoring and reporting across all states and territories on the pressures, and the health of our natural and cultural assets.
Such efforts are crucial if we’re to reverse declines and forge a stronger, more resilient country.

Chinese inverter manufacturer Zhejiang Beny Electric Co., Ltd. has recently launched a micro-inverter series for residential and commercial PV systems.
The micro-inverters are available in three different versions with a rated power output of 550 volt-amperes (VA), 700 VA, and 2,800 VA. “The first two products can be connected to a single panel, while the largest micro-inverter can be connected to four panels,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine. “Our microinverters have the ability to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at the module level, which allows the overall output power to be maximised by optimising the output power of each module.”
The smallest device is called BYM550 and is able to work with a solar module power range of 400 W to 670 W. It features an efficiency of 97.5% and a European efficiency of 97%. It measures 210 mm x 230 mm x 34 mm and weighs 2.38 kg. It allows the connection of up to 10 units per string.
The middle-sized inverter, dubbed BYM700, works with a panel power range of 450 W to 750 W. Its efficiency reaches 97.5% and the European efficiency is rated at 97%. It has a size of 210 mm x 230 mm x 34 mm and weighs in at s 2.38 kg. It enables the connection of up to eight units per string.
The largest micro-inverter – the BYM2800 – is able to work with solar modules in the power range of 450 W to 750 W. It can achieve the same efficiencies as the BYM550 product.
For all devices, the MPPT voltage range is 24-50 V and the operating voltage range is 16.56 V, while the maximum DC input voltage is 60 V and the maximum short-circuit current is 24 A. Furthermore, they all achieve an MPPT efficiency of 99.8%, and a night power consumption of less than 100 milliwatts. The devices also feature an IP67 enclosure rating and a cooling system based on natural convection.
The manufacturer offers a 25-year performance warranty and a 10-year product warranty for all the micro-inverters of the series.
Beny Electric is based in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, and has an annual inverter capacity of 30 GW. It also has overseas offices in Germany, USA, and Brazil.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/19/oil-and-gas-reservoirs-are-cheapest-options-for-underground-hydrogen-storage/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,IRELAND",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 19, 2022",Oil and gas reservoirs are cheapest options for underground hydrogen storage,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists led by the Dublin City University in Ireland has analysed the prospects of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in geological formations in a comprehensive review and has found that depleted oil and gas reservoirs are the cheapest options.
In addition to oil and gas reservoirs, the techno-economic analyses considered hydrogen storage in aquifers, porous rocks, and salt caverns. “It should be mentioned that salt caverns do not exist naturally,” it explained. “Instead, they are artificial cavities in underground salt formations, that are created by the controlled dissolution of rock salt through water injection during the solution mining process.”
All these geological formations may ensure a series of advantages in terms of safety such as good gas tightness, high wall sealing thicknesses, and extensive subsurface depths. “It is worth noting that UHS can benefit from the technological maturity of the geologic storage of natural gas and CO2, which are associated with decades of established knowledge,” the researchers noted. “However, H2 is invariably more chemically, biologically, and microbially reactive, which presents unique challenges that are yet to be fully understood.”
Furthermore, compared to conventional natural gas storage, UHS has leakage issues, due to viscosity, the molecule size of hydrogen, and the lower density, which requires more pressure and in turn affects storage capacity.
The analyses showed that the cost of underground hydrogen storage depends on transportation, monitoring, storage, and injection cost, as well as the location and properties of the geological storage site. Capital costs included gas compression, transformer installation, piping, transformer installation, new well drilling, and wellhead equipment installation.
The researchers found that depleted oil and gas reservoirs are the cheapest storage option with a cost of US$1.29/kg (AU$1.9/kg), while rock caverns offer the highest levelised cost of storage of US$2.77/kg (AU$4/kg). Capital expenditure for gas and oil reservoirs was also the lowest at US$0.73/kg (AU$1.07/kg) and salt caverns had the highest capital expenditure of US$1.51/kg (AU$2.2/kg). The academics emphasised that the operating expense was also lower (US$0.11/kg) when compared to salt caverns (US$0.14/kg), noting that depleted natural gas reservoirs have a lower construction cost when compared with depleted oil reservoirs.
They introduced their findings in the paper “Perspectives and prospects of underground hydrogen storage and natural hydrogen,” published in Sustainable Energy Fuels. “Despite the scarcity of economic data on natural hydrogen projects, it is expected that the overall economics of its extraction will not be too different from natural gas,” they concluded. “Nonetheless, this requires further substantiation via robust techno-economic analyses.”
