Few details of the precinct plan have been released, with Graphite Energy simply noting the masterplan includes 5 MW of solar to be combined with “multiple forms of integrated energy storage,” including batteries, thermal energy storage for heating, cooling and drying, and hydrogen for diesel substitution.
Graphite Energy has had relatively little coverage until now, but according to the company it has developed a proprietary thermal energy storage system for the decarbonisation of industrial and manufacturing operations.
Graphite Energy already has a facility at Lake Cargelligo, which sits almost in the centre of NSW between Dubbo and Griffith. The precinct will expand on this existing facility and is to be built in stages, the first of which is expected to commence in late 2023 with completion earmarked for mid-2024.
Considering the scope of the precinct’s plans, both the budget and construction timeframe appear very modest – but it is worth noting the announcement includes no information on what each construction stage will entail.
The company did add that the new Lake Cargelligo facility will also include a manufacturing research facility.
All in all, the Lake Sustainable Energy Precinct is aiming to bring together the agricultural and renewable energy industries – two vital sectors which are increasingly vying for land. “The project aims to demonstrate how renewable energy and agriculture can coexist, using industry advancements to enable renewable energy sources without forgoing farmland,” the company’s announcement says.
The precinct will generate renewable energy to power sustainable agriculture operations, including: 
·          agrivoltaics – protected cropping operation underneath and between the solar panels
·          greenhouse – protected cropping for the production of vegetables and leafy greens
·          fish farm – tank-based aquaculture system to produce fresh fish
The company hopes the precinct will serve as “an Australian-first pilot model that can be scaled and replicated throughout Australia and the rest of the world.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/12/nasa-finds-hydrogen-emitting-fairy-circles-in-wa/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",NASA pictures hydrogen-emitting ‘fairy circles’ in WA,"The image shows groups of “fairy circle” hydrogen seeps, commonly known as salt lakes, near the town of Moora, around 150 kilometres north of Perth.
In 2021, a group of scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia’s science agency, took soil-gas measurements in and around some of these salt lake depressions, finding “persistent hydrogen concentration” in the soil, and especially at the edges.
“This work is the proof that fairy circles, in the meaning of H2 emitting structures, are present in Australia and opens the door to new prospectivity pathways by evaluating original hypotheses on natural hydrogen generation, migration pathways and entrapment,” research authors Emanuelle Frery, Laurent Langhi, Mederic Maison, Isabelle Moretti said the study, published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.
The team also noted: “The natural hydrogen system is still poorly understood and needs to be studied in new geological contexts.”
Natural hydrogen is sometimes referred to as ‘gold’ or ‘white’ hydrogen. While the world has known for many decades about hydrogen accumulating under the earth’s surface, the phenomenon has largely been ignored because there had simply been no market for hydrogen.
While research of natural hydrogen is lacking, it is believed to originate from two main underground processes. The first is called ‘serpentinisation’ and is a reaction between iron and water.
Serpentinisation is believed to have given rise to the natural hydrogen found in these Western Australian “fairy circles.” Essentially the reaction occurs when water comes into contact with iron rich rocks in the subsurface, deep enough to be unaffected atmospheric oxygen. “Then those iron-rich rocks, they effectively want to rust, they want to turn into iron oxides… so they will strip the oxygen atom off the H2O and that releases the hydrogen,” HyTerra executive director and chief technical officer, Avon McIntyre, previously told pv magazine Australia.
HyTerra is one of a number of Australian companies looking to develop natural hydrogen projects.
In February 2022, pv magazine reported that in the past year exploration licenses amounting to one third of South Australia’s total landmass have been either granted or applied for by companies in search of natural hydrogen.
*The renewed interest in South Australia’s natural hydrogen potential came, according to Australian energy consultancy EnergyQuest, from the “chance rediscovery” of historical reports of two wells drilled in the 1930s where high purity hydrogen was detected.
Of all Australian states and territories, South Australia has the most favourable regulatory environment for natural hydrogen exploration today.
The Western Australian government is believed to be currently working on amending its regulatory environment to enable natural hydrogen exploration.
–
*Article amended September 14 to clarify the origins of South Australia’s natural hydrogen regulations.
The original article stated the favourable regulatory environment in SA “isn’t because South Australia is particularly bountiful in natural hydrogen accumulations, but simply that the state is the only jurisdiction currently with favourable exploration regulations.” South Australia has in fact been home to noteworthy natural hydrogen discoveries in the last century, and while this doesn’t preclude natural hydrogen discoveries in other jurisdictions, these historic discoveries have impacted its regulatory environment.

“The challenge to transition Australia’s electricity system to accommodate more renewable energy sources is not the race to develop new solutions – it’s about the targeted investment in deploying existing technologies and the infrastructure to store and transmit energy to provide reliable continuous supply,” the report says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/12/australian-vanadium-secures-new-land-agreement-plugs-towards-delayed-vision/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023","Australian Vanadium secures new land agreement, plugs towards delayed vision","Australian Vanadium Limited, or or AVL, has signed a “new” option agreement to purchase land for its vanadium processing plant at Tenindewa, 60 kilometres east of the port city of Geraldton in Western Australia.
In both 2019 and 2020, AVL signed option agreements to purchase land for the processing plant, and is now saying this new agreement replaces the previous option agreements and allows AVL to define, subdivide and purchase a portion of the land under option.
Under the agreement, AVL is granted a licence to access the option land immediately for the purpose of drilling, engineering, surveying and excavation, it said in its statement to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).

Back in April 2022, AVL announced its feasibility studies into a vanadium mine near Meekatharra, part of its two-pronged “pit to battery” strategy, found the mining project to be “bankable.” At the time, the company said it expected to reach financial investment decision (FID) for the mine by fourth quarter of 2022, with construction to commence in the fourth quarter of 2023.
This has not come to pass, and given the company first signed land agreements for the Tenindewa land four years ago, it would appear the company’s vision is not as easy to realise as it previously anticipated.

AVL is not the only vanadium hopeful in Australia to face delays. In 2022, Perth-based mining technology company TNG Limited, owner of the major vanadium Mount Peake Project in the Northern Territory, had its leadership team ousted in what was described as a  “masterclass” in shareholder activism.

Grant Wilson, a former Australia Financial Review columnist and hedge fund manager, took over as the company’s new director after running a campaign criticising the slow progress of the Mount Peake project, which promised to begin construction in 2018 but was still finalising engineering and approvals some four years later.
There are currently just a handful of vanadium mines operating in the world, with Australia home to some of the world’s biggest untapped deposits.
In June this year, critical minerals company Vecco Group celebrated the official opening of Australia’s first commercial-scale vanadium battery electrolyte manufacturing facility in Townsville. The vanadium used in that production will initially be imported, but like AVL and TNG (now renamed Tivan), Vecco is developing its own mine to feed into the processing and manufacturing arm of its business. It is hoping for its Debella Critical Minerals Mine, located near Julia Creek, about 650 kilometres west of Townsville, to begin production in 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/12/acen-to-triple-its-investment-in-australian-renewables-to-6-billion/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,PHILIPPINES",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2023",ACEN to triple its investment in Australian renewables to $6 billion,"ACEN Corporation, owned by Ayala Group, is deepening its involvement in Australia’s renewables sector, with the company’s president and CEO, Eric Francia, confirming the Philippines-based company will triple its investment here from the current $2 billion to $6 billion over the next three years.
The commitment followed Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese’s, trip to the Philippines last week where he met with Eric Francia and signed a strategic partnership agreement with the nation’s president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. 
“I met Eric Francia, the CEO of ACEN, an energy company focusing on renewables,” Albanese said. “They currently have $2 billion of investment in Australia. They have a large presence in New England region, in Tasmania, as well as investment coming in Western Australia in the Pilbara.”

“They expect that investment to increase to $6 billion in three years – a substantial investment in Australian renewables, putting online something like three gigawatts [ 3 GW] of additional capacity in the Australian energy market,” the prime minister added.
ACEN’s CEO later confirmed these figures, adding: “our projects are particularly reliant on the Central West Orana renewable energy zone and the Marinus Link transmission projects, among others.”
While Marinus Link has long been controversial, and recently had its scope downgraded, concerns over New South Wales’ (NSW) renewable energy zones are emerging with the new state government raising the alarm that the zones, the bedrock of the state’s decarbonisation roadmap, are already delayed and facing cost blowouts. ACEN says it has over 1 GW of solar capacity in operations and under construction in NSW already.
Coming back to the growing ties between Australia and its neighbours, prime minister Albanese has been on tour in Southeast Asia these last weeks, kicking his journey off in Indonesia where he met Indonesian President Joko Widodo to forge closer economic ties in the transition to clean energy, as well as Indian prime minister Narendra Modi.
It will mean closer cooperation on defence, more trade, and stronger bonds between our peoples.

The strategic partnerships with both Indonesia and the Philippines come off the back of Australia’s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040.
ACEN Corporation has had a busy year in Australia, finalising its acquisition of UPC\AC Renewables Australia in February, resulting in it taking full ownership of the planned 720 MW New England and 400 MW Stubbo solar farms. The acquisition also saw it take control of UPC/AC’s development pipeline which reportedly has more than 8 GW of solar, wind, pumped hydro, and energy storage planned in Australia.
In January, the company also announced it had signed a green term-loan facility with a syndicate of major international banks worth $277 million as part of its ambition to raise more than $600 million to help grow its renewables capacity in Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.
At the time, the company said it had more than 1.5 GW of projects across NSW, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia “under construction or at an advanced stage of development.”
In total, ACEN has approximately 4 GW of generation capacity in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Australia, an estimated 87% of which is from renewables.

Shell has put Sonnen up for sale, according to Handelsblatt. The German news outlet now values Sonnen – which Shell acquired for for €500 million ($835 million) four year ago – at €1.35 billion to €1.8 billion. The oil giant reportedly wants to sell off all of the German energy storage company, or at least 51% of it.
Sonnen, one of the world’s largest providers of PV home storage, has experienced continuous growth in recent years. It holds a strong position in Germany, other European markets, and the United States.
The company also recently doubled its production capacity in Wildpoldsried, Germany. However, it declined to comment on the Handelsblatt report when contacted by pv magazine.
“In principle, Sonnen is continuing its global growth course in the rapidly expanding storage market,” said a company spokesperson.
Shell has also declined to comment on the matter.
Shell acquired charging infrastructure specialist Ubitricity and Next Kraftwerke in 2021., but now it seems to want to withdraw from the residential storage business. It recently sold its retail electricity and gas business in Germany and Great Britain to Octopus Energy.
