For a mid-size regional city, Bundaberg has an impressively recognisable name. It’s done this buy attaching that name to sugar, rum, and ginger beer. Perhaps, like me, you’d never drawn the link between those products – but really they start the story of Bundaberg’s 150 years of industry co-location.
How Bundaberg is using yesterday to create tomorrow is where it gets interesting. Bundaberg is aiming to be Australia’s first ‘bio’ economy – an umbrella term encompassing green energy produced by agricultural waste and extending all the way to the green hydrogen industry its inspiring.
The plan, which is already well on its way and gaining momentum by the day, is being spearheaded by none other than its local government. “Sugar’s had its day and its declining,” Ben Artup, Bundaberg Regional Council’s Executive Director of Strategic Projects and Economic Development, told pv magazine Australia. The big opportunity for regional Australia, he says, is in the renewable energy space. “We’re going to play in this space and this is going to be our contribution,” Artup said.
Bundaberg Regional Council
In October 2020, Bundaberg opened a bioHub the city’s disused wastewater plant, a nine acre plot just across the way from Bundaberg Sugar and Bundaberg Rum’s facilities. The plant already features biodigesters which are processing the city’s agricultural waste (of which, there is literally tonnes – an estimated 25% of agricultural products rot on the farms). Bundaberg is keen to diversify its economy, but its doing so by using its agricultural origins as a springboard.
The bioHub’s next step and biggest opportunity will come in the form of green hydrogen production. Utilitas runs the site’s biodigesters and it has teamed up with California-based technology company ReCarbon. Together the pair are looking to produce 200kg of green hydrogen from the bioHub by 2021, before scaling up to a tonne daily. The question is, who is going to take that hydrogen so soon, especially given that the fuel’s transportation and storage put fairly hard edges on uptake.
Bundaberg Regional Council
This is where the Bundaberg Regional Council comes in, though not just as necessary deep-pocketed supporters, but co-creators. In February, the council facilitated its first Bundaberg Bio-Hydrogen Technology Cluster. From that event, a partnership between the government’s local waste truck supplier, Superior Pak, and Singapore-based Hyzon Motors was born. While Hyzon is headquartered overseas, its CEO and co-founder, Craig Knight, is Australian and has been paying attention to the oft-overlooked Australian market for fuel cell technology. After being introduced at the Bundaberg event, Hyzon and Superior Pak entered into a commercial arrangement to create hydrogen-powered garbage trucks. Hyzon will provide drive train and fuel cell technology and Superior Pak will deliver the rubbish collection element of the truck.
But what have garbage trucks got to do with the bioHub? In short, the Council are the glue sticking these two plans together. It’s planning to lease the fuel-cell garbage trucks being manufactured by Hyzon and Superior Pak for its own fleet, stepping up to pay what it acknowledges is a green premium to get the technology off the ground.

With that settled, the council suddenly has a need for hydrogen, entering into a two-year offtake agreement with Utilitas and ReCarbon at the Bundaberg bioHub and guaranteeing a minimum purchase amount with the hub for two years. Not only does this offtake agreement financially kickstart the green hydrogen production element of the bioHub, it means Bundaberg will have a refuelling station, crucial piece of infrastructure enabling future growth.
“We’ve identified within the region, the key to getting that actually happening is having a refuelling station. People can invest in the vehicles but you need is the refuelling station – that’s an important piece of infrastructure,” Emily Murray, Bundaberg Council’s Industry and Investment Advisor and Artup’s green energy co-conspirator, told pv magazine Australia. “That then enables other industry in the region who have their own emissions targets or social licensing things, that’s then there for them. They don’t have to go and organise for the refuelling infrastructure or work out the logistics because its all here ready.”

There’s an earnestness about Artup and Murray’s approach, which necessitates a degree of courage rare in government. That is, they don’t flinch away from the fact their vision will not easily realisable. “It’s going to take a lot of work, it’s going to be disruptive,” Artup says.
The council’s role as glue doesn’t just refer to its capital’s sticking power either. These projects and partnerships didn’t land in the region thanks to the grace of god. Before the town held its first hydrogen cluster meeting, a model which is being popularised across the country, the council actually convened 80 national and international delegates in 2020 for the stated purpose of exploring Bundaberg’s transition to a bio economy. The Bundaberg Bio Economy Conference, as it was aptly named, was organised in part by Artup and Murray through stunningly simple means: picking up the phone.
“We just google stuff and research it and then I say to Emily, ‘can you ring [the key people involved] and get them up here? Just think of a reason to invite them here and explain what we’re doing and just have a conversation?’” Artup says frankly.
Bundaberg Regional Council
“From there it snowballs… we haven’t got to the boundaries yet where we’re not meeting someone new every single day,” Murray says. “We’re talking to these really high level technical hydrogen experts and then we’re connecting them… we’re the middle guys, we just work for local government – but it seems to be working.”
Indeed it does, the council’s magic phone has managed to reel in Professor Ian McKinnon, Queensland’s strategic hydrogen advisor and a professor at the Queensland University of Technology. Both Artup and Murray still seem to be in disbelief at his involvement and willingness to help build the region’s green hydrogen competency. For them, collaborating with not only industry but also academic institutions like the Queensland University of Technology and the Central Queensland University has helped them piece together both a viable vision and deep understanding of a complex energy ecosystem.
You couldn’t describe Artup as anything other than chuffed when he talks about the momentum that’s built around Bundaberg in the past year. “Industry will start talking about us without us being in the room, and that’s the best PR we can get,” he says.
Bundaberg Regional Council
Artup, Murray and their colleagues, it turns out, are actually be building on another long tradition in Bundaberg: green energy solicitation. Ken Mathews has long been in the solar game – his company Clean Holdings is looking to develop a solar project in Bundaberg on 350 hectares of Bundaberg Sugar’s land. “Bundaberg, we got involved there initially because the ex-mayor reached out to us,” Mathews told pv magazine Australia. He said he was invited up to Bundaberg, shown around and encouraged to scale up the ambition of the project – which is still getting land approval, a process which Mathews notes has actually been fast tracked by Queensland’s Cooordinator General. “When we went, [the project] was going to be a small example, but it grew very rapidly,” he said.
In an interview which veered into the philosophical, Andrew Horvath said he believes the primary job of government is to set conditions that maximise potential. The words stuck. It seems to me that Artup, Murray and presumably many of their colleagues in Bundaberg see their roles as just that. “It takes a vision,” Artup says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/17/rystad-says-cost-looms-as-hurdle-for-green-hydrogen-industry/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 17, 2021",Rystad says cost looms as hurdle for green hydrogen industry,"Australian governments and industry have embraced the potential of green hydrogen with 38 GW (AC) of assets already announced but new analysis from independent consultancy Rystad Energy has warned capital expenditure costs need to slashed by 75% for it to be cost competitive with fossil-fuel alternatives.
The Australian Government has committed to green hydrogen – generated by electrolysis powered by solar PV and wind energy – as a fuel for the future, formally recognising it as a ‘priority technology’ in the Technology Investment Roadmap announced late last year.
The government, which reaffirmed its commitment to the technology at the recent G7 Plus Summit in England by signing new partnerships with both Germany and Japan to support hydrogen initiatives, has set an economic ‘stretch goal’ to produce green hydrogen for $2 per kilogram.
At that price green hydrogen is expected to be cost competitive in applications such as producing ammonia as a transport fuel and for firming electricity and will help Australia capture a significant share of the growing global export demand for the renewable fuel.
Rystad Energy senior analyst David Dixon has however declared reaching the $2p/kg target shapes as a real challenge, saying detailed examination of cost factors in Australia showed green hydrogen would struggle in the foreseeable future to be cost competitive with gas produced using fossil fuels.
“At the present time we have a cost, best case scenario, of about $5 per kilogram of hydrogen,” Dixon said. “We see $3 as foreseeable but $2 becomes extremely challenging.
“A lot needs to go right in order for this to work.”

Dixon last week released details of a year-long investigation into the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) in Australia.
The analysis, based on a 100 MWh electrolyser facility powered by current solar PV and wind technology, included more than 2,400 simulations for every state investigated and took into account the AC capacity of the solar and wind assets, and the capex and opex of all elements in the equation.
The investigation identified electricity costs, the electrolyser capex and the opex of the electrolyser as the three key components of the LCOH and determined the costs of all facets would need to come down to reach the government’s stretch goal.
“Our numbers suggest you need to reduce the capex of the total system, that is the electrolyser, the PV and the wind by 75% as well as improve the capacity factor in order to get to the government target of $2p/kg of hydrogen,” he said.
Dixon said the required cost decline is foreseeable for hydrogen electrolysers as they start to get built at scale but warned achieving similar reductions for PV and wind it is going to be a real challenge with electricity makes up the bulk of the LCOH.
“The wind and PV costs have to come down by over 50% and this is a very, very big challenge in a mature industry,” he said. “And in the short term, we’re actually predicting costs of key equipment to go up as commodity prices rise, not go down, so $3 is foreseeable and $2 is very, very challenging.”

The report shows gains in electrolyser efficiency, including firming during periods of low demand on the grid, would also be critical in reducing costs but Dixon said even with the foreseeable reductions, the LCOH would still be above the $2p/kg target.
“If the capex of electrolysers reduces 60%, we can knock off a $1, if we build utility PV and wind at a scale and thus benefit from the economies of scale, you knock off about 50 cents and if you firm between off-peak hours you can reduce that further but it still only takes you to $3p/kg,” he said.
“There has to be a shift or subsidy even at scale in order to displace the existing production of hydrogen from steam methane reforming.”
While costs remain a hurdle for the industry, the Australian government remains committed to hydrogen, signing a new accord with Germany which will see the two nations invest in a new series of initiatives designed to accelerate the development of a hydrogen industry.
Included in the initiatives is the establishment of the German-Australia Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (HyGATE) with both countries to commit up to $50 million to support pilot and research projects along the hydrogen supply chain.
The new accord will also see the two countries exploring options to facilitate the trade of hydrogen and its derivatives produced from renewables from Australia to Germany.
Australia also announced a new agreement with Japan to jointly support initiatives that will help drive transitions to net zero emissions with a focus on clean technology such as hydrogen.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said international collaboration focused on technological innovation is key to getting new energy technologies like hydrogen to commercial parity.
“Our ambition is to produce the cheapest clean hydrogen in the world, which will transform transport, mining, resources and manufacturing at home and overseas,” he said.
“We have a mix of all the key ingredients needed to be a major global player in a thriving global clean hydrogen industry – abundant land and energy resources coupled with an excellent track record and reputation as reliable energy partner.
“We have set the goal of producing hydrogen at less than $2 a kilogram – ‘H2 under 2’, the price at which hydrogen becomes competitive with higher-emitting alternatives.”
The government believes the green hydrogen industry could add $11 billion to the economy by 2050 and potentially as much as $26 billion, depending on how quickly global demand grows.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/17/victoria-declares-energy-emergency-with-yallourn-power-station-at-risk/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 17, 2021",Victoria declares ‘energy emergency’ with Yallourn Power Station at risk,"The Victorian government has declared an energy emergency after Energy Australia revealed flooding last week had created significant cracks in the Morwell River Diversion wall which protects the Yallourn Power Station and adjacent mine site.
Victorian Environment and Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said on Thursday the diversion wall could “breach at any moment with very little notice”, and it was clear swift action was needed to stabilise the mine walls and to ensure ongoing energy security.
“We need to take swift action, and the best way to take swift action is declaring this energy emergency,” D’Ambrosio said.
“These measures will help to protect the Yallourn mine from flooding and ensure Victoria continues to have a steady supply of energy.”
The declaration will allow Energy Australia to undertake emergency works, without going through normal planning and regulatory approvals, and divert river water away from the site, relieving water pressure on the mine walls.
If the mine floods, the power station could stop operating or operate at a significantly reduced capacity, potentially for months.
Yallourn, which supplies about one fifth of Victoria’s power, has already been operating at a reduced capacity in the wake of last week’s storm and associated flooding but Energy Australia said it continued to meet demand.
“Yallourn’s generation output is being maintained at an appropriate level to help conserve coal while also ensuring that demand for energy continues to be met,” the company said in a statement.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) said that despite the damage to the Yallourn mine and the impacts it is having on power generation there are no forecast supply issues for Victoria, due to low winter demand and the diversity of Victoria’s energy generation.
Victorian Greens deputy leader Ellen Sandell said the government’s decision to announce a state energy emergency reinforced the unreliability of coal and highlighted the need to move to more distributed renewable forms of energy.
“If the government needed any more evidence that coal is unreliable and we need to urgently transition towards more distributed, renewable energy, here it is,” she said.
“What a disaster. Coal is totally unreliable, and on its last legs, but both Labor and Liberals refuse to see it.
“It’s time governments stopped propping up coal and came up with a plan to end our addiction to it and support jobs and communities in the transition.”
The Yallourn Power Station was due to close in 2032 but Energy Australia earlier this year announced it would be retired by mid-2028 with the electricity retailer to replace it with a four-hour 350 MW capacity big battery.

Meanwhile, the damage caused by the storms which struck the state on June 9, continues to impact with Ausnet Services revealing on Thursday that about 3,000 customers would likely be cut off from power until July 10.
The transmission network service provider said restorations in parts of the Dandenong Ranges will take longer than expected with challenges including fallen trees, rugged terrain and in some cases severe damage to the network.
“Estimated restoration times for storm affected customers have changed,” the company said in a statement.
“We now fully understand the extent of the damage and the scale of the recovery and repair ahead of us. We now know that some repairs will take several weeks to complete.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/17/nsw-to-invest-record-380-million-for-renewable-energy-rollout/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 17, 2021",NSW to invest record $380 million for renewable energy rollout,"The NSW government will invest a record $380 million as part of the 2021-22 state budget in a bid to ramp up investment in new solar, wind and energy storage projects as it prepares for the impending retirement of its coal-fired power generators.
Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the money, to be announced in Tuesday’s state budget, will be spent over the next four years in implementing the state’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, that passed parliament late last year.
Under the roadmap, the government plans to bring online 12 GW of new large-scale solar and wind energy and 2 GW of storage by 2030, creating 6,300 construction jobs and 2,800 ongoing jobs.
“The roadmap is expected to attract $32 billion of investment over the next decade and create thousands of jobs,” Perrottet said in a statement on Thursday.
Energy Minister Matt Kean said the funding package is the government’s biggest investment in large-scale renewable energy in the state’s history, supporting “the most ambitious renewable energy policy in the country”.
“With four of our five coal-fired power stations due to reach the end of their technical lives in the next 15 years, we are on the clock to replace them before they close to keep the lights on and prices down,” he said.
“The roadmap is expected to deliver NSW families and businesses some of the cheapest electricity in the OECD and will set the state up for success in a low-carbon world.”
The budget funding boost builds on more than $110 million of existing funding commitments set aside by the NSW government to establish renewable energy zones (REZ) in the state’s central-west, New England, Riverina, Hunter and Illawarra regions.
It is expected the latest funding will ensure transmission upgrades in the Central West-Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, are ready by the end of 2022. It will also help finance the establishment of a Consumer Trustee, Financial Trustee and Regulator to ensure competition in the new REZs benefits consumers.
The NSW budget announcement comes after Queensland government unveiled its budget on Tuesday, including a $2 billion investment in solar, wind, pumped hydro and battery storage projects.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the $2 billion Renewable Energy and Hydrogen Jobs Fund would help the state become “a renewables, hydrogen and manufacturing superpower” and deliver on a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
The Northern Territory Government has also rolled out its 2021-22 budget, allocating $4.8 million towards existing renewable energy schemes.

FRV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Abdul Latif Jameel, said the plant’s output will be connected to Ergon’s distribution network, allowing it to supply and take electricity from the grid and trade in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
FRV Australia managing director Carlo Frigerio said the hybrid facility is designed to be operated as a predictable and dispatchable generation plant, providing a reliable energy output to Queensland customers.
“Battery energy storage systems are needed to support further investment in Queensland renewables and help maintain system security and reliability,” Frigerio said.
“This project will be critical to Queensland’s future energy supply and security as renewable energy capacity increases, with storage supporting solar and wind power coming into the market when it is most needed.
“The inclusion of PV as part of the project shows the importance of integrating solar and batteries in order to deliver dispatchable power.”
Spanish EPC contractor Gransolar Group (GRS) has secured the contract to build the Dalby Hybrid Power Plant.
GRS Australia managing director Carlos Lopez said the plant will have the ability to access the maximum number of markets and revenue streams, including arbitrage and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS).
Lopez said while the Dalby facility is Gransolar’s first hybrid project, the energy management system has been tested in different electricity systems and is capable of operating under different grid codes and providing different applications such as energy arbitrage, ancillary services and/or microgrid control.
“The Dalby Hybrid Power Plant is a very interesting and promising project for the Gransolar Group,” he said.
Construction of the project is scheduled to be completed in December with the facility expected to be fully operational by early 2022.
FRV global managing director Felipe Hernandez said the Dalby project is part of the company’s  long-term investment plan to develop energy storage projects globally.

“FRV is already collaborating with governments, regulators, and partners around the world to lay the foundations for a new energy model,” he said.
“Energy storage will play a central and critical role to fully realise the power of renewable energy, and FRV acknowledges the value of this technology as a key element to achieve a decarbonised society.”
The Dalby Hybrid Power Plant is FRV’s ninth project in operation or under construction across the NEM, including the 125 MW Lilyvale Solar Farm in Queensland, the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria, and the  69.75 MW Goonumbla Solar Farm in New South Wales.
FRV has also achieved financial close on the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm, commenced construction on the 90 MW Sebastopol Solar Farm, and continues to develop the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm, all in NSW.
The Dalby Hybrid Power Plant is among a raft of battery energy storage systems planned for Queensland as the state government looks to continue its transition to renewable energy.
The 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South BESS project, being developed by Singapore-based Vena Energy, is nearing completion with connection to the transmission network now in the final stages.
The state-owned energy company Stanwell is progressing plans to develop a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to the 1.4 GW Tarong Power Station site near Nanango in the South Burnett while the state government has announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries, with a combined capacity of 40 MWh in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/17/aldi-takes-first-place-in-supermarket-race-to-100-renewables/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 17, 2021",Aldi takes first place in supermarket race to 100% renewables,"Back in August 2020, German discount supermarket chain Aldi, Australia’s 67th largest electricity user, become the first Australian supermarket to commit to 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2021. Yesterday, Aldi announced that it had achieved 100% renewable electricity six months ahead of time, making it the first Australian supermarket to have all its offices, stores and warehouses powered by renewable energy alone. 
The result is already palpable to Aldi, who has seen its CO2 emissions drop by 85%. To achieve this goal, Aldi’s longtime solar partner Epho Commercial Solar (Epho), recently acquired by AGL, has refined its processes, managing to install 100 solar systems atop Aldi sites in 100 days. In addition, Aldi signed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with two wind farms (Dundonnell Wind Farm in VIC, and the Collector Wind Farm in NSW), and acquired market renewable energy certificates. 
Aldi Australia CEO, Tom Daunt, said that he hoped “other businesses across the country are encouraged by what we have been able to achieve and accelerate their own plans around renewable energy.” 
According to Aldi the solar rollout across its network of freestanding stores continues, with more than 104,000 panels installed across 274 stores and six distribution centres since 2015. Epho has contributed 24.5 MW of that rollout.
“Supporting Aldi with their renewables ambition makes the Epho team immensely proud,” said Oliver Hartley, Epho’s managing director. “Last year,” Hartley continued, “at the peak of the program, we delivered 100 solar systems on Aldi stores in 100 business days. This kind of speed is only possible because Aldi and Epho have built a strong partnership over the years.” 
Epho is no stranger to supermarket clients. In July 2020, Epho dramatically called in air support via the use of a helicopter to lift its solar systems onto 12 separate rooftops at Woolworths headquarters after restricted crane locations forced the installer to think outside the box. 
But of course, it takes a certain manner of confidence to call in a chopper, the kind of secure confidence provided by experience. Epho and Aldi partnered up way back in 2015, but only delivered one store installation in that year and one more the following year.
Now Aldi has more on-site solar systems than any company in Australia, most of them 100 kW systems installed in that 100 business day period, but also featuring larger urban solar power stations on distribution centres such as that at Regency Park, South Australia (650 kW), Brendale, Queensland (1 MW), Derrimut, Victoria (1.4 MW), and Dandenong, Victoria (1.5 MW).

Researchers from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in Saudi Arabia, have fabricated an organic solar cell with an ultra-thin electrode coating that is claimed to raise the efficiency of this kind of PV device by 0.9%.
The scientists decided to build the electrode with a hole-transporting molecule called Br-2PACz and not with commonly-used thin films based on PEDOT:PSS, which is a conjugating-based polythiophene polymer. This compound was bound to an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode to form a single-molecule layer.
The new coating was tested on an organic cell developed by the KAUST scientists and its efficiency rose from 17.5% to 18.4%. “Br-2PACz increased the cell’s efficiency in several ways,” the research group explained. “Compared with its rival, it caused less electrical resistance; improved hole transport; and allowed more light to shine through to the absorbing layer.”
Moreover, the Br-2PACz also improved the structure of the light-absorbing layer itself, which the scientists attributed to the coating process. The latter is claimed, in fact, to enable the recyclability of the solar cell, as the ITO electrode can be removed from the cell’s coating and be used for other applications.
The discovery of the new material for the electrode coating, according to the Saudi team, may revolutionise the research in organic solar. “We believe Br-2PACz has the potential to replace PEDOT:PSS due to its low cost and high performance,” said KAUST researcher Yuanbao Lin.
