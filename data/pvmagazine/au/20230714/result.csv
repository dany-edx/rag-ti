Inpex, which operates the Ichthys LNG plant near Darwin in the Northern Territory, said the purchase will be made through its newly established subsidiary, Inpex Renewable Energy Australia.
In a statement, Inpex said that upon the finalisation of the transaction it expects to jointly control EGPA, overseeing the company’s current renewable generation portfolio and continuing to develop its project pipeline, “targeting an increase of the developer’s installed capacity.”
“This ensures EGPA will continue to drive the energy transition underway in Australia, accelerating its contribution to achieve the country’s net zero target,” Inpex said.
EGPA’s operational assets include the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in Victoria and its 51% stake in the Bungala 1 and Bungala 2 solar farms, which deliver a combined 220 MW of generation capacity into the grid in South Australia.
It has also commenced construction on the 93 MW Girgarre Solar Farm in central Victoria and the 76 MW Flat Rocks wind farm in Western Australia.
Enel said it is also developing “a significant portfolio of wind, solar, storage and hybrid projects across Australia, alongside expanding its activities in innovative solutions within its retail and trading operations.”
Earlier this year it announced it had received initial approvals from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for a 96 MW solar farm and 20 MW battery energy storage system to be constructed at Quorn Park in the central west of New South Wales. It has also announced proposals for a solar and battery hybrid project at Bouldercombe in Queensland and the retrofit of battery storage at Bungala.
Enel said the transaction is in line with its current strategic plan, which “envisages the implementation of partnerships in certain businesses and geographies to enhance value creation.”
The closing of the sale remains subject to certain conditions, including clearance from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and Antitrust authorities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/14/dutton-wants-australia-to-join-nuclear-renaissance-but-this-dream-has-failed-before/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 14, 2023",Dutton wants Australia to join ‘nuclear renaissance’ – but this dream has failed before,"The same phrase was used 20 years ago to describe plans for a massive expansion of nuclear. New Generation III plants would be safer and more efficient than the Generation II plants built in the 1970s and 1980s. But the supposed renaissance delivered only a trickle of new reactors – barely enough to replace retiring plants.
If there was ever going to be a nuclear renaissance, it was then. Back then, solar and wind were still expensive and batteries able to power cars or store power for the grid were in their infancy.
Even if these new smaller, modular reactors can overcome the massive cost blowouts which inevitably dog large plants, it’s too late for nuclear in Australia. As a new report points out, nuclear would be wildly uncompetitive, costing far more per MWh than it does to take energy from sun or wind.
Early in the 21st century, the outlook for nuclear energy seemed more promising than it had in years. As evidence on the dangers of global heating mounted, it became clear that the expansion of coal-fired power in the 1990s – especially in Asia – had been a mistake.
And despite the prevalence of slogans such as ‘Solar not Nuclear’, the cost of solar and wind energy was then too high to make fully renewable systems a reality.
The rise of Generation III and III+ designs promised to eliminate or at least greatly reduce the risk of accidents like those at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.
The time seemed right for a nuclear renaissance – especially in the United States. Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied for construction and operating licenses to build 31 new nuclear power reactors. But all but two of these proposals stayed on paper.
The first, in Georgia, is expected to be completed this year after running way behind schedule and way over budget. The other project in South Carolina was abandoned in 2017 after billions of dollars had already been poured into it. The same disastrous cost and time blowouts have hit new reactors in France (Flamanville, 10 years behind schedule), Finland (Olkiluoto, which opened this year after a 14-year delay) and the UK (Hinkley Point C, still under construction with cost and time blowouts).
China has built a trickle of new nuclear plants, commissioning three or four a year over the last decade. China currently has about 50 GW of nuclear power capacity. This pales into insignificance compared to the nation’s extraordinary expansion of solar, with 95-120 GW of additional capacity expected this year alone.

What went wrong for nuclear? Despite the claims of some nuclear advocates, the renaissance in the 2000s did not fall short because of political resistance. Far from it – the renaissance had broad political support in key markets.
And, unlike in the 1970s where intense anti-nuclear sentiment was tied to fears of nuclear war, environmentalists in the 2000s had refocused on the need to stop burning carbon-based fuels. Anti-nuclear campaigns and protest marches were almost non-existent.
What stopped the nuclear noughties was a bigger problem: economics. Governments looking at nuclear saw the cost and time over-runs and decided it wasn’t worth it.
As megaproject expert Bent Flyvbjerg has shown, cost overruns like these are typical. First of a kind nuclear plants offer an extreme example of the problem. To date, no Generation III or III+ design has been produced at scales large enough to iron out the inevitable early problems.
At the same time, other energy sources were growing in importance. The United States found ways of tapping its unconventional shale gas reserves.
All the while, solar and wind were getting cheaper and cheaper, driven by generous subsidies from European governments such as Germany and manufacturing economies of scale in China. Solar and wind production ramped up exponentially, growing around 30% a year every year since the beginning of the century.
In Australia, the writing was on the wall by 2007, when an inquiry found new nuclear power would struggle to compete with either coal or renewables. A string of subsequent inquiries have come to precisely the same conclusion.
To make nuclear viable these days, advocates believe, means making it safe, cheap and easy to build. No more megaprojects. Instead, build small reactors en masse on factory production lines, ship them to where they are needed and install them in numbers matching the needs of the area.
Advocates hope the efficiency of factory production will offset the lower efficiency associated with smaller capacity. Ironically, off-site mass production and modular installation is the basis of the success of solar and wind.
To date, the most promising reactor design is NuScale’s VOYGR. It has yet to be produced and the US company has no firm orders. It does have preliminary agreements to build six reactors in Utah by 2030 and another four in Romania.

If all are built, that’s still less than the capacity of a single large Gen III plant. More strikingly, it’s about the same as the new solar capacity installed every single day (~710 MW) this year around the world.
Even with US government subsidies, NuScale estimates its power would cost $132 (USD .90) per MWh. In Australia, average wholesale prices in the first quarter of 2023 ranged from $64 per MWh in Victoria to 114 per MWh in Queensland.
So why, then, is Australia’s opposition still talking about new nuclear? Dutton claims Australia’s future nuclear submarines to be built under the AUKUS deal are “essentially floating SMRs”. This is a red herring – while submarine reactors are small, they are not modular.
The simplest answer is political gain. Announcements like this yield political benefits at low cost.
The U.S., U.K. and France have decades of experience in nuclear power, even if failures outnumber successes. So yes, there is a slim chance the latest “nuclear renaissance” will succeed in these countries.
But in Australia, promises to create a nuclear power industry from scratch based on as yet unproven technologies and in competition with cheap renewables is simply delusional.

The NEM is rapidly transitioning to higher penetrations of renewables with the ongoing exit of coal-fired generation, development and connection of new utility-scale generation and energy storage, and sustained growth in distributed energy resources (DER).
The NEM has delivered several renewables milestones in the past year including reaching 68.7% instantaneous penetration of renewables on 28 October 2022.
AEMO said the rapid growth of renewables suggests there will be enough resource potential to reach 100% of grid demand, for a small number of dispatch periods, as early as 2025.
While the intent is to have the system ready for the first 100% instantaneous renewables period, AEMO Future Energy Systems Manager Chris Davies said the challenge is managing the high penetrations of variable, inverter-based renewables like wind and solar generation, which make up the majority of new renewables coming into the NEM.
AEMO
“Readiness for 100% instantaneous renewables is a critical enabler for being able to operate the power system regularly with high penetrations of renewables, in turn supporting the transition to a net zero energy system,” he said.
“The transition requires a concerted effort across industry, and this report summarises the major engineering and operational readiness activities that AEMO intends to progress in this next financial year.”
The priority actions outlined in the report focus on four key areas, including accelerating efforts to support new technologies such as grid-forming inverters to address system needs, ongoing studies of the power system, and building operational readiness.
The fourth focus area centres on enabling higher penetrations of DER including rooftop solar, small-scale batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs) with AEMO saying it expects the trend for a significant increase in the number of DER connecting in the NEM to continue.
“So it is essential the right frameworks are in place to address existing and potential challenges,” the operator said.
The engineering roadmap, which builds on the 2022-23 report, points to the roll out of new compliance regulations for small-scale DER standards, the development of coordination and aggregation capability, and potential new connection requirements for projects of less than 5 MW.
“This is a critical area of focus because poor integration can reduce the visibility, predictability, and controllability of the power system, posing a risk to power system security,” AEMO said.
AEMO said another key focus will be on enabling new technologies to address system needs, including accelerating efforts to support the development of grid-forming inverter technology.
“A range of technologies will be needed to meet future power system needs, delivering capabilities to replace the essential system services that will no longer be available from large synchronous generators when they are offline,” the report says.
AEMO has called for industry input on the Engineering Roadmap to 100% Renewables program, which will be open to stakeholder feedback until 31 July 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/14/viridian-solar-presents-new-residential-inverters/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2023",Viridian Solar presents new residential inverters,"Viridian Solar, U.K.-based manufacturer of roof-integrated solar panels, has unveiled new inverters for applications in residential PV projects.
The company said it will offer its new Clearline Inverters in combination with its roof-integrated solar installations.
“Our new inverter products mean we are ready to offer the complete package,” the company said in a statement. “In fact, a number of our housebuilding partners have already added Clearline Inverter into their solar specification.”
Viridian offers the new product in five versions, with power outputs ranging from 1 kW to 3 kW and an efficiency ranging from 97.2% and 97.6%. The European efficiency is 96.4% to 97.2%. The maximum input power of the smallest device is 1.3 kW, while the biggest inverter is 3.9 kW.
The products have dimensions of 295 mm x 230 mm x 113 mm and weigh 5 kg. They include one MPPT input and a voltage range of 500 V to 600 V, with a maximum input voltage of 600 V. The inverters have IP65-rated protection and cooling systems based on natural convection.
The company said that the new product is suitable for solar installations ranging from 0.67 kW to 3.6 kW and will be released for sale in September.
“Research on solar fire safety has highlighted that the two main points of failure in a solar PV system were the DC connectors and the DC isolation switch,” the company said. “Clearline Inverter will only be available with an integrated DC isolator switch, eliminating the risks associated with a site assembled external switch.”
Viridian Solar did not say where the new product is being manufactured.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/14/research-identifies-existing-fences-as-low-cost-racking-solution-for-pv-deployment/,"MARKETS,RESEARCH,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 14, 2023",Existing fences identified as low-cost racking solution for PV deployment,"An American-Canadian group of scientists has suggested using existing fences in animal farms as a low-cost racking solution for solar modules.
“This is perhaps the lowest-cost approach to racking,” the research’s corresponding author, Joshua M. Pearce, told pv magazine. “What we did is show that at least one PV module between two upright posts is mechanically acceptable for every type of conventional farm fencing. In this case, the racking is almost free.”
The researchers identified three main typologies of fencing: fences based on multiple battens placed between the main posts to support the fence wire; fences using posts on which the fence wires or mesh are attached; and fences utilizing prefabricated meshes of various designs suitable to the need and sometimes aesthetics. “Normally for fences, high tensile steel wires and mild steel wire are predominantly used,” they noted. “Their diametric dimensions are generally 4 mm, 3.15 mm and 2.5 mm for high tensile (HT) wire and mild steel wires.”
In order to ascertain if an existing fence may be used for solar deployment, developers should first investigate if the fence can withstand a certain wind load in a specific location with the addition of PV panels, as well as the region’s topological, geographical and climatic challenges. In this regard, the group said special attention should be given to line post size and spacing play, adding that the main factors to be carefully considered are the height of the fence, footing depth, design and size of mesh fabric, as well as the material strength of the posts.
The scientists also explained that wind load measurements should be taken via the Main Wind Force Resisting System (MWFRS) and Components & Cladding (C&C) procedures, as well as by the Open Source Wind Load Calculator, which is a tool used to calculate the wind load on a fence in a given region in the United States. “The program outputs the wind loads in terms of the base shear force in pound force (lbf) and base moment in feet pound force (ft- lbf),” they specified, adding that they calculated for a range of wind loads from 80 mph to 150 mph (129 km/h to 241 km/h).

The academics conducted a series of field tests using three Cheetah HC 72 M monocrystalline PERC panels manufactured by China-based JinkoSolar. They said their installation was performed quickly by two people, with the mounting of a single module requiring seven minutes and a total of four zip-ties.
They also conducted a series of simulations for retrofitting existing farm fencing for a wide range of farms, including sheep, goats, pigs, cows, and alpaca, and found solar projects based on the proposed approach would be economically viable in the United States.
“The cost of the racking retrofit is only the cost of four stainless steel zip ties per module, which can be purchased in 120 packs for $11 or about 37 cents per module,” they explained. “If the modules range in power from 250 to 500 W then the racking cost of an existing fence is less than a penny a Watt.”
Pearce said the research group also laid out what would be an optimal inverter strategy depending on how much energy a farmer would need. “Small-scale farmers can use the free ebook to set up the design for the system, do the install with metal zip ties themselves, and then only need to call an electrician to attach to the grid,” he concluded.

The scientists presented their findings in the paper “The potential for fencing to be used as low-cost solar photovoltaic racking,” published in Solar Energy. “Future work is necessary to determine the full scope of the benefits of this approach of vertical PV agricultural fencing on a global scale,” they said, looking forward to how to improve the proposed methodology.
The research team comprises academics from the Western University in Canada and the Michigan Technological University in the United States.
