The McGowan Labor government’s Smart Energy for Social Housing program intends to install $6 million worth of solar panels across 500 social housing properties over a period of four years, as part of the WA Recovery Plan’s $66.3 million renewable energy technologies package announced in July last year. 
WA Housing Minister, John Carey hailed the results so far as, “a great outcome for public housing tenants on low incomes who will benefit substantially from a reduction in their annual power bill and freeing up of income for other essentials.”
Since December, a total of 80 homes of three bedrooms or more have now had systems installed and the next phase of the program will be expanded to complexes with one and two-bedroom townhouses or homes, and apartments.
Synergy installs and maintains the systems, and tenants are also given access to Synergy’s Future Communities Plan, which offers a discounted rate for electricity consumed during times of lowest demand and greatest solar feed in — between 9am and 3pm each day — to the state’s main electricity grid, the Interconnected Southwest System.
Synergy is working with tenants “to increase their savings by encouraging the use of major appliances such as the washing machine or dishwasher during daylight hours”, said WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston.
The rollout of solar to public housing is part of an Australia-wide trend for governments to extend the savings conferred by PV to people who can most benefit, but who, as low-income tenants, have too many hurdles to overcome to install solar themselves.
The South Australian Housing Virtual Power Plant, which will ultimately see 4,100 Housing SA homes provided with 5 kW of solar and a 13.5 kWh Tesla Powerwall, recently began an innovative bolt-on trial to extend its reach.
It offered 20 housing trust homes that were unsuitable for solar (whether because of structural limitations, shading or poor aspect to the sun) a free Tesla battery, which allows them to store energy generated within the VPP or by the grid when solar output is highest and prices are lowest, for use at other times of day.
As SA Energy Minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan told the ABC in June, “A battery alone, as part of the Tesla VPP, can still deliver 29% savings on electricity prices,” compared to what “other housing trust and public housing homes are receiving.”
Having extra batteries in the grid in South Australia also assists to soak up the state’s daytime oversupply of solar, rebalancing supply by creating timely demand. 
In New South Wales, solar delivered straight up by state government-funded programs to more than 6,000 social housing homes in recent years has been delivering savings of up to $1,000 per annum on household energy bills.

At Solar Professionals, a regional solar installer based in Wagga Wagga, which commenced a new contract in April to install a total of 3 MW of solar on 800 Aboriginal Housing Office (AHO) homes, Managing Director Dan Kimber said that as partners of the AHO since 2017, “we’ve installed thousands of solar systems on public housing and seen the outcomes firsthand — the solar program provides real economic benefits.”
New social housing being called for in every jurisdiction should of course come solar- and/or battery-enabled, but retrofitting the current housing stock for low-income tenants shows significant returns that build on carbon reduction benefits.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/06/a-closer-look-at-australias-solar-stopper-market-reforms/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2021",A closer look at Australia’s ‘solar stopper’ market reforms,"In the past week there have been some incredibly exciting predictions from the Australian Energy Market Operator: in just five years Australia’s main grid could be powered at times by 100% renewable energy, including up to 77% by rooftop solar alone.   
But there’s a suite of reforms on the table that threaten to stifle this rapid and sensible transition to clean energy. 
In the rooftop solar space, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has just ruled that Distribution Network Service Providers can now charge solar households for exporting their energy into the grid. 
This rule change is intended to address apparent grid issues caused by excess rooftop solar energy feeding into the grid. Yet even after a year or more of consultation on the proposal, serious concerns remain about whether export charges are justified and how they might impact consumers. 
In the final determination, the AEMC talked up several ‘consumer protections’ in their ruling, but on close inspection these don’t hold much water. 
Firstly, the AEMC has stated that export charges will be ‘optional’, which is true – up to a point. The new rules require networks to provide consumers with an export option that has no charge for ten years. But if consumers do choose this option they could have their export limit, and therefore their export income, slashed considerably. 
As an example, an export charging proposal put forward by South Australian Power Networks, one of the proponents of the rule change, suggests a 1.5kW limit without charge, down from the existing 5kW limit in SA. This means consumers will have to pay up for exporting or have their exports and solar income slashed to approximately a third of what it is now. In other places it could be less, or even a zero export limit; there’s no minimum export amount that networks will be required to provide. 
This is another key point of contention in the rule change. One of the arguments for allowing networks to charge for exports is to stop them from imposing static zero export limits, which restrict solar households from exporting any solar at all. But the fine print shows that networks have been given a big out in the rules which allows them to still impose zero export limits if they deem it necessary, despite collecting revenue to prevent such limits. 
Existing solar customers only get an exemption from charges until 2025, perhaps long enough to cover system payback periods, but not accounting for any long-term financial calculations made by households who invested in solar in good faith. 
And we’re still left with the fundamental question of how export charging will affect the uptake of rooftop solar and our transition to clean energy. Consumers are seeing the reward for solar investment continue to plummet with dropping feed-in tariffs alongside these new charges, despite the important role of rooftop solar in our energy transition. A transition which could be slowed if households decide to restrict their solar exports, or not invest in solar in the first place. 
The good news is that export charges aren’t yet a done deal. States and territories may decide to block solar export charges in their jurisdictions. Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio has already come out of the gate strongly, saying that the Victorian government “won’t be allowing Victorians to be charged for the extra power they send to the grid” as they “don’t believe this proposal is a benefit for Victorian solar owners.”
Queensland, another opponent of the ruling in its draft form, may follow suit, along with other states and territories. 
Large scale renewables are also facing stifling new reforms.
The Energy Security Board (ESB) has just released its recommendations for the post 2025 energy market. Our outdated energy system undoubtedly needs reforming, but some of the proposals have set alarm bells ringing for the clean energy sector – and anyone concerned about a speedy transition to renewables. 
The proposal gaining the most attention is the call for a Physical Retailer Reliability Obligation (PRRO), a ‘capacity market’ mechanism, that would essentially pay large generators, primarily coal and gas plants, just to exist. The idea, championed by federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor, is to pay large generators for the capacity that they could supply, rather than what they do supply.
As coal fired power stations age and become increasingly unreliable and unprofitable, this mechanism could amount to a subsidy to prop up these plants beyond their use by date – and it will come straight out of the pockets of consumers. Recent analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and Green Energy Markets shows it could cost as much as $7 billion and add up to $430 to household electricity bills every year. 
Yet there’s no certainty of reliability in return for this big spend; under such a proposal there’s no guarantee that generators will supply the energy needed, just that the capacity is there to do so. 
The latest predictions from AEMO, referenced above, show that the pipeline of renewable generation and transmission projects should ensure a reliable grid – if the pipeline stays on track. Introducing this capacity market mechanism, referred to by some as ‘coal-keeper’, could disrupt market signals, creating extra risk and uncertainty for clean energy investors, and prolong the life of increasingly unreliable and high-emitting coal plants.
The other alarming proposal is the recommendation for a congestion management model (CMM). Similar to ‘coal-keeper’ above, this has been called the ‘solar-stopper’, with concerns it poses an even bigger threat to solar and wind projects. The proposed CMM could impose congestion charges on generators that are built outside of proposed renewable energy zones, or added to the zones after they’re already established. 
Groups like the Clean Energy Council have raised concerns that this would also add additional uncertainty for investors attempting to forecast revenues for new clean energy projects, and may actually disincentivise new transmission projects that could help ease congestion. 
These reforms, driven by a federal government that is still clinging to the fossilised idea of a ‘gas-led recovery’, could seriously hinder Australia’s renewable progress. Once again, the onus will fall on states and territories to lead the way on sensible and ambitious clean energy policies.
New South Wales Energy Minister Matt Kean has already expressed concerns about the capacity mechanism, and is keen to carve his own path to build a reliable, renewable-based grid in the state. 
All state and territory energy ministers now have the opportunity, and responsibility, to rebuff these backwards ‘reforms’ that would needlessly keep us stuck in the fossil fuel dark ages, and move us forward into our bright clean energy future.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/06/unsw-study-channelling-rooftop-pv-into-water-heating-is-a-residential-super-saver/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2021",UNSW study: channelling rooftop PV into water heating is a residential super saver,"Self consumption of rooftop solar-generated electricity is Australia’s cheapest electricity bet, never mind that sucking up the solar onsite helps electricity networks manage grid voltage and power quality at times of peak solar generation. 
Although batteries are the logical answer to saving lunchtime solar for later, they’re still too pricey for most homeowners. A new study led by Dr Baran Yildiz of the University of New South Wales’ School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) shows that storing excess lunchtime solar in the giant thermal battery — an electric hot water tank — already onsite at more than 50% of Australian households can save them an extra $100 a year on their electricity bills for minimal upfront investment.  Aaaand homeowners can still have 20-30% of their excess solar to play with.
“Hot water storage tanks can store more energy than a Tesla Powerwall, in thermal form,” Yildiz tells pv magazine Australia. And although that energy is not recoverable as electricity, it serves a relentless residential need — water heating typically makes up around 25% of a household’s electricity demand.                                       
For the purposes of the study, Yildiz and the Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM) team developed an intelligent water-heating control (IWHC) tool in collaboration with Solar Analytics, which channels excess rooftop generation into the household water heater. The IWHC makes its decisions based on a household’s PV generation characteristics, electricity consumption and hot water use patterns, and real-time energy monitoring.
The IWHC — a complexity of algorithms in a simple piece of hardware — was pitted against two commercially available tools: timer-based switching of excess solar energy into water heating, and more sophisticated diverter technology, which has so far not been widely adopted.
The three technologies were each installed and tested in around 10 households and the resulting data was validated and parlayed into simulation models that were then applied to a broader set of electricity data from 380 Australian households in the greater Brisbane, greater Sydney and greater Adelaide areas.
Although the diverter tech came out on top in terms of savings delivered, at an average $170 a year, its higher upfront cost means that the cheaper IWHC, delivering $100 average savings, is a more cost-effective solution. The timer came in at $80 average annual saving.
The results indicate that, “on average, households can utilise 2.4 kWh, 1.8 kWh and 3.4 kWh, of daily excess distributed-PV generation for water heating, using the IWHC, timer and diverter, respectively”, says Yildiz’s paper (Assessment of control tools for utilizing excess distributed photovoltaic generation in domestic electric water heating systems), published in the 15 October edition of the journal Applied Energy.
The outcomes were surprising to Yildiz on a number of fronts. Firstly, he says the research showed, “we can provide 48%, almost half, the daily requirement of energy for heating water using excess solar generation while providing 100% customer comfort”. That is, you’ll always get a nice hot shower.
Then, he says the fact that there’s still residual — between 20% and 30% — excess solar, opens up the possibilities of further deploying this cheapest energy source for other household duties, such as “pre-heating or pre-cooling the house, or for charging electric vehicles …” or for timely use of an electric pool pump or pool heater.
Head of School at SPREE, Professor Alistair Sproul, emphasises the benefits of using excess solar to keep hot water topped up compared to the now old-world idea of heating water with off-peak energy — at night, when demand used to be at its lowest.
Off-peak electricity tariffs (discounted between 10pm and 7am) were introduced “when New South Wales had an abundance of coal-generated electricity and it wanted to keep them running — you don’t want to ramp these things down too much overnight,” Sproul told pv magazine Australia.
Off-peak electricity tariffs, he explains, were introduced to push gas-fired hot-water heating out of the game —  “They were deliberately designed to cannibalise the gas industry, so the electricity industry could flourish.”
Despite the fact that demand is now often overwhelmed during the middle of the day by an abundance of PV generation, and wholesale electricity prices can spin into the negative, electricity retailers are still propping up night-time demand by offering “off-peak” rates.
Says Sproul, “The off-peak electricity tariff in NSW is probably now 12 to 14 cents per kilowatt hour between 10pm and 7am, but what’s the lifecycle cost of PV coming off your roof?”
He calculates that rooftop PV, installed at even $2,000 per kilowatt (which is at the higher end of the range) “is about seven or eight cents a kilowatt hour — to the consumer who uses it”.
“Baran’s paper shows that if you can avoid buying electricity from the grid, even at 12 cents a kilowatt hour off-peak, by using your PV excess in the middle of the day to heat your water, you can make savings,” concludes Sproul.
Self consumption of rooftop solar also has environmental benefits in that the electricity generated is immediately used on site rather than being exported to the grid for use elsewhere; that is, any transmission of electrons results in losses along the line, whittling away at the original bounty of renewable energy.
Yildiz says the outcomes of SPREE’s hot-water-as-a-super-solar-soaker study have already informed the Australian Energy Market Commission’s plans to better integrate energy storage systems into the National Electricity Market, and that energy distribution network service providers, such as AusGrid, Energy Queensland and Endeavour Energy are keen to apply the IWHC technology, which is likely to be scaled up in the near future.
“With this paper,” says Yildiz, “we wanted to show that it’s fine to invest in batteries, but we already have hot water heaters — why don’t we implement this easy, low-hanging fruit first!”

The company, which provides a peer-to-peer “experience” platform on which would-be EV drivers can spend time online and ultimately test drive an EV (test drives will be available as soon as COVID regulations allow) with people like themselves who’ve already made the switch to clean-drive vehicles, also took home the competition’s grand prize of $50,000 from Humanitech (a think-do tank established by the Australian Red Cross in partnership with Telstra).
“Now more than ever, we need to support organisations like Whirl to amplify their impact and scale on the fight against climate change,” said Alastair Pryor, head of the Humanitech Lab, who was involved in judging the more than 60 Australian entrants to the ClimateLaunchpad training and mentoring program.
Previous Australian alumni of the global startup enabler include Sunovate, which developed technology to simultaneously cool rooftop solar panels, increasing their lifespan and efficiency, and channel put the captured hot air to further good use.
The other 2021 Australian finalists, who will join Whirl in virtual participation in the Southeast Asian final of ClimateLaunchpad’s global competition in October, are SEE Labs, which is repurposing old EV batteries for use in light vehicles in India; and Woodify, which has developed software that enables builders to easily swap traditional materials for more sustainable options.
Whirl, the trading name of Give It A Whirl Pty Ltd, also aims to promote EV options, not a hard sell, through its EV-owning ambassadors and the partnerships it hopes to form with EV rental, ride-share and secondhand businesses.
“We’re not selling anything,” Dini tells pv magazine Australia. “We want to encourage people to try clean technologies through peer reference.”

The company currently has some 15-20 ambassadors on its books, who own different EV makes and models, in various parts of Australia, and with different approaches to their EV ownership; some, for example, have rooftop solar which they use to charge their vehicle, some have more than one EV, some combine EV, PV and home battery storage.
For $29 would-be EV drivers can book time with a Whirl ambassador and, for the moment, their experience will be online, but even in the virtual world the value is in cutting to the chase and asking the kinds of questions that you might not find a ready or reliable answer to on a search engine, such as: “What’s it really like using a public charger?”, or “Everyone says the warranty and insurance on EVs is equivalent to petrol-driven cars, but what did you actually pay?”
Soon, the experience will encompass the Whirl team’s original intention, to provide EV test drives that are not tied to a sales pitch, that are local to the would-be EV driver, at a time to suit their schedule, and that come with an unbiased guide to the world of electric mobility.
“The idea is ‘Come give my car a whirl, see what you think,’ without having any pressure to buy. We really want to let people share an experience, realise that EV technology is mature and fun, and normalise it,” says Dini.
Ambassadors are vetted and coached by Whirl, and the rules of engagement are that each party treats the other with respect.
The Whirl team is constantly looking for new ambassador recruits —they’re typically enthusiasts who have done their homework on EV models and ownership, and are keen to share their experience.
So far, during testing and development of the platform, ambassadors have contributed their time on a volunteer basis, but as the partnership side of the model builds, they will be offered rewards in kind, such as discounts on a public charging network. 
Dini is also working to set up an ambassador’s-only area online, where they can debrief, talk about their client conversations and engage in some friendly competition. 
She’d like to gamify their participation, providing “credit scores for the number of sessions each ambassador hosts”. And if they do happen to deliver an outcome or perhaps a sale, it’s recognised as an achievement.
“If you’re interested in sustainability, and you’ve sold five EVs even though you’re not an EV salesperson, that’s a carbon contribution! It’s something to be proud of,” says Dini.
In Australia, ClimateLaunchpad is run by Climate-KIC Australia, an innovation community that aims  to inspire and enable climate action, by working as a catalyst for innovation in the clean-tech field.
Dini says Climate-KIC was incredibly supportive of participants, and that the program of “focused sprints on key topics” was particularly valuable.
“When you have an opportunity to spend a whole day looking at your business model, or at the way you’re messaging your value proposition, with support from expert trainers in entrepreneurship and innovation, then you’re really well guided to an outcome,” she says.
Whirl has been online with its virtual offering for a month, and is also building up a blog portfolio of appealingly packaged information. For example, “We just put out a summary of the top four electric SUVs under $70,000, because we know the SUV is the biggest selling class of car in Australia and if we’re going to see more of them sold, we want as many of them as possible to be electric,” Dini says.

The charms of New Zealand, it appears, have become attractive to solar developers as well as end-of-the-world-fleeing Silicon Valley billionaires.
Three English solar developers today announced the formation of a joint venture to develop a 350 MW utility scale solar pipeline in New Zealand, having been attracted by the clear environmental commitments made by Jacinda Ardern‘s government; a lack of the grid congestion which is hobbling PV in neighbouring Australia; and high levels of solar irradiation – compared to England, anyway.
Hampshire-based Hive Energy today announced the formation of its HES Aotearoa joint venture along with the Exeter-based Ethical Power Group that Hive acquired half of in November, and fellow installer and developer Solar South West, which takes its name from its location in Crewkerne, Somerset, in southwest England.
The press release issued by Hive today did not specify whether the stakes held by each partner would be evenly split and did not indicate any finalised plans for solar farms as yet.
The statement did, however, point to the commitment made by Ardern’s Labor government to have an entirely renewables-based electricity system this decade and its decision to stop issuing gas exploration licenses.
Quoted in the press release, Hive CEO Giles Redpath said: “This new joint venture with Ethical Power and Solar South West presents an exciting opportunity to deliver Hive Energy’s mission to support a cleaner, greener future, through its pipeline of nearly 350 MW of solar assets. New Zealand’s excellent natural conditions for solar energy, along with its opportunities for grid connections and support from the government, presents a unique opportunity for HES Aotearoa.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/06/flexible-solar-panel-for-vehicle-integrated-applications/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2021",Flexible solar panel for vehicle-integrated applications,"From pv magazine Global
Germany-based solar panel manufacturer OpesSolutions and the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP have developed a flexible, lightweight standard solar module for vehicle integration that is claimed to be particularly suitable for cargo bikes, as well as for electric buses, trucks and vans.
“For a light commercial vehicle charged with the current electricity mix, integrated solar panels can reduce annual CO2 emissions by up to 890kg and reduce operating costs by providing electricity for refrigeration systems,” the panel maker said in a statement. “In buses, with their large roof areas, integrated photovoltaics can provide up to 100% of the HVAC system’s energy needs – especially helpful when the engine is off.”
Called SolFlex, the frameless panel is based on 22%-efficient solar cells and is designed for high, one-sided heat load. The standard product measures 100x100x2.9cm, weighs in at 3.4kg, and has a power output of 170 W. Its open-circuit voltage is 24.23 V and its short-circuit current is 9.55 A. A customised panel may also reach a power output of up to 600 W and have a size of 3,000×1,200×2.9mm.
The module has, also, a bending radius of up to 15 degrees and a scratch-resistant surface. “Innovative interconnection, integrated bypass diodes and half-cell technology ensure optimum yields even with shading and low irradiation,” the manufacturer further explained, adding that the panel can be produced at lower costs, compared to similar products, as it relies on series production located in Changzhou, in China’s southern Jiangsu province.
Electric cars incorporating PV panels on their bodywork or roof have the potential of reaching more than 10,000km per year of pure solar-powered driving and the modules could have a payback time of only three or four years, according to a recent study from the Netherlands. The 10,000km range, however, is still difficult to reach for most electric cars that are currently on the market, due to their current vehicle energy efficiency. On the other hand, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and its power prices.
