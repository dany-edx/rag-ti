The renewable energy microgrid will incorporate an 8MW solar farm, 20MWh of battery storage and a 1MW green hydrogen plant. Construction of the project is due to commence this year and the microgrid is expected to begin operations by 2024.
“This is a major win for communities in the Daintree Rainforest, which will see reduced pollution and noise from diesel generators and will be a valuable demonstration of solar-to-hydrogen technology,” Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said on Monday.
“The renewable and hydrogen microgrid will use cutting-edge technology to reduce emissions and drive down costs by ending the community’s reliance on costly diesel generation.”
The microgrid, which has been the subject of a feasibility study, will store energy generated by the new solar farm and existing rooftop solar arrays by converting it to hydrogen.
The Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources described the project as the first of its kind anywhere in the world but Western Australian utility Horizon Power has been developing a microgrid that utilises solar and renewable hydrogen generation and storage at Denham, in the state’s northwest. The Daintree microgrid is expected to power about 700 homes.
“As a 100% renewable microgrid, the generation station will comprise a solar farm, battery storage, containerised electrical switchgear and a containerised hydrogen electrolyser and fuel cell,” the department said.
“The combination of solar generation and battery and hydrogen storage will ensure that sufficient energy is captured and stored to get the community through periods of low solar production like in the wet season.”

Assistant Energy Minister Tim Wilson said the microgrid will allow the Daintree community to cease its reliance on millions of litres of diesel fuel annually.
“Once completed, the microgrid will displace more than 4 million litres of diesel fuel consumed in the Daintree each year,” he said.
“It also presents a significant opportunity to develop key learnings that can be applied as we pursue further microgrid options across Australia.”
Local MP Warren Entsch said the project, which is to be constructed along roadways and on previously cleared land to avoid disturbing the ecosystem, is a game-changer for the Daintree community.
“Microgrid technology is becoming increasingly cost-effective, creating the opportunity for reliable, low-cost, off-grid power in communities like the Daintree,” he said.
“But more importantly, from an environmental aspect, it will remove the need to burn dirty and inefficient diesel in the Daintree, allowing residents to have access to a cleaner, more affordable, more reliable source of energy.”
The grant is being delivered under the Daintree Microgrid Program, following the feasibility study which was completed under the $50 million Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/07/cannon-brooks-puts-pens-down-after-agl-shuns-revised-takeover-bid/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 7, 2022",Cannon-Brooks puts ‘pens down’ after AGL shuns revised takeover bid,"Australian energy utility AGL Energy has shunned a revised takeover bid from a consortium led by Mike Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures and Canadian investment firm Brookfield Asset Management to acquire 100% of the company. The new deal was worth about $9 billion, including the company’s debt.
The consortium submitted a pitch for $8.25 per share over the weekend, a 75c per share increase on an initial unsolicited bid of $7.50 submitted in late February. The Canadian firm was funding about 80% of the bid.
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on Monday, AGL said the board had rejected the revised proposal, telling the market the offer was still “well below” the fair value of the company and not in the best interests of shareholders.
Chairman Peter Botten said it also fundamentally ignored the potential future value of the company through the proposed demerger.
“It also ignores the momentum we have recently seen in the business through our solid half-year result, strong progress on the demerger, strong interest in our Energy Transition Investment Partnership and the improvements we are seeing in forward wholesale prices,” he said in a statement.
Following the rejection, Cannon-Brookes said he and his consortium partner would be abandoning their bid to take over AGL.
“The Brookfield-Grok consortium looking to take private & transform AGL is putting our pens down – with great sadness,” he confirmed on social media.
“This weekend, the board rejected our raised offer of $8.25. 46% more than the price of $5.55 about 90 days ago.
“The board are proceeding with their demerger path.”

It’s expected AGL will now press ahead with its plan to split the company into two separate entities – green energy retailer AGL Australia and coal-fired electricity generator Accel Energy – by June 30.
“The proposed demerger will be a catalyst for the potential realisation of shareholder value,” Botten said on Monday.
“It will create two industry-leading companies with distinct value propositions.
“It will allow each business to be valued separately and more positively by the market on the basis of their own specific fundamentals.”
The proposed entities have been assigned emissions reductions targets, putting them on course to reach net-zero in 2040 and 2047 respectively.
In February, AGL announced it would bring forward the planned closure of the Bayswater black coal plant in New South Wales (NSW) to “no later than 2033” and Loy Yang A power station in Victoria to 2045. AGL’s coal-fired Liddell power plant, also in the NSW, remains on track to close in April 2023.
The Brookfield and Grok Venture consortium had planned, if its bid was successful, to accelerate AGL’s plan to exit from coal, and close all three of its coal-fired power plants by 2030.
Cannon-Brookes said the demerger plan was “a terrible outcome for shareholders, taxpayers, customers, Australia and the planet we all share”.
Greenpeace Australia Pacific chief executive David Ritter said the rejected bid represents yet another failure by AGL’s leadership, which “continues to demonstrate an outdated, evidence-free obsession with burning dirty coal”.
“AGL has consistently failed to read the market, the pace of the energy transition, and the extent of its environmental damage,” he said.
“The energy market is shifting at lightning speed away from coal, as shown by Origin’s recent announcement that it will close the Eraring coal-burning power station by 2025.
“But instead of grasping a lifeline and taking the path to inevitable decarbonisation, AGL has chosen to move ahead with a demerger that makes no environmental or financial sense.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/07/solving-the-epc-equation-for-utility-scale-solar-developments/,"FINANCE,INSURANCE,LEGAL,OPINION & ANALYSIS,QUALITY,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 7, 2022",Solving the EPC equation for utility-scale solar developments,"Some of the most critical risks facing utility scale solar developments in Australia are widespread delays and constraints in achieving connection agreements in a congested national grid, supply chain delays and workforce constraints arising from international and domestic responses to Covid-19 and the ever-present issue of unidentified site risks. At the same time, the insurance market has tightened and corresponding insurances have become more expensive.
In recent years, some EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) contractors have suffered heavy losses on solar projects, which has contributed to high-profile construction firms departing the Australian solar market and, in at least one notable instance, insolvency. Nevertheless, EPC contracts are likely to continue to be the most commonly used form of construction contract for utility-scale solar projects in most jurisdictions, given their flexibility and the value and certainty that owners and lenders derive from them. 
For the EPC contract to work best, to allocate risk effectively and to protect the parties, we recommend that it is carefully developed on a project-by-project, contract-by-contract basis. One size won’t fit all. Every project is different and project drivers will vary; for one project the key driver may be timely delivery, whereas for another it may be cost control.
Ultimately, the EPC contract is one part of a complex set of project documentation and agreements. We need to view the EPC contract not in isolation but in terms of how it fits in with other documents such as the connection agreement, power purchase agreement (PPA) and more. Managing the interfaces between the agreements will all feed into the way the EPC contract should be shaped. It is in everyone’s interests – investors, lenders, developers, contractors, offtakers, insurers – to get the risk allocation, drafting and timing correct.
From our experience partnering with our developer clients to solve their EPC challenges and get the best development service fee, we recommend attending to the following considerations.
1. Allocating risk should not be an automatic process, so critically examine the risk allocation to match the circumstances of every project. 
For example, if a project is being undertaken in an area with unknown geology and without the time to undertake a proper geotechnical survey, the developer may be best served by bearing the site condition risk itself as it will mean the contractor does not have to price a contingency it has no way of quantifying. This approach can lower the risk premium paid by the developer. Alternatively, it may wish to pay for the contingency in return for passing off the risk, which quantifies and caps its exposure. This type of project-specific analysis should be undertaken on all major risks prior to going out to tender.
2. Take care in selecting a contractor that has sufficient knowledge, expertise and available resources to execute the works. 
Given the significant monetary value of EPC contracts, and the potential adverse consequences if problems occur during construction, the lowest price should not be the only factor when selecting a contractor.
A major disadvantage of an EPC contract becomes evident when problems occur during construction. Developers should have limited ability to intervene. The more they interfere, the greater the likelihood of the contractor claiming additional time and costs. In addition, interference by the developer will make it substantially easier for contractors to defeat claims for liquidated damages and defective works (i.e. the contractor will be able to argue that it is not liable for either delayed or defective performance).
3. Pay attention to the interface of the EPC contract with the other agreements necessary to develop the solar project, such as the PPA, grid connection agreement, commissioning and testing regimes, equipment warranties, and the development application requirements. 
Smoothing the interfaces between all the project agreements is best dealt with at the contract formation stage, drawing on the expertise of experienced project and construction lawyers.
A variety of projects we have worked on in Asia, and more recently in Australia, have incurred significant delays and costs to determine the grid access obligations under the EPC contract. This experience has taught us that grid connection is a matter that must be resolved at the contract formation stage, to pave the way towards timely completion of construction, commissioning and testing, including generator performance standards and compliance with the requirements of the market operator.
It is also important to check that the commissioning and testing regimes in the EPC contract appropriately mirror the requirements for commercial operation under the PPA. Mismatches can result in delays, lost revenue and liability for damages, all of which have the potential to cause disputes.
The increasing size and complexity of utility-scale solar projects mean that the days are gone where schedules could be attached to the EPC contract at the last minute without review. Discrepancies between the relevant testing and commissioning requirements will only serve to delay and distract all parties from successful completion.
4. Don’t overlook the need for clarity in lines of communication with relevant government agencies, landowners, local communities, the project company and the contractor. 
At a fundamental level, it is imperative that the appropriate party corresponds with the relevant project stakeholders and that responsibilities are clearly articulated in the contract. Any uncertainty may see the contractor liaising directly with these third parties and possibly risking the relationship of the developer with key stakeholders and long-term neighbours. Significantly, the developer must develop and nurture the ongoing relationship with key stakeholders, particularly the offtaker.
5. The EPC contract must clearly articulate expectations and responsibilities relating to damages, guarantees and unforeseen events.
Given the role that delay and performance liquidated damages play in ensuring EPC contracts are bankable, it is vital that these clauses in an EPC contract are properly drafted so that parties cannot void liquidated damages liability on legal technicalities.
With the Covid-19 pandemic having impacted manufacturing and supply of key equipment and materials used in the construction of solar facilities in Australia and with uncertain times ahead as virus variants emerge, careful attention should be given to force majeure clauses so that all parties can better understand their legal and financial responsibilities. 
Although force majeure clauses are almost always included in EPC contracts, they are rarely given much thought unless and until one or more parties seek to rely on them. Especially in the current global environment, it is appropriate to examine their application. We favour explicitly defining what is included or excluded from the definition of force majeure, to provide greater certainty over generic references and subjective terminology, and to take the matter out of the hands of the courts and give clarity and control to the parties. We expect to see a greater emphasis on the categorisation of both Covid-19 and similar outbreaks in definitions of force majeure going forward. 
When a solar project falls into the shadow of adverse events, or when difficulties emerge between parties, the EPC contract will come under scrutiny. If it has been well developed, it can be the central factor in maintaining clarity of responsibilities and risk allocation. It will provide a strong foundation to steer the project through to a successful resolution and a bright future. 
6. Supply chain constraints may cause a rethink on the free issue of the generation equipment.
The concept of free issuing generation equipment is relatively new in the context of utility-scale solar developments. Previously, there has been a reticence from the contractor market to accept free issue of one or more categories of generation equipment due to a loss of margin. However, with much larger solar projects becoming more prevalent, the impact of the contingent liability of a supply chain failure (let alone an actual failure) on the balance sheet of a contractor may result in a rethink, albeit all parties (including lenders) need to carefully understand and work through the appropriate allocation of responsibility for a failure to meet the performance guarantees and defects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/07/monash-researchers-announce-lithium-sulphur-battery-breakthrough/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 7, 2022",Monash researchers announce lithium-sulphur battery breakthrough,"A team of researchers from Monash University’s Faculty of Engineering have redesigned the heart of a lithium-sulfur battery, creating a new interlayer that allows for exceptionally fast lithium transfer, as well as an improvement in the performance and lifetime of the batteries.
“It’s world-leading,” said Professor Matthew Hill, deputy head of the university’s Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering.
“A lot of our research has been about making the battery more stable and lasting longer, so this particular discovery is really exciting.”
With the world’s switch to emissions-free electrification accelerating, lithium batteries are playing an increasingly vital role as energy storage tools to facilitate that transition.
Lithium-ion batteries are the dominant technology, but Hill said lithium-sulfur batteries already offer higher energy density and reduced costs. They can store two to five times more energy per kilogram than the lithium-ion alternatives but previously, the electrodes in lithium-sulfur batteries deteriorated rapidly during the recharge process.
The research team, including Hill, Dr Mahdokht Shaibani, Professor Mainak Majumder and PhD candidate Ehsan GhasemiEstahbanati believe they have fixed that issue, developing a battery interlayer that allows for very fast charging, as well as an improvement in the life and performance of the batteries.
“The interlayer stops polysulfides, a chemical that forms inside this type of battery, from moving across the battery; polysulfides interfere with the anode and shorten the battery life,” Hill said.
“The new interlayer overcomes the slower charge and discharge rates of previous generation lithium-sulfur batteries. It means the battery can be charged and discharged hundreds of times without failing.”

Hill said the key to this latest discovery was going against the accepted norms and conventions of lithium battery construction.
“It’s ground-breaking technology, because in a regular lithium battery there’s about half-a-dozen components that make up the battery,” he said. “Most people research those, but hardly anyone has looked at changing the interlayer or separator in the middle. They tend to be fairly standardised, and until now we’ve assumed it didn’t matter too much if you changed them.
“Now we’re saying it actually does; we’re going against the accepted convention.”
Hill said the development shapes as a game-changer for lithium-sulfur batteries which do not rely on metals like cobalt, nickel and manganese, which are critical minerals found in lithium-ion batteries.
“These batteries are not dependent on minerals that are going to lack supply as the electrification revolution proceeds, so this is another step towards cheaper, cleaner and higher performing batteries that could be made within Australia,” he said.
This latest breakthrough, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, comes just weeks after scientists in the United States announced they had developed a lithium-sulfur battery using a commercially available carbonate electrolyte, that retained more than 80% of its initial capacity after 4000 cycles.
The group used a vapor deposition process which unexpectedly produced a form of sulfur that did not react with the electrolyte, overcoming one of the key challenges for this battery chemistry.

Researchers from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia have developed a solar-powered integrated water-electricity-crop production system that is able to produce water from atmospheric water vapour.
“Our system is suitable especially for off-grid communities anywhere as it provides an easy way of getting electricity, water, and crop products for point-of-consumption,” the research’s corresponding author, Peng Wang, told pv magazine.
Called WEC2P, the system relies on a PV system to generate power and an atmospheric-water-harvesting (AWH) material to produce water vapour from the air. The freshwater produced by the AWH device is used either to grow crops or to reduce the operating temperature of the solar modules. The system works in two operation modes, which the scientists called AWH-PV cooling mode and AWH-water and crop production mode.
The cooling device consists of a polyethylene (PE) anti-corrosion film with a thickness of around 0.04 mm, polymer-based atmospheric water-vapour sorbents, and a polyacrylamide-calcium chloride (PAM-CaCl2) hydrogel. “The as-obtained PAM-CaCl2 hydrogel was directly attached to the backside of each individual PV cell in the PV panels via its self-adhesion properties,” the Saudi group explained. “A poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plate-shaped frame was installed by spring bolts to reinforce the adhesion of PAM-CaCl2 hydrogel with PV panel and secure their close contact.”
The excess heat extracted during the cooling operations is used to drive the water to evaporate from the polymer-based sorbents during the daytime. This evaporated water vapour is then collected during the daytime in a condensation chamber that is utilised as a passive condenser.
The surface area of the condensation chamber, which is made of an aluminium alloy with a copper nozzle at the lower sidewall is 1.6 times, that of the overlying four south-oriented PV panels, which were deployed at a tilt angle of 22 degrees. A cotton wick passing through the nozzle was used to help the extraction of the condensed water into a water-collection bottle. “Each PV panel was considered as an independent module and was connected with an MPPT system and a 12-V lead-acid battery,” the scientists emphasised. “Furthermore, each module was connected with a total of 20-W light-emitting diode (LED) light strips as a load to discharge the battery at night when the PV panel was not in operation.”
The performance of this system design, both with and without the cooling system, was analysed at an outdoor testing facility aimed at growing spinaches located in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, over a 3-month period during last summer.
The proposed system configuration was found to allow a 9.9% increase in power generation thanks to a reduction of the operating solar module temperature by up to 17 degrees Celsius. The small spinach growth unit registered a crop surviving rate of 95%.
The costs of the systems haven’t been estimated so far by the researchers. “The performance is far from being optimised and thus it would be not possible to reasonably estimate the overall cost of the system when scaled up,” Wang affirmed.
The system was introduced in the paper An integrated solar-driven system produces electricity with fresh water and crops in arid regions, published in Cell Reports Physical Science.

The Filipino government agency responsible for irrigation has said it will offer up potential floating solar sites on its bodies of water as part of moves to deploy clean energy.
The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) has responded to comments by Vicente C Sotto III, the leader of the nation’s Senate, about plans to roll out multi-hectare solar-powered irrigation systems, by stating it has already installed one such facility, as well as hundreds of smaller scale solar pumps and a floating solar pilot project.
An article published on the NIA website yesterday said Sotto and fellow senator Panfilo M Lacson had told the Politiko news website about plans to use state funding to finance the roll-out of solar irrigation systems on plantations and paddy fields.
In response, the irrigation authority said it had already invested PHP1.52 billion (AU$40.3 million) installing 333 solar pumps across the nation which could irrigate 6,480ha and benefit 8,467 farmers. Based on those numbers, the NIA said, each unit of horsepower generated by the solar pumps required PHP360,000 (AU$9,567) and each hectare watered, PHP234,000 (AU$6,223).
The government body said it installed a 200kW, 2,500m2 floating solar demo project at the Magat reservoir, on the island of Luzon, in June 2019 and would offer up sites for similar projects on its other bodies of water, including the Pantabangam Dam, in the Nueva Ecija province of Luzon; and the Jalaur Dam, in the Iloilo province of Panay island, in the Western Visayas region.
Regarding the larger irrigation systems referred to by the senators, the NIA said it had already installed a five-station, 50-panel facility capable of watering 25ha of cornfields in Barangay Pacuan, in the Pangasinan province on Luzon.
