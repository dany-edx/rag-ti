The company says it will put the capital towards setting up a 200 MWh capacity production line. It will also help the company expand its market presence to Turkey, the US, Japan and India via new partners.
VFlowTech says it also plans to scale up the manufacturing of its larger 250 kWh modular PowerCube product. To date, the company has many deployments of its residential 30 kWh and 100 kWh units, but is now ready to cater to larger-scale customers.
VFlowTech’s PowerCube products have been deployed across Australia, the preferred technology of vanadium hopeful VSun, owned by miner Australian Vanadium Limited.
Led by Japan-based venture capital firm Real Tech Holdings, investors in the Series A round included Seeds Capital, Wavemaker Partners, Sing Fuels, Pappas Capital, Carbon Zero Venture Capital and Turkey’s İnci Holding.
The round comes just over a year after the company secured $4.3 million in a pre-Series A financing series.

In January, the Queensland government announced it would invest $75 million in a critical minerals demonstration facility in Townsville, which will process primarily vanadium, and also cobalt, high purity alumina, and rare earth elements.
Likewise, there are a number of vanadium mines and connected projects looking to get off the ground in the coming years, including the Australian Vanadium Project owned by Western Australian company Australian Vanadium Limited, or AVL. It is looking to build a vanadium mine near Meekatharra in the state’s midwest.
Perth-based mining technology company TNG Limited, which recently changed its name to Tivian Limited following a shareholder uprising which saw the company’s incumbent leadership ousted, is still working towards realising its vanadium Mount Peake Project in the Northern Territory.

In 1983, Martin Green and Andrew Blakers at the University of New South Wales produced solar cells with 18% efficiency, surpassing the 16.5% recorded previously. Over the next few years, they published cell results of 19% and 20% efficiency, and theoretically determined the maximum achievable efficiency to be close to 30%.
Green’s Lab at the University of South Wales held the global record for efficiency for 30 of the 40 years from 1983 to 2023, with Aihua Wang and Jianhua Zhao leading the work which eventually reached Green’s 25% efficiency target.

Recognising the important role PERC technology plays in the development of solar energy, the awardees published their findings with no patent, encouraging further developments within the field and driving down the cost of production to the benefit of wider society.
Through continued research and development, and the help of many others worldwide, the Queen Elizabeth Prize judges said the 2023 laureates significantly reduced the costs of solar panels, which has fallen by over 80% in the past decade. PERC technology, which introduced an additional layer on the back surface of solar cells to help prevent recombination and reflected unused photons back into the silicon to generate more electrons, is now the most commercially viable and efficient solar cell technology. It accounts for almost 90% of the global solar cell market.
The 2023 laureates will be formally honoured at the Queen Elizabeth Prize presentation ceremony and will receive GBP 500,000 ($865,000 / USD 602,000).
The International Energy Agency has forecasted global solar capacity to almost triple over the 2022-2027 period to become the largest source of power capacity in the world. Currently, solar represents about half of new-build electricity generation capacity worldwide.

The shifted
Last year, the peak body flagged waning investment in large-scale projects as cause for alarm – noting financial commitments in the utility segment in 2021 equated to just 2.11 GW, down from 3.16 GW in 2020.
This bearish trend shifted in 2022 however, with 4.3 GW of large-scale capacity achieving a final investment decision. That amounts to a growth of roughly 50%.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the “majority of this increase was after the May 2022 federal election,  “which proves renewable investors are responding positively to the Albanese government’s strong emissions reduction targets and know that Australia is back open for business in clean energy.”
While Bowen is lauding the numbers as a sign of what’s to come under the new government, utility-scale forecasts from solar and storage analyst Sunwiz are more downbeat.
While founder Warwick Johnston agrees 2022 was the best year to date for Australia’s utility segment, Sunwiz is predicting 2023 to be its “probable worst.”
There is currently 2.2 GW of large-scale capacity under construction, according to Sunwiz data – less than half of the 4.9 GW recorded in January 2021. “This means 2023 is likely to be a far leaner year for solar farm completion – quite possibly its worst since the before commencement of solar farm mass rollout in 2018,” Sunwiz concluded in its 2023 Annual SunWiz Australian PV Report.
As dreary as that sounds, there is of course a lag between decisions, financial close, construction and ultimately connection in large-scale projects so while the investment boost in 2022 might not lead to a bumper 2023, it should certainly change the forecasts for 2024 and beyond.

A team from the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra announced they had reached the first 30, achieving a 30.3% efficiency.
The perovskite and silicon tandem solar cell have ultra-high efficiency, while also enhancing the operational stability of the solar cells, said the team. The work builds on a previous record set by ANU researchers in 2020, and was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), who committed $40 million to help see the “Solar 30 30 30” stretch goal realised.
Research lead The Duong said the team brought into play the strengths of both widely-used silicon cells and perovskite cells, which are made from materials with a specific crystal structure revered for efficiency but notoriously unstable.
“With these tandem solar cells, the perovskite top cell can efficiently absorb the blue light and transmit the red light to the silicon bottom cell, producing significantly more energy from sunlight than each individual device,” Duong said.
Alone, the highest recorded efficiency for silicon cells is currently 26.81% in lab circumstances, but for commercially available modules it sits closer to 20%.
“Surpassing the 30% mark is significant,” Duong said. “That’s currently considered the efficiency threshold for the commercialisation of tandem technology like that used in our study. The current predictions are that tandem solar technology will be in mass production by 2026. However, more work is still needed to upscale and ensure the technology can be stable in the field over 25 to 30 years.” 
The ANU team is now working to further improve the efficiency and stability of the solar cells. Their findings have been published in Advanced Energy Materials.

Green growth is one of the seven priorities in India’s Union Budget 2023-24. As the nation targets net-zero carbon emission by 2070, “the budget builds on the government’s focus on green growth,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a speech this week.
The budget focuses on emerging clean technologies such energy storage, green hydrogen, and electric mobility. It also signifies the government’s resolve to boost domestic solar and battery manufacturing, while waiving import duties on capital goods and machinery needed to manufacture lithium battery cells for EVs.
The minister also announced viability gap funding (VGF) for battery energy storage projects with a capacity 4 GWh. A detailed framework for pumped storage projects will also be formulated.
Customs duty has been waived off on capital goods and machinery required to manufacture lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. This will come into effect from February 2 and will be applicable till March 31, 2024. The move follows the INR18,100 crore production-linked incentive scheme for advanced chemistry battery cells, providing further impetus to domestic battery manufacturing for green mobility.
The minister said India targets green hydrogen production capacity of 5 MMT per year by 2030. And that the recently launched National Green Hydrogen Mission, with an outlay of INR 19,700 crore, will facilitate transition of the economy to low carbon intensity, reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, and make the country assume technology and market leadership in this sunrise sector.
The minister also announced construction of inter-state transmission system for evacuation and grid integration of 13 GW renewable energy from Ladakh with investment of INR 20,700 crore including central support of INR 8,300 crore.
The budget provides INR 35,000 crore for priority capital investments towards energy transition and net-zero objectives, and energy security by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas.
For encouraging behavioural change, a Green Credit Programme will be notified under the Environment (Protection) Act. This will incentivise environmentally sustainable and responsive actions by companies, individuals and local bodies, and help mobilise additional resources for such activities, said the minister.
Industry stakeholders have lauded the budget announcements and stress on detailed policy structure and timely implementation of the measures.
NSEFI CEO Subrahmanyam Pulipaka expressed happiness that the Ministry of Finance has accepted their request to create a detailed framework for pumped storage projects in the country. “The viability gap funding announced for storage system with the capacity of 4 GWh will help penetration of solar as a dispatchable energy generation source,” he added.
Pulipaka also welcomed the continuation of nil basic customs duty (BCD) on specified inputs for use in the manufacturing of EVA sheets or backsheets, solar tempered glass, flat copper wire for use in the manufacture of photovoltaic ribbons that are used in the manufacturing of solar cells and modules. This will help the growth of solar manufacturing as well as the allied balance-of-system (BoS) manufacturers, especially as gigawatt-scale facilities come up in India under the two PLIs announced for solar modules.
Debi Prasad Dash, executive director, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA), said their demand for custom duty exemption on capital goods and machineries for Li-ion cell manufacturing has been met in this budget. Dash added that VGF for battery energy storage projects with a capacity 4 GWh will help to advance the battery projects in India and will support higher renewable adoptions for the grid. This will help SECI, NTPC and various state agencies to come up with more battery storage projects in India.
Under India Battery Supply Chain Council (IBSCC), IESA work with 50+ potential battery giga-factory and supply chain players and expect to see 140+ GWh of battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030. IESA released India Energy Storage Vision document last year which projects a grid-scale market potential of 160 GWh by 2030.
Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice president & group head-corporate ratings, ICRA Ltd, said the announcement of a VGF scheme for battery energy storage projects and the stated intent of coming out with a framework for pumped hydro projects is a positive for the RE energy sector, given the importance of storage for RE sources, which are intermittent in nature. However, the fleshing out of the details is awaited; and timely implementation of these measures will remain crucial.
“The proposal for investment in transmission lines for large-scale evacuation of green power from Ladakh is likely to support RE capacity addition and grid integration. The already announced National Green Hydrogen Mission with a target to produce 5 MMT of green hydrogen is also a positive, although the cost competitiveness of the same remains a key monitorable,” he added.
Srinivasan Viswanathan, chief executive officer of Vibrant Energy, said the budget is progressive and beneficial to the energy sector. “The statement on Green Growth is highly comprehensive, with a vision for the green hydrogen mission costing INR 19,700 crore, which would undoubtedly accelerate the energy transformation. The promotion of Ladakh green energy corridor is a welcome step. We appreciate the INR 35,000 crore capital investment for reaching the net zero goal, however, we look forward to receiving the policy structured in a detailed manner,” he said.

Sembcorp and Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA) have announced the successful commissioning of a 285 MWh energy storage system in the Banyan and Sakra region on Jurong Island, Singapore.
The large-scale system features 800 high-energy density lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries and occupies 2 hectares of land. It is the largest energy storage system in Southeast Asia, according to Sembcorp.
“Its rapid response time to store and supply power in milliseconds is essential in mitigating solar intermittency caused by changing weather conditions in Singapore’s tropical climate,” the company said in a statement. “It can also provide reserves to the power grid, which frees up power generation plants to generate more electricity to meet demand, when needed.”
A central control system regulates the batteries’ charge and discharge cycles according to grid needs. The integrated system also includes liquid cooling systems or built-in air conditioning systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures.
In addition, Sembcorp operates a 360 MW battery in the United Kingdom.
