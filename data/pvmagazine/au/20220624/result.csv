The investment will allow Evergen to further develop the company’s software platform that enables digital optimisation of the energy supply chain. The technology is used by retailers, network operators, asset owners and operators as well as consumers to optimise the function of their renewables assets, including residential, commercial and utility-scale solar and battery systems.
Evergen’s technology, developed by the CSIRO and backed by AMP Capital, also allows batteries, generators and loads to be orchestrated in fleets enabling energy generators, retailers and distributors to use these systems as Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).
Currently, Evergen controls more than 100 MW of renewables assets on its platform, including 7,000 residential home batteries.
Evergen chair and global co-head of infrastructure at AMP Capital, Michael Cummings, said the FRV-X investment is a significant boost for Evergen and will help it build the capability to service more large-scale renewable energy and battery projects in both Australia and overseas.
“They bring significant experience in energy markets and businesses worldwide and are the perfect partner to support Evergen on their next leg of growth in Australia and in key overseas jurisdictions,” he said.

The $15 million investment in Evergen buys FRV, which entered the Australian market in 2010, a significant minority stake in the business.
“They are exceptional operators and have built software products that provide significant opportunities to enhance the way renewable generation and storage assets perform at scale in a variety of contexts internationally,” FRV-X managing director Felipe Hernandez said.
A part of UAE-based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy, FRV and its affiliated companies have installed 2 GW of renewable energy generation globally. There is another 560 MW under construction and FRV is planning to double its installed capacity to 4GW in 2024.
In Australia, FRV has developed nine solar farms that are currently producing a combined total of 781 MW of electricity sold into the National Electricity Market (NEM). It also has a pipeline comprising ~7 GW of solar projects and ~1.3 GWh of battery storage.
Evergen chief executive officer and managing director Ben Hutt said FRV-X’s financial backing highlighted a new international readiness to invest in Australia’s renewable energy sector following clear policy signals set by the federal government.

“Australia is in a prime position to capitalise on renewable energy opportunities and the world has been watching and waiting for us to set a clear longer-term agenda for our energy future,” he said.
“Whilst FRV has been a long-term and committed investor in Australia since 2012, there has been hesitance from many other large-scale international investors to invest strongly and with confidence in the Australian market due to the confusion and disputes over renewable energy policy direction.
“The new government’s renewable energy focus is proving to be a green light for investors who are ready to back clean-tech companies like Evergen, and the current instability in electricity markets in Australia is evidence that the transition to renewables is accelerating faster than ever before.
“The world is looking to us to lead the way on a clean energy future.”

Singapore-based Sun Cable is seeking to develop a giant solar PV and battery energy storage complex on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory’s (NT) Barkly region. The project includes a 17-20 GW solar farm and between 36 GWh and 42 GWh of energy storage.
Once operational, AAPowerLink will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometre transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
The project is expected to cost more than $30 billion, and Sun Cable and its advisor PwC said it is likely to deliver investment of more than $8 billion to Australia and generate export revenue of $2 billion a year from 2028.
“The Australia-Asia PowerLink will be transformative for the country on multiple fronts,” PwC Australia chief executive officer Tom Seymour said. “This $30+ billion project is forecast to deliver a $24 billion boost to GDP over its lifetime, generating 1,100 jobs on average each year, supercharging the economic development of regional and Northern Australia.”
After completing its own assessment of the economic impact of the project, Infrastructure Australia, which first added AAPowerLink to its Infrastructure Priority Initiative List in 2021, provided its endorsement, recommending the project for commonwealth investment.

Infrastructure Australia acknowledged that delivering AAPowerLink “will undoubtedly be challenging but not insurmountable”, adding the project would provide an uplift in economic activity from spin-off industries to support the proposal’s construction and operation, as well potentially catalysing new industry investment to take advantage of lower energy costs.
The advisory body said the developers had produced a strong business case and were continuing to develop the project, including by securing environmental approvals, commercial agreements to underpin demand and final funding arrangements.
“Today’s announcement by Infrastructure Australia affirms that the AAPowerLink is economically viable and will deliver significant benefits for Australia and our region,” Sun Cable founder and CEO David Griffin said. “The AAPowerLink will enable a stronger economy for the long term through contracts, wages and economic diversification.
“It will spur enhanced capacity and skills in the construction and technology sectors as a result of jobs and training over the lifetime of the project, and pave the way for new green industries to be established, and to thrive.”
The project has already secured key approvals with the Australian government awarding it Major Project Status while the Indonesian government has approved the submarine transmission cable route.
Sun Cable hopes to reach financial close by the start of 2024 with construction to start in the same year. The first electricity is expected to be supplied to Darwin in 2027 with the project to be fully operational by 2029.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/24/market-suspension-lifts-but-underlying-drivers-may-stick-around/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 24, 2022","Market suspension lifts, but underlying drivers may stick around","However, from 4am on Thursday, 23 June, the market started to set prices again, meaning a road out of suspension is near. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) says that since the market was suspended, it has seen an improvement in market conditions, including ~3-4 GW of generation returning from outages, which has given AEMO the confidence to move to lift the suspension. If AEMO is happy with the pricing and operation of the market, then the market suspension could be lifted completely.
The level of unit unavailability over the past fortnight was among the key drivers of the market events that transpired. Therefore, their return to service should go a long way toward improving the supply/demand balance and lowering the requirements of AEMO to intervene manually.
It is important to note that even if the market suspension is lifted, one of the major underlying conditions which led to the Administered Price Cap being triggered is still present. High fuel costs remain and are likely to persist over the short/medium term. The ACCC netback price series suggests forward prices of ~$35/GJ until February 2023. Given the links between international and domestic markets, it stands to reason that domestic prices will also remain elevated.
Sustained high gas prices up at $35-40/GJ in most states translates to short-run marginal costs for peaking generators around $350-400/MWh to break even (assuming a heat rate of ~10 GJ/MWh).
This SRMC value is lower than the average price required to breach the Cumulative Price Threshold (CPT) in a week of ~$674/MWh, so assuming that generators offer capacity around their SRMC, similar circumstances could be avoided. However, while the application of Administered Pricing may be avoided, the market will likely remain at relatively high prices in the short term, all else being equal.
Looking forward through MTPASA shows that the next few weeks will see a further return of capacity. This may be enough to ease pressure on prices towards more stable outcomes. However, it is also important to note that some units have planned outages scheduled for the coming months.
The chart below visualises the change in availability for select units over the next two months – those whose availability is subject to change (blue boxes indicate a unit is in service). We can see a gradual increase of capacity returning to the market through July of around 2.5 GW, which may be enough to ease pressure on prices towards more stable outcomes. However, it is also important to note that some units have planned outages scheduled for the coming months, like Stanwell U4.

So in the short term, the situation in the NEM will likely remain dynamic. Those familiar with these phrases would know this means the situation could change quickly, especially if external factors change from expectation. Therefore, careful attention should be placed on the near term.
While the short-term focus will remain, it is important to lift our eyes up and over the current situation into the long term to avoid/limit these circumstances from occurring again.
The first thought is to diversify the NEM’s supply. As the old saying goes – don’t keep all your eggs in one basket. We have seen the case for dispatchable generation when the wind/sun doesn’t blow/shine, but the past fortnight has been a reminder that no technology is immune to market forces. The investment in renewable capacity is already occurring but likely has to find another gear, particularly in Queensland, which has plenty of ground to make up for its QRET ambitions in replacing coal generation.
Furthermore, there needs to be a strong signal in the market for dedicated reserves. That is, capacity whose express function is to operate unimpeded when it is most required in high impact, low probability events. This may be a more costly insurance product for the market, however when compared to the cost of compensation likely to be paid out from the past fortnight (and beyond), it may make sense.
For reserves to be effective, there should be a clear link between reserve provision and the delivery of that capacity when it is most required. We do note that the ESB has recently released a capacity mechanism consultation paper that would place a value on capacity however, at first pass, it does not appear like this would have prevented the current market events from occurring. Other options are being progressed currently, like Iberdrola’s proposal for an Operating Reserve market (ERC0295) which could be a suitable longer-term operational option.
A final aspect we should also consider is compensation frameworks and mechanisms. There appeared to be a distinct change in operation when the CPT was breached and APC was applied, prompting generators to withdraw from the market. This poses a question as to whether generators have a preference in compensation mechanisms in extreme market events – that is, AEMO directions compared to the APC framework. This may be explored when the current event is in the rear view.
Like most, we will be keeping a close eye on the outcomes over the short term, particularly watching how higher gas prices flow through to the electricity market. To the extent that generation sources are diversified, price pressure could be relieved. However, if increased generation requirements are placed on thermal generators over the coming months, the NEM could be in for a cold and bumpy winter.

“In the de-occupied territories most affected by the Russians, there are problems with electricity, and Tesla Powerwall stations provide backup power during power outages,” said Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov. 
Solar power systems are being deployed mostly to prevent blackouts and to protect critical infrastructure such as hospitals, said Olga Sukhopara, development director of the Ukrainian Association of Renewable Energy. 
“After the liberation of the north of Ukraine, a lot of power grid lines were damaged or destroyed due to hostilities,” Sukhopara said, adding that all damaged grid lines in the region have been restored. 
Commercial rooftops and facade solar PV have become popular in recent years as a way to save on energy bills, Sukhopara said.  
“Cross-subsidizing in the electricity sector still exists in Ukraine: tariffs for households are state-regulated, while business pays market price for electricity which is on average three times higher than for households,” she said. “That’s why businesses started installing solar systems for their own consumption more often – to lower energy bills and to provide themselves with electricity at fixed price years ahead.”
Ukraine’s solar industry is mostly focused on survival now, and not on further development. The aim is to avoid going bankrupt under constant curtailment and lower feed-in-tariff payments, Sukhopara said.  
“Work is underway to amend the legislation on free access to the electricity market for RES producers,” she said. “We also hope to start exporting green electricity to the EU in the near future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/24/acap-lands-45-million-to-kick-renewable-energy-transformation-into-gear/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 24, 2022",ACAP lands $45 million to kick renewable energy transformation into gear,"Based at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP) will receive up to $45 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to develop better and cheaper solar technologies that will help cut energy costs and reduce emissions.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the research done by ACAP will help kick the nation’s renewable energy transformation into gear, and provide access to cleaner, cheaper power for Australia and the rest of the world.
“Australia has all the ingredients to become a renewable energy superpower with this government working collaboratively to ensure secure, affordable and reliable energy that drives down emissions,” he said.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said the funding, which will extend the operations of ACAP’s research program to 2030, would ensure the centre remains one of the world’s top research hubs for innovation in solar energy and solar PV technology.
“Australia is a world leader in solar PV innovation, punching far above its weight,” he said. “Through the funding for ACAP, we are ensuring that university research groups will continue to underpin education and training and ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of the PV industry well into the future.
“For Australia to really succeed in a net-zero world, we need to see continued innovation in solar PV to power the rest of the energy transition.”
Delivered by the UNSW School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, ACAP includes research groups at the CSIRO, Australian National University, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, University of Sydney and Monash University.

The latest round of funding will mean ACAP can facilitate a minimum graduation of 30 honours students, 10 masters students and 25 PhD students every year to 2030, employ 18 postdoctoral research fellows each year across the eight research institutes, and provide a comprehensive domestic and international knowledge sharing program.
ACAP’s research program supports ARENA’s ambitious ‘Solar 30 30 30’ goal – to improve solar PV cell efficiency to 30% and reduce the cost of installation of solar modules to 30 cents a watt by 2030.
Solar has experienced significant efficiency improvements and cost reductions over the past decade but ARENA said further improvements are needed to better facilitate the quickening transition to a renewable energy future.
In January, ARENA also launched a $40 million competitive funding round for ultra low-cost solar research and development, highlighting the importance of advancing solar research and technology to reduce costs.
“Ultra-low-cost solar will be key to enabling Australia’s energy transition and emissions reduction efforts, as it will help to lower the input costs for green hydrogen, low-emissions metals and other large-scale clean energy opportunities across all sectors as we move to net zero,” Miller said.
UNSW Professor Martin Green said ACAP is a critical element of Australia’s world leading research and development capability in solar PV, with benefits for emissions reductions in Australia and globally.
“The next decade promises to be the most exciting and important in solar PV, ever, with massively increased uptake and technological change,” he said. “With ARENA’s support, we will continue our world-class technology development including more efficient and powerful cell technologies and growing a sustainable solar sector at scale.”
The latest funding builds on more than $83 million in ARENA funding already allocated to ACAP for solar PV research and will be subject to the execution of a satisfactory funding agreement with the government.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/24/debunking-myths-about-pv-system-orientation-dimensioning/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,FINLAND,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 24, 2022","Debunking myths about PV system orientation, dimensioning","From pv magazine Global
Researchers from Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) claim to have debunked three myths about the orientation and dimensioning of PV systems and the sale of surplus electricity.
“The results are applicable to the conditions in the north, but the methods are applicable everywhere,” a spokesperson for LUT told pv magazine. “Our experts would like to take a closer look at other data and other countries’ data for solar electricity, energy consumption, and electricity prices.”
In a first study – “Optimisation of rooftop photovoltaic installations to maximise revenue in Finland based on customer class load profiles and simulated generation,” published in Solar Energy – the scientists considered a PV system orientation based on profitability. They used hourly data from 13 different statistical customer class load profiles, historical electricity market price data for the 2016-20 period, and simulated solar PV yield from southern Finland.
The research group compared single-azimuth and dual-azimuth systems. It found that the first project typology was more profitable under a net metering regime, with optimal orientations being identified at azimuth angles of -15 degree to -5 degrees and at tilt angles of 35 degrees to -45 degrees.
“However, if no compensation is paid for surplus electricity, it is usually more profitable to minimise the electricity purchase by orienting the solar PV modules in two azimuths between east and west with tilt angles of 10 degrees to -55 degrees, depending on the capacity of the solar PV system and the load profile,” they said.
An east-west orientation could lead to financial losses of 15% compared to a south-facing system, when net metering is not in place and self-consumption must be maximised.
“A south orientation is economically viable regardless of the consumption profile. There is no single correct orientation. The choice depends on whether you want to maximise self-sufficiency in electricity generation or profitability,” said Altti Meriläinen, an electrical engineering research assistant at LUT University.
Optimal dimensioning
In “Optimal dimensioning of a solar PV plant with measured electrical load curves in Finland,” which was recently published in Solar Energy, another research team investigated the profitability of PV systems for self-consumption. They focused on a grocery store, a dairy farm, and a home in southern Finland.
“The profitability of the PV power system was studied by using internal interest rate, net present value, discounted payback period, and self-consumption rate,” the researchers said.
They found that the respective internal rates of return were 6.8%, 6.6%, and 1.4% for the grocery store, dairy farm, and home. For the grocery store and the dairy farm, the PV system size could be increased without the internal rate of return decreasing significantly, which would justify a larger installation. By contrast, using the self-consumption ratio to optimize the PV power system size could result in an undersized system.
”In single-family houses, the best or most profitable solution is the over-dimensioning of the solar PV system. In larger buildings, 100% self-consumption is the most economical alternative. On the other hand, profitability would not plummet due to excess yield,” said researcher Antti Kosonen.
A paper in Applied Energy, “Techno-economic viability of energy storage concepts combined with a residential solar photovoltaic system: A case study from Finland,” compared the profitability of PV systems operating under net metering with that of solar arrays connected to physical or virtual storage. The researchers found that selling surplus electricity to the network would be the most profitable option.
“(The) addition of a physical battery energy storage to the energy system was found to increase self-sufficiency from 20 to 30 percentage points for the houses under study,” the academics said. “The peak power capacity of the solar PV installation was observed to be a significant factor for determining the amount of self-sufficiency increase obtained by the use of a battery energy storage, with the increase being higher for larger solar PV installations.”
But given the current power price scenario in Finland, the deployment of lithium-ion batteries for residential applications is not yet economically feasible, they concluded.
“An increase in price for electricity import, of which the price of transmission is the most significant and prone to rise, would improve the profitability of an investment in a physical battery storage,” they said.
