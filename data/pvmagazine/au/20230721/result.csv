https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/21/fortescue-snaps-up-fast-to-market-green-hydrogen-project-in-us/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 21, 2023",Fortescue snaps up ‘fast-to-market’ green hydrogen project in US,"Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has added to its global portfolio of renewable energy projects, acquiring the Phoenix Hydrogen Hub (PHH) development from an affiliate of Arizona-based zero-emissions vehicle manufacturer and clean energy company Nikola.
FFI, the clean energy arm of Australian miner Fortescue Metals Group, said the PHH being developed on a 370-hectare site at Buckeye, near Phoenix, is expected to be built in stages with first production of green hydrogen from the facility expected by 2024.
Stage one of the project is planned to include an 80 MW electrolyser and liquefaction facility capable of producing up to 12,000 tonnes of liquified green hydrogen annually. It is expected production would scale up to approximately 55,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum and beyond with the project having room to expand as the demand for clean hydrogen grows.
“The PHH project is currently going through the final stages of its permitting process, and the procurement of long-lead equipment is well underway,” FFI said in a statement.
“It is anticipated the project will go to the Fortescue board for a final Investment decision this year.”
The acquisition is the first major move in the U.S. by FFI since the introduction of the country’s $544 billion (USD 369 billion) Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers subsidies, grants and tax breaks to encourage investment in renewable energy and climate change measures.
FFI Chief Executive Officer Mark Hutchinson said the company is looking to build its presence in the U.S. with the incentives in the IRA make it one of the best markets in the world to invest in green energy.
“FFI is actively expanding its U.S. presence and strengthening its position as a leading global developer of green energy production and technology,” he said.
“The U.S. is now one of the best places in the world to do this, with the Inflation Reduction Act making it an ideal place to invest in green energy.”
“This investment by FFI will greatly strengthen one of the country’s first and most important hydrogen ecosystems and it is a significant milestone in creating the all-important local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of green hydrogen.”
The PHH transaction comes after FFI and Nikola signed a memorandum of understanding in January 2023, agreeing to collaborate on the co-development of large-scale green hydrogen production facilities in the U.S.
That agreement was based on the understanding that the supply of green hydrogen for any potential projects would be underpinned by Nikola as a potential offtaker.
The PHH investment coincided with the announcement that Fortescue Metals Group and FFI would come together as one brand ‘Fortescue’ to represent being “a unified global metals and green energy company.”
The move was confirmed as part of Fortescue’s 20-year anniversary.

The three North Island projects have been referred for approvals under the Fast-track Consenting Act, which provides for an accelerated consenting process for projects with the potential to contribute to New Zealand’s efforts to speed up the roll out of renewable energy generation facilities as it strives to reach net zero by 2050.
Harmony has already secured approval under the fast-track consenting process to construct and operate the 147 MW Tauhei Solar Farm at Te Aroha West, about 140 kilometres south of Auckland in the Waikato region.
It is anticipated construction of the Tauhei Solar Farm will commence in 2024, with the solar farm to be operational in 2025. It took just 70 working days for the consent application to be approved.
Harmony is now seeking to utilise the same consenting process to expedite the development of its proposed Carterton, Opunake, and Marton solar farms.
The planned 133 MWp Carterton Solar Farm, the largest of the three projects, would comprise about 200,000 solar panels spread across a 148-hectare site north of Wellington in the south of the North Island.
Harmony’s proposed Opunake Solar Farm, located in the Taranaki region of the North Island, would have an output of approximately 94 MWp. It is to consist of about 140,000 solar panels occupying about 58ha.
The third proposed project, the Marton Solar Farm planned for a 93ha site near Palmerston North on the North Island, would have an output of approximately 65 MWp and comprise about 105,000 solar panels.

The project features charging hardware provided by Melbourne-based company Jet Charge and also includes a combination of solar and battery, with a back-up diesel generator.
Horizon said it will open an EV charging station in Carnarvon next month, while construction has started on chargers in Exmouth, Denham, Derby and Karratha.
The WA EV charging network will be the longest in Australia stretching more than 7,000 kilometres from Kununurra in the north, to Esperance in the south and east to Eucla. It is to include 98 charging stations across 49 locations.

The NSW government has announced a new funding round to install at least 500 kerbside chargers to help EV drivers in high-density communities find convenient options to charge their car.
As part of the first round of a $10 million (USD 6.78 million) program, $3 million in funding will be offered to local councils and charge point operators to install kerbside chargers in 26 targeted local government areas where private off-street parking is limited.
Grant amounts will be limited to $800,000 with the funding for each applicant to be less than 80% of the equipment and installation cost with funding for each EV charge port to be capped at $10,000.
Up to 80% of the cost of a three-year EV charger software subscription can also be included in eligible applications.
Applications are now open and will be taken until 17 November 2023.
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government has launched a new cost comparison web tool to make it easier for Canberrans to better understand the running costs associated with EVs or other zero emissions vehicles.
The free tool allows users to see at a glance the total cost of ownership of any car model available in Australia over a five-year period. It also allows you to compare these costs to other models available on the market.
The tool also provides information on driving range, annual fuel or energy costs, as well as financial incentives available if you purchase an EV in the ACT.
As part of what the local council is describing as a first for the state of Victoria, an EV fast charger has been installed at the Bayswater train station in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs.
The Knox city council has brokered a deal with Sydney-based Jolt to instal up to seven fast charging stations in the local government area no cost to council. Fast chargers have now been installed at the Bayswater and Ferntree Gully train station, and in the carpark at the Scoresby Village shopping centre, with more to come.
All construction and operating costs associated with these charging stations are borne by Jolt which provides drivers with up to 7 kWh – about 15-20 minutes’ charging time – free each day. This allows for 40-50km of driving range. If people want to charge for longer, Jolt charges about 46 cents per kWh.

The lawsuit specifically refers to the electrodes used in the supercapacitors, which Tesla described in the court documents as the “primary source of the device’s power capabilities.”
Tesla said the electrodes used in Cap-XX’s supercapacitors match Maxwell’s patented technology. It has filed a lawsuit in a Texas federal court against Cap-XX, asking the court to award financial compensation for damages done.
The legal action follows a claim of patent infringement brought by Cap-XX against Maxwell Technologies in 2019. The trial date for that action has been set for December.
In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, Cap-XX said it “remains optimistic” about its prospects in the action against Maxwell and “intends to strenuously defend” the Tesla claims “and further announcements will be made as appropriate.”
