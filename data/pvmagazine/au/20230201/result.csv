“The Bulwer Island facility will have capacity to produce up to 20 kilograms of green hydrogen a day, creating 30 new specialist jobs in the process,” the Queensland government said. It noted the company is “investigating other sites in Queensland for future stages of its development.”
Eneos will produce the green hydrogen at the facility using its patented electrolysis technology, Direct MCH, powered by an onsite 250 kW solar system.
The hydrogen will be produced in the form of methylcyclohexane, which fixes hydrogen with toluene and remains in a liquid form at normal temperature and pressure for storage and transportation. The grand plan is for the methylcyclohexane to be converted back to hydrogen in Japan. 
The demonstration plant is the first project supported by the Japanese government’s $24 billion (USD 17 billion) Green Innovation Fund, dedicated to helping the nation reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
Eneos Senior Vice President Yuichiro Fujiyama described the demonstration of its technology in Queensland as a “great step,” noting the project will expand its scale “in near future.”
The demonstration plant appears to build on a feasibility study Eneos began in 2021 with Origin Energy.
The company is also progressing with plans announced that same year to develop a 204 MW solar farm at Edenvale in the Western Downs region of Queensland.

The startup is manufacturing its systems via an unnamed production partner in Victoria.
It will test the prototype systems on the sites of five potential customers who have multiple diesel engines across the steel manufacturing, agriculture, construction, mining and hospitality/tourism industries, the company says.
The systems include both hardware and proprietary software to manage the injection of hydrogen into an existing diesel engine – something the company claims can potentially cut fuel usage by up to 20% and reduce carbon emissions by 300 tonnes per year.
“Four of the companies we will be conducting field testing with are based in Australia, while the other is in the Middle East,” H2i Technology Chairman David Vinson says. The company is hopeful it will convert these field testing agreements into sales contracts.
H2i Technology appears to either be fully or partially owned by Liberty Energy Capital, an Australian investment firm with “significant positions” in 18 renewable energy companies. Those include H2X Global, Patriot Hydrogen, Sweetman Renewables, Verdant Earth Technologies, Port Anthony Renewables Ltd, among others.
Branding itself as a renewable energy investor, Liberty Energy Capital’s portfolio is noticeably heavy on hydrogen projects and technologies which are technology agnostic, at best. Liberty holds almost every company which has biomass-based hydrogen projects in Australia – which is certainly not zero emissions technology. Liberty Energy Capital also holds a 30%stake in Pure Hydrogen, a company which owns three gas projects, including the Windorah Gas Project in the Cooper Basin, one of Australia’s most prolific onshore petroleum basins.

Administrators FTI Consulting have appointment MA Moelis Australia as an adviser on the sale, which it is hoping to finalise within the next four months. 
The sale, or potentially the recapitalisation, of Sun Cable is necessary to ensure the progress of its $30 billion (USD 21 billion) Australia-Asia PowerLink project, which is proposing a giant solar farm, up to 20 GW, coupled with as much as 42 GWh of battery storage in the Northern Territory, to then send that power to Singapore using 4,200 kilometres of sub-sea cables.

Bloomberg has reported iron-ore magnate Andrew Forrest, whose private firm Squadron Energy owns a major stake in Sun Cable, is among the parties considering making an offer. There has also been speculation tech billionaire and Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes, whose Grok Ventures also owns a major stake in Sun Cable, will bid.
These two billionaire owners have failed to agree on the direction of the project, with Sun Cable chairman Cannon-Brookes supporting its current form and Forrest reportedly looking to scrap the sub-sea cable element in favour of domestic energy use and green hydrogen production.
In the meantime, Cannon-Brookes via Grok Ventures has provided Sun Cable with a $65 million interest free loan to maintain its employees and project momentum.
FTI Consulting described Stage 1 of the Australia-Asia PowerLink project as being “materially progressed,” having gained federal and local government support and a number of the required approvals.
However, Bloomberg has reported lawyers for FTI told Australia’s Supreme Court last week that Sun Cable had less than $3.6 million in cash and looming bills of more than $10 million.
“The Administrators are seeking binding proposals for the sale of Sun Cable by end of April 2023, with targeted completion no later than the end of May 2023,” FTI Consulting said in its statement.
“Moelis will now commence a process to invite offers for sale or recapitalisation of the company.”

As rosy as this cherrypicked statistic looks, a closer inspection of the whole industry reveals a more complicated scene. This mammoth jump in the nation’s solar capacity, in fact, came down to three enormous solar farms entering operations. They make the claim solar had another “record year” in 2022 technically true, if a little misleading.
In reality, the year was far from a show stopper. The nation’s sweetheart, rooftop solar, kicked off the year with a seizable contraction, from which it was just able to claw back once energy became front page news worldwide. The commercial and industrial (C&I) segment behaved differently again, enjoying perhaps its greatest embrace to date. And while the utility segment rode on the coattails of a few huge projects, its momentum is far from full steam.
These disparate trends hold some important lessons for the industry, Sunwiz managing director Warwick Johnston tells pv magazine Australia.

Before we get there, the solar installed in 2022 brings Australia’s all-time tally to 31.4 GW, of which 21.7 GW is rooftop, mostly residential (19.9 GW comes from sub-100 kW systems).
2022 kicked off with the single biggest monthly contraction in the volume of rooftop system registrations on record, virtually halving from one month to the next, Sunwiz outlines in its report.
This cliff-dive was actually forewarned by the data, Johnston says, but this was largely overlooked, leading suppliers into a painful position.
“All of 2021’s installations were effectively hangovers from 2020. And early 2021 was basically people had sold and were still fulfilling sales. Lead generation dropped off a cliff far earlier in 2021,” Johnston says.

The reason households stopped being interested in solar, he adds, boils down to the fact lockdowns were mostly over by the end of 2021, so restaurants and other outdoor activities stole the focus away from home improvements, a darling during the pandemic. 
The issue here is the disparity between leads, sales and fulfilment – which had an unusual lag over the pandemic because demand was high but installers ability to actually install systems was spluttering with the final bouts of lockdown and high rainfall across the east coast.
“The key thing where wholesalers had a bit of a misstep was they didn’t read that leads had dried up and 2021’s installations had largely been buoyed by hungover interest,” Johnston says.
This misreading of the market – mistaking the high rate of installations in 2021 for a continuing boom in demand – meant solar suppliers radically overbought solar stock. This stock, Johnston says, was largely left sitting in warehouses as installs dried up, leaving suppliers playing a game of chicken in terms of pricing. “And in the meantime, they’re all hurting.”
(This approach of mapping demand through leads as opposed to installations has led Sunwiz to the conclusion 2023 will be a strong year for the rooftop segment, which pv magazine will report on in greater depth the coming week.)

While rooftop’s contraction characterised the first part of the year, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shook the globe’s still fossil fuel-dependent energy system and caused prices to skyrocket globally. Unsurprisingly, this led to a rush towards lovely, independent solar systems.
This panic-induced demand saw the rooftop segment recover some of its earlier losses, but while the year certainly ended strongly, Sunwiz found it wasn’t enough to entirely make up for the downturn. The segment ultimately posted a contraction overall, with few systems installed overall compared to 2021 and 2020. 
It is also worth noting the federal election in May 2022 likely contributed to households hesitating or holding off their solar purchases.
“Whereas STC systems both commercial and residential contracted, commercial had less of a contraction than residential,” Johnston says.
In fact, in December the C&I segment ended up having “pretty much a record month,” he added.

While skyrocketing electricity prices surely would have vindicated companies on the solar journey, Johnston says businesses would have probably started planning their systems well before that particular pandemonium broke out.
More likely, he says, is that big customers would have been doing solar trials these last years and by 2022 were finally ready to get on with a complete rollout. He noted both Woolworths and Bunnings, two of Australia’s biggest chains, had big solar pushes in 2022. Likewise, Johnston says while nursing homes used to be among the biggest C&I customers, that has now shifted to industrial precincts.
Looking at commercial systems aerially via Nearmap, Johnston says there is an “amazing” number of new builds going up immediately with solar systems installed.
Much of 2022’s solar growth came from the utility segment. Specifically, the energisation of three massive solar farms, each exceeding 200 MW in scale. 
Image: Sunwiz
Those were the Neoen’s Western Downs Green Power Hub in Queensland, Iberdrola’s Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park in South Australia, and Lightsource bp’s Woolooga Solar Farm also in Queensland. 
These three projects led to a record year for solar farms being connected to the grid, Sunwiz found.
But while rooftop leads led Sunwiz to an optimistic conclusion for rooftop solar in 2023, this approach has led to a starkly different vision for the utility sector.

China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) have announced that they plan to revise the country’s Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted for Export.
In a joint statement, the two ministries said that three technologies related to the PV manufacturing industry could be included in the catalog – wafers, black silicon, and ingot casting.  If the three categories are added to the restrictions list, manufacturers will need technology export licenses from the respective provincial departments to export such products.
China accounted for more than 98% of global wafer production for the solar industry in 2021, according to reports from the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA). Although the plan is still in a phase of public consultation, this attempt shows the country’s efforts to protect its most advanced solar technology and maintain the competitiveness of its solar industry.
“Such technology-related export restrictions are nothing new,” Frank Haugwitz, senior adviser of Apricum Cleantech Advisory, told pv magazine. “The last version of this list was published in August 2020 but it took a good two years to come into effect after the consultation process was completed.”
“At the same time, if you take into account the years of significant investment in wafer R&D, this may not be surprising,” said Haugwitz. “On the one hand, it affects plant manufacturers, but also producers who may be considering setting up wafer production in other regions. In other words, such a technology transfer abroad would also be subject to such restrictions.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/01/multi-day-iron-air-batteries-to-be-hosted-in-former-us-coal-sites/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"FEBRUARY 1, 2023",Multi-day iron-air batteries to be hosted in former US coal sites,"From pv magazine USA
Solar and wind power have variability in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can impact output. Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost effective is important in grid reliability.
This is the logic that supported the creation of Boston startup Form Energy’s iron-air batteries. The grid-scale batteries can store intermittent renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at costs competitive with conventional power plants.
Utility Xcel Energy said it will install two 10 MW/1,000 MWh iron-air batteries – one at a retired coal plant in Minnesota and another on a restored site in Colorado. The projects are expected to go online in 2025, following regulatory approval.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air, creating rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
The technology is less energy-dense than its lithium-ion counterparts, making it a better fit for large grid-scale applications. This may come as an advantage for the company, as EV batteries are in competition for lithium, a metal with geo-political mining concerns and battery fire risks.
“Form was founded with a unified mission to develop a multi-day energy storage battery that would unlock the power of extremely low-cost renewable energy to transform the electric grid,” said Mateo Jaramillo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Form Energy.
Form Energy said an individual battery module is about the size of a side-by-side washer/dryer set and contains a stack of approximately 50 one-meter-tall cells. The cells include iron and air electrodes, the parts of the battery that enable the electrochemical reactions to store and discharge electricity. Each of these cells are filled with water-based, non-flammable electrolyte, like the electrolyte used in AA batteries.
These battery modules are grouped together in environmentally protected enclosures. Hundreds of these enclosures are grouped together in modular megawatt-scale power blocks. Depending on the system size, tens to hundreds of these power blocks can be connected to the electricity grid. For scale, in its least dense configuration, a one-megawatt system comprises half an acre of land. Higher density configurations would achieve >3 MW/acre. (One acre is equal to roughly 4045 square metres).
“We’re on track to reduce our electric system carbon emissions 80% by 2030 and to deliver carbon-free electricity by 2050,” said Bob Frenzel, chief executive officer of Xcel Energy. “As we build more renewable energy into our systems, our partnership with Form Energy opens the door to significantly improve how we deliver carbon-free energy.”
Form Energy held a USD 200 million ($286 million) Series D funding round in 2021 led by ArcelorMittal and a USD 450 million Series E round led by TPG Rise Climate, and numerous Canada-based funds.
In December, it announced a West Virginia-based manufacturing facility. Emerging from startup mode, Form expects to begin construction of its Weirton factory in 2023 and start manufacturing iron-air batteries in 2024 for broad commercialisation.
The governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, said that the state was able to structure a unique financial incentive package worth up to USD 290 million in asset-based, performance financing to support their decision to locate in Weirton. The West Virginia Economic Development Authority allocated USD 75 million toward the purchase of land and the construction of buildings in Weirton. The governor said he plans on working with the West Virginia Legislature and federal partners to obtain an additional $215 million needed to finalize the agreement.
The Xcel collaboration was modelled using Form Energy’s investment and operational modelling tool for grids, called Formware. This modelling helped Xcel Energy validate how Form’s multi-day storage will support Xcel Energy’s ability to reliably and cost-effectively integrate large amounts of wind energy and other renewable resources on its system.
Additionally, this analysis demonstrated how the 100-hour iron-air battery technology will strengthen the grid against normal day-to-day, week-to-week, and season-to-season weather variability, in addition to extreme weather events including severe winter storms and polar vortex events.
“Xcel Energy operates across some of the richest wind-resource areas in North America,” said Jaramillo. “This partnership highlights Xcel Energy’s commitment to ensuring grid resiliency and reliability, energy security, and access to low-cost clean energy when and where it is needed – every day of the year.”
