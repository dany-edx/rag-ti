“The non-cash impairment has no impact on either JSP or Genex’s funding,” assures Genex CEO James Harding in the report, “and is not reflective of the operational performance of the asset.”
On the contrary, he writes, “the project has been contributing strong revenues since energisation and continues to remain a valuable cash generating asset for the Group.”
Genex Power is of course the developer of the Kidston combined solar, wind and pumped hydro proposal for the former gold mine of the same name. The 50 MW first stage of its solar ambitions, KS1, contributed $13.3 million in revenue over the past reporting year, and in April this year Genex Power achieved financial close on the 250 MW K2-Hydro component of its Kidston Clean Energy Hub, an important renewable generation and storage addition to the North Queensland grid.
JSP was acquired by Genex Power from Vast Solar in March 2019, and the purchase was funded on a portfolio basis, together with refinancing of the company’s KS1 project.
Portfolio finance gave JSP a favourable funding structure, which helped drive the acquisition to completion.
Genex subsequently proceeded with the development of the project, with Beon Energy Solutions as its engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and operations and maintenance (O&M) contractor. 
Energised in December last year, JSP is now fully commissioned and operating as a merchant generator in the National Electricity Market — and therein, it seems lies the fly in the accounting ointment.
Firstly, as a merchant generator, the company receives the spot price for electricity generated by JSP (as well as revenue from the sale of Large-Scale Generation Certificates). The need for an impairment assessment was triggered by a decrease in wholesale electricity prices over the past financial year, and for impairment testing, writes Harding, “the application of the accounting standards require JSP to be assessed on a standalone basis.
“As such, the assumptions that can be made around funding structure and cost of funding are restrictive,” and “such assumptions do not reflect the actual commercial parameters under which JSP operates.”
Genex Power’s second generating asset, JSP which is located in Forbes in central west New South Wales provides geographic diversification to the company’s portfolio.
Together, JSP and KS1 generate some 267,000 MWh of clean energy each year, offsetting about 250,000 tonnes of CO2 and producing enough energy to power up to 41,660 average Australian homes.
The annual report confirms that the company is now focused on delivering its K2-Hydro project, with energisation scheduled to commence in late 2024.
A key enabler of K2, the first new pumped hydro project to be delivered in Australia in 40 years, was the Queensland Government’s $147 million Transmission Line Funding package. 
Together with the connection agreement signed with Powerlink in March, the funding enabled work to commence on development of a new 186km  275 kV single-circuit transmission line from Kidston to the site of a new switching station which will be constructed at Mt Fox.
Transmission is already a given for Genex’s likely 50 MW Bouldercombe Battery Project (BBP) to be situated within the boundary of Powerlink’s Bouldercombe substation near the Queensland city of Rockhampton.
A connection offer is expected in Q2 of next year. If financial close is achieved shortly thereafter, BBP will demonstrate the flexibility and speed to completion of battery storage technology by becoming operational almost two years before K2, at the beginning of 2023.
The project was identified as part of a strategy to diversify Genex’s footprint in energy storage, and leverage the expertise it has developed in renewable energy storage as part of bringing K2 to build stage. 
BBP is intended to operate on an arbitrage and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) model, and will have the ability to bid into all FCAS markets.
In the meantime, Harding expects JSP, earning a more than a million dollars a month in revenues on the basis of improved wholesale electricity prices, “will provide a step change in revenue and cashflow generation for the Company from FY22 onwards”.

Work is now underway on a pilot production line to demonstrate a 3D-printed solid-state battery technology.
Sakuú Corp. said the battery will be up to 50% smaller and 30% lighter than lithium-ion batteries, and will be less expensive to produce at scale. Currently, the battery has a capacity of 3 Amp hours.
Sakuú’s first-generation batteries use a binder jet printing process that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed to allows thin layers of ceramic and metal to be deposited in one build. The 3D printing process is relatively slow, but enables the batteries to be smaller and lighter – something that the company said could make them optimal for electric vehicles.
Sakuú is also testing high-voltage cathodes, which it said could achieve up to a 25% boost in energy density in its KeraCel solid-state battery.
The company said the 3D printing platform is able to print batteries for many different applications, including drones, vehicles, and cell phones, to name a few.
Solid-state batteries are still relatively unproven in terms of their longevity and stability, but some researchers have deemed the technology the “holy grail” of battery chemistry due to its high capacity and energy density.
The “raw materials in, finished product out” nature of the printer platform can help product developers reduce their dependency on other companies by streamlining their supply chains, said Sakuú.
The facility is expected to be completed and operational by the end of the year. It will serve as both a pilot production line and customer learning centre for Sakuú’s additive manufacturing platform.
The California-based company is working with Relevant Industrial and Honeywell Process Solutions on the product line. The two will help Sakuú scale-up the facility in a second phase scheduled for 2022, when production may be up to 1 GWh per year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/30/where-rooftop-solar-meets-the-most-money-saving-energy-plan-its-personal/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 30, 2021",Where rooftop solar meets the most money-saving energy plan — it’s personal,"Not a team to surrender to tedium, solar technology advocate Nigel Morris and the software experts at Solar Analytics have been mining the potential of data to eradicate what Morris calls, “The incredibly complicated, mind-numbingly boring and almost impossible task of choosing the right provider and energy plan as a new solar owner.”
In a conversation about impending five-minute settlement rules in the National Electricity Market, Morris, who is Head of Business Development at Solar Analytics, told pv magazine Australia about the launch today of Solar Analytics Plan Optimiser, an upgrade to the company’s real-time solar monitoring and analysis software — which already tracks the data of solar users to help them make the most of their PV systems given their electricity usage and weather forecasts.
People with new solar systems on their roofs are primed to reap the rewards, but typically need to change their energy plan or their provider, or both, to dovetail with their enhanced power status and really get the benefits flowing.
In recent years, competition between proliferating energy retailers has resulted in a dizzying variety of solar export rates, time-of-use rates, fixed charges and so on.
The impost on solar owners to compare and contrast different plans in relation to their own individual energy use is “nightmarish” , says Morris. 
He has various pithy criticisms of existing energy-plan comparison sites, but says the main problem is that “no-one has done it with solar owners in mind — they’re all chasing the 25 million Australians who buy energy, but no-one’s really thought about it and said, ‘Well, how do you get the best plan if you’re a solar owner?’”
The most recent State of the Energy Market Report by the Australian Energy Regulator seems to concur with Morris in its acknowledgement that existing switching services “may not provide customers with the best outcomes” and that it is “difficult for customers to assess whether an offer is right for them.” 
Little wonder that the rate of customers changing their energy plans is notoriously low, and potential savings accordingly seep away.
Pilot testing of Plan Optimiser technology revealed its calculations and recommendations on the best plan to switch to resulted in an average saving per site of $100 a quarter — $400 a year. 
Of the sample solar sites analysed, Solar Analytics’ data showed 70% could reap rewards by switching plans or providers, and the maximum saving shown so far by a Plan Optimiser switching recommendation was $2,000 a year.
For new solar owners who subscribe to the Solar Analytics software application, Plan Optimiser is a new standard feature and calculation of the most suitable energy plan begins with entering the details of their latest electricity bill into the Solar Analytics dashboard. Actual home energy data is then run through a set of algorithms to compare the compatibility of plans on offer in the market with the use patterns of that site.

Morris told pv magazine Australia that the system will yield ideal results when supplied with two to three months of usage data; so new solar owners “don’t need to worry about it straight away, just let the automation do the work for you, and eight weeks down the track, the calculation will tell you whether there’s a material saving to be made by switching”.
The company’s existing 25,000 users will start receiving the upgrade for free from today as it rolls out to New South Wales, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania, Victoria and Southern Queensland. 
For these customers the platform already has a wealth of electricity-useage data, and will do its thing in the background, scanning market offerings and updating each user either immediately or periodically — depending how spot on their existing plan is — on what they could save by switching to a new plan.

The system is also expected to save solar retailers a mountain of time and calculations in advising customers on what they could save by installing solar.
“Solar businesses struggle to keep up with advising their customers about ever-changing energy plans,” says Morris, but Plan Optimiser uses the latest information on plans in the market to highlight potential savings for prospective buyers of solar systems.
It’s the first upgrade in a suite of optimising services Solar Analytics has planned, says Morris: “We’re working on Battery Optimiser, VPP Optimiser and EV optimiser, all with specific needs in mind and offering unbiased advice based on real data.”
And on the subject of five-minute settlement — the rule change that is intended to incentivise investment in fast-response technologies, such as big batteries in the electricity market, and stimulate innovation in retail energy plans — Morris says, “It’s certainly something we’re keeping a watching brief over. We’ll be making sure that any changes to plans are automatically passed through into our Plan Optimiser, for example,” so solar owners can switch to take advantage of them.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/30/alpa-seeks-to-harness-the-renewable-gold-rush-for-australias-regional-communities/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 30, 2021",ALPA seeks to harness the renewable gold rush for Australia’s regional communities,"On Friday, the Australian Local Power Agency Bill 2021, which was introduced to Parliament in February by Independent Member for Indi, Dr Helen Haines, was the subject of a public hearing held by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy. The Committee heard evidence from many of the individuals and organisations – such as Farmers for Climate Action, the Clean Energy Council, City of Greater Bendigo and Repower Shoalhaven — who contributed more than 1,000 submissions received on the bill over two weeks mid-year.
“The Committee’s inquiry provides an opportunity to hear and consider all viewpoints, in order to advise the House on the merits of the Bills,” said Committee Chair Ted O’Brien MP in advance of the event.
The proposal for an Australian Local Power Agency (ALPA) grew out of Haines’ Local Power Plan, which was launched in September last year after consultation with communities and energy experts on how to “unlock the benefits of community energy”.
Haines had identified more than 100 community energy groups in Australia, many of which were struggling to implement projects, because of a lack of finance, underwriting, limited human resources and access to expertise.
She said when tabling the ALPA Bill in February, “regional Australia should be home to the world’s best renewable energy industry, and we should harness that power of that industry to deliver a generation of prosperity for everyday regional Australians”.
Under the Plan’s Local Power Scheme, one of three pillars of the proposed ALPA, is that 50 Local Power Hubs would be established across Australia — from Esperance in WA, to Gippsland in Victoria, to Cape York in Queensland — to provide local organisations seeking to get renewable energy projects up and running, both technical and project support, and strategic development capital from a new $310 million Local Power Fund.
“At the moment we’re all doing great stuff, but working in silos,” Walter Moore from Repower Shoalhaven in NSW, told the Committee on Friday. 
Local Power Hubs will alleviate the constantly repeated learning curve, with “peer-to-peer capacity building”,  “shared resources” and providing “technical support across communities”, says the Local Power Plan.
Three “schemes” are key to the Plan, which is seeking an overall $483 million of Federal funding over 10 years: the Local Power Scheme is complemented by the Underwriting New Community Investment (UNCI) Scheme, which will provide financial certainty to proposed mid-scale energy projects (generation and/or storage) that are at least 51% community owned, which Haines says will “unlock billions of dollars of private investment to support communities to build their local energy independence and resilience”.
And the Community Renewables Investment (CRIS) Scheme will introduce a requirement that local communities be able to purchase 20% project equity in large scale renewable developments planned for their area.
This third component of ALPA is likely to become the most contested.

Both written and verbal submissions to the Committee were largely in favour of the ALPA Bill, with organisations such as Renewable Albury Wodonga (RAW) Energy, presenting evidence of the burnout experienced by under-resourced volunteer organisations passionate about enabling the energy transition at a community level, and sharing the benefits.
RAW Energy has been particularly successful in its community education, sourcing funding for installation of solar on low-income housing, gathering data in support of further initiatives, modelling a mid-sized solar farm for the region and assisting with the establishment of a community energy retailer, Indigo Power — among other activities.
Its representative Narelle Martin wrote in RAW’s submission that the organisation has learned that volunteers can become very thinly stretched, and “volunteering needs to be enjoyable for people to continue their engagement and contribution”. Also that, “Volunteers may not have the skills required for technical and financially complex projects.”
The organisation’s hopes for ALPA are high, saying it would reduce the pressure and expectation of volunteers to help develop critical infrastructure; it would provide access to new financial streams that can “improve the financial resilience of regions”; and it would accelerate the ability of rural and regional communities to share in the social and financial benefits of local renewable energy generation.
Where RAW sees the potential for the Community Renewable Investment Scheme to provide fairer access for project-hosting communities to the financial benefits of large-scale renewable-energy projects, the National Farmers Federation (NFF) expressed “reservations … with respect to profit-sharing arrangements as set out in clause 30 of the Bill”. 
David Jochinke, Vice President of the NFF board, said his membership believes that ALPA would help address the problem experienced by farmers that they are typically not included in early consultation by organisations such as the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), when planning new energy infrastructure.
The NFF written submission to the Committee cited decisions on AEMO’s Integrated System Plan, and the Western Victoria Transmission Network Project had been made in advance of community and local council consultation, such that, “While greater investment in electricity generation has created significant opportunities for regional Australia, the benefits do not necessarily flow nor contribute to the development and growth of regional communities.”
Its submission went on to say that ALPA, “would address these crucial gaps by empowering regional communities and regional stakeholders to be involved in the decision-making process, rather than central authorities”.
Then although the NFF said it agreed with the principle of local benefit sharing by large project developers, “the concept of 20 per cent of the profits going to people living within 30 kilometres (km) appears prescriptive and may even deter investment”, it said, adding that it “would welcome the exploration of new models” to achieve the same benefit-sharing outcomes.
The Clean Energy Council’s written submission by Anna Freeman, the organisation’s Policy Director for Energy and Hydrogen, said the industry also objects to 20% mandated profit sharing, though not to benefit sharing per se. 
Freeman noted on behalf of the CEC’s membership that profit sharing is not mandated “on any other form of major infrastructure development in Australia”, and is therefore inequitable, and singles out a sector which is on average performing better than any other form of energy infrastructure in Australia in terms of sharing benefits with the community”.
The CEC also expressed “grave concerns” about the Bill’s proposal to require Federal ministerial approval of projects involving construction, modification or expansion of large renewable energy generation facilities in Australia, when such projects are already go through a process of approval for development under state planning laws, unless there are foreseen implications of a project under the Environment and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 — as has been the case with the mega Asian Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
Freeman submitted that affording the Federal Minister powers of approval over such projects “would represent a significant overreach in Commonwealth powers and would create another layer of complexity and uncertainty for investment in an already challenging regulatory environment”.
On behalf of Repower Shoalhaven, Moore addressed another salient point in Haines’ reasoning for a community-focused agency, which is that established and successful agencies — such as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Clean Energy Finance Council (CEFC) that have supported innovation in renewables, and the development of large-scale clean energy projects, tend to support corporations and major investors.
Repower Shoalhaven, for example, has developed rooftop solar for local organisations and businesses such as a joint project covering Nowra Bowling Club (45kW), Eagle Park Dairy (30kW)  and Ogden’s Timber & Hardware (20kW); and its most recent project, the 3 MWac Shoalhaven Solar Farm to be co-developed with innovative energy utility Flow Power, opened for investment by members this month.
“We never quite ticked the boxes,” to receive funding from existing agencies like ARENA, Moore told the Committee.
On this point, however, and despite supporting the aims of ALPA, Freeman also questioned the need for a new and separate agency to administer the necessary financial and technical support. She wrote that the CEC suggests these functions “could be effectively implemented by an existing agency if that agency’s mandate and funding were to be increased accordingly.”
The Committee hearing, which began at 9.30am on Friday, wound up at 4.30pm with Haines tweeting, “Thanks so much to everyone who gave evidence today and to the committee members for their thoughtful questions.”
The ALPA bill has certainly highlighted, as Claire Ferres Miles, CEO of Sustainable Victoria said on Friday, that communities want to act on climate change, but currently encounter many barriers to participation — there is an important role for govt-funded staff to support volunteers in community power hubs.

Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE announced it achieved a record efficiency of 13.94% for a mini organic solar module with a surface of 9 cm2.
The panel is based on 14.9%-efficient organic PV cells with a surface of 1.1 cm2 that the same research group unveiled in September 2020. The scientists said at the time they want to explore the use of their device in large-scale, high-performance modules.
“We are really pleased at how the research is developing so positively and we’re optimistic that we will be able to make further improvements in the coming months,” said Uli Würfel, head of Organic and Perovskite Photovoltaics at Fraunhofer ISE and lead researcher at the Freiburg Materials Research Centre (FMF) at the University of Freiburg, referring to the fabrication of the new module.
The solar cells were interconnected using laser structuring. “We were so pleased that it worked straightaway,” stated Jan Nekarda, head of Production Technology — Structuring and Metallisation at Fraunhofer ISE in regard to the process. “Now we’re working on continuing to minimise scribe width.”
Looking forward, the research team said it wants to apply roll-to-roll methods, enabling solar modules to be produced in a similar manner as films. No more technical details on the module technology were revealed.
