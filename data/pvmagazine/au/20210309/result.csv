Nonetheless, the energy giant was ranked Australia’s biggest polluter by the Clean Energy Regulator just over a fortnight ago, revealed to have emitted more than 42 million tonnes of carbon emissions last year. February continued to prove harsh for the energy provider, with AGL announcing a statutory loss of $2.87 billion after tax for the period ended December 31, 2020.
Keen to shake its ugly past, the acquisition ventures to get AGL a foothold in rooftop solar’s increasingly lucrative commercial segment.
“With these acquisitions, we will have the systems and technologies in place to deliver more than 70 MW of commercial solar each year, providing a combined revenue of over $150 million per annum,” AGL’s CEO & Managing Director, Brett Redman, said in statement today.
“This part of the energy sector has seen significant growth over the last 10 years, as businesses right across Australia seek out solar offerings to help them decarbonise, reduce costs and create sustainable operations.”

Established in 2008, Solgen’s wholesale distribution, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business has delivered more than 15,000 projects in the past decade.
Solgen Energy Group CEO David Brown said the acquisition will afford the company new growth.
“This will allow us to provide more customers with best-in-market commercial energy solutions throughout Australia – this group will play a leading role in the future of the broader, national solar energy market,” he said in a statement.
Formed in 2014, Epho specialises in the construction and maintenance of large-scale systems and has delivered more than 400 projects nationwide.
Epho also co-developed the proprietary technology Bright Thinkers Power Station™ which allows large roof-top solar systems to be connected both behind-the-meter and also as an independent, market registered power station; creating a virtual power plant.
“The acquisition of the Epho Group by AGL presents a tremendous opportunity to advance the purpose of Epho and its role in the energy transition in the Corporate and Industrial sector,” Epho’s Managing Director, Oliver Hartley, said in the statement.
“Now backed by AGL, Epho can provide the full suite of on- and off-site renewable energy retail solutions required by our clients to achieve their environmental commitments.
Over the last seven years, Epho has provided solar solutions to much of corporate Australia including ALDI, Coles, Woolworths, DHL, Brisbane Airport, and large industrial landlords such as Goodman, Dexus and ESR.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/09/brisbane-based-flow-battery-company-secures-its-largest-sale-at-1-5-million/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,CALIFORNIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 9, 2021",Brisbane-based flow battery company secures its largest sale at $1.5 million,"The momentous sale will see the largest deployment of Redflow batteries globally, allowing the Brisbane-based company to get a foothold in California – a global clean energy exemplar.
Redflow will provide Anaergia with a 2 MWh system comprising of 192 x 10 kWh flow batteries. The energy storage system will permit Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility to reduce its peak energy use by supplying the stored energy between 4pm and 9pm daily, sidestepping tariffs. Once’s operational, the Anaergia Rialto Bioenergy Facility will be North America’s largest landfill-diverted organic waste digester facility, converting 700 tonnes of organic waste and 300 tonnes of biosolids into renewable natural gas and fertiliser daily.
The US$1.2 million (AU$1.5 million) battery contract is part of Anaergia’s microgrid project, which also includes a biogas conditioning system and was funded in part by a grant from the California Energy Commission.

“Anaergia selected Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow batteries because they are uniquely suited to meet the demands of the Rialto site,” Anaergia’s Chief Operating Officer, Yaniv Scherson, said in a statement. Specifically, zinc-bromine flow batteries are extremely tolerant of heat – which has made them a favourite in sweltering states like the Northern Territory, Western Australia, even Fiji, Thailand – and now California.
“Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility provides the ideal use case for Redflow zinc-bromine flow batteries. Our batteries thrive on heat and hard work – exactly what Anaergia requires from them,” Redflow Managing Director and CEO Tim Harris said.
“This project also enables Redflow to establish a presence in California, where we can offer commercially-proven zinc-bromine flow battery solutions to the broader Californian and US energy market. These markets are expected to accelerate the transition to renewable energy under the new administration of President Biden. We are very excited about the potential for Redflow in California and the broader US market.”

In January, Redflow put the finishing touches on its latest model, the Gen3. Already boasting the world’s smallest commercially available flow batteries, the ZCell and ZBM2, Redflow is looking to move into mass production techniques for the first time with the Gen3. This should lower cost barriers considerably for its deep cycling, long-duration storage solutions. Redflow’s arrival on the American scene seems ideally timed, especially given California’s decarbonisation commitments will require it to add between 45 GW – 55 GW of additional long-duration energy storage before 2045.
Redflow will also provide Anaergia with 12 newly-designed ‘Energy Pods’ to meet the waste conversion facility’s needs. Each of the ‘Energy Pods’ contains 16 Redflow batteries and the power electronics needed to link with external inverters.
As Redflow’s statement published on Tuesday notes, while each of the provided batteries has a rated energy storage capacity of 10kWh, in practice each battery stores about 10.5 kWh of energy, meaning it is comfortable rating Anaergia’s system at 2MWh.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/09/world-leading-vanadium-project-awarded-major-project-status-by-federal-government-progressing-redox-flow-battery-industry-in-nt/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NORTHERN TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 9, 2021","World-leading vanadium project awarded Major Project Status by Federal Government, progressing redox flow battery industry in NT","Granted Major Project Status by the Federal Government on Monday, TNG’s Northern Territory-based Mount Peake Vanadium-Titanium-Iron Project (Mount Peake Project) is the world’s most advanced vanadium project.
Owned entirely by Perth-based TNG, the Project is planned across two separate sites, including a mine and Beneficiation Plant located 235km north of Alice Springs and a processing facility in Darwin’s investment priority area, the Middle Arm Precinct.
These two facilities will see the project vertically integrated from production to market, with TNG describing the project as a “world class multi-commodity resource with in-country value adding.”
The Project is forecast to annually produce around 6,000 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide to be used for vanadium redox flow batteries and steel strengthening, as well as massive quantities of iron oxide and titanium pigment. This will be done through TNG’s patented TIVAN process, which the company says allows it to “overcome limitations of the conventional processing.” 
The Mount Peake Project is expected to be a top-10 global producer.
Having last year established its own green-focused subsidiary, TNG Energy, the company is developing applications for Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are not a new technology but have enjoyed a resurgence of attention as an energy storage solution driven by the fact VRFBs are non-flammable, offer virtually unlimited cycling without degradation and are easily scalable.

TNG are not the only Australian company vertically integrating its vanadium-based endeavours. In 2016, Australian Vanadium Limited set up subsidiary VSUN Energy to drive market demand for VRFBs and help raise capital needed to open its Western Australian vanadium mine. “It takes a lot of time to become an overnight success,” VSUN’s Business Development Manager, Samantha McGahan, told pv magazine Australia.
Yet with its flagship project recognised for being strategic significant by both the Federal and NT Governments, TNG’s Mount Peake Project is clearly leading Australia’s vanadium crusade.
The company is also keen to jump aboard the country’s green hydrogen craze. In September of 2020, TNG announced it will partner with German-based strategic engineering company, SMS Group, to develop carbon-neutral technology and produce green hydrogen. The agreement is part of the company’s bid to optimise its Mount Peake Project, TNG said at the time.
As it stands, TNG is currently progressing with its front-end engineering design (FEED) study, which is also being carried out with SMS Group. Once the final capital expenditure has been determined by the study, the company plans to deliver its Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) proposal.
TNG’s Managing Director and CEO, Paul Burton, said the Government’s recognition of the significance of project will help it with remaining approvals, adding that it “represents an important endorsement of the Project” as the company moves into the next stages of project financing.
“Mount Peake is a world-class project which is set to deliver critical minerals required for the growing demand from the renewable energy sectors from Australia to global markets for many decades to come. The award of Major Project Status by the Australian Federal Government is a testament to the substantial economic and social benefits expected to be delivered by the Project and its potential strategic significance to the Northern Territory and Australia in expanding and diversifying our critical minerals industry,” Burton said in the company’s ASX statement on Monday.
