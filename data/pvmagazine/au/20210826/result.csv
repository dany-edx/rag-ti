After a two-year consultation period, the ESB has made public proposed reforms designed to support the delivery of affordable and reliable power in the NEM beyond 2025.
The proposals seek to strengthen investment in dispatchable generation capacity, deliver essential system services, improve transmission and access arrangements and better integrate distributed energy resources (DER) like rooftop solar.
Included in the ESB’s proposals is a controversial recommendation for incentives to be provided to retain existing fossil fuel-fired power generation “for as long as it is needed to keep the system reliable”.
The “capacity mechanism” will require electricity consumers, via their retailer, to pay primarily conventional generators such as coal and gas plants not just for the electricity they actually generate, but also for the size of capacity installed in the power plant, irrespective of how often that capacity is needed to generate electricity.
Another controversial proposal recommends the creation of a “congestion management model” (CMM) that would result in charges for new generators connecting to the grid outside of designated Renewable Energy Zones (REZ).
CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said while the ESB’s proposed reforms to system strength and a roadmap for DER reform are welcome, the industry is particularly concerned about the CMM and capacity market proposals, saying both create further risk for investors.
“A capacity market could fundamentally change and distort the energy market and price signals for new investment,” he said.
“This would be further compounded should such a scheme ultimately subsidise existing coal plants and unnecessarily prolong the life of fossil fuel generation that is both high emitting and increasingly unreliable.
“Any subsidy for old coal would undermine confidence in new clean energy generation critical to delivering long-term energy reliability of supply, reducing emissions and supporting economic growth.”
Thornton said the CMM proposal would significantly change the nature of access to the electricity grid in a way that creates additional risk and uncertainty for investors and customers and will do nothing to deliver much-needed investment in transmission that is becoming a major barrier to a reliable and clean energy system.
The CEC said the “unhelpful” CMM and capacity market proposals come at a time where the risks and uncertainty continue to mount for clean energy investors, resulting in further stalling in rates of investment in 2021 – down 29% from 2020 levels and 70% on 2018.
“The proposal for a capacity market and CMM will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the investment in new generation and energy storage necessary to deliver a low-cost, zero emissions and reliable supply of electricity for customers,” he said.

The Australian Energy Council (AEC) also raised concerns about the development of a capacity mechanism with chief executive Sarah McNamara warning it needs to be approached carefully.
“We have consistently said that ministers need to take time to ensure any capacity mechanism brought forward is fit for purpose and does not lead to unintended consequences,” she said.
“With the dramatic shifts under way in the electricity sector it is critical any reforms focus on security of supply, avoid disorderly closure of existing capacity and, at the same time, do not impede the energy market’s transition to lower emissions generation.”
Smart Energy Council (SEC) chief executive John Grimes was less accommodating, urging all state and territory governments to reject what he labelled the “Morrison Government’s pro-coal, anti-solar agenda”.
“These are the worst possible policies at the worst possible time,” Grimes said.
“The world is literally burning and the Morrison Government is fuelling the fire.
“The latest United Nations climate report has provided the starkest warning yet that we must stop funding coal projects and instead dramatically increase support for solar and the Morrison Government is heading in the exact opposite direction.
“Energy Ministers should urge Federal Energy Minister, Angus Taylor, to go back to the drawing boards and develop an energy and climate change policy for the 21st Century, ahead of the critical COP26 international climate change meeting in November 2021.”
Energy ministers will meet in September to agree the final package of reforms which will be provided to National Cabinet for consideration in October.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/26/solar-industry-pioneer-pushes-for-national-transmission-network/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 26, 2021",Solar industry pioneer pushes for National Transmission Network,"Solar industry pioneer Andrew Blakers, Professor of Engineering at The Australian National University (ANU), has told a federal government environment and energy committee inquiry that improved transmission infrastructure between the states is urgently required as network operators look to balance an electricity market comprising more and more renewables.
“Stronger interstate transmission is the most important near-term requirement,” Blakers said on Wednesday.
“This includes stronger interstate interconnection for geographical smoothing of supply and demand, and interconnection of cities with Renewable Energy Zones (REZ).”
Blakers called for a National Transmission Network, akin to the National Broadband Network (NBN), that would connect Perth and far north Queensland to the rest of Australia.
“The National Broadband Network was ahead of the curve, a National Transmission Network would be an attempt to get ahead of the curve,” he said.
“It would be true nation-building.”
In his submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy’s inquiry into the current circumstances, and the future need and potential for dispatchable energy generation and storage capability in Australia, Blakers said new solar and wind power capacity is being deployed in Australia about 10 times faster than the global average.
About 18 GW of new solar and wind was deployed in Australia over the three-year period from 2018-2020. About 3 GW of new rooftop solar 4 GW and new solar and wind farms were accredited with the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) in 2020 and the regulator expects 6 GW or more of new solar and wind to be added in each of 2021 and 2022.
Blakers said the rapid deployment of solar and wind is likely to continue because of the compelling economic advantages associated with the technology but warned the increasing levels of renewable energy generation are causing significant challenges for grid management.
Those challenges include low net demand in the middle of sunny days due to rooftop solar generation and the loss of mechanical inertia with the impending retirement of coal-fired power plants and low net demand in the middle of sunny days due to rooftop solar generation.
Over the next 20 years, about 15 GW, or nearly 65% of Australia’s coal-fired generators, are projected to reach the end of their lives and retire.
Blakers said the increasing penetration of renewable energy continued to decrease the capacity factor of some existing fossil fuel power stations which could trigger their premature retirement.
This he said would open the way for additional space for solar and wind but Blakers said the transmission network remains the number one constraint.
Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) is one of the world’s longest interconnected transmission systems. It operates in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. Western Australia is serviced by the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) while the Northern Territory does not have a single interconnected electricity transmission network but rather a series of networks.
Blakers said the NEM was constructed to service a predominantly coal-fired electricity system and while the five NEM states are interconnected, those connections are relatively weak compared with peak loads,.
“Major augmentation of the transmission system is required to cope with rising penetration of solar and wind because good sites for solar and wind farms are generally not co-located with coal power stations which current transmission primarily services,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/26/sun-cable-plans-capacity-increase-for-worlds-largest-solarstorage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 26, 2021",Sun Cable plans capacity increase for world’s largest solar+storage project,"Sun Cable’s mega project is set to get even larger with the consortium behind the proposed Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) –  which would export solar energy from Australia’s Outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link – announcing it will produce much more electricity than originally planned.
Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin said on Wednesday that improvements in solar PV technology meant the proposed solar farm will be significantly larger than the 14 GW originally planned.
“It will certainly be a material uplift from that,” Griffin told the ABC.
“We’re still refining that precise figure but we’ll have more to say about that at the end of September.”
The proposed AAPL already includes a 14 GW solar farm featuring the prefabricated, pre-wired Maverick solar PV system designed by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B. The renewable energy generation will be coupled with an estimated 33 GWh of battery storage.
The project, being developed on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Barkly Region, is expected to supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
Griffin said the capacity increase had been driven by customer demand for more consistent renewable energy generation and improvements in solar PV technology.
“Our customers are wanting more electricity supplied on a flatter profile so more 24/7 rather than the traditional load profile,” he said.
“The other factor is simply improvements in the technology.

“Solar PV technology has come over an extraordinary journey over the last 30 years. Panel prices have fallen more than 99% over that timeframe so it sounds like a mature technology, but it actually has a huge amount of technological advancement to go.
“The roadmap for that is very clear. We understand what the industry is doing to further improve the efficiency of these solar panels and what timeframe that’s going to occur over.
“And those advances are pretty profound. It’s not a mature technology just yet, it’s got a lot of improvements to come so we’re just taking account of those future enhancements.”
Griffin said the expected increase in renewable energy generation will be mirrored with an increase in battery energy storage capacity.
“There’s a marginal increase in the scale of the battery as well but again, a lot of that is reflected in increased efficiencies within the battery technology between now and when the project is built,” he said.
“So once again, there’s no visible change to the system it’s just that its’s operating more efficiently.”
While the capacity increase is not expected to alter the physical scale of the project, Sun Cable has changed the location of where its under-sea cable will land, shifting it from Middle Arm in Darwin to Murrumujuk Beach at Gunn Point, about 60 kilometres northwest of the city.
“We had been intending to base our voltage source converters in Middle Arm,” Griffin said.
“We were going to supply the Darwin Katherine Integrated System (DKIS) with 800 MW of capacity and then transition to submarine cables through Darwin Harbour and off to Singapore.
“But Darwin Harbour is getting pretty crowded with prospective projects and infrastructure that are there already and we didn’t need to compete against conflicting uses when there was perfectly viable alternatives elsewhere so we’ve moved that portion of the system out to Murrumujuk.
“We’ll still supply the Darwin Katherine Integrated System from up there and the submarine cables will transition from there into the sea and directly off to Singapore and avoid the Darwin Harbour area.”
Sun Cable said the AAPL will be capable of supplying up to 20% of Singapore’s total electricity needs, with supply commencing in 2027.
Griffin said the company is still “some time away from kicking off any physical construction” on site but work on the project is progressing with baseline analysis and geotechnical studies continuing.
Actual construction is expected to begin in early 2024 with the first power to be supplied to Darwin in 2026.

Chinese inverter maker Growatt has unveiled the SPF 3000T HVM-G2 inverter for off-grid solar power systems.
The device consists of a built-in MPPT charge controller, an AC charger, and an inverter with a low-frequency transformer. “It allows for surge power at three times of the rated power to support motor-type loads or inductive loads,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “Additionally, thanks to its optimized product design and improvements in both software and hardware, the inverter has a longer design life and comes with a five-year product warranty as standard.”
The 3 kW inverter has an efficiency of 95%, a surge power of 9000 VA, and solar input voltage up to 250 V. It can be connected in series for up to six units for single-phase or three-phase systems to expand capacity to 18 kW.
The device, which also features IP20 enclosures, measures 225 x 300 x 550 mm and weighs in at 27 kg. Its operating ambient temperature ranges from -20 to 50 degrees Celsius.
Growatt stated that the inverter enables power input from multiple sources, including any power generator, a solar array, a storage system, and the power network. “The inverter can work with or without batteries, and it is compatible with mainstream lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries, including Growatt’s Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries that are well-known for [their] safety and reliability,” it further explained. “Additionally, it is designed with Low Voltage Disconnect protection function for batteries.”
