The future of renewables is a combination of large-scale assets, some of which are co-located. At least, that can be inferred in markets such as Australia where developer Neoen is continuing to develop a mix of big wind, PV, and batteries in states that put in place favourable enabling policies such as Renewable Energy Zones.
Victoria, in Australia’s southeast, is one such state that is seeing large scale renewables racing ahead. The French independent power producer (IPP) and project developer Neoen has developed a series of big projects there, with its capacity reaching 652MW with the completion of the Bulgana Green Power Hub today.
The Buglana project sees a 20MW/34MWh battery system installed alongside a 204MW wind installation. The project is set to generate 750,000MWh of renewable energy annually. Tesla supplied the battery system and the project came at a price tag of $350 million.
On completing the project, Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy described its development and grid connection as having been a “long and challenging process,” and one that he was “proud of having overcome it” – likely due in part to the Australian regulator’s strict requirements for renewable projects’ operation.
Construction on Bulgana began in 2018, with the project scheduled to be completed by August 2019. The delay of more than two years in its commissioning was a major headache for Neoen and the project has faced numerous hurdles including the bankruptcy of the slated 15% offtaker Nectar Farms. It will now sell 100% of its output onto Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM).
In a statement, the chairman of Neoen’s global business, Xavier Barbaro, noted that the company is the leading renewable developer in the country. “We are convinced of the value that hybrid assets such as Bulgana Green Power Hub can bring to the market in Australia and globally, and we are proud of our fast-growing expertise in delivering such complex solutions.”
Neoen has constructed and operates the 128MW Numurkah Solar Farm and the Victorian Big Battery(300MW/450MWh) in the state – the latter project having generated headlines in August after two of its Tesla Powerpacks caught fire during the commissioning process earlier this year.
The state of Victoria is currently governed by the center-left Andrews Labor Government. It supported the Bulgana project with a 15-year Support Agreement, the details of which have not been made public, and has put in place a series of subsidies and supportive projects for distributed solar and battery storage. It has a renewable energy target of 50% by 2030.
By contrast, Australia’s conservative coalition federal government has a record of being a laggard on enabling renewables if not outright hostile to them – with policies including the scrapping of the country’s price on carbon emissions in 2014 and unsuccessful attempts to abolish its renewables agency, ARENA, and green finance body, the CEFC.
The outcome of the Victorian state government’s policies has been clear, with the state claiming to be the leader nationally for its increase in renewable energy generation in 2021. Renewable generation in Victoria growing by 3.2TWh in 2021, up from an increase of 2.2TWh from 2019 to 2020.
“We are also proud to achieve Australia’s largest ever annual increase in renewable power, a testament to Victoria’s leadership on clean energy and climate change,” said the state’s energy, environment and climate change minister Lily D’Ambrosio, in a statement. “The Bulgana Green Power Hub is another giant step towards Victoria becoming the renewable energy capital of Australia and achieving our target to halve our emissions by 2030.”
Victoria currently claims a renewable energy share of 32.4% at the end of 2021, up from 26.6% in 2020 and 22.7% in 2019.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/04/arena-pours-funding-into-advanced-inverter-capability-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"JANUARY 4, 2022",ARENA pours funding into advanced inverter capability batteries,"From pv magazine Global. 
Australia is looking to accelerate demonstration of advanced inverter capabilities on battery projects at scale as it continues to search for new ways to provide stability to the electricity system and enable the grid to operate with higher shares of intermittent renewables.
Building on its previous investments in both grid scale batteries and system security, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will now allocate $100 million to further investigate grid-forming inverters that can enable utility-scale batteries to provide system stability services traditionally provided by synchronous generation, such as coal or gas.
Named the Large-Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, the new ARENA program will provide funding to grid-scale batteries of 70MW or larger operating operating in the National Electricity Market (NEM) or Western Australia’s Wholesale Electricity Market. In addition to supporting new build projects, funding will also be available to existing grid scale batteries seeking to retrofit advanced inverter capability or expand an existing or committed battery by constructing a new adjacent project, and incorporating advanced inverter functionality across both the existing and new assets.
It is expected that the funding round will support at least three projects, with a maximum grant available of $35 million per project. Applications will be open to all battery energy storage technologies, provided that they are equipped with advanced inverters, ARENA stated.
Demonstration at scale
The funding round aims to incentivise and derisk private sector investment and overcome barriers to the deployment of advanced inverter technology. By funding advanced inverter technology at scale, ARENA hopes to provide valuable insights into the operations and emerging capabilities of advanced inverters.
“Grid scale batteries and other types of energy storage technology will be vital to support our future electricity system powered by renewables,” ARENA CEO Darren Miller said. “This funding round will demonstrate the role of advanced inverters in grid scale batteries to provide system stability, facilitating a more efficient transition and accelerate the uptake of renewable generation.”
Unlike traditional, grid-following inverters which sync their output to the grid’s voltage waveforms, advanced or grid-forming inverters can set their own frequencies without the inertia generated by large spinning pieces of hardware. This makes them capable of providing the grid with virtual inertia replacing the mechanical inertia traditionally provided by synchronous generators while reducing the current curtailment of solar PV and wind generation.
ARENA’s funding initiative follows the release of the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Application of Advanced Grid-scale Inverters in the NEM report, which highlights the great potential of this technology. The report identifies four key areas of application for advanced inverters – including connecting inverter-based resources in weak grids, supporting system security, island operation, and system restart.
In line with the findings, the paper set out clear recommendations for immediate action to capture the opportunities of advanced inverters, including enabling capabilities on new grid-scale batteries.
“Further funding and support is needed to assist as many new grid-scale battery deployments as possible to incorporate grid-forming capabilities, to build a fleet that can support the transition to high IBR penetration by 2025,” AEMO said.
Another recent study by Powerlink Queensland found that batteries with advanced inverters can play a valuable role in maintaining system strength, supplementing the use of synchronous condensers. The study has showed that grid forming batteries can play a constructive role enabling renewables and supporting the operation of the power system. It found that a 100MW battery can support the connection of 300MW of inverter based generation, specific to the particular case examined.
Growing fleet
Presently, Australia’s largest grid-connected battery using advanced inverter technology is another ARENA funded project – the 30MW/8MWh the Dalrymple ESCRI battery situated on South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula. But, this will be soon overshadowed by the 150MW/193.5MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve, aka the Tesla Big Battery, also in South Australia, once it completes its upgrades to advanced inverters.
Earlier this year, Australian utility AGL broke ground on the 250MW/250MWh Torrens Island battery, touted as the largest planned grid-forming battery in the world. The system will initially start out with a one-hour duration (250MWh) but will be capable of expanding to up to four-hour duration in the future (1000MWh). The Torrens Island battery will be delivered by Finnish technology company Wartsila, use over 100 inverters with grid-forming capabilities supplied from German-headquartered company SMA.
In ARENA’s latest funding round, expressions of interest will open in February, with a due date of March 31. Selected projects will be invited to submit a full application later in the year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/04/rystad-residential-solar-soars-past-ci-in-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,CHINA,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JANUARY 4, 2022",Rystad: Residential solar soars past C&I in 2021,"From pv magazine Global. 
Residential PV achieved a 30% increase in installations in 2021, in a standout figure from Rystad Energy’s year-end summary. According to the analysis, solar installations on homes or small businesses grew from 18.9GW in 2020 to 25.2GW.
The result means that residential PV surpassed the C&I segment for the first time, which registered a decline to 19.9GW in 2021, from 20.6GW in 2020.
One reason for the shift is cost dynamics. With PV module prices having largely increased throughout 2021, as a result of a number of supply chain challenges, larger PV projects are more likely to be postponed or delayed, including those planned for C&I rooftops. The residential segment, by contrast, is more insulated from price increases, with labor and sales costs contributing a larger share of overall PV system cost for the end customer.
Rystad reports that PV module costs increased 57% in 2021, from US$0.21/Wp in 2020 to $0.33/Wp this year. Module material cost increases have been blamed for the increase, which was further compounded by high shipping costs.
The burgeoning Chinese residential rooftop segment, which had been long-awaited and arrived with gusto in 2021, is another driver of residential PV expansion. While not noted in the most-recent Rystad analysis, IHS Markit said that in the first seven months of 2021, China saw 7.66GW of residential rooftop installations – and expected 17GW to be installed throughout the year. Chinese homeowners and developers, in figures reported by IHS Markit analyst Holy Hu in October, installed a massive 1.8GW of rooftop PV in July alone.
Turning to the big end of town, Rystad found that the utility scale solar segment grew by 15% in 2021. Dampening growth has been some 20GW of PV power plant projects that were deferred or delayed in 2021.
“The renewable energy industry is facing some of its most significant challenges yet over the short term,” reported Rystad Energy’s Head of Renewables Research, Gero Farrugio, in a statement. “But the future has never looked brighter with new and aggressive commitments from governments and companies alike.” Farrugio said that carbon-neutral pledges made at the COP26 negotiations in November are likely to result in “major growth in the coming years.”
Across the renewable energy sector, offshore wind, utility scale battery storage, and hydrogen electrolyser installations all saw growth in 2021. Large scale battery installations increased three-fold, and hydrogen electrolyser capacity expanded from 0.04GW in 2020 to 0.08GW in 2021.

Rystad expects 270GW of renewable energy installations to be installed in 2022 – with solar and green hydrogen leading the way. This is despite ongoing PV module price hikes, with the analysts expecting prices to continue to increase to $0.41/Wp in Q3 2022. Rystad says that 50GW of utility scale projects could be threatened by such high prices, “as their economic feasibility dwindles.”
Renewable project transactions point to continued growth, notes Rystad, with 195GW of utility scale wind project transactions having been concluded as of November 2021. This contrasts to just 14.9GW in 2020. Leading greenfield developers for the year were BP and 7 X Energy, and Repsol and Hectate Energy.
Renewable energy’s arrival on the energy sector mainstage was also highlighted by Rystad, with notable acquisitions such as German developer and EPC ib vogt, by DIF Captial, and Italian developer Falck Renewables, which was snapped up by JP Morgan’s infrastructure investment fund.

Huaneng Power International (HPI) has completed the world’s largest floating PV project – a 320 MW facility in Dezhou, in China’s Shandong province.
It deployed the floating array on a reservoir near Huaneng Power’s 2.65 GW Dezhou thermal power station.
It built the solar plant in two phases with capacities of 200 MW and 120 MW, respectively. The first phase, which included the deployment of 8 MWh of storage capacity, was completed in 2020, while the second phase was finished between mid-September and the end of December. The facility is expected to generate around 550 million kWh of electricity per year, the company said, without disclosing additional technical details.

In mid-December, the company also commissioned a 130 MW solar plant in an intertidal zone near Yuhuan, Zhejiang province. It described the Qinggang Photovoltaic Power Station as China’s first intertidal PV project, with 242,000 solar modules deployed across an area spanning 1.2 million square meters.
The project is expected to produce around 150 million kWh per year. It will be resistant to typhoons and water corrosion, among other harsh environmental factors, said the company.
Huaneng Power also plans to build a 2 GW solar plant in Fengcheng, Jiangxi province. The experimental array will include floating PV, agrivoltaics and solar parks on fishponds. The first 320 MW unit will be completed this year, with the rest of the capacity to be installed by 2026.

Project developer Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corporation (SPNEC) has begun construction on the first 50MW unit of a 500MW PV facility on former ranchland in Peñaranda, in the province of Nueva Ecija, in the Central Luzon region.
“The first 50MW is targeted to begin delivering power to the grid by the end of 2022, paving the way for SPNEC to reach profitability and construct the rest of the project by 2023,” the company said in a filing with the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).
“Once the first 50MW begins delivering power to the grid, SPNEC plans to install solar panels for the next 175MW over half a year, and be ready to install solar panels for the rest of the 500MW over a year, given the relative ease of adding capacity to an already operating solar farm.”
When completed, the unsubsidised plant will be the country’s largest solar facility. The project is part of a 1GW PV project pipeline that the company announced in December 2020.
