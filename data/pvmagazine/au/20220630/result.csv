The 2022 Integrated System Plan (ISP), published on Thursday, forecasts that the supply of electricity in the NEM will rapidly transform from a mix dominated by coal-fired generation, to a grid with very high renewable energy penetration, supported by energy storage, transmission, hydropower, gas-fired generation, and distributed energy resources (DER) including rooftop solar.
AEMO said the latest ISP offers four main scenarios, with the most likely scenario, the step change plan, predicting all coal-fired power plants will exit the market by 2043.
The modelling forecasts the withdrawal of 14 GW of coal-fired generation capacity from the NEM by 2030. The currently announced closure timings suggest that only 8.4 GW of the current 23 GW of coal capacity will withdraw by 2030, which implies further withdrawals are still to be announced.
AEMO chief executive officer Daniel Westerman said recent developments, including Origin Energy bringing forward the closure of its Eraring generator in New South Wales, and AGL Energy accelerating the closure of its coal-fired power plants, had reinforced the rapid pace of change in the NEM.

“A clear message from our stakeholders and recent market events is that our energy system transformation is accelerating and irreversible, and ever more comprehensive and challenging,” he said.
“We’ve recently seen market dynamics exhibiting the step change scenario, including accelerated coal-fired power station closures.”
The Australian Energy Council (AEC), the peak body for generators and retailers, said the market operator’s ISP highlights the profound disruption occurring in the grid.
“The rapid decline of coal in our market is front and centre in the ISP along with the need to ensure there is sufficient dispatchable and sustainable resources in place that can operate for extended periods as coal retirements occur,” AEC chief executive officer Sarah McNamara said. “It’s critical we get the transition right to avoid unnecessary disruption and costs for end users.”
AEMO said to compensate for this loss of coal-fired generation capacity, and to meet increasing demand brought on by the electrification of our transport, industry, offices and homes, will require a “significant investment” in renewable energy technology.

The step change scenario forecasts a doubling of electricity consumption from the grid by 2050, up from 180 TWh today to nearly 320 TWh. AEMO said to ensure that demand can be met, will require at least 141 GW of large-scale wind and solar capacity, 61 GW of storage and hydro capacity and 69 GW of small-scale solar and household batteries to be built by 2050.
“To maintain a secure, reliable and affordable electricity supply for consumers through this transition to 2050, investment is required for a nine-fold increase in grid-scale wind and solar capacity, triple the firming capacity (dispatchable storage, hydro and gas-fired generation) and a near five-fold increase in distributed solar,” Westerman said.
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) welcomed the latest ISP, saying it confirms the urgent need to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and energy storage, replace coal-fired power stations, and deliver a more reliable grid that protects customers from high and volatile power prices.
“The message is clear that Australia needs to bring more clean, low-cost energy powered by renewables into the system, and it needs to do so urgently,” CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said in a statement.
“Australia is in the midst of an energy crisis caused by unreliable coal generation and the failure of global fossil-fuel markets. The ISP clearly identifies that reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is key to delivering Australian energy independence.”

Beon Energy Solutions general manager Glen Thomson said with the first “golden rows” now in place, construction activities are expected to ramp up over the coming weeks.
“Despite some recent wet weather, we anticipate steady progress in construction from here on in,” he said. “All going well, construction of the project will be completed early 2023 and commissioned and generating power by mid-2023.”
When operational, more than 450,000 solar modules mounted on single axis tracking systems will generate approximately 500 GWh of electricity annually, enough to power more than 100,000 Australian homes with clean energy.
The Avonlie project is the first standalone solar farm in Iberdrola’s booming Australia renewable energy portfolio, which includes the almost 320 MW Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park in South Australia. The $500 million project will combine 210 MW of wind with 107 MW of solar to generate an estimated 900 GWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power about 180,000 Australian households each year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/30/canadian-fund-manager-snaps-up-stake-in-agl-energy/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 30, 2022",Canadian fund manager snaps up stake in AGL Energy,"AGL Energy confirmed on Thursday it had become aware that a subsidiary of Canadian investment firm Brookfield Asset Management had bought 17.2 million shares in the Australian energy major, representing 2.56% of its register.
AGL said it became aware of the transaction, which occurred late last week, through routine registry analysis responses and acknowledged the information may be historical.
“It is possible that subsequent trading may have altered the position,” AGL said.
“AGL has not received any updated acquisition proposal from Brookfield, since the two proposals received earlier this year that were announced to the market.”
The acquisition comes after Brookfield, in partnership with Australian software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ investment vehicle Grok Ventures, earlier this year tabled two offers to acquire 100% of AGL Energy, Australia’s largest electricity generator and the nation’s largest carbon emitter.
The offers valued the company at more than $8 billion and came with a promise to invest up to $20 billion to build enough large-scale renewables and batteries to bring forward the closures of AGL’s fleet of coal-fired power stations in Victoria and New South Wales.
AGL rejected those buyout offers but Grok has since become the biggest shareholder in the public company, having acquired an 11.28% stake worth an estimated $650 million.
While Grok and Brookfield are no longer in talks about making an offer, the latest transaction adds to the uncertainty surrounding AGL, which last month abandoned its plan to split its business in two, conceding defeat in the face of “opposition from a small number of investors”.
Under the proposed demerger, AGL would have been split into separate entities – energy retailer AGL Australia and generator Accel Energy which would have retained control of the existing coal-fired assets, including the Loy Yang A power station in Victoria, and the Liddell and Bayswater power stations in New South Wales.
AGL said on Thursday it is continuing to focus on a strategic review into the future company, a review it embarked upon immediately after it abandoned the demerger plan.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/30/aemo-reveals-new-roadmap-for-rapid-switch-to-renewables/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 30, 2022",AEMO reveals new roadmap for rapid switch to renewables,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has today published the final version of its 2022 Integrated System Plan (ISP), outlining a 30-year roadmap of investments for what it said is “a true transformation” of the National Electricity Market (NEM), from fossil fuels to firmed renewables.
AEMO said the 104-page document, developed with involvement from more than 1,500 NEM stakeholders, calls for levels of investment in generation, storage, transmission and system services that exceed all previous efforts combined.
“Australia is experiencing a complex, rapid and irreversible energy transformation,” AEMO chief executive officer Daniel Westerman said in a statement.
“The 2022 ISP informs Australia’s energy transformation, based on an optimal development path (ODP) of essential transmission investments that will efficiently enable low-cost, firmed renewable energy to replace exiting coal generation.”
Australia’s traditional fossil-fuel fired generators are being replaced by consumer-led distributed energy resources (DER), utility-scale renewable energy, and new forms of dispatchable resources to firm those renewables but AEMO said it is critical the NEM provide the power system assets and services to ensure these resources are efficient, safe, reliable and secure.
The market operator estimates at least 10,000 kilometres of new transmission is required to connect a nine-fold expansion of wind and solar farm capacity and a near five-fold increase in distributed solar by 2050 and to treble the firming capacity from alternative sources to coal, including utility-scale batteries, hydro storage, gas-fired generation, and smart behind-the-meter virtual power plants (VPPs).
Five transmission projects across New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have been highlighted as top priorities with AEMO saying they should progress as urgently as possible. The five projects – HumeLink, VNI West, Marinus Link, Sydney Ring and New England REZ Transmission Link – are all currently being assessed for regulatory approval or should begin that process soon.
The five priority projects are in addition to another seven transmission links, including Project EnergyConnect and the Victoria-NSW Interconnector Minor upgrade, already under development.

Westerman said the five priority projects would optimise benefits for all who produce, consume and transport electricity in the market; and provide investment certainty.
“These transmission projects are forecast to deliver $28 billion in net market benefits, returning 2.2 times their cost of $12.7 billion, which represents just 7% of the total generation, storage and network investment in the NEM,” he said.
As part of developing the ISP, AEMO and stakeholders identified the most likely future for the NEM, having considered ageing generation plants, technical innovation, economics, government policies, energy security and consumer choice.
The ISP indicates the NEM must triple its overall generation and storage capacity by 2050 if it is to meet the economy’s electricity needs in the ‘step change’ scenario.
“The step change scenario forecasts annual electricity consumption from the grid will double by 2050, as transport, heating, cooking and industrial processes are electrified and 60% of current coal generation exiting by 2030,” Westerman said.
“To maintain a secure, reliable and affordable electricity supply for consumers through this transition to 2050, investment is required for a nine-fold increase in grid-scale wind and solar capacity, triple the firming capacity (dispatchable storage, hydro and gas-fired generation) and a near five-fold increase in distributed solar.”
Today the NEM installed capacity of nearly 60 GW delivers approximately 180 TWh of electricity to industry and homes per year. In Step Change, utility-scale generation and storage capacity would need to grow to 173 GW and deliver 320 TWh per year to customers by 2050 to serve the electrification of our transport, industry, office and homes.
The ISP forecasts that variable renewable energy (VRE) capacity will increase from 16 GW currently to 141 GW by 2050. Additionally, distributed PV is forecast to increase from 15 GW to 69 GW over the same period. To firm that VRE and distributed PV, 63 GW of firm dispatchable capacity and additional power system security services will be needed by 2050.

AEMO also expects that coal-fired generation will continue to withdraw faster than announced, with 60% of the eastern seaboard’s coal fleet to expire by 2030.
“Competition, climate change and operational pressures will intensify with the ever-increasing penetration of firmed renewable generation,” it said. “Current announcements by thermal plant owners suggest that about 8 GW of the current 23 GW of coal-fired generation capacity will withdraw by 2030. In the step change scenario, ISP modelling suggests that 14 GW would withdraw by 2030.”
Westerman said the need to cost-effectively deliver the investment in firmed renewables has gathered momentum in recent months.
“We’ve recently seen market dynamics exhibiting the step change scenario, including accelerated coal-fired power station closures. In addition, generation unavailability and high commodity prices further highlight the need to invest in the transmission plan outlined in the ISP to support firmed renewables,” he said.
“The ISP will help industry participants, investors, governments and communities plan for the decarbonisation of the power system to deliver low-cost, firmed renewable electricity with reliability and security.
“Importantly, the ISP will help meet state and national climate targets, and contribute to economic growth through low-cost, reliable energy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/30/tesla-big-battery-operator-fined-for-power-rules-breach/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 30, 2022",Tesla big battery operator fined for power rules breach,"Hornsdale Power Reserve (HPR), which is owned and operated by French renewable energy giant Neoen, has been ordered to pay a $900,000 fine after admitting to breaches of the National Electricity Rules related to providing back-up contingency services to the grid in 2019.
The fine, ordered by the Federal Court, comes after the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) brought legal action against HPR, claiming that between July and November 2019 it failed to provide contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) to maintain the safe operations of the grid following power disruptions, despite making offers and receiving payment from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to be on stand-by to provide them.
HPR admitted it would have been unable to comply with its offers and provide those services during that period, despite being paid to do so.
The failure was identified when an unexpected outage at the coal-fired Kogan Creek power plant in Queensland in 2019 caused grid disturbances.
The court heard that investigations after the Kogan Creek incident had revealed the battery, also known as the Tesla big battery, had unwittingly been under-delivering on promised stability services since technology provider Tesla had performed a firmware update earlier in 2019.
In announcing the penalty, Federal Court Justice Anthony Besanko acknowledged submissions from HPR that the contraventions were inadvertent and that after the event the company had agreed to repay more than $3.3 million it had received for providing contingency services that it had not delivered over a four-month period.

AER chair Clare Savage said the fine would send an important message to the whole market at a time when many new operators were connecting to the grid.
“It is vital that generators do what they say they can do if we’re going to keep the lights on through our market’s rapid transition to more variable renewable generation,” she said.
“It’s what is expected by every household, small and large business across Australia when they pay their electricity bills.
“AEMO relies on accurate information and compliance with offers and dispatch instructions to ensure it can effectively stabilise frequency deviations.”
In another Federal Court ruling handed down this week, Australia’s largest energy retailer Origin Energy has been hit with a record $17 million fine after it was found to have breached energy retail hardship rules.
Origin was fined for failing to comply with their obligations to protect customers experiencing hardship and payment difficulties, having admitted that the automated processes it put in place to assist customers that have trouble paying their bills caused Origin to breach its hardship obligations more than 100,000 times over four years, between January 2018 and October 2021.

The automated system “unilaterally” created and cancelled customer payment plans and increased repayment amounts, without considering a customers’ capacity to pay.
More than 90,000 customers in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and South Australia were affected by the breaches.
Savage said the fine, the largest total penalty yet imposed for breaches of the National Energy Retail Law and Rules, “should send a strong deterrence message to all energy retailers that they must maintain and implement their hardship policies in accordance with the law, to protect customers experiencing financial distress”.
“This message is even more important in the current market conditions where customers are facing significant cost of living pressures, including as a result of recent energy price rises,” she said.
Origin was also ordered to pay $200,000 in legal costs.
Also on Wednesday, energy giant AGL was fined $3.5 million for failing to seek approval for critical systems settings on the Hallett 1, 2, 4 and 5 wind farms in South Australia for more than three years, including on the day of the 2016 state-wide blackout.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/30/chinese-polysilicon-producer-shuts-down-factory-due-to-fire/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 30, 2022",Chinese polysilicon producer shuts down factory due to fire,"From pv magazine Global
A fire broke out on June 17 at a polysilicon factory run by Chinese manufacturer East Hope, according to Bernreuter Research.
“I don’t expect a major disruption because East Hope was already planning for regular maintenance, but a tangible impact was already visible in the polysilicon price increase last week,” polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter told pv magazine. “The actual impact should be a reduction in production output of around 1,500 metric tons (MT).”
This minimal output drop compares to a decline of around 21,000 MT in 2020, when three different accidents occurred at factories owned by Daqo, Xinjiang GCL, and Sichuan Yongxiang (Tongwei).
“So there is at least an order of magnitude difference between the impacts of the East Hope accident in 2022 and the three incidents combined in 2020,” Bernreuter said. “However, the latter occurred at the historically lowest price point, whereas the current situation is characterised by continuing shortage and the highest prices since October 2011. In such an environment, any disturbance increases the nervousness of market participants on the demand side and spurs further price increases.”
According to Bernreuter Research, East Hope said that the post-fire production shortfall would be limited. It reportedly expects the shutdown to last about one month.
“Polysilicon manufacturers are currently running at full speed in view of the supply shortage and high prices,” said Bernreuter Research. “That may loosen the attention to safety concerns.”
Last week, polysilicon prices reached a high of CNY 280 ($60)/kg in China.
