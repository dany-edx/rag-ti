The rebate will come into effect from today and is part of a larger Clean Energy Car Fund which will also provide another $22.6 million to increase EV charging infrastructure as well as $31 million for additional climate action research and planning.
Somewhat mischievously, the announcement also included the news that the WA government will introduce a distance-based road user charge for zero and low emission light vehicles from July 1, 2027.
This charge, it says, will “ensure all motorists pay their fair share towards the maintenance and construction of WA roads.”
The charge for electric and hydrogen vehicles will have a base rate of 2.5 cents per kilometre and two cents per kilometre for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, both of which will be indexed to the Consumer Price Index.
The McGowan government said it plans to invest $200,000 to develop options on systems for monitoring and collecting the future road user charge.

Coming back to the EV rebates, the government forecasts the average Western Australian driver will save more than $1,400 per year on fuel costs by making the switch – though it isn’t clear which volatile fuel price was used as the base input for this modelling, though likely not the most recent numbers.
Moreover, the government says the 10,000 low emissions cars it hopes the policy will bring onto the road will reduce carbon emissions by “at least” 7,000 tonnes each year.
In terms of EV charging points, it is investing a further $22.6 million from the 2022-23 Budget for new charging infrastructure to expand WA’s network, including:
“I’m excited to announce that Western Australia’s electric vehicle highway, which will be the longest in the world, will receive eight extra charging stations,” WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston added. “With stations from Kununurra to Esperance already being delivered, the new stations between Norseman and Eucla will complete the link to South Australia.”
In terms of the often overlooked solution of public transport, the state’s transport minister, Rita Saffioti, said the government will be introducing electric buses onto the network through our current electric bus trial in Joondalup.
“These new incentives, including electric charging infrastructure at train stations, will help encourage more people to use electric vehicles,” she added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/10/wollongong-university-recruited-for-green-steel-research-project-at-bluescope/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 10, 2022",Wollongong university recruited for green steel research project at Bluescope,"The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) on Monday announced $924,784 in funding for the Port Kembla Steelworks Renewables and Emissions Reduction Study project, which will take place on the New South Wales south coast.
Together with partners Future Fuels Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), which will provide technical input, and the University of Wollongong, which will “provide expertise in process modelling, steelmaking technologies and pneumatic conveying of raw materials,” Bluescope Steel is hoping to find the best ways to launch itself into the green new world. 
The study will consider the technical and economic feasibility of several decarbonisation options for Bluescope’s Port Kembla plant, exploring two main pathways: smart carbon usage and direct carbon avoidance.
The smart carbon usage refers to opportunities to substitute coal with renewable biochar in the steel making process. It will include series of plant trials where BlueScope will investigate partially replacing the coal injected into its blast furnace with biochar. It is not entirely clear why burning biochar would have markedly less emissions than coal, though presumably the actual differences would be figured out in the study.
The second pathway, direct carbon avoidance, refers to the longer term opportunities to decarbonise steelmaking, including through using renewable hydrogen in combination with a direct reduced iron process.
According to ARENA, BlueScope’s Australian operations emitted 7.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in 2019, contributing about 1.3% of Australia’s total emissions. 
NSW government
BlueScope has a medium-term target to reduce steelmaking emissions intensity by 12% between 2018 and 2030 with a net zero by 2050 goal. This will require the steelmaker to get cracking on finding new green processes with Swedish steelmaker SSAB having already delivered its first batch of green steel last year.
The research will happen alongside the work Bluescope is doing with Shell and Rio Tinto.
Last December, Bluescope announced it would be partnering with Shell to investigate the design, construction and operation of a pilot-scale 10 MW renewable hydrogen electrolyser to explore and test the use of green hydrogen in the Port Kembla blast furnace.
Before that, in November, it also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Rio Tinto, saying the agreement would see it further processes to reduce iron ore using green hydrogen “in an electric melter to produce metallic iron suitable to be finished into steel.”

BP is expected to announce a deal for a 30% equity stake in the $36 billion project at the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam this week, according to the outlet. The project is currently being led by InterContinental Energy and CWP Global, with Vestas and Macquarie also holding a stake.
The Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) has been in the planning stages since 2014, getting bigger and bigger every year. In 2017 it was unveiled as a 6 GW hybrid plant, then the plan grew to 9 GW, 11 GW, and now 15 GW. 

The 15 GW hybrid plant (10 GW wind, 5 GW solar) is only the first stage though – with its proponents planning to eventually expand to reach 26 GW of renewable wind and solar generation, servicing industries throughout the Pilbara such as mines and mineral processing, as well as Asian markets with green hydrogen and ammonia. Moreover, AREH is promising at least 3 GW of generation capacity for Pilbara energy users themselves.
The project is hoping to start producing power by 2027.
AREH’s current main developers, CWP Global and InterContinental Energy, are also behind an even bigger $100 billion megaproject in Western Australia, the Western Green Energy Hub. This 50 GW project, if realised, would be the world’s largest renewable hub, and is seeking to produce either 3.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen or, alternatively, 20 million tonnes of green ammonia yearly. 
Coming back to the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, the project made headlines in June last year when federal environment minister Sussan Ley rejected the proposal.

Ley described the expanded project as “clearly unacceptable,” due to the potential impact on protected Eighty Mile Beach wetlands. Strangely, the decision was made before the project’s proponents had even completed their environmental assessment.
The consortium of developers remained undeterred, saying they would amend the plans and try again. BP must be unfazed by the rejection also.
The World Hydrogen Summit 2022 is being held now in Rotterdam and will continue to Wednesday.

In terms of Kidston, which is owned by Genex Power and located in the mid north of Queensland, its AC capacity factor increased 26.4% compared to last year. The Kidston Solar One Project is an integral generator for the Kidston pumped hydro project.
Growing slightly less at 25.5% AC capacity factor was the 10MW Greenough River 1, owned by Bright Energy Investments (a joint venture between DIF Infrastructure, Synergy and Cbus Super).
Similarly, the 100 MW AC Merredin Solar Farm, which was last year bought by Sun Energy from Risen, saw its capacity factor increase by 25.4%.
The analysis came from Rystad’s senior renewables analyst Dave Dixon, who noted that overall April 2022 ended with all Australian utility PV and wind assets generating 2,895 GWh, “up from 2345 GWh (+23%) in April 2021,” Dixon said on LinkedIn.
At a state level, New South Wales was the top performing state, generating 820 GWh from utility solar and wind, Dixon said. Victoria came in second with 713 GWh, and South Australia third with 511 GWh. 
In terms of wind, the top utility assets were mostly in Western Australia and Victoria, with WA taking out four of the top seven spots. 
“The best performing utility wind assets for the month were Goldwind’s / Nebras Power QSC Stockyard Hill 1 wind farm (48.4% CF) in Victoria, followed by APA Group’s Badgingarra (44.5% CF) and Infrastructure Capital Group’s Mumbida wind farm (43.5% CF) both located in Western Australia,” Dixon noted.
He also pointed out, as has been widely covered in the media, that April was the highest month of wholesale prices for all states bar Tasmania on Rystad’s records, dating back to 2011.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/10/longis-ambitious-global-green-hydrogen-plans/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 10, 2022",Longi’s ambitious global green hydrogen plans,"How does Longi view the relationship between hydrogen, solar PV, and storage?  
Li Zhenguo: Longi believes that green power plus green hydrogen is the best solution to achieving carbon neutrality Looking at the progress of solar power over the past 10 years, we believe cost reductions in PV will play a key role in promoting the development of hydrogen. 
Solar power (green electricity) fundamentally reduces carbon emissions in hydrogen production and provides a clean energy source for green hydrogen. Its production is an extensive application of solar energy that can bring hundreds of gigawatt-level increments. In addition, green hydrogen is a new type of energy storage that can address intermittency issues. This is what we call the “green electricity–green hydrogen–green electricity” cycle. 
The world currently consumes about 80 million tonnes of hydrogen every year, and most of it is grey. If green hydrogen accounts for 15% of consumption, it requires about 450 GW of PV installations to support it. That is why we say solar PV and hydrogen production are inextricably linked in terms of scale and cost.  
As a solar PV company, entering the hydrogen industry requires a strategy change. How have you approached this? 
In 2018, Longi began to conduct strategic research into the hydrogen value chain. On Mar. 31, 2021, we officially established Longi Hydrogen Energy Technology Co., Ltd, and our first hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing plant in Wuxi, China. The first 1,000Nm3 / h alkaline water electrolyser was officially launched in October 2021, and so far, several more have been delivered to our customers and put into production. The production capacity of the Wuxi plant will reach 1.5 GW by the end of 2022 and is expected to reach 5 GW to 10 GW by 2025. 
The “green power plus green hydrogen” solution fully covers synthetic methanol, synthetic ammonia, steel smelting, petroleum refining, and other industries that are in urgent need of decarbonisation. Hydrogen production will grow rapidly due to the substantial expansion of downstream hydrogen energy utilisation and dominate in the future era of dual carbon targets. 
As a renewable energy industry leader, we will continue to invest in R&D to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of both solar PV and hydrogen production. Longi Hydrogen has gradually established technology, operations, and marketing teams with experience in large-scale hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing and operations management. In addition, we have developed a five-year development strategy for the hydrogen business and are committed to accelerating the global transition to clean energy. 
What are Longi’s strategic hydrogen plans?  
Longi has launched its alkaline water electrolyser, which marks a significant milestone, and means we have taken a key step towards becoming a world-leading hydrogen technology company. Our electrolyser can provide a hydrogen output of 1,000Nm3/h and we have already provided a 4000Nm3/h hydrogen production system for the world’s largest green hydrogen project. The service life of the equipment exceeds 200,000 hours. The distributed I/O control system realises automatic and unattended operation. We will continue to invest in R&D and innovation and push for the development of products based on our technical abilities. 
What is the biggest challenge for the development of hydrogen and how can it be solved? 
Like other green energies, the development of green hydrogen is highly dependent on policy. Interest rates and carbon prices play critical roles in the cost of green hydrogen. We have made a simple calculation: If the technical cost is considered, the cost of green hydrogen is around US$1.17 to US$1.33 per kg, which is very close to or even lower than that of grey hydrogen. This calculation is sensitive to interest rates. If the local interest is 5%, the cost of green hydrogen will grow to around US$3.33. Therefore, green hydrogen is financially competitive in countries with low-interest rates, like Europe and Japan; but there are still cost difficulties in China. 
The second constraint is carbon price. Compared to grey hydrogen production, green hydrogen saves around 20kg of carbon dioxide emissions for each kilogram of hydrogen. Based on the present carbon price in Europe – which means an extra income of about US$1.33 – it makes green hydrogen more cost competitive. Therefore, green hydrogen has an absolute economical advantage in regions such as the European Union with low-interest rates and high carbon prices. However, in China, the current carbon price from Shanghai Carbon Exchange is only around US$8.33 per metric tonne, which means a compensation rate of around US$0.17 for green hydrogen per kg. This is far from enough for the development of China’s green hydrogen.  
We believe China needs more policy support and has a long way to go to achieve large-scale commercialisation and hydrogen energy industrialisation. First, we need a standard definition of “green hydrogen” and a clear penetration target for our fourteenth and fifteenth five-year plans. The country ought to encourage the use of water electrolysis with renewable energy.  
Second, green hydrogen must be included in the energy management system, and green hydrogen incentive policies must be introduced. The industry needs appropriate subsidies and incentives for green hydrogen and improvement of the carbon trading market. Lastly, like in the Top-Runner program for solar PV, we can promote and demonstrate advanced hydrogen technology in the hydrogen top-runner program initiated by the government. I believe with the support of the state and joint efforts of all market players, China’s green hydrogen industry will grow rapidly and contribute to the realisation of the dual carbon targets. 
What are the trends in green hydrogen prices? 
It is possible to realise US$0.25 per cubic meter on the production side. The cost rise in the PV industry supply chain in the past two years is temporary. I believe the cost of solar PV will continue to decline, and eventually, in many places, PV power will reach 3.33 cents or even lower per KWh. In that case, the power cost for water electrolysis would be around US$0.15 per cubic meter, thus allowing hydrogen to achieve US$0.25 per cubic meter.  
What are the main applications of green hydrogen? 
We see a variety of industries that need hydrogen, and especially green hydrogen. For example, in petroleum refining, hydrogen is used as a feedstock, reagent, and energy source. Hydrotreating is one of the key links in the refining process, involving processes such as hydrogenation, hydrodesulfurisation, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrodemetallisation. Gasoline and diesel hydrogenation, wax oil hydrogenation, and hydrocracking units also require a lot of hydrogen consumption. The global oil refining industry consumes 38 million tonnes of hydrogen every year, accounting for 33% of the global hydrogen demand. The International Energy Agency estimates that demand for hydrogen in the refining industry will continue to grow. Meanwhile, tighter standards for air pollutants will lead to an extra 7% increase in hydrogen use in refining.  
In the field of iron and steel smelting, we can use green hydrogen instead of coke as the main reducing agent to reduce iron ore to produce steel. Unlike conventional blast furnaces using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent, which will result in a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions, the utilisation of hydrogen will reduce these and realise low-carbon or zero-carbon steelmaking. The steel industry has long been one of the industrial sectors with the most significant carbon emissions, accounting for 18% of China’s total carbon emissions – second only to the power generation and heating sector. That is why we say the use of hydrogen steelmaking technology to replace the traditional steelmaking process will contribute to achieving Chinas carbon neutrality targets. 
What role will hydrogen play in helping China achieve its carbon targets? 
When we talk about carbon neutrality, there must be a carbon sink to correspond to the carbon dioxide emission limit. China has only a few hundred million tonnes of forest carbon sink per year, which cannot fulfil the national emission demands.  
Today, 42% of China’s carbon dioxide emissions are tied to electricity generation, and the remaining are mainly from energy, chemical, iron and steel smelting, and other fields. Vehicles in future cities can be decarbonised directly with clean electricity, but ocean freighters and aviation aircraft cannot do this. The battery energy density is still too low to provide continuous power for long-distance transportation. In addition, daily heating, cooking, and other energy consumption activities also need cleaner energy. Therefore, the introduction of green hydrogen can help human society to achieve deep decarbonisation.

Lithion said this week that its lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) residential battery is now UL-certified when paired with Sol-Ark 12K hybrid inverters. The company achieved UL 9540 certification after going through rigorous testing for reliability and safety.
The Stack’d Series LFP batteries are a modular platform that can be scaled in 4.8 kWh increments, from 9.6 kWh to 38.4 kWh. The company is vertically integrated, using its own Tier 1 prismatic cells in the composition of the battery.
While many battery providers claim whole home backup capability, central A/C and other large appliances may not be able to start up after an outage, Lithion said. The company’s battery is capable of up to 16.8 kW surge and 14.4 kW continuous power, providing true whole-home backup.
LFP batteries are known for their reduced fire risk due to the elimination of cobalt, which is known to be connected to mining practices that have human rights and environmental concerns. The company said its batteries are designed to be readily recyclable at the end of their lifecycle.
The battery is paired with a low-voltage 48 V system, IP55 water and dust resistance, and a proprietary battery management system, all elements of the safety and stability of the battery. A 10-year, 4,000-cycle full-refund warranty is included.
Sol-Ark said the battery makes a good match for its inverters, boosting ease of install. “With our upcoming Sol-Ark 15K, the Stack’d Series battery will be the only battery on the market to maximise its capability,” said Bhawna Oberoi, COO of Sol-Ark.
Lithion’s modular designs make a “drop-in” solution for replacing lead acid batteries, designing them to be easy to implement without retooling efforts. This leads to cuts in purchasing, inventory, and servicing costs, said Lithion. The company is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.
Sol-Ark is a Texas-based company started in 2013 by local US veterans with experience in semiconductors and power electronics. It has multiple production lines for its inverter lines, including the Sol-Ark 12K hybrid, which makes for a full home backup and off-grid solution when paired with the Stack’d Series batteries.
