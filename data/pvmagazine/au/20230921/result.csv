The UN’s new Global Stocktake makes clear we need to accelerate the race to net zero.
It’s time to act as quickly as humanly possible. This week, Australia’s leading engineers and technology experts from the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering have called for Australia to get to net zero 15 years quicker than our current goal of 2050 to be more consistent with a 1.5℃ trajectory.
It will be hard. But ask yourself – what is the alternative?
To shake us out of business as usual, we have to fast-track regulatory change, upskill the workforce, future-proof national infrastructure, embed a zero-waste approach to supply chains and massively boost business investment. Here’s how.
Per capita, Australia is the world leader in solar and wind generation. But we’ll need more as we electrify the entire economy, which will triple demand.
To get there means investing in distribution, transmission, battery and pumped hydro storage and grid integration. All of this has to be fast-tracked through closer engagement with communities and streamlined regulations.
Electrifying our export industries is vital for both Australia’s and the world’s net zero efforts. This would make full use of our advantages in cheap power from renewables such as by making green hydrogen, which can help with green chemical and green metals manufacturing.
Pulling carbon dioxide back out of the air is another potential “export” industry. Direct air capture will be needed to bring levels in the atmosphere back down, and Australia could use cheap renewable energy to do it, and sell the credits to offset hard-to-abate areas such as plane flights.

Supply chains of products and raw materials put out emissions at every step along the way. Some emissions are from activities in Australia, others overseas. But all end up in the atmosphere.
Fixing this means slashing waste and removing emissions at every stage of production, from raw materials to recycling. Our food systems produce an estimated 29% of global emissions but around 30–40% of food is wasted.
But it’s more than that. The end goal must be embracing a circular economy, where overconsumption is phased out and waste becomes the feedstock for new products. We can greatly accelerate our efforts by working with European authorities, given they are far ahead of Australia here.
Emissions from our buildings come largely from electricity and gas use, with embodied emissions from, say, the use of concrete in construction a smaller concern. Here, the low-hanging fruit is moving to zero-emissions electricity and switching from gas to electricity.
Banning new household connections to the gas network as Victoria and the ACT are doing, is another opportunity.
When gas heaters reach their end of life, we can require they be replaced by electric heaters. This won’t significantly increase the grid demand if high efficiency heat pumps are used.
And we should boost efficiency standards still further for new buildings and major renovations. Australia’s new National Construction Code will help, but more can be done.
In the longer term, cement made without emissions and new construction methods will help further cut emissions.
After a slow start, electric cars are finally gaining popularity in Australia. Now we’re seeing electric utes and trucks. Electric buses are already on the roads in some states. This is essential. Now it’s time to speed it up.
We need all states and territories on board to plan for a phase-out of internal combustion engines, coupled with better investment in public and private charging infrastructure.
Electrifying transport will give us enormous battery packs in our driveways – often several times the capacity of a home battery. New technologies such as vehicle-to-grid will let us use our cars as grid backup and give households security if there’s a blackout.
Shipping giants are working on the challenge of cleaning up emissions, while work is being done on electric planes. These are harder nuts to crack, but already there are electric ferries up and running in Europe and short-trip electric planes on sale in Australia.

Some farms are already running on solar and storage for cost and energy security reasons. But there’s more to do, such as slashing emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide from fertilisers using nitrification inhibitors.
In mining, some operators are rapidly cleaning up their operations – and often for cost reasons. Running a mine site on diesel is expensive. We need to accelerate the shift here towards powering grinding machines, excavators and ore trains with renewables.
Some problems don’t yet have off-the-shelf solutions, such as reducing methane from livestock or producing steel cost-effectively without using coal.
These hard-to-cut sources of emissions will need significant and sustained investment to produce practical and cost-effective technologies solving the problems.
Swapping fossil fuels for clean technologies will take talking as well as technology. Many of us find change confronting, especially at this pace.
So we need to do this right, sharing economic benefits and preserving the social fabric of communities and avoiding damaging nature. The debate over new transmission lines is a case in point.
We’ll need an honest national conversation – and one that isn’t limited to expert, government and industry circles.
We have new institutions to help us move faster, such as the Net Zero Authority, the new mandates for the Climate Change Authority, and the sector-level net zero plans in progress.
Now we need to get on and do it. Yes, it’s faster than we thought possible. But fast is now necessary.

Naturally occurring hydrogen, known as ‘white’ or ‘gold’ hydrogen, is attracting increasing attention as a potential new renewable energy source with proponents confident the resource could be exploited at a lower cost than producing the gas from fossil fuels or electrolysis.
H2EX Chief Executive Officer Mark Hanna said the CSIRO’s latest report shows that the gas soil sampling field survey observed high-confidence hydrogen seeps in PEL 691, an exploration permit awarded to H2EX in June 2022.
The CSIRO and H2EX have completed two research agreements focused on the almost 6,000 square kilometre Eyre Peninsula site; a desktop study in December 2022 and a fieldwork survey conducted in April-May 2023.
Hanna said the work with CSIRO over the past year confirms that “where we theorised natural hydrogen is being generated subsurface correlates with high-confidence hydrogen seeps detected in the soil.”
“We now focus our attention to mapping the subsurface to identify commercial accumulations of natural hydrogen,” he said.

H2EX Chief Financial Officer Greschen Brecker said the company will now work with Fleet which will use its Exosphere scanning technology to explore prospective natural hydrogen zones identified by the CSIRO. The survey is expected to commence later this year.
Fleet said the Exosphere system is designed to help exploration customers reduce the time it takes to make a potential discovery.
Fleet said the Exosphere system delivers detailed subsurface 3D mapping using an array of geode sensors. The sensors create a detailed map of the subsurface using ambient noise tomography which listens to seismic waves present on Earth.
Fleet Chief Executive Flavia Tata Nardini said the data is then transmitted and processed via the company’s constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit to deliver a 3D visualisation of the area in near real-time, reducing the data acquisition process from six months to as little as a few days.
Brecker said the technology makes the exploration process faster, more sustainable, less expensive and more accurate.
“Fleet Space Technologies have the ability to considerably accelerate exploration, which is exactly what we need to deliver a clean energy revolution by 2030,” she said.

“The NEM renewable energy share has peaked for the day and we have a new record,” GPE said, adding that it expects the record will be broken many more times before the year is done.
Prior to Wednesday, the record for renewable energy share in the NEM was 69.6%, a mark established on 28 October 2022.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) confirmed Wednesday’s record high, although it declared the renewable energy share had reached 69.9% between 11am and 11.30am.
“At the time, rooftop solar generation contributed 38%, grid-scale solar 17%, wind 13% and hydro 2%, combining to deliver more than 19 GW of electricity to homes and businesses,” AEMO said.
AEMO’s figures are based on data recorded at 30-minute intervals while GPE relies on data published at five-minute intervals.
The new renewable generation high comes after operational minimum demand in the NEM reached a record low at the weekend.
AEMO said that demand reached a record low of 11,393MW at 12.30pm on Saturday, a 4.2% fall from the previous record set in November 2022.
At the time, rooftop and grid-scale solar contributed 57% of total electricity supply in the NEM.

The 50:50 BMA joint venture, which is targeting net zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, operates seven coal mines in Queensland’s Bowen Basin. It also owns and operates the Hay Point Coal Terminal near Mackay.
The new PPA effectively extends an existing renewable power agreement between BMA and CleanCo currently running to the end of 2025. The new PPA will enable BMA to continue to source half of its expected electricity needs from renewable sources such as solar and wind, as well as pumped hydro.
BHP President Australia Geraldine Slattery said the link with CleanCo would improve the long-term sustainability of BHP’s business and support regional communities and jobs.
“We are increasing renewable electricity at BMA in line with our decarbonisation commitments to 2030 and beyond,” she said.
The new PPA will help support the ongoing development of Neoen’s 460 MW Western Downs solar farm. The solar farm, part of the planned Western Downs Green Power Hub that will also include a 200 MW/400 MWh big battery, is already supplying electricity to the grid and is expected to reach full commercial operations later this year.
The power agreement will also support the development of the 180 MW Dulacca Wind Farm which is currently under construction and is expected to come online in late 2023, Acciona Energia’s 2 GW MacIntyre Wind Farm that is due for completion in 2025, and the 157 MW Kaban Wind Farm that is expected to achieve full commercial operations by late 2023.

CleanCo has also directly incorporated storage capabilities of the 570 MW Wivenhoe pumped hydro energy storage facility near Toowoomba into the PPA.
The agreement allows CleanCo to store renewable energy at Wivenhoe for the direct benefit of BMA when it is required.
CleanCo Chief Executive Officer Tom Metcalfe said this will ensure the gen-tailer can effectively match the renewable energy purchased to those times when BMA needs electricity most, not just when wind and solar energy is available.
“We are committed to providing tailored, clean energy solutions to help our customers decarbonise,” he said.
“Mining is an energy intensive industry. It is our role to develop solutions that meet the unique energy needs of these companies so that they can thrive in a net zero future.”
BHP says it is on track to achieve its medium-term target to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% by 2030. BHP also has a long-term goal to achieve net zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/21/agl-awards-demolition-contact-for-torrens-island-gas-power-plant/,"MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",AGL awards demolition contact for Torrens Island gas power plant,"Australian energy giant AGL said demolition work at its Torrens Island A power station in Adelaide will commence in October with McMahon Group appointed as demolition contractor for the first phase.
AGL began progressively closing the gas-fired power station in September 2020, when the first two of four units ceased operation. The third unit was mothballed in September 2021, and the final unit closed in September 2022.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the appointment of McMahon Services as the demolition contractor is an important step in the transition of the Torrens site into a clean energy precinct.
“This marks another significant milestone in AGL’s journey to decarbonisation, as we transition the site to a low carbon, industrial energy hub,” he said.
AGL has already commenced that process with a 250 MW/250 MWh battery energy storage system at the site now live. It is expected the Torrens Island battery will eventually be expanded to four hours of storage as it plays a greater role in shifting wind and solar output to times of peak periods.
“The Torrens site is a great example of the energy transition in action,” Brokhof said. “In the past three years we have closed Torrens A power station, built a gas peaking plant, and built and opened the second largest battery in Australia, providing flexibility and storage for the South Australian energy grid.”
AGL has also announced plans to close the Torrens Island ‘B’ power station on 30 June 2026, following the mothballing of one of its four units in 2021.
The demolition of the Torrens A power plant is expected to take about two years. The first phase will involve the removal of turbine hall equipment and demolition works to flue ducts and cooling water infrastructure.
AGL said it plans to recycle 90% of the scrap steel during the demolition while some key infrastructure will also be retained and repurposed as the fossil-fuel generation plant is transformed into a clean energy hub.

Hitachi Energy has supplied Ovako with a modular eHouse solution for the electrification of a 20 MW electrolyser in Hofors, Sweden. The project marks the world’s first steel plant to use hydrogen for heating before the rolling process. Beyond steel heating, the hydrogen will fuel cell-powered trucks, and surplus heat from the plant will support district heating. Hitachi Energy’s delivery includes a modular Grid-to-Stack solution, with components such as transformers, rectifiers, control equipment, and high-current connections to convert alternating current from the distribution grid into the direct current required for the electrolyzer. The company has collaborated on the system’s development with Volvo Group, H2 Green Steel, and Nel Hydrogen.
Enapter has expanded its product lineup with the introduction of the “AEM Flex 120,” a new AEM electrolyser for industrial and refueling pilot projects. The AEM Flex 120 features up to 50 AEM Stack core modules, ensuring high reactivity to fluctuating renewable energy sources. It can produce approximately 53 kg of hydrogen per day at 99.999 percent purity, with the option for a dryer. This electrolyzer addresses the market gap between Enapter’s AEM Electrolyser EL 4 (1 kg/day) and its megawatt-scale AEM Multicore (450 kg/day), and the company is scaling up its production capacities to meet demand.
The Port of Rotterdam and the inland Port of Duisburg have jointly presented the findings of a feasibility study focused on North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The results show a significant local increase in demand for low-carbon hydrogen, exceeding 3 million tons per year until 2045. To meet this growing demand for green hydrogen in the medium term, the study recommends completing the first hydrogen pipeline between the two ports by 2027. Subsequently, pipelines for hydrogen derivatives and CO2 export should follow, complementing the essential roles of inland shipping and rail transport.
Rina, in collaboration with SEA Aeroporti di Milano and the local branch of the Italian enterprises federation Confindustria, has launched the Hydrogen Valley Malpensa project – Italy’s first hydrogen valley in an airport environment. The project’s objective is to establish a complete hydrogen supply chain ecosystem by September 2027. Participants in the project include Air Pullman, Artelys, Circe, Emisia, and Lhyfe Labs, making it a collaborative effort involving various stakeholders.
Nuvera Fuel Cells has agreed to supply a hydrogen fuel cell system for a reachstacker developed by Hyster, which has been delivered to the Port of Valencia in Spain as part of the H2Ports project. This initiative aims to introduce hydrogen-powered vehicles and equipment into port operations. “The hydrogen is stored in high-pressure tanks and can be refilled less than 15 minutes,” said Nuvera Fuel Cells. “The hydrogen fuel cell charges the batteries, which power the electric motors and hydraulic systems, enabling the reachstacker to lift laden containers with comparable performance to a diesel alternative.”
Irish Rail and Digas have signed a contract for a proof-of-concept project to convert a diesel locomotive from traditional diesel fuel to hydrogen. As part of this €1.5 million project, Irish Rail will provide the 071 Class Diesel Locomotive for the conversion, while Digas will manufacture and install a Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (H2 ICE). The project’s success could demonstrate a practical and cost-effective means to decarbonise and operate existing diesel locomotives with hydrogen-powered engines, offering environmental benefits for rail transportation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/21/indian-scientists-making-high-purity-polysilicon-ingots-from-recyled-pv-cells/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,INDIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2023",Indian scientists making high-purity polysilicon ingots from recyled PV cells,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) in India have used the SPS technique to produce polysilicon ingots from recycled solar cells in end-of-life PV modules. They claim to have produced small-sized ingots with purity levels of 98% to 99%.
These purity levels slightly exceed the 3N purity level, which the scientists say is greater than that of metallurgical-grade silicon. It is also “good enough” for applications other than solar cells, like battery materials.
“Currently, we are working towards the purification process of recovered silicon to grow ingot better than 5N, so that same can be used in the fabrication of new solar cells,” researcher Sushil Kumar told pv magazine. “This work is expected to be completed in the next few months.”
The scientists used a modified hot pressing technology known as SPS, involving the passage of pulsed direct current with millisecond pulse widths, high current, and low voltage through the pressing tool and sintered body. This approach enables rapid heating and short processing times, typically within a few minutes. The researchers specifically applied this technique to consolidate the silicon powder obtained from the recycled solar cells.
They conducted the experiment on a 98 cm × 164 cm solar module, weighing 17.18 kg. They used a mechanical treatment to remove the aluminum frame (0.62 kg) and the junction box. They then cut down the remaining parts of the panel into small pieces of varying sizes, ranging from 9.5 cm × 11 cm to 12 cm × 16 cm.
The process involved thermally treating the recovered wafer pieces on a stainless steel plate at an optimised temperature of 480°C for 30 minutes in a muffle furnace, resulting in a total weight of 23.04 grams. Glass, silicon cell fragments, and connecting wires were recovered, while the EVA encapsulant and backsheet were removed. To eliminate residual ash adhering to the cell pieces, the cell fragments underwent ultrasonic cleaning with hot distilled water for one hour.
Subsequently, the researchers utilized SPS to consolidate the powder at temperatures ranging from 1,100 C to 1,200 C, significantly below silicon’s melting point of 1,410 C. The sintering cycles were conducted for up to 20 minutes under vacuum conditions.
The Indian team reported removal rates of 97.72% for aluminum and 99.90% for silver through this process. Using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, they determined that the resulting ingots achieved a purity level exceeding 3N.
“Despite the fact that recovered silicon from waste is used in the production, it is highly likely that ingots of much greater purity can be easily produced through upgraded recovery and purification techniques,” the academics concluded.
They presented the new technique in “Growth and analysis of polycrystalline silicon ingots using recycled silicon from waste solar module,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
