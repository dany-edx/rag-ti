In line with its commitment to the Paris Agreement, Indonesia has set an ambitious target for its vehicle industry. By 2025 it wants at least 20% of the cars it produces to be electric vehicles. That equates to about 400,000 cars.
Indonesian government programs such as the Low-Cost Green Car incentives and Low-Carbon-Emission Vehicle regulations are driving this transition.
Most vehicles made in Indonesia involve joint ventures with foreign manufacturers. To produce electric vehicles, Indonesia established joint ventures with Korea’s Hyundai and China’s SGMW.
The government’s goal is for the Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC) to become a hub of EV battery manufacturing. This would take advantage of Indonesia’s rich nickel deposits. However, the country lacks other ingredients to make these batteries, most notably lithium.

Indonesia aims to be in the world’s top five EV battery producers by 2040. To achieve this, it needs to secure access to other minerals, including lithium. Australian mines supply around half of the world’s lithium.
Other important suppliers include Chile (24%) and China (16%). But being close to Indonesia makes Australia the most attractive supplier.
So far most of Australia’s lithium exports have gone to China. Given changing geopolitics (for example, Chile plans to nationalise its lithium industry) and global supply-chain disruptions (the Russia-Ukraine war, the China-US tension), Australia would benefit from exporting lithium to Indonesia as well.
We could need 6 times more of the minerals used for renewables and batteries. How can we avoid a huge increase in mining impacts? https://t.co/fCvTI8V5yU via @ConversationEDU

Australia is the world’s largest producer of spodumene. This mineral is rich in lithium.
However, Australia has limited capacity to refine all that spodumene into the lithium hydroxide used to make lithium-based batteries. It makes sense, then, to exploit this resource as part of the global supply chain, by linking with battery and car industries in Indonesia and other countries.
Australia is a small player in global manufacturing trade. However, its share of the global production network has been increasing.
Australia has a distinct competitive edge in specialised components. These include parts for aircraft and associated equipment, vehicles, earth-moving and mineral-processing machines, and finished products such as medical and surgical equipment.
However, Australia’s geographical location puts it at a disadvantage as an exporter. It costs more to export to distant major markets.
Specialising in high value-to-weight components helps to overcome this “tyranny of distance”. Exporting raw materials (including lithium) and importing the derivatives back to produce high-value goods is better for Australia.

In February 2023 the Western Australian government and Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to explore partnership opportunities. The focus is on supplying critical minerals for the battery industry. Widodo and WA Premier Roger Cook signed a follow-up plan of action this week.
Australia and Indonesia are expected to sign an MOU that will accelerate co-operation on the global battery and electric vehicle sector. Tuesday’s joint communique included a commitment to pursue this goal.
As both countries begin to decarbonise, they should exploit the complementary aspects of their economies. Both are embarking on the journey of energy transition to deal with the challenges of climate change.
It is important, however, not to limit this to a two-country endeavour. For a start, an EV battery needs much more than just nickel and lithium. Many of its components need to be sourced from other countries. And an EV battery industry should be integrated with an automotive industry supplying global markets.
The joint ventures may also extend to mineral processing. In Indonesia, electricity from coal powers most smelters. Collaboration on the energy transition should include a shift to clean wind, hydro and solar power.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/06/ausgrid-adopts-pole-mounted-technology-for-community-battery-trial/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 6, 2023",Ausgrid adopts pole-mounted technology for community battery trial,"Ausgrid said the 30 kVA/60 kWh EcoStore pole-mounted battery energy storage system installed in the Hunter Valley city of Maitland will support all properties connected to the local distribution network, helping to maximise the value of rooftop solar energy while at the same time improving grid reliability.
The EcoStore battery energy storage system, supplied by Queensland-based manufacturer EcoJoule Energy, comprises three pole-mounted cabinets, each containing a 10 kVA/21.9 kWh battery coordinated to operate as a three-phase system. Ecojoule said the system is fitted with in-built network support technology which can improve the voltage delivered to consumers as well as reduce phase unbalance.
The Maitland battery is the first of several pole-mounted community battery energy storage systems that Ausgrid plans to deploy with additional pole-top batteries to be installed at strategic locations across its distribution network in Newcastle and the Central Coast in the coming weeks.

Ausgrid said the trial of pole-mounted batteries will complement the network operator’s larger community battery program and will improve its understanding of solutions to support the growth of renewable energy in its networks.
Junayd Hollis, Ausgrid’s Asset Management Executive General Manager, said he expects the trial to demonstrate the ability of pole-mounted battery energy storage systems to improve network hosting capacity, reduce voltage imbalance and manage peak loads.
“Pole-top batteries will play a crucial role in integrating more renewable energy into the grid,” he said. “They can store excess energy generated during periods of high production and release it during times of low production or high demand.”
Hollis said if successful, the pole-top battery systems could eliminate the need for more extensive network augmentation that would otherwise be necessary to address network constraints.
The installation of the pole-top battery comes just days after Ausgrid announced that it is partnering with the federal government to deliver six new community batteries for Sydney and Central Coast communities.
The projects are being jointly funded and planned in partnership with Ausgrid and the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water’s Community Batteries for Household Solar Program.
The batteries will be installed in Bondi, Cabarita, Cammeray, Narara, North Epping, and Warriewood.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/06/report-finds-south-korean-partnership-essential-for-australias-critical-minerals-future/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 6, 2023",Report finds South Korean partnership essential for Australia’s critical minerals future,"The Value-Added Critical Minerals Bilateral Agreement for Australia and South Korea report urges the Australian government to form a strong international relationship with South Korea, with one eye on the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The $1.2 trillion (USD 800 billion) economic stimulus created from the IRA and Department of Energy’s (DoE) Loan Program Office funding has been the catalyst for an investment race in global decarbonisation technology. A significant part of the funding is dedicated to energy storage, namely batteries.
The IRA has been responsible for major growth in manufacturing in the U.S., and battery and electric vehicle (EV) industries have been central to the boom, with South Korea already a key player in battery technology and manufacturing.

South Korea is the second-largest battery producer in the world behind China, with three of its majors accounting for over a quarter of the EV battery manufacturer market share in 2022. The country has already made significant investment to supply downstream battery facilities to the US, and is the largest foreign investor into new battery facilities in the country.
The report suggests that allied nations, such as Australia and South Korea, should now look to leverage the stimulus through supply chain investment and capacity.
Australia’s abundance of critical minerals and mining expertise means it is perfectly positioned to capitalise on a bilateral agreement that focuses on battery supply chains.
The need for a stable, long-term lithium supply is central to South Korea’s manufacturing growth. While Australia is the largest lithium producer in the world, South American nations such as Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, as well as Indonesia, are all well-placed to compete and have existing trade relationships with Korean firms.
In 2022 Australia produced nearly half of all extracted lithium, with the majority exported in an unprocessed state to China. Several Western Australia producers have begun producing battery-grade refined lithium hydroxide, the precursor for battery cathodes.
Refining partnerships
Australia’s refining process, which uses hard-rock mineral supply to produce hydroxide, provides the country’s lithium producers with a significant competitive advantage compared with those in South America. The CPE report quotes economic modelling from a McKinsey study that found Australia could produce lithium hydroxide up to 52% cheaper than the rest of the world by 2030.

“Australia must now, as a key strategic priority, work constructively with South Korea to ensure both economies are dealt into the North American value-added cleantech opportunity, and to leverage our combined world-leading capacity and skill sets,” authors Matt Pollard and Tim Buckley state in the report.
“Harnessing Australia’s world-leading expertise in mining and mineral extraction/processing and renewable energy resources, and leveraging Korea’s world-leading battery IP and technology, there is potential to become a joint powerhouse in the global battery midstream market, capitalising on the generational opportunity of the IRA.”
The report also suggests Australia must commit more resources and industry support to take advantage of its own partnership with the U.S., the Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact announced in May.
The Central Energy Fund estimates Australia will need $100 billion of public capital to ‘crowd in’ $200 billion  of private investment.
The Federal Government’s recently released Critical Minerals Strategy 2023-2030, CEF notes, is a “missed opportunity”, and lacks the necessary ambition and support to leverage Australia’s competitive advantage in critical mineral and renewable energy resources.
The report suggests the $500 million (USD 334.3 million) investment committed by the Albanese government falls well short of the requisite funding to build scope, scale and speed to leverage Australia’s opportunity to become a world leader in value-added critical minerals.
Opportunities beyond South Korea
Within Australia, states are already beginning to look abroad for critical investment opportunities, including with other major lithium-producing nations.
The Western Australian government this week signed a Plan of Action with Indonesia’s Chamber of Commerce, in a move that will promote investment and collaboration in value-adding critical minerals and battery industries.
“We’re committed to growing the State’s participation in global battery and critical mineral supply chains, with a view to further developing our value-adding and manufacturing industries,” WA’s freshly installed premier Roger Cook said in a statement.
“Working with Indonesia, an important trading partner and our closest neighbour to explore partnerships, share information, knowledge and strategies and facilitate business links will fuel our mutual economic growth and green ambitions.”
The agreement encompasses three pillars of co-operation, which are: to develop resilient and sustainable supply chains; support strong environmental and social governance outcomes; and grow a skilled workforce.

The Green Energy Approvals Initiative is aimed at driving investment in wind and solar projects, green hydrogen, lithium mining, critical minerals processing as well as manufacturing of renewable energy products such as batteries, electrolysers, solar panels and wind turbines.
“This new, streamlined approvals pathway will ensure Western Australia continues to be a destination of choice for renewable industry investors,” WA Premier Roger Cook said.
“The whole-of-government Green Energy Approvals Initiative will drive the green industries boom in WA, supporting local jobs and a strong economy into the future. It will draw new investment and improve our renewable energy credentials.”
The state government said more than 40 green energy projects are currently being assessed or regulated by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation with a further 30-plus proposals expected to be referred for assessment over the next 12 months.
It is anticipated a significant number of these projects will be targeted by the new initiative in the coming weeks to allow processes to be trialled and optimised.
A Green Energy Major Projects Group is being established within the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation as a first point of contact to help steer projects and investors through government processes.
The creation of a Green Energy Expert Panel comprising of government and industry will provide the independent Environmental Protection Authority with the information needed to progress approvals in a timely manner.
WA Environment Minister Reece Whitby said the unique cross-agency model would help deliver faster decisions on renewable energy projects.
“Green energy projects are critical to our renewable energy transition,” he said. “This is the next step to support industries in their contribution to global efforts to decarbonise our economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/06/membrane-boosts-bifacial-solar-module-yield-by-6-4/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,GREECE",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 6, 2023",Membrane boosts bifacial solar module yield by 6.4%,"Germany-based Solar Kapital recently tested a white membrane to improve bifacial solar module yield at three of its solar facilities in Greece.
Solar Kapital reported that approximately 2,500 m2 of its membranes were used at its Lagkadas solar farm. The modules were installed on single-axis trackers with a fixed inclination of 25 degrees, positioned at an average height of 1.5 m above the ground. Measurements taken from June 2022 to May 2023 revealed a weighted average increase in output of 6.4% over the year, though values varied due to radiation intensity.
The company said the actual yield of the two inverters during the period was 1,661 kWh per kW. Considering weather conditions, a 4% lower yield is assumed, resulting in an average production yield of 1,730 kWh per kW, which the company considers remarkable for the region. Solar Kapital said that with a guaranteed feed-in tariff of €0.073/kWh ($0.12), the membrane’s payback time is less than 2.5 years.
Solar Kapital also conducted tests on the membranes at its Kilkis solar plant, which relies on dual-axis tracker technology. The measurements indicated an approximate 2.5% increase in yield for both inverters at the facility. Factoring in a feed-in tariff of €0.335/kWh ($0.55) and minimal labour and geotextile requirements, the company estimated the payback time of the membrane to be less than one year.
However, the payback period estimates do not consider variable costs associated with electricity generation or the potential benefits of reducing the need for grass clippings. The nature of the subsoil is also significant, as installation costs escalate on rocky ground.
Over time, the laid geotextile degrades, with Solar Kapital’s engineers assuming an annual loss of around 20% in its degree of reflection due to weather effects and dust. Consequently, the additional yields of the bifacial solar modules diminish.

The facility in the Xinjiang region includes a PV generation complex, power transmission lines, a water electrolysis hydrogen production plant, hydrogen storage, and transport infrastructure. It aims to produce 20,000 tons of green hydrogen per year by using solar power for electrolysis. It has the capacity to store 210,000 cubic meters of hydrogen and transport 28,000 cubic meters per hour.
The Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has released guidelines to incentivize green hydrogen and electrolyzer production. The first round will launch bids for 1.5 GW of electrolyzer capacity. Bidders can offer a minimum capacity of 100 MW and a maximum capacity of 300 MW. Incentives will remain in effect for five years starting from the commencement of electrolyzer production.
Verde Hydrogen has agreed to develop and commission a 2 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer project in Morocco. “The project will complete its installation in early 2024,” said the US-based company. The project features Verde Hydrogen’s 2 MW containerized electrolyzers, with five modules in total, including two 20-foot containers and two 40-foot containers in a compact design.
The Spanish government has revised its 2030 hydrogen targets, nearly tripling them in the latest draft of its mational energy and climate plan. “About 11 GW of electrolyzers are planned for 2030 for the production of renewable hydrogen, mainly for industrial uses,” said the government. “The 11 GW is also an increase over the first estimates in the hydrogen roadmap, which set a target of 4 GW of electrolysis by 2030.”
Portugal has doubled its 2030 hydrogen targets, as stated in the latest draft of its National energy and climate plan. The Portuguese government said that it expects 5.5 GW of installed electrolysis capacity by 2030. Previously, the target was set at 2.5 GW of electrolysis capacity. The European Commission has told pv magazine Italia that Portugal and Spain are among the seven countries that have submitted their updated plans within the deadline.
Trelleborg Sealing Solutions has launched a range of sealing materials for various applications in the hydrogen value chain. This includes a new high-pressure ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber designed to perform well in a wide temperature range, and a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) optimized for extremely low temperatures. The Sweden-based engineering group claims that the materials exhibit superior resistance to rapid gas decompression and showcase excellent wear and extrusion properties.
Topsoe has selected Aveva Process Simulation to model its Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells (SOECs) in order to optimize their design and establish an effective control strategy. The industrial software company said that Aveva Process Simulation is playing a role in accelerating the energy transition by enabling Topsoe’s engineers to enhance the speed and efficiency of electrolyzer design and optimization.
HyCC has contracted McPhy for the supply of electrolyzers and Technip Energies for the design and construction of a 20 MW green hydrogen plant in Delfzijl, the Netherlands. The execution of the contract is contingent upon a final investment decision, which HyCC intends to make later this year. The plant, operated by HyCC, will use McPhy’s electrolyzers to produce up to 3,000 tons of green hydrogen per year from renewable power and water. OCI Methanol Europe will use the green hydrogen to produce renewable methanol, resulting in a reduction of up to 27,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year, said HyCC.
