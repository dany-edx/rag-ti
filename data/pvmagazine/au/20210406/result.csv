The Australian Energy Regulator on Tuesday published Evoenergy’s 2021–22 electricity network pricing proposal, which details the electricity distributor’s plan.
Under the proposal,  the network charges for an average residential customer would increase by 37%, adding around $280 to their bill yearly. Commercial customers can expect a 41% increase, raising bills by around $1,660 a year.
“This increase is predominantly driven by a 133% rise in the jurisdictional charge resulting from the ACT Government’s 100% renewable energy target,” Evoenergy’s statement on the changes said.
Network and jurisdictional charges make up around 40% of customers’ overall energy bills.
Evoenergy’s proposal has been sent to the Australian Energy Regulator for approval, with a decision expected in May. If approved, the changes would come into effect on July 1.
In 2016, the ACT Government legislated a target to source 100% of the Territory’s electricity from renewable sources by 2020. To reach that target, renewable energy is purchased and offset through contracts under the large-scale feed-in tariff scheme from wind farms and solar farms mostly outside of the Territory, including from South Australia’s Hornsdale Wind Farm.
Evoenergy says the price hikes are to cover the costs associated with the administration of the government’s large-scale feed-in tariff scheme for the next financial year.
Under the scheme, payments are made on a contract-for-difference arrangement, where the payment is calculated as the difference between the fixed feed-in tariff price agreed to in the contract and the wholesale electricity price.
Evoenergy’s Chief Executive Officer John Knox said the sustained decrease in wholesale electricity prices over the past twelve months has driven the company to propose bill increases.
“What we’ve seen over the past year is a significant drop in wholesale electricity prices which has increased the payments Evoenergy has had to make under the scheme. This has resulted in a tripling of the funds Evoenergy requires to make large-scale feed-in tariff payments to generators, from around $42m in the current financial year to $127m in 2021–22,” Knox said.
“The significant jurisdictional charge increase, combined with smaller transmission and distribution charge increases, is expected to result in an average network increase of around 41 per cent higher than 2020–21.”
“We understand passing through any increase is difficult for the ACT community, let alone one of this size.”
This afternoon, Energy Networks Australia (ENA) called for changes to the Territory’s large-scale feed-in tariff in response to Evoenergy’s proposal. General Manager of Corporate Affairs at the ENA, Tamatha Smith, said the looming bill hikes should serve as a “cautionary tale” for other states going it alone on energy policy.
Evoenergy said it will continue to work with the ACT Government as part of its administrative responsibility.
The Australian Energy Regulator will now assess Evoenergy’s network electricity pricing proposal with a final decision expected in May 2021.
 
CORRECTION: This article was amended on April 7, 2021. The previous version stated Evoenergy’s proposal would increase average power bills by around 40%. In reality, the 40% increase relates to network charges, which is a component of the overall power bill.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/06/turnbull-ousted-as-chair-of-nsw-climate-board-before-he-even-began/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 6, 2021",Turnbull ousted as chair of NSW climate board following anti-coal stance,"Energy Minister Matt Kean this morning released a statement announcing Malcom Turnbull’s appointment would be rescinded, saying the focus of the position should “not be on personality.”
“No person’s role on the Board should distract from achieving results for the NSW people or from the Government’s work in delivering jobs and opportunities for the people of NSW,” Kean’s statement read.
Turnbull was only appointed to the five-year role as chair of state’s Net Zero Emissions and Clean Economy Board last week. The former prime minister quickly stirred controversy within the state’s Coalition government after calling for a moratorium on new coal mines or expansions in NSW. 
Turnbull also called out Australia’s “right-wing media ecosystem,” with these sentiments believed to have been culminating forces which led to his dismissal before the job had even officially begun.
NSW’s new Net Zero Emissions and Clean Economy Board was established to advise on program design and funding proposals under the $1 billion first stage of emissions reduction covering 2020-30.
Until a new chair is appointed, the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, Professor Hugh Durrant-Whyte, will act in the role.

The impressive growth was deemed even more remarkable for unfolding on the backdrop of a global pandemic, with IRENA’s Director-General, Francesco La Camera, hailing it as the start of the “decade of renewables.” Tellingly, more than 80% of all new electricity capacity added last year was renewable, with solar and wind accounting for 91% of that expansion.
“Along with the renewed growth of hydropower, this exceptional growth in wind and solar led to the highest annual increase in renewable generating capacity ever seen,” IRENA’s annual report, Renewable Capacity Statistics 2021 said.

This growth also meant renewables now account for a significantly higher share of the total new electricity capacity, increasing to 82% in 2020 compared to 73% in 2019.
At the end of 2020, global renewable generation capacity amounted to 2,799 GW with hydropower still accounting for the largest share of the global total, at 1,211 GW. Wind and solar energy accounted for equal shares of the remainder, with total capacities of 733 GW and 714 GW respectively.
Oceania continued to be the fastest growing region, increasing its renewable generation capacity by 18.4%, growing at triple the rate of Europe (6%) and more than double that of North America (8.2%). “Almost all expansion occurred in Australia,” the report found.
The agency went on to note that despite its world-leading growth rate, Oceania’s global capacity remained small, accounting for just 2% of the total global share.

Most of the world’s renewable capacity expansion occurred in China, and to a lesser extent, the United States, IRENA found. “Most other countries continued to increase renewable capacity at a similar rate to previous years,” the report finds.
Asia accounted for 64% of new capacity in 2020, increasing its renewable capacity by 167.6 GW to reach 1.29 TW, amounting to 46% of the global total. “A huge part of this increase occurred in China.”
Capacity in North America expanded by 32 GW, representing an 8.2% increase which mostly occurred in the US.
Europe expanded by 34 GW, a 6.0% increase, and Africa continued its steady trajectory with an increase of 2.6 GW, amounting to 5.0% which was slightly more than in 2019.
IRENA notes its findings reflect not only the rapid growth of renewables but also the simultaneous decline of non-renewable capacity.
Net decommissioning of fossil fuel generators continued in Europe, North America and, for the first time, Eurasia – the region including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation and Turkey.
New fossil fuel additions fell to 60 GW in 2020 from 64 GW the previous year, continuing their downward trend.
“Despite the challenges and the uncertainty of 2020, renewable energy emerged as a source of undeniable optimism for a better, more equitable, resilient, clean and just future,” IRENA’s Director-General Francesco La Camera said. “The great reset offered a moment of reflection and chance to align our trajectory with the path to inclusive prosperity, and there are signs we are grasping it. 
“These numbers tell a remarkable story of resilience and hope.”
“Despite the difficult period, as we predicted, 2020 marks the start of the decade of renewables,” La Camera added. “Costs are falling, clean tech markets are growing and never before have the benefits of the energy transition been so clear. This trend is unstoppable, but as the review of our World Energy Transition Outlook highlights, there is a huge amount to be done. Our 1.5 degree outlook shows significant planned energy investments must be redirected to support the transition if we are to achieve 2050 goals. In this critical decade of action, the international community must look to this trend as a source of inspiration to go further.”
