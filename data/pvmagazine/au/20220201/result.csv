The company claims its technology addresses both the high levelised cost of ocean energy and the ‘ocean wave survivability’ issues which have prevented the generation method from getting off the ground. 
Japanese shipping giant Mitsui O.S.K. Lines seems to agree, pledging $6.74 million (£3.54 million) to the company. The investment follows 18 months of close collaboration between the parties and will be used to further the operational capability and commercialisation the mWave energy generation technology.
This will include the completion of Bombora’s 1.5 MW mWave validation project due to be installed off the Welsh coast in Pembrokeshire in the coming months, supported by $25.5 million (£13.4 million) in funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) via the Welsh government.
It will also, the company says, increase the reach of Bombora’s InSPIRE platform where its mWave technology is integrated onto floating wind platforms. The company is working with global engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) contractor TechnipFMC to develop demonstrations, the first of which involves 4MW of mWave technology integrated with 10MW of wind.
Bombora Wave Power
According to Bombora, wave energy conversion can offer continuous power generation which is more predictable than both wind and solar. Moreover, its output increases in winter when solar’s decreases. The company also says the technologies have minimal environmental impact. 
The fact that these technologies must live in salt water has, however, proven a problem. Coupled with high costs, a perpetual deterrent from new technologies, it has meant wave conversion has hardly become popular.
The Perth-company is moving to defy that. “The [Mitsui O.S.K. Lines] investment underpins Bombora’s wider capital raising initiatives to propel the company through the next phase and for delivery on commercial projects,” Bombora’s Managing Director, Sam Leighton, said.

Researchers at the University of Évora (UÉvora) in Portugal have developed a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) configuration that is able to control the power output of a PV installation by maintaining the ramp rate within a non–violation limit and within a battery state of charge (SoC) range.
They explained that a solar system’s ramp rate may have a negative impact on the lifetimes of household appliances and grid stability. “The redox flow battery technology has advantages in the decoupling of power and energy ratios, large cycle life, low maintenance, and limited self-discharge,” they explained. “As for disadvantages, it has a low power density.”
“The vanadium redox flow battery technology can be upscaled up to any capacity, as it can be designed with independent power and energy requirements, an advantage over lithium-ion technology,” the research project’s corresponding author, Ana Catarina Foles, told pv magazine. “The sizing of a battery for this purpose of self-consumption and control of power ramps must be done taking into account the load profile, the characteristics of the solar photovoltaic system, such as installed power, inclination, and orientation, among others, as well as the site characteristics, such as solar radiation, meteorology, and limits imposed by law or regulation on power ramps or grid integration.”
The 5 kW/60 kWh battery was connected to a rooftop PV system with an MPPT inverter capable of receiving power commands in real-time. The battery operates through three inverters synchronised to the local three-phase grid. It was built with two electrolyte tanks containing a mixture of vanadium ions and sulfuric acid, two pumps for electrolyte flowing, and a stack as the energy conversion unit. The latter was fabricated with 40 cells electrically connected in series, and hydraulically connected in parallel.
The battery was provided by UK-based redT energy, which was recently renamed Invinity. The device has a rated capacity of 60 kWh,  an operating voltage of up to 60 V, and a capacity of 1.8 cubic meters for each tank. “The rated capacity of this battery is used to its fullest, without causing any degradation of its capacity, lifetime or performance,” Foles explained. “The technology type is very tolerable to over-discharge, and overcharge avoidance is achieved through the open-circuit voltage reference control outside the stack. Vanadium ions exist in both electrolyte tanks and crossover through the membrane stack does not lead to contamination.”
The VRFB is also equipped with a reference cell, which is hydraulically connected in parallel with the stack, subjected to the same electrolyte flow, without being subjected to charge or discharge voltage, and allows to make direct real-time voltage measurements.
The storage device was tested to control the ramp rate of a 6.7 kW building-integrated PV microgrid installed at the university campus.  The simulation was performed to analyse how the battery balances the system load to ensure firm power output at the load.  Three different strategies were applied: maximisation of self-consumption; maximisation of self-consumption with ramp-rate control; and self-consumption maximisation with ramp-rate control and battery charging based on weather forecasts. Accordingly, three different algorithms were developed using Matlab software.
“The inputs of the simulation model include the constraints details of the UÉvora microgrid, the PV generation and load profiles, the developed VRFB electrical model, and the ramp rate calculus and its premises,” the academics specified, noting that the VRFB architecture may be reproduced in similar projects, with the increased advantage of being an easily scalable product.
Through their measurements, the Portuguese scientists found that approximately 5% of the PV power ramps that occurred were above the rate of 10%/min of the PV nameplate capacity and that the first strategy performs only a self-consumption maximisation without any form of ramp rate control. The second strategy, by contrast, was able to perform ramp rate control by imposing a 10 %/min of the PV nameplate capacity ramp rate limit, while also providing additional stability over the grid energy exchange.
As for the third strategy, it was not only able to perform ramp rate control and maximise self-consumption but was also capable of implementing an SoC control to prepare the battery to better deal with the next–day PV power ramps. “This strategy demonstrated to be able to control 100% of the ramps with rates above 10%/min, maintaining the self-consumption ratio of the PV system at around 61%,” the scientists affirmed.
“The VRFB can be used in different energy management strategy scenarios, and to better complement the solar photovoltaic generation,” Foles emphasised. “In this study, we show that for the goal, which is to control PV power ramps, and given the profiles understudy, more gains are achieved if applied with the third strategy. However, VRFB can be used with the first and the second strategy if the goals are distinct. VRFB technology is a promising energy storage technology for building integration, and this work proves successful results on its real operation implementation.”
The research’s findings can be found in the paper “An approach to implement photovoltaic self-consumption and ramp-rate control algorithm with a vanadium redox flow battery day-to-day forecast charging,” published in Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/01/the-panel-and-the-city/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 1, 2022",The panel and the city,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from Arizona State University in the United States have conducted research to evaluate how urban settings affects the performance of PV systems and, conversely, how PV systems affect their surrounding urban environment.
The researchers explained that solar modules are sources of radiative heat for all structures beneath them and, at the same time, are convective heat sources that can considerably increase the temperature of the ambient air in cities, contributing to the so-called urban heat island (UHI) effect, which occurs when cities absorb and retain heat, due to a high concentration of pavements, buildings, and other surfaces.
Their analysis was based on a review conducted on 116 scientific articles for review, through which seven different types of PV-urban climate interactions were identified. For the impact of the urban environment on the PV system, it considered urban air temperature, urban air pollution, the partial shading of the PV system, and soiling. To evaluate how the solar array affects the urban environment, it took into account urban air temperatures, building heating and cooling loads, and outdoor shade.
The scientists found that all analysed parameters have a “non-trivial role” in affecting PV power generation, although the impact of the elevated temperatures caused by the UHI is difficult to quantify, as it varies seasonally and diurnally.
Air pollution was described as one of the main factors reducing PV performance in urban environments, with power yield spanning from 5 to 15%. “Particle deposition on PV panels results in absorption and backscattering of insolation, reducing the transmittance of the panel surface,” the academics explained. “While this effect is most notable in highly polluted urban environs, it can also manifest itself in rural installations downwind of urban and industrial pollution sources.”
As for the effect of soiling, the scientists said that cities often have impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and buildings, which are not detrimental to PV power generation, as these are less prone to high atmospheric loading of particulates from soils. “Nevertheless, other sources of soiling in urban environments, including soot from vehicles and industry and dust from construction activities may significantly contribute to soiling of PV,” they further explained. “However, research suggests that periodic cleaning of PV surfaces, either from precipitation or from routine maintenance can maintain the generation penalty of soiling at less than 10%.”
The shading effect, which for PV systems in urban environments is often unavoidable, is described in the study as the most significant issue affecting PV system performance in dense urban areas. “The average effects of this penalty can be on the order of 20%,” the researchers emphasised. “However, careful design of urban installations, accounting for current, and potential future shading, can greatly reduce this issue.”
The analysis of how PV impacts the urban environment showed conflicting results and highlighted the need for further studies, although it confirmed that solar panels have an influence on urban energy balance and affect urban air temperatures.
Their thermal and electrical characteristics are key parameters to assess this influence. The shadow that the panels can produce on the surrounding areas and air gap between the panels and the surface beneath them, which results in convective heat transfer from both surfaces of the PV panel to the air, were identified as two main factors increasing air temperature. “Further controlled empirical studies and validated modelling efforts are needed, particularly because the conflicting studies differ not simply in magnitude of their projections, but in terms of the sign of the anticipated impact of PV on air temperatures,” they further explained.
Their analysis also showed that current scientific literature is also divided on how rooftop PV positively affects the energy performance of buildings by reducing the need for cooling at night, taking into account that solar panels can cool down faster than the roof cover or other architectural elements. “The magnitude of this savings depends significantly on the assumption of the albedo of the roof surface being shaded, the level of building insulation, and other building construction and operation characteristics,” the also stated.
Their findings were presented in the paper “Photovoltaics in the built environment: A critical review,” published in Energy and Buildings.
“As our synthesis suggests, photovoltaics in urban settings offer many benefits, but also are fraught with challenges — both in terms of how the urban environment affects their performance and how they can adversely affect the urban environment and energy consumption for air conditioning,” they concluded. “These complexities are often difficult to convey to the general public or to local/regional decision-makers who are typically seeking simplified summaries regarding the evaluation of technologies.”

While Hyzon is headquartered in Rochester, New York, its CEO and co-founder Craig Knight is Australian, which has presumably led the company to pay attention to the Australian FCEV market which is routinely overlooked.
In conjunction with the RACV, Hyzon will develop a purpose-built facility in the Melbourne suburb of Noble Park which will include corporate offices, a showroom, assembly warehousing and workshops.The move, Hyzon says, is expected to generate over a 100 localised engineering and manufacturing jobs by 2025, with “hundreds more indirect jobs expected through the supply chain.”

The news comes not long after H2X, Australia’s homegrown hydrogen vehicle manufacturer, announced it would set up manufacturing capacity for its hydrogen fuel cells and equipment in Victoria’s Gippsland region.
Both the companies’ Australian chief executives, Craig Knight from Hyzon and Brendon Norman from H2X, have expressed ambitions of returning manufacturing capabilities to Australia through building hydrogen vehicle capacity here. Unlike H2X though, Hyzon is specifically focussing on manufacturing commercial heavy vehicles.
RACV-owned towing company Nationwide Group is set to receive three vehicles from Hyzon, including two “locally manufactured” HyMax TT7 tilt-tray trucks and one of Hyzon’s fully imported HyMax prime mover trucks. The vehicles are scheduled for delivery by the end of the year.
“Nationwide [Group] is keen to assess the performance of these vehicles in a real-world test for towing and transport,” Nationwide’s CEO, Michael Stephenson, said.

Managing Director for Hyzon Motors in Australia and New Zealand, John Edgley, described the company’s partnership with RACV as an “exciting prospect” for its business development in the region.
“We are focused on generating new jobs, new manufacturing and technology facilities, and a fundamentally new industry in Australia and New Zealand, that will underpin a sustainable future for the region,” Edgley said.
“With governments across Australia and New Zealand shifting their focus towards hydrogen as a cost-competitive and zero-emission fuel source, Hyzon stands ready to support and partner on key projects and initiatives.”
Hyzon was born of the Singapore-based company Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, which was founded in 2003 and specialises in hydrogen fuel cells. Australian Craig Knight was a founding shareholder in Horizon, holding position of CEO in the company from 2019 to 2020, before becoming the co-founder and CEO of its spinoff Hyzon.
In short, Hyzon is a response to the reluctance of the auto industry to move away from fossil fuels and seeks sidestep them by offering commercial FCEVs to the market directly using the proprietary hydrogen fuel cell technology from Horizon.
In July 2021, Hyzon listed on the Nasdaq, America’s stock exchange, as it grows internationally. While it primarily services the U.S, China and Europe, it has had success in Australia too with the company scheduled to deliver hydrogen powered coaches to Fortescue Metal Group for its Western Australian operations in 2022, as well as its prime mover trucks to Coregas in New South Wales and TR Group in New Zealand.
It will also deliver five fuel cell-powered heavy-duty trucks to Ark Energy Corporation, the Australian subsidiary of the world’s largest zinc, lead, and silver producer, Korea Zinc, this year. Finally, it has an agreement in place with garbage truck company Superior Pak which will see its HyMax GSL garbage trucks used in Queensland, part of an agreement which sprouted from a hydrogen innovation hub in Bundaberg.
Hydrogen-powered vehicles, or FCEVs, have sparked heated debate in Australia and around the world with many doubtful of their prospects against the prospering and already established pure electric vehicle (EV) market. 
That being said, there is more optimism for the technology when it comes to heavy vehicles, like trucks, buses and other commercial-use locomotives. This is the sole focus of Hyzon, though not of its main Australian competitor, H2X.
H2X global
In January 2021, Hyzon announced it had signed an agreement with Pure Hydrogen which would see the pair collaborate to develop a network of hydrogen refuelling stations across the nation. Since then, Pure Hydrogen has acquired a significant 24% stake in H2X Global. 
It is also worth noting Pure Hydrogen is a somewhat misleading name given the company owns three gas projects, including the Windorah Gas Project in the Cooper Basin, one of Australia’s most prolific onshore petroleum basins. Such fossil fuel allegiances have of course only exacerbated the debate around hydrogen vehicles, which brand themselves as “zero emissions vehicles” which is only the case if they are refuelled with 100% green renewable hydrogen. Something which is certainly not a given.
