Both interconnection upgrades have been identified as priority projects by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) as part of its Integrated System Plan and will increase the capacity for the bidirectional flow of energy across state lines and help ease the bottleneck of new wind, solar and storage projects waiting to enter the grid.
Transgrid executive manager of works delivery Craig Stallan said the VNI upgrade project, which will increase transfer capacity into NSW from Victoria by 170 MW at times of high demand, is now over 55% complete with the network operator saying it remains on track for completion this year.
Stallan said the bulk of civil works is completed and the first stage of electrical works of the VNI upgrade project will commence next month, with the balance of civil works to be finished in August.
“We are very pleased with the progress we are making on this major project that will help lower energy costs across the National Energy Market (NEM),” he said.
“The VNI upgrade will help reduce electricity bills through more efficient sharing of generation resources between the states. It will also enable more energy from renewable sources to enter the grid.”
The project involves an upgrade of TransGrid’s Stockdill Substation in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) using smart wires technology which enables the real-time control of electricity flows along powerlines. The system detects areas of congestion in the network and automatically redirects flows to less congested lines, under certain network scenarios. It will allow more energy to be transferred between Victoria and NSW.

TransGrid is also undertaking an upgrade of the QNI in a bid to the relieve transmission constraints between Queensland and NSW.
The project includes uprating the existing 330 kV Liddell to Tamworth lines, and installing new dynamic reactive support at Tamworth and Dumaresq substations and shunt connected capacitor banks at Tamworth, Armidale and Dumaresq.
Stallan said the project is 80% complete with works now moving from the civil phase to the electrical phase.
“We have already finished key elements of this upgrade, including gantry construction at our Dumaresq and Tamworth substations and the replacement and upgrade of towers,” he said.
“We are very pleased to have achieved 99% of the transmission line upgrade to 120 degrees Celsius, which allows higher power transfers while maintaining statutory ground clearances for the higher temperatures.”
New equipment in the QNI upgrade includes new capacitor banks, static VAR compensators (SVCs), SVC transformers and associated 330 kV switch bays. The capacitor banks provide additional reactive power, while the SVC regulates the reactive power on the grid.
“This technology will optimise the real power flows on the transmission lines and enables us to control the power flows between NSW and Queensland, as well as providing grid stability,” Stallan said.
TransGrid said the QNI upgrade will allow 460 MW more power to transfer into Queensland and 190 MW more into NSW and the ACT when it’s needed and it will link customers to the NEM.
Transmission and grid connection remain among the areas of greatest concern for executives in the clean energy industry according to the latest Clean Energy Outlook survey, which is conducted every six months.
The latest edition of the survey conducted by the Clean Energy Council reveals that the grid connection process is the most significant challenge facing large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia, with substantial delays and changes in technical requirements impacting projects and investor confidence.
While the QNI and VNI upgrades are expected to improve grid stability for the eastern states, a new link from South Australia to NSW is also seen as critically important for a great number of massive wind, solar and storage along the line.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/26/racv-solar-adds-another-installation-company-to-its-stable/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 26, 2021",RACV Solar adds another installation company to its stable,"One of Victoria’s largest solar companies, RACV Solar announced it has acquired 100% of Great Ocean Solar and Electrical in a move which will allow it to increase its footprint in the Geelong, Surf Coast and South-West Victoria region.
Great Ocean Solar and Electrical was already engaged as the local delivery partner for a number of RACV Solar’s projects in the region, including the Geelong Community Solar Program and installations on the Surf Coast Shire’s council buildings.
The company has also been installing free solar and battery systems on community buildings throughout the region as part of RACV’s $1 million Solar in the Regions initiative.
RACV Solar has emerged as one of the state’s largest installers of residential and commercial and industrial solar since its acquisition of Gippsland Solar in late 2019.
RACV Solar CEO Andy McCarthy said the addition of Great Ocean Solar and Electrical as a permanent member of the group would allow the solar contractor to expand its solar, battery storage and electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions in the region.
“This acquisition will provide positive benefits, not only to both our companies, but also to the region,” he said.
The acquisition caps a busy period for RACV Solar which last week announced it had partnered with Holmesglen Institute to install a commercial-scale rooftop solar PV system and battery energy storage solution across two of the TAFE college’s Melbourne campuses.
Solar arrays capable of generating more than 1 GWh of energy each year and battery storage systems will be installed at Holmesglen’s Moorabbin and Drummond Street campuses.
McCarthy said the systems will be used to not only help power the two sites but also for training in the institute’s solar PV and energy storage courses.
The solar panels and battery storage system have been installed so students can safely access the installations in order to gain an understanding of the correct installation and set-up of a commercial-sized renewable energy system.
Holmesglen’s associate director of energy and infrastructure, Dr Ross Digby, said the installations will ensure students undertaking the Institute’s training programs will receive hands-on experience on large-scale commercial projects, with access to industry experts and the best possible training.
The installations will include one array which will feature 10 different brands of solar modules connected to monitoring systems so students can learn about the varying performance of different panels.
“These programs deliver accredited, high quality, industry-based training that equips electrical apprentices and qualified electricians to work in the growing renewable energy sector,” Digby said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/26/clean-energy-ad-campaign-points-to-past-as-the-way-forward/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 26, 2021",Clean energy ad campaign points to past as the way forward,"The Clean Energy Council (CEC) has launched a new advertising campaign in a bid to demonstrate that Australia’s renewable energy industry has the power to not only accelerate the transition to clean, reliable, low-cost energy, but also create jobs and bring benefits to communities across the country.
The ‘Renewable Energy is Here Now’ campaign, launched on Monday, features existing wind, solar, hydro and battery storage projects to demonstrate the gains the renewable energy industry has already made in Australia as the move away from fossil fuels continues.
CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said the campaign is unapologetic in its objective: to convince cautious Australians that a future where we are powered by 100% clean energy is not only possible, but that the transition is already underway and will beneﬁt us in day-to-day life.
“There is a clear business case for renewable energy,” he said.
“The reality is, we know most Australians support renewable energy, but the climate debate has meant that a minority of loud voices have misled the public, resulting in some Australians feeling uncertain about a future powered by clean energy.
“This campaign is about ensuring all Australians are certain about the facts and feel part of the exciting transition already taking place.”
The campaign features the Victorian town of Yackandandah, which earlier this month took another step towards its 100% renewable energy target by adding the state’s first behind-the-meter, community-owned solar PV and battery energy storage system to its energy generation strategy.

It also features a solar PV installation at Carrara Stadium on Queensland’s Gold Coast, a Tasmanian hydroelectric project and a wind farm – all underlined by the message, ‘No more yeah buts, renewables are here now’.
Thornton said the campaign celebrates the work that the clean energy industry has “already done to make a real difference to everyday Australians – lowering energy costs, delivering quality jobs and careers, and creating thriving, resilient communities”.
The launch of the campaign comes after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) released new data showing record high shares of renewables in the grid with the CEC declaring renewables already contribute almost 30% of Australia’s electricity. That figure has almost tripled in the past decade.
“Clean energy isn’t a far-flung concept grounded in science fiction. It is here right now and ready to be plugged in,” Thornton said.

Simply Energy, which has more than 700,000 accounts across Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, with sales totalling 12% of the Australian market, was issued with 125 penalty notices after the agents allegedly impersonated customers consenting to the switch in phone calls to the company.
Victoria’s Essential Services Commission said the two sales agents had, between July 2019 and April 2020 transferred 525 electricity and gas accounts at 264 properties without obtaining their consent.
Commission chair Kate Symons said it is the most blatant case of fraudulent sales contractors the commission has dealt with to date.
“This behaviour from rogue sales contractors undermines customer trust in the market,” she said.
“This is the strongest action we have taken against an energy company and shows just how seriously we view customers being transferred by fraudulent means,” she said.
Symons said it is the third time Simply Energy, which contracted the agents, has been issued penalty notices for not obtaining explicit informed consent before transferring customers.
“That factored into our calculation of the appropriate number of penalties to be paid and our discussions with the company which have centred on gaining assurance this won’t happen again,” she said.
“This action should send a strong message to Simply Energy and other retailers we will not tolerate behaviour that undermines customer trust.”
A Simply Energy spokesperson told 9News on Monday that the company apologised to the customers caught up in the fraudulent activity.
“The two field sales agents involved in these matters led deliberate and sophisticated criminal frauds, circumventing our policies and controls, and are the subject of criminal proceedings,” they said.
“We have apologised to all affected customers, reversed and refunded any payments for fraudulent account transfers.”

Solar and wind power have variability in their productive hours, as multi-day weather events can impact output. Therefore, multi-day storage that is cost effective is important in grid reliability.
Boston startup Form Energy developed technology to address this need, revealing recently the chemistry behind their iron-air batteries. The company said its iron-air batteries can deliver renewables-sourced electricity for 100 hours at system costs competitive with conventional power plants. At full-scale production, Form Energy said the modules would deliver electricity at tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.
The iron-air battery is composed of cells filled with thousands of iron pellets that are exposed to air and create rust. The oxygen is then removed, reverting the rust to iron. Controlling this process allows the battery to be charged and discharged.
US$200 million (AU$270 million) in Series D funding has been secured for the project, led by US$25 million (AU$33 million) from ArcelorMittal’s XCarb innovation fund. ArcelorMittal will non-exclusively supply the iron materials for the battery system production, and Form Energy said it intends to source its iron domestically, manufacturing the batteries near where the iron was sourced.
The company’s first project is a 1 MW / 150 MWh pilot installation with Minnesota-based utility Great River Energy, located near the American Iron Range. Form Energy said it expects to have the facility deployed at a Great River Energy power plant by 2023.
Mateo Jaramillo, CEO and Co-founder of Form Energy, said, “We conducted a broad review of available technologies and have reinvented the iron-air battery to optimise it for multi-day energy storage for the electric grid. With this technology, we are tackling the biggest barrier to deep decarbonisation: making renewable energy available when and where it’s needed, even during multiple days of extreme weather or grid outages.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/26/german-start-up-offers-5-2-kwh-ac-battery-that-works-without-inverter/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GERMANY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JULY 26, 2021",German start-up offers 5.2 kWh AC battery that works without inverter,"From pv magazine Germany
German start-up Sax Power GmbH is offering a residential AC battery it says works entirely without an inverter and has 50% more capacity and service life than conventional batteries.
According to its specifications, the battery stores direct current and can deliver both alternating current and direct current. The conversion is not carried out by transistors such as IGBTs or MOSFETs, but via the software of the battery management system. By interconnecting with cascaded H-bridges, the cell blocks can be controlled individually. That enables the system to build a sinusoidal curve typical of alternating current from the individual DC voltage values. It also increases efficiency, since the conversion is purely electronic. Sax states the efficiency of its solution is 99%. The option of plugging the battery into a main socket is a further innovation, according to the company.
Sax Power said, in this type of device the current is measured by folding current transformers. That means no cables have to be disconnected in a household network. In addition, a second current measurement of the same type is carried out on the feeding line to the house. The battery then receives the information it needs for optimal use, via wireless communication units.
The manufacturer said some performance can be lost with the plug-in device, which has a nominal power output of 3.7 kW. The standard product, without the plug-in, has an output of 4.6 kW.
The battery comes with lithium iron phosphate cells and the capacity of the basic model is 5.2 kWh but it can be expanded with extra modules to 15.6 kWh. The nominal current is 20 A, or 16 A with the plug-in installation.
The company offers a 10-year guarantee for the device, which weighs 52kg and is said to be easier for installers to mount as they do not have to handle an inverter.
In May, the product received a German Innovation Award and Sax Power said it will be on display in October at the EES storage fair held alongside The Smarter E trade event. The developer said its product has qualified as a finalist for the EES Award at this year’s show.
A price for the product can be found on the Sax Power website. The basic version is listed as costing €5,079 (AU$8100). In a version with wireless communication and a better smart meter, the device costs €5,210 (AU$8320). It will be sold in series from autumn.
