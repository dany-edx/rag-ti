Once fully commissioned, the $155 million (USD 103.5 million) battery will be connected to the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), helping to support system stability and smooth the transition to renewables as the WA government prepares to retire its coal-fired power stations by 2030.
Delivered for Synergy by Italy-headquartered energy storage specialist New Horizons Ahead (NHOA) in partnership with Perth-based subcontractor GenusPlus Group, the Kwinana big battery will have the capacity to power the equivalent of 160,000 homes for two hours.
Synergy, which will operate and manage the Kwinana big battery, described the facility as a major component of its future asset mix but has already announced plans to build a second, larger system at the site with four times the energy storage of stage one. The 200 MW/800 MWh Kwinana 2 battery is expected to be operational by late 2024.
Synergy will also build a battery energy storage system at the nearby town of Collie, which the state government said will be one of the biggest battery systems in the world. The 500 MW/2,000 MWh Collie battery is due to commence operations before the end of 2025.

The two new battery projects were allocated $2.3 billion in last week’s state budget and Premier Mark McGowan said on Monday that battery storage systems will be critical to the state’s energy future, “allowing us to harness our rooftop solar resources to meet power needs during peak times.”
“With the Kwinana big battery entering operational testing today, we’re moving onto an even bigger battery on site, with four times the capacity,” he said. “It will make our existing electricity system more secure, support the continued uptake of renewables, and set up our state for the long-term.”
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the three battery energy storage systems will be crucial in managing household energy demand and supporting the uptake of residential solar.
Johnston said battery energy storage will allow for renewable load shifting, absorbing excess energy from rooftop solar when demand is low and discharging during peak periods, helping to provide long-term system stability.
“We are committed to delivering cleaner and more reliable power to help us reach our ambitious emissions reduction targets,” he said.
The state government has estimated that the SWIS may need about 50 GW of new renewable electricity and storage infrastructure to support increased demand over the next 20 years.

The $1.3 billion Household Energy Upgrades Fund, announced as part of the 2023-34 federal budget, will provide households with access to discounted finance to increase sustainability across the housing sector, including through investment in energy efficiency upgrades, high-performing appliances and battery-ready solar PV.
The fund includes $1 billion in discounted loans to help households install solar panels, replace gas hot-water system and stoves with electric alternatives, double-glaze their windows and undertake other energy efficiency measures.
The fund will also provide $300 million to support energy performance upgrades to social housing which will be co-funded and co-designed with the states and territories.
MEA Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Richards said while solar panels and high-efficiency electric hot water systems are worthy of support, new technologies are emerging that will potentially provide greater benefits to households and the nation.
Richards urged the government to consider supporting households to invest in bi-directional electric vehicle (EV) charging points that would allow people to draw electricity from their car batteries at peak times and charge them when demand for electricity is lower.
“Many areas of Australia already experience negative demand for solar power at the hottest part of the day, that is to say, we produce more power than we can use,” he said. “Funding additional solar panels alone will only add to this problem. We would like to see a holistic approach to this loan scheme, incorporating emerging technologies to maximise the benefits of green energy generation.”
Richards suggested the loan criteria for the Household Energy Upgrades Fund could be expanded to include battery energy storage solutions to help smooth that negative demand in the middle of the day, “by capturing excess electricity and making it available during the evening peak.”
“But there’s no reason for the batteries to be fixed in one place,” he said. “Within the next decade most Australians homes are expected to have at least one electric vehicle.  Why not use that in-built battery as a power source for homes or offices?”
“Charge the vehicle wherever you are during the day and use the power wherever you are at night. It not only saves money for consumers, but it cuts down on the need for expensive investment in the power grid.”
Richards said by adopting some “out-of-the-box thinking” with the energy upgrades fund, the federal government can not only help households, but can earn a dividend for the budget in the form of deferred spending in the years ahead.
While the final detail of the Household Energy Upgrades Fund is yet to be published, the $1 billion scheme will be overseen by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) which will work alongside private lenders to deliver the program. The scheme is expected to start next year.
The fund is part of a larger $1.6 billion “energy savings plan” outlined in the budget. This includes $314 million in tax deductions for businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million that invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.

A temporary power supply has been established for pre-commissioning testing on the eight battery enclosures, each comprising a bank of 24 batteries, a set of inverters and a step-up transformer. Using the temporary power supply in combination with an AC/DC power converter, the battery modules will be charged and discharged to test all their functions before being connected to the 11 kV switch room.
Territory Generation Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Laubscher said network-connected commissioning of the DK BESS, being delivered by the Swiss-headquartered Hitachi Energy, is scheduled to commence later this year and the battery is expected to be fully commissioned and online in the 2023-24 financial year.
“We recognise commissioning is a complex and time intensive process and we are working closely with all stakeholders to support the fastest possible progression of these activities,” he said.
Laubscher said once fully operational, the 35 MW battery will strengthen the region’s largest grid, unlocking further capacity for households to connect their rooftop PV and for industry to invest into lower cost solar systems for the commercial and industrial operations. The Darwin-Katherine electricity system provides energy to 150,000 Territorians, and one in six customers already have rooftop solar.
“The DK BESS is key to unlocking flexibility in our generation fleet,” Laubscher said. “Once commissioned, it will be online continuously, helping to stabilise the impacts of solar and support the integration of more into the Darwin-Katherine grid.”

The battery will also reduce the dependence on fossil-fuels generation, replace a generating unit at the gas-fired Channel Island Power Station in Darwin Harbour.
The DK BESS will use Hitachi Energy’s virtual synchronous machine or grid-forming technology. The technology gives batteries the capacity to help stabilise the grid by providing inertia and frequency control services which have until historically been provided by gas or coal-fired generators.
Hitachi Energy’s country manager in Australia, Bernard Norton, said the DK BESS will ensure full utilisation of solar energy generation and less reliance on fossil fuels.
“Through this partnership approach with Territory Generation, Hitachi Energy is helping to solve the challenge of integrating intermittent renewable energy generation and accelerating the transition towards a carbon-neutral energy future for all,” he said.

NT Energy Minister Selena Uibo welcomed the milestone, saying the battery is an important step forward in the government’s plan for 50% renewable power by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.
“This battery energy storage system will put about 35 MW into the Darwin system, which means we can reduce the gas turbines spinning and reduce the amount of fossil fuels being burnt,” she said.
“When operating, the big battery is expected to support system security for about 150,000 homes between Darwin and Katherine and it will provide Territorians with greater system reliability and cleaner, green energy.”
Using the DK BESS instead of a gas turbine is expected to reduce carbon emissions by about 58,000 tonnes annually. Uibo said the big battery is also forecast to deliver cost savings of about $9.8 million per year, paying for itself in about five years from connection to the grid.

Terabase is launching Terafab, an automated utility-scale solar installation system. It describes the service as an automated “field factory” that can double installation productivity. 
The installation system makes use of digital twins, logistics software, an on-site digital command centre, a field-deployed automated assembly line, and installation rovers that can operate 24/7. 
The company also announced the grand opening of a Woodland, California manufacturing facility; “a factory to make factories.” The facility is currently manufacturing the first gigawatt Terafab assembly line with capacity to make more than 10 GW of Terafabs per year.  
Terabase said its system will double labor productivity when compared to traditional utility-scale installation methods. The system offers high-throughput, 24/7 operation, and modularity to enable rapid ramp-ups and higher solar field construction speeds, significantly reducing project schedules. 
“We successfully field-tested Terafab last year, building 10 MW of a 400 MW site in Texas. Today’s launch is the next step forward to rapid commercial scale-up,” said Matt Campbell, chief executive officer and co-founder of Terabase. 
Terabase has partnered with developer Intersect Power, engineering, procurement and construction firm Signal Energy, tracking hardware provider NEXtracker, and solar panel manufacturer First Solar to develop the Terafab facility. 
“Not only does our partnership with Terabase bring advanced installation technology to our next-generation Series 7 solar module, but it also enables a closed-loop packaging recycling system consistent with our vision of responsible solar,” said Nick Strevel, vice president of product, First Solar. “The Terafab system is another example of how homegrown American innovation can help accelerate the deployment of solar, enabling our country’s decarbonisation ambitions.” 
Terafab is pegged for commercial deployment starting in the third quarter. The company said that the automated installation system reduces the levelised cost of electricity for utility-scale solar projects. It is also scalable, built on a modular design that can be replicated and deployed quickly. 
Terafab reduces the physical safety risk of construction workers by eliminating the need to lift heavy solar panels and steel structures, often in harsh weather conditions, by using automation on a climate-controlled assembly line.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/15/building-nature-friendly-solar-parks/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,HUNGARY,WORLD",EDGAR MEZA,"MAY 15, 2023",Building nature-friendly solar parks,"From pv magazine Global
In an effort to share its know-how on the construction of more eco-friendly solar farms, Hungarian solar company SolServices collaborated with national parks, environmental protection organisations, energy companies and even beekeepers to produce a comprehensive white paper.
The “Professional Guide for the Development of Next-Generation Solar Parks” offers a completely new, practice-based methodology detailing how solar farms can be operated in an ecologically conscious and nature-friendly manner and that can be recommended to investors.
Based on the company’s earlier biomonitor surveys but expanded in scope, the white paper aims to ensure that solar parks built on large stretches of land fit into the ecological balance of the area, taking into account as much as possible its ecological, biological and natural features.
Based on Hungary’s geographical and solar radiation characteristics, solar energy has a very high potential for electricity generation in the country. Installed PV capacity reached 1,144 MW at the end of 2019, of which around 38% was made up of household-sized units of less than 50 kW. The remaining capacity is spread among small plants with capacities below 0.5 MW and a few plants of a few megawatts.
Hungary’s new National Energy Strategy aims to expand solar capacity to 6,000 MW by 2030, and which could reach 12,000 MW by 2040. The country, however, requires grid upgrades to meet the challenges of a decentralised and highly weather-dependent electricity generation structure. It also requires the expansion of large-scale facilities.
Achieving the country’s ambitious goals can only be achieved “in an environmentally and nature-friendly manner, taking into account the ecological requirements and characteristics of the given area as much as possible,” SolServices states in the report.
“Agri-environmental research in recent years has shown that, with appropriate land use and the strengthening of plant communities, wildlife populations can be significantly increased in agricultural areas,” it adds, noting that solar parks can effectively support wildlife and increase biodiversity.
“A particularly positive factor is that, with proper design and minimal management and intervention, a solar park can provide an almost undisturbed habitat for both flora and fauna for some 30 years after construction. A very small part of the solar farm area, less than 5%, is physically covered by various infrastructure (roads, inverters, support poles for panels), and even with the parts of the area covered by panels, this proportion covers only about 50% of the total area. The area not covered and partially shaded by the panels, i.e. roughly 95% of the solar park area, can be a diverse habitat for plants and animals.”
The paper details a number of methods that can be used to create suitable habitats to increase biodiversity and create a more natural vegetation cover that can benefit a wide variety of wildlife, from insects and amphibians to birds, bats, rodents and big game.
Pollinating insects, for example, benefit from a patchwork of plants that flower at different times of the year. “In addition, from herbaceous plants, the planting of red clover, which has been shown to increase the presence of bumblebees and butterflies, is of particular importance,” the paper notes. Clematis and honeysuckle grown on fences can also benefit pollinator species.
Amphibian-friendly solar parks can be considered if site conditions are suitable for permanent or temporary surface water and wetland habitats in the project area. “Reptiles prefer dense, bushy, lush undergrowth, so it is advisable to leave a minimum strip of 2 m of untidy, untrimmed vegetation along wetland areas (e.g. drainage ditches). In addition to offering easier and safer movement for animals, they also provide a home for many species of molluscs, worms and insects, and the latter provide a suitable food source for amphibians.”
For rodent and small game-friendly parks, sufficiently quiet and undisturbed habitats are necessary. Mosaic mowing and the creation of undisturbed green corridors to provide free movement and shelter for small animals are important when managing green areas, the paper advises. Such parks should include shrubs and hedges — taking into account the requirements of emergency management guidelines — as well as haystacks from locally mown hay, which can be used as daytime and winter shelter. Passages or tubes, both on the surface and underground, can facilitate the introduction of ground squirrels.
PV farms also offer different uses for a variety of different bird species. Some may use them as nesting and breeding places, while others may use them as feeding or resting areas. “We can help various species to disperse and breed in the project area by installing different types of dens or artificial nests, or by planting shrubs and trees, as long as this is compatible with the safety requirements of the solar farm and does not interfere with energy production,” the company explains.
Likewise, solar parks can be potential habitats for certain bat species. In Hungary, there are some 30 bat species found in a wide range of biotopes, from urban environments to natural habitats and abandoned mines. Insect-rich solar parks can be suitable feeding sites for bats. Big game can be expected in arable land and grassland close to forest edges. The presence of big game around in solar parks, however, should generally be minimised to protect both the animals and equipment.
“Therefore, in the case of a big-game-friendly park, we are talking about solar parks that help big game to safely escape from the project area. To this end, it is recommended to install jump exits for big game. In addition, we can also install wildlife guide structures within the solar park to help stray animals find their way out as quickly as possible. These tools are especially useful in the first two years after installation, but can also be a valuable feature of the solar park after that.”
