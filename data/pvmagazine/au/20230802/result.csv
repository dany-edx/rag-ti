The projects build on Energy Queensland’s recent announcement that it will trial a vanadium flow battery in partnership with Brisbane-based Vecco Group and Japanese manufacturer Sumitomo Electric.
Energy Queensland Chief Engineer Peter Price said the flow batteries are an important part of the corporation’s battery program with the state government identifying large-scale energy storage as fundamental to the success of Queensland’s energy transition.
With the state targeting 80% renewable energy in the grid by 2035, batteries will play a key role in the success of Queensland’s renewable energy grid. A discussion paper prepared by consultancy Accenture highlights that the state’s energy storage demand could potentially reach 14 GWh by the end of the decade.
Price said the zinc-bromine and iron flow battery projects are a step towards diversifying Energy Queensland’s overall battery program away from the more commonly available lithium battery systems.
“These two projects will help our understanding of the benefits and possible challenges of distribution-connected energy storage,” he said.
“The batteries will be located close to areas of high solar penetration, while supporting the whole electricity supply chain, alongside other complementary solutions to maximise the growing uptake of renewable energy.”
“Exploring flow batteries will help us to understand the benefits of emerging battery storage technology.”

Redflow will receive $12 million of the funding package for a zinc-bromine flow battery to be deployed in the Ipswich region while a further $12 million will be invested in an iron flow battery from ESI, with the preferred site in the Wide Bay region.
Redflow Chief Executive and Managing Director Tim Harris said the Brisbane company has been working closely with Energy Queensland over the past few months to finalise the project which is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024.
Harris said the government-backed project – which follows the recent announcement that Redflow will build one of the world’s largest zinc-based battery energy storage systems in the United States after signing a deal with the California Energy Commission – is a further demonstration of the market acceptance of zinc-bromine flow battery energy storage technology.
“The momentum towards a decarbonised grid and the energy storage market continue to rapidly accelerate, and this is one of many multi-MWh opportunities in our sales pipeline that continues to grow,” he said.
Stuart Parry, Managing Director of ESI, said he expects the pilot project will also help bring long-life iron-flow battery energy storage technology to scale.
The company is establishing a $70 million battery assembly facility in Maryborough with the centre expected to be operational in 2024. Parry said the company plans to expand its operations so that, by the end of 2026, it will be capable of delivering up to 400 MW of battery energy storage systems annually.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/02/solar-farm-adds-to-king-islands-renewables-solution/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 2, 2023",Solar farm adds to King Island’s renewables solution,"Hydro Tasmania said the new $3.35 million (USD 2.22 million) King Island solar farm, comprising about 5,000 panels spread across an almost six-hectare site, will increase the amount of renewable energy produced on the island and cut diesel consumption by 300,000 litres every year.
The government-owned utility said the 1.5 MW plant, delivered by Queensland-headquartered GEM Energy, will soon be connected to the local grid, forming part of the existing King Island Renewable Integration Project (KIREIP).
Installed over several earlier phases, the off-grid power system includes another 470 kW of utility scale solar generation and 2.45 MW of wind backed by a 3 MW/1.5 MWh battery energy storage system. The system also includes two 1 MVA flywheels that aid system security and stability, a 1.5 MW dynamic resistor to manage surplus renewable generation, and an aggregated customer demand response system. The island is also home to four diesel generators with a combined capacity of 6 MW.
Hydro Tasmania Chief Executive Officer Ian Brooksbank said the new solar plant is part of a long-term plan for King Island, which is home to about 1,700 people, to transition away from diesel entirely.
“Over the past 10 years, we’ve slashed diesel consumption on King Island by 50%. That saves 2.1 million litres of diesel and cuts carbon emissions by 5,700 tonnes a year,” he said.
“The new solar farm will save an additional 300,000 litres in diesel and 800 tonnes in carbon emissions annually and deliver even greater reliability in electricity supply for local homes and businesses.”

King Island already draws about two-thirds of its annual electricity from renewables but Hydro Tasmania said the KIREIP system is capable of 100% renewable operation, the only megawatt class off-grid system with this capability in the world today.
Brooksbank said King Island, which installed its first wind turbines 25 years ago, has become a renewable energy blueprint for isolated off-grid communities in Australia and around the world.
“This type of hybrid, renewable energy system is also a model for the national electricity market,” he said. “How we integrate wind, solar and storage, while reducing fossil fuels and maintaining grid stability, is an important lesson as the nation transitions to renewable energy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/02/international-energy-giants-look-to-kickstart-new-era-in-australian-manufacturing/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,INDIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 2, 2023",International energy giants look to kickstart new era in Australian manufacturing,"Canadian investment giant Brookfield, which is currently in the process of formally acquiring Origin Energy, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with India’s Reliance Industries to explore opportunities for manufacturing of clean energy equipment in Australia.
“Under the terms of the MoU, Brookfield will work with Reliance to explore avenues of direct capital investment and development of skills, knowledge and expertise in the renewable energy sector of Australia to facilitate the nation’s transition to a net zero future,” the companies said in a joint statement.
“The MoU aims to both accelerate and de-risk Australia’s energy transition by enabling it to locally produce clean energy equipment such as PV modules, long-duration battery storage and components for wind energy.”
Reliance has strong expertise in solar panel technology and long duration battery storage technology. It is currently in the process of setting up one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India.
Brookfield announced only last month that it, along with it partners in renewable energy projects, will invest up to $30 billion (USD 19.86 billion) in Australia over the next 10 years.
The Canadian company, which along with its consortium partners has lodged an estimated $18.7 billion takeover bid for Origin, says it plans to develop up to 14 GW of new renewable generation and storage assets within the Origin Energy business by 2033.
The Reliance-Brookfield partnership intends to support that investment, the companies said.
“Reliance and Brookfield will evaluate the establishment of advanced operations in Australia to make/or assemble equipment used in the construction of renewable energy projects supplying equipment to all players in the market including Origin Energy Markets,” they said.
Luke Edwards, head of Brookfield’s renewable division in Australia, said the nation’s energy, which includes a target of 82% renewables in the main grid by 2032, offers an opportunity to deliver a new era in local manufacturing.
“Australia has a proud history of manufacturing and an abundance of raw materials, but the industry is not currently cost-competitive,” he said. “The energy transition creates an opportunity to bring advanced manufacturing processes created offshore to Australia, which would secure the supply of critical equipment for the transition to help drive down Australia’s emissions faster and contribute significantly to job creation.”
“We want to help kickstart a new era in local manufacturing that will benefit domestic renewables developers, including Origin Energy Markets, and many communities around Australia.”
Edwards said Brookfield is looking to establish these manufacturing partnerships “as quickly as possible” with market analysis indicating the establishment of onshore manufacturing capability for the energy transition has the potential to create about 18,000 jobs.
Brookfield expects many of the jobs will be created in regions most impacted by the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, including the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria.
For Reliance, the MoU continues the company’s expansion beyond the petrochemical sector to businesses in retail, telecommunications, and clean energy.
Led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, Reliance is currently developing one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India, including gigafactories for PV panels, energy storage, hydrogen electrolysers and fuel cells.
Ambani said the company’s 10 GW solar cell and module factory is set to commence production by 2024. The company plans to increase the facility’s capacity to 20 GW by 2026 and is also targeting 50 GWh annual cell-to-pack battery manufacturing capacity by 2027.
“At Reliance, we are firmly committed to the mission of creating a global clean energy ecosystem that is both beneficial to humanity and compatible with nature,” he said. “Towards this end, Reliance is pursuing opportunities of investment in India and globally with great enthusiasm and passion.”
“We are confident that Reliance and Brookfield will explore avenues in green energy in Australia, accelerating the nation’s transition to a net zero future and providing a fillip to the global green energy movement.”
