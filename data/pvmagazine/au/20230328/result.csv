While its target changed from AGL to Origin over the last 12 months, Brookfield’s strategy of using a major established energy company to accelerate decarbonisation at a globally significant scale remains the same. 
Under Brookfield and its newly revealed fellow investors, Singapore giants GIC and Temasek, the business plan is to invest “at least” $20 billion in the next decade to construct up to 14 GW of new renewable capacity.
To put those numbers in perspective, this represents about one-fifth of the what the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) says will be needed by 2030 to reach national targets. 
Brookfield also plans to reduce Origin’s absolute emissions by more than 70% by 2030. A decent chunk of this reduction will come from the closure of the Eraring coal-fired power station in New South Wales, slated for retirement in 2025 at the earliest.
During his campaign ahead of the NSW election on March 23, then-opposition Labor leader Chris Minns said he would be open to buying back the 2.8 GW coal generator. With Minn’s election over the weekend, Brookfield has not closed the door to this proposition, but its Asia Pacific CEO Stewart Upson told the Australian Financial Review that such a deal would need to fit into Brookfield’s decarbonisation vision.
The buyout will see Brookfield, GIC and Temasek take over Origin’s retail and generation business, which currently has a 24% market share in Australia’s national electricity market. Meanwhile, partner MidOcean Energy, managed by US investment giant EIG Partners, will take control of Origin’s gas assets and business.
After months of due diligence and negotiations, the consortium has entered into a Scheme Implementation Deed with Origin to purchase 100% of its shares at $8.91 per share, a premium on current trading prices.
While the deal should be approved by shareholders, it still has to be looked over by both the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
Since Brookfield is Canadian-owned, a member country of the Five Eyes security alliance, it is not anticipated to see too many roadblocks from the Foreign Investment Review Board. The ACCC, on the other hand, could prove problematic, especially given Brookfield’s recent takeover of Victorian network AusNet Services.
APAC CEO Stewart Upson is expected to make the argument that national interest (in the form of accelerated decarbonisation) should outweigh any competition concerns.
Brookfield is adamant it has the know-how to realise its ambitious seven-year plan. “Brookfield has the capital, expertise, supply chain strength and global track record that’s needed to transform Origin’s generation fleet to greener sources and accelerate Australia’s energy transition while ensuring network security and reliability,” Upton said.
Indeed, the acquisition will be made via the Brookfield Global Transition Fund, which claims to be the world’s largest private fund focused on the net-zero transition, and is headed up by Mark Carney, one of the world’s most influential climate change power brokers.
Next to its capital and political clout, Brookfield also has significant experience with renewables development, claiming a portfolio with 25 GW of generating capacity and a 110 GW development pipeline globally. 
The company says it is also now working with Indian giant Reliance in light of the deal, with the potential for it to come on as a “strategic partner”. While this was the extent of details provided, Reliance is major renewable equipment manufacturer, suggesting Brookfield is already looking to secure supplies once the Origin takeover is approved by shareholders and regulators.
Earlier this month, Brookfield acquired the remaining 50% stake in Spain-based renewables developer X-Elio from its joint venture partner, investment firm KKR.

These figures come in spite of the fact Australia had less sunshine than normal over summer – a testament to the cumulative force of rooftop solar’s normalisation.

The Clean Energy Council says the 15% – 20% increase in Australian’s electricity bills in 2022 have underpinned strong demand for rooftop solar. The rising power price has also made rooftop solar’s payback times even more attractive, hitting near record-low at 3.4 years for a 7 kW system.
“We’re seeing a fundamental shift; consumers are becoming energy generators,” Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton said. Thornton also noted these figures measure only what enters the grid.
Breaking down the states, New South Wales’ (NSW) rooftop solar generation jumped 35% on the previous summer. Tasmania also saw a massive uptick, clocking a 31.7% jump from the previous year.

Using data from the Clean Energy Regulator, the Council also noted top postcodes for rooftop solar uptake, with Lismore claiming the top spot for NSW, Bundaberg for Queensland, Salisbury in South Australia, Hoppers Crossing in Victoria, Mandurah in Western Australia, and Blackstone Heights in Tasmania.
Home battery installations are also growing, with 7% of new solar systems now including a battery.
In total, 2.8 GW of rooftop solar was installed in 2022.

Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) said this week that its new PVT solar module PX-1 from German manufacturer Sunmaxx PVT has an overall efficiency of 80%.
The module measures 1,750 mm x 1,140 mm x 38 mm and features 108 PERC half-cells in the M10 format. The electrical output is 400 W, which corresponds to an electrical efficiency of about 20%.
The new product has also a thermal output of 1,200 W, which corresponds to a thermal collector efficiency EtaO of 60%. Fraunhofer ISE measured this value under maximum power point (MPP) conditions in full sunlight, at a module temperature of 25 C, and at a wind speed of 0 meters per second.
Fraunhofer ISE has conducted additional tests on real operating scenarios on outdoor and indoor test stands. The measurements showed that the module heats up to a maximum temperature of 30 C in full sunlight. Conventional PV modules reach temperatures of up to 80 C, which reduces their efficiency.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/28/silicon-anode-lithium-ion-battery-cell-with-500-wh-kg-density/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"MARCH 28, 2023",Silicon anode lithium-ion battery cell with 500 Wh/kg density,"From pv magazine USA
California-based Amprius has verified the performance of its silicon anode battery cells with third-party tester Mobile Power Solutions. The results show that the cell model provides 504 Wh per kg and 1321 Wh per L at 25 C.
Amprius said the silicon anode cell is roughly half the weight and volume of leading conventional commercially available lithium-ion cells. The cells have applications in the rapidly growing electric aviation space and could be integrated with electric vehicles. Together, electric aviation and light-duty EV battery demand is estimated to exceed USD 100 billion ($150 billion) throughout the world by 2025, said the company.
The Amprius cells offer a run time of 200% compared to leading graphite battery cells. However, they are lighter and smaller than other batteries with the same energy content.
“This latest validation continues Amprius’ track record of producing the world’s most powerful battery cells and sets an industry benchmark for next-generation battery technology that will ultimately revolutionise how high we fly, how far we travel and how long we can use our devices,” said Jon Bornstein, president of Amprius Labs.
Customers can adjust specifications on the battery cell platform to meet a project’s engineering needs. The customisable platform allows customers to select the option to either increase energy content in a battery pack without increasing weight, reduce weight in applications that target a fixed energy content, or a combinations of the two. Higher energy is important for longer run times, range and endurance, while lighter packs increase energy efficiency.
The battery cells are planned to be integrated with the AALTO Zephyr, a high-altitude platform station (HAPS). The solar-electric telecommunications aircraft offers persistent earth observation with 18cm ground sampling distance, near-real-time video and imagery from the stratosphere, day and night.
“We look forward to taking advantage of Amprius’ 500 Wh/kg cell to further develop Zephyr’s unrivalled stratospheric endurance capabilities,” said Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technical officer at AALTO HAPS, an Airbus subsidiary. “Amprius is a valued current supplier with a great track-record, and we are confident that its battery will deliver the capability we need.”
Amprius operates a research and development laboratory in Fremont, California. It recently signed a letter of intent for a 774,000 square foot facility in Brighton, Colorado that would provide up to 5 GWh of manufacturing capacity.
The US Department of Energy (DoE) targets improvements in battery performance to stabilise the critical materials supply chain and offer attractive products to vehicle buyers. “While a number of electric drive vehicles are available on the market, further improvements in batteries could make them more affordable and convenient to consumers,” according to the DoE.
The DoE funds advanced battery development, systems analysis, and testing in pursuit of these goals. Read more about DoE’s involvement with batteries here.
