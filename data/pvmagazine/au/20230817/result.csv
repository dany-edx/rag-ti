“We were thrilled to have hosted site visits last week showcasing our newly completed Norton Binduli 2.3 MWp Nomad project,” the company said.
“The success of this deployment was a proud achievement for us, and for the renewable energy landscape, demonstrating the huge potential for ultra-low cost solar here in Australia.”
“We now have firm proof of how the Nomad outperforms other technologies in the region and that prefabricated solar tracking will enable the next big leap.”

Cambridge, which delivered the project for Perth-based energy and mining consultancy ResourcesWA and investment firm CrossBoundary, said its Nomad system is the only PV solution in the world that combines prefabrication with solar tracking, setting “a new standard in delivering efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable solar.”
“The technology revolutionises solar energy by offering the benefits of solar tracking in a unique, prefabricated design,” the company said. “It maximises energy yield, making solar projects more feasible, cost-effective, and socially responsible.”
Cambridge which was founded by Australian Tom Miller, said the Nomad system features bifacial panels mounted on a single-axis tracking system which allows for maximum energy output, claiming the Nomad generates 45-50% greater yield than other prefabricated solutions.
The system also features an innovative anchoring solution that eliminates the need for piles and concrete. The tracker is anchored to the ground using percussion-driven earth anchors that utilise the soil as a counterweight and are connected to the structure through cables.
“This anchoring method eliminates the need for extensive groundworks, steel piles or concrete, and ensures minimal disruption to the soil during installation and decommissioning,” Cambridge said.

The system has been designed to be stored in a shipping container, and Cambridge said it can be removed and reinstalled as and when required with the modular design reducing inefficiencies in transport and installation, while making for faster deployment than conventional solar, resulting in lower deployment costs.
Trent Colyer, managing director of Perth-based OSOS Global Services which provided the installation team behind the 2.3 MW Binduli project, said the install had gone much quicker than expected.
“We had never installed one of these Cambridge models before, and no one in Australia has either. But they’ve made it very, very simple for us to do it,” he said.
Colyer said the small installation crew had deployed 1 MW per week using regular construction machinery.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/17/study-claims-pv-industry-is-neglecting-overirradiance-issues/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 17, 2023",Study claims PV industry is neglecting overirradiance issues,"An international research team has investigated how overirradiance (OI) may impact the performance of PV installations at low- and mid-latitudes and have found several issues may arise when OI conditions last more than one minute and at ambient temperatures above 30 C.
These events may affect the operating performance of photovoltaic plants, the stability of the electrical grid, and the efficiency of inverters. These effects are due to the increase and drastic fluctuation of irradiance, which can vary by more than 900 W/m2.
“To our estimation, the industry in the last decades, the PV industry, has been neglecting overirradiance, possibly due to unawareness or the belief that these events are rare and isolated,” the research’s lead author, Marco Zamalloa, told pv magazine. “We ourselves were not aware of such events before seeing them in our irradiance data a few years ago. However, since we are relatively new to this topic, we cannot say with absolute certainty whether some PV energy industry branches and project developers now consider these overirradiance conditions.”
 According to Zamalloa, OI conditions are common and occur everywhere with cloud formation. “They can be imagined as a wandering focal point of a magnifying glass,” he further explained. “With the movement of the cloud, it wanders over the earth’s surface. We become only aware of the irradiance enhancement when the focal point passes a sensor.”
In the paper “Overirradiance conditions and their impact on the spectral distribution at low- and mid-latitude sites,” published in Solar Energy, Zamalloa and his colleagues analysed the spectral distribution of OI conditions in Lima, Madrid, and Berlin using spectroradiometers, tilt and azimuth angles, and sampling interval. They measured, in particular, the spectral distribution of solar irradiance in W/m2/nm, ranging from 350 to 1050 nm, via two years of measured spectral data.
Through their analysis, they found that OI conditions cause red-shift and cloud a blue-shift of the clear-sky spectrum. “The red-shift caused by overirradiance conditions results in different spectral distributions, depending on the average photon energy of the clear sky,” they explained, adding that the spectral red-shift indicates a cloud-enhancement of the direct normal irradiance.
“We believe the photovoltaic industry requires a quantitative evaluation of the impacts of overirradiance on the operation of photovoltaic systems, which are just beginning to be carried out,” co-author Jan Amaru Töfflinger said. “The sudden change in irradiance makes it necessary to improve the response time of the inverters and the MPPT algorithm, both to take advantage of the increase in irradiance and to avoid heating the cables, fuses, and photovoltaic modules due to the high current generated by the overirradiance events.”
Töfflinger also stressed that overirradiance conditions are frequent in Brazil and can have technical and economic effects on photovoltaic plants. “We have contacted colleagues from Brazil, where, so far, most papers have been written regarding the impact of overirradiance conditions on PV plants,” he concluded. “They say they are quite aware of the potential risks and are taking precautions in sizing the inverter and protective fuses.”
The research group is formed by scientists from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Germany’s Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie GmbH, and the University of Jaén in Spain.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/17/over-155-gw-of-u-s-solar-manufacturing-announced-in-one-year/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INVERTERS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 17, 2023",Over 155 GW of U.S. solar manufacturing announced in one year,"One year ago this week, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law, marking the largest climate and energy spending package in U.S. history. Inside the massive energy, climate, and tax bill is almost $940 billion (USD 600 billion) in spending, $570 billion of which is dedicated to supporting renewable energy buildout and climate resilience.
The IRA mandates a nationwide reduction of carbon emissions by roughly 40% in 2030. It also targeted a return to domestic manufacturing in the United States, bringing jobs and supply chains back onshore. About $100 billion within IRA is directed towards U.S. manufacturing.
One year later, more than $150 billion in private investment has been announced, leading to the establishment of 51 new facilities or significant expansions, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
“The unprecedented surge in demand for American-made clean energy is a clear sign that the clean energy incentives enacted last year by Congress are working,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.
SEIA shared that over 155 GW of solar supply chain capacity expansions have already been announced, leading to an estimated $30 billion investment in U.S. communities. The production additions include:
By 2026, it is forecast that the U.S. will have more than 17 times its current capacity across modules, cells, wafers, ingots, and inverters once these facilities reach operations. Over 20,000 U.S. jobs are expected to be created by these facilities, and the U.S. solar manufacturing workforce is set to triple to more than 100,000 over the next decade.
Additionally, over 65 GWh of energy storage manufacturing capacity has been announced across 14 new or expanded facilities. Since the IRA was passed, over 3 GW of large-scale energy storage projects have been deployed, and an estimated 100,000 customers have installed a residential solar system paired with battery storage.
“We’ve often dealt with the buy side, through continued tax credits for projects. That really helps installers and developers and end-users,” said George Hershman, SEIA board director and SOLV Energy chief executive officer in an interview with pv magazine USA.
“But we really never dealt with how we are going to get product, the supply side. I think the IRA did a great job with supporting the supply side to ensure we build the manufacturing supply chain in the U.S. that we all want to be able to deploy,” Hershman said.
As for political threats to IRA, there have been attempts to overturn it or strip core provisions, but Hershman said that early and continued success will de-fang any attempts to throw out the landmark industrial policy.
“We want to win the win,” he said. “We all want to be in a position where we can cut ribbons and put shovels in the ground and say the IRA brought this project to your community. A lot of these projects are in Red counties and Red districts. It’s much harder to fight against a bill that’s bringing jobs and property tax revenues to your district.”
E2 reported that Republican districts accounted for 60% of the jobs estimated to be created and 63% of the new investment under IRA. Over 74,000 direct jobs have been created by these manufacturing announcements, according to an E2 report.
SEIA forecasts that the solar industry will generate over $565 billion in private sector investment over the next decade. By 2033, cumulative solar capacity will reach 668 GW, enough to power every home east of the Mississippi River. This is also equivalent to offsetting 459 million metric tons of carbon emissions each year, representing about one-third of all power sector emissions based on 2021 levels.
