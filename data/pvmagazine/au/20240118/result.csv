The MoorPower project works on the same principle as Carnegie’s ‘CETO’ technology which features submerged, buoy-like devices that rely on the movement of the waves to produce oscillating motion that is converted into grid-ready electricity.
The company said the MoorPower module leverages the core principles of this technology but works on the surface and at a smaller scale.
Carnegie Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Fievez said the deployment of the module is a significant milestone in the challenge of decarbonising offshore operations and reducing the reliance on diesel generators.
“It is an important step in bringing our technology to the world,” he said. “We have listened to the needs of industry operating in isolated offshore environments and adapted our unique CETO technology to their requirements.”
The deployment follows onshore testing and commissioning completed at Carnegie’s Fremantle base. That testing focused on reliability and allowed the project team to refine communications and control strategies.
Carnegie said the offshore trial will yield vital insights into the behaviour of the MoorPower system across various sea conditions with the results to play a crucial role in validating the modelling of the technology and performance simulations for future commercial projects.
The company also expects the learnings will be transferable to its existing projects in Europe.
“MoorPower is set to transform the way energy is harnessed offshore, with its initial target market being aquaculture barges and vessels that require electrical power while operating on offshore locations,” the company said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/18/degrussa-solar-and-battery-hub-labelled-brilliant-success-as-decommissioning-begins/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 18, 2024",DeGrussa solar and battery hub labelled ‘brilliant success’ as decommissioning begins,"French renewable energy giant Neoen has confirmed the DeGrussa solar and battery hub in the heart of Western Australia’s goldfields region is to be dismantled after seven years of operations.
The DeGrussa facility, comprising 10.6 MW of PV and a 6 MW lithium-ion battery energy storage system teamed with a diesel-fired generator, was commissioned at West Australian mining company Sandfire Resources’ Degussa copper mine site, 900 kilometres northeast of Perth, in June 2016.
The solar hybrid power system has since supplied nearly 20% of the mining operation’s annual power requirements and cut its emissions by about 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.
Sandfire purchased the power under an initial 5.5-year agreement but that was extended as the mining operation pushed beyond its original 2021 closure date. The mine has however now ceased operations, signalling the end of life for the DeGrussa solar and battery hub.
In a statement shared with pv magazine, Neoen said it is intending to remove the solar panels, as well as the rest of its facility and to rehabilitate the site.
Climate Energy Finance Director Tim Buckley said the dismantling came as no surprise with the end of mine life “absolutely well known” when they solar hybrid power system was commissioned.
“There is no surprise there,” he said, adding that in spite of its short lifespan, the DeGrussa power project has been a “brilliant success.”
Buckley said the project, which attracted $20.9 million (USD 13.7 million) in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and $15 million in debt finance from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), was part of the “step change that took solar from being a potential technology to being now integral to the transformation and decarbonisation of the Australian electricity system.”
“Given Australia has gone on to become a world leader in both the solar and battery energy storage systems means this was a brilliant success, over-delivering in terms of the financials and project’s planned life and the learning by doing of this pilot-scale, world-leading deployment,” he said.
“The capacity, the scale, the technology improvements, the software integration, all the learnings that have gone on, Degrussa was a core part of the early learning by doing.”
Buckley said the project had provided key learnings in how off-grid energy needs are going to be met with Australia now is embracing the energy transition.
“Our biggest companies are BHP and Rio, huge balance sheets, huge potential and huge energy needs and they are starting to embrace the learning by doing that ARENA has been championing for the past decade and Degrussa was a classic example,” he said.

Even as it is being dismantled, the DeGrussa project could provide lessons with Neoen exploring opportunities to repurpose the 34,080 solar panels and other infrastructure that is installed across the 20-hectare site.
“Our preference is for the solar panels to be re-used as they remain in good condition,” the company said, adding that it “is currently investigating opportunities to find a second life for the solar panels and for the other main components such as the inverters, transformers and the battery pack.”
The DeGrussa milestone comes as Western Australian government-owned utility Synergy announced that it has commenced the decommissioning of the Ten Mile Lagoon and Nine Mile Beach wind farms near Esperance in the state’s southwest.
Nine Mile and Ten Mile wind farms were installed more than 20 years ago and have reached their end of life.
During decommissioning, two of the wind turbines are being donated to North Metropolitan TAFE for renewable energy training purposes and six wind turbines will be repurposed at new wind farm sites in the Perth region.
The project is expected to be completed by end-2024.

Trina said the 1.6 mm x 1.6 mm dual-glass solar panels features high-transmission anti-reflective (AR) coated heat-strengthened glass on the front and heat-strengthened glass on the reverse which deliver higher power generation and improved reliability.
The Vertex S+ NEG18R.28 modules yield a maximum power output of 505 W with an efficiency of 22.5%, a performance Trina attributes in part to the N-type technology which the company said ensures “a longer lifespan, less light-induced degradation, and delivers a higher conversion efficiency than P-type panels.”
Trina said the panels have ultra-low degradation rates, including a 1% first year and 0.4% annual degradation.
The panels measure 1,961 mm x 1,134 mm with a width of 30 mm and weigh 23.5 kg, dimensions that Trina said make installation straight-forward while ensuring the panels are robust enough for larger-scale commercial installation.
“Lighter-weight panels make installation in hard-to-reach spaces easier and the panels may also suit older buildings whose roofs were not originally designed to hold extra load long-term,” the company said.

Trina also said the design of the panels provides optimised energy production under inter-row shading conditions, which can be prevalent in commercial and industrial installations.
The NEG18R.28 panels include potential induced degradation (PID) resistance to reduce deterioration due to unwanted charge carrier movements, have increased crack and scratch resistance, meet IEC fire ratings (Class A+C), and have passed 35 mm hail tests.
The panels are backed by a 25-year product warranty and 30-year performance warranty.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/18/queensland-builds-on-statewide-network-connected-battery-program/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 18, 2024",Queensland builds on statewide network-connected battery program,"The Queensland government has announced a $179 million (USD 117 million) investment that will underpin stages three and four of its local network-connected batteries program that has already delivered 17 battery energy storage systems designed to assist in gaining the maximum advantage from the state’s rooftop solar systems.
The first stage the program entailed five local network-connected batteries being deployed across Queensland, with stage two currently under way to add another 12 batteries.
Energy Queensland Chief Engineer Peter Price said the 4 MW / 8 MWh network-connected batteries to be rolled out in the next stages will be installed in regional areas with high solar penetration and will be used to soak up excess generation and support the energy network during times of peak demand.
“By basing the batteries in communities where there are large volumes of roof top solar means renewable energy will be generated locally, stored locally, and then used locally, reducing the pressure on the network,” he said.
“With these battery projects we’re aiming for a win-win-win scenario that achieves the energy trifecta for communities throughout the state – affordability, security and sustainability.”
Stage three of the program is set to deliver 12 additional 4 MW / 8 MWh batteries with Price saying the project will build on the lessons learned in the initial stages to ensure that efficiencies and benefits are continually added into the program.
Stage four will entail the deployment of two flow batteries sourced from Queensland manufacturers.
“Stage four of the plan will be particularly exciting as it will investigate the suitability of two batteries as an alternative to lithium batteries, with the added bonus of potentially kickstarting a local battery industry,” Price said.
State-owned Energy Queensland last year signed a deal with Redflow for the supply of a 4 MWh of zinc-bromine flow battery energy storage while fellow Queensland-based renewables company Energy Storage Industries – Asia Pacific (ESI) has been tapped to supply a 5 MWh iron flow battery.
Queensland Premier Steven Miles said the battery program will play a central role in the state’s Energy and Jobs Plan by maximising the benefits of rooftop solar and bolstering the electricity distribution network.
“We have the highest rate of rooftop solar anywhere in Australia so it’s only right that we equip our energy network to keep pace with the high rates of solar generation,” he said.
“This battery program is fundamental to our success in achieving 70% renewable energy by 2030, and Net Zero Emissions by 2050.”
The initial stage of the local network-connected batteries program delivered batteries at Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Toowoomba, Townsville and Yeppoon.
Stage two is currently in delivery, with the installation of 12 batteries underway in Cairns (two sites), Townsville, Mackay, Emerald, Mundubbera, Gladstone, Howard, Toowoomba, Raby Bay, Morayfield and Bribie Island.
Energy Queensland is yet to finalise sites for the stage three batteries but Mooloolaba, Runaway Bay, Cornubia, Jimboomba, Woodridge, Yatala, Barcaldine, Dalby, Glenella, Toowoomba, Milchester and Maryborough are currently being considered.
Burrum Heads and Ipswich are the likely sites for the two flow batteries that will be installed in stage four of the program.

Switzerland’s Meyer Burger Technology has announced that it is preparing to shut down its solar module manufacturing facilities in Germany.
“With a deteriorating market environment in Europe, continuing with full-scale European solar manufacturing is not sustainable for the time being,” the company said in a statement. “Part of the plan would unfortunately be the closure of one of Europe’s largest operational solar module production sites in Freiberg, Germany, as early as beginning of April 2024, affecting approximately 500 people.”
The company said that it will make a final decision by the end of February, leaving the door open to rethink its plan if “sufficient measures to create a level playing field in Europe, such as a resilience-reward scheme,” are put into place.
Meyer Burger said that cell production at its factory in Talheim, Germany, will support module production at its 2 GW factory currently under construction in the United States.
“The R&D sites in Switzerland and Germany would not be affected by these measures and continue to develop and produce technology and equipment to support Meyer Burger’s business outside Europe,” it said.
“In the US, we can take full advantage of our leading technology position, resulting in substantial interest by partners and supported by favorable industry policies,” said Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt. “The expansion of the US business is currently proceeding as planned with the ramp-up of our solar module production site in Goodyear, expected to start in the second quarter of 2024.”
By combining US module and cell manufacturing, Meyer Burger will benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit 45X system, which is a component of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Prior to this announcement, Meyer Burger was targeting about 3 GW of new annual production capacity in Germany by the end of 2024, including 1.4 GW of module production capacity in Freiberg. It also currently plans to build a 3.5 GW solar cell and module factory at an unspecified location in Spain.
