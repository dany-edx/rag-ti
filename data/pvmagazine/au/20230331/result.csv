Enerparc said the portfolio includes two operational solar farms at Trundle and Peak Hill, near Parkes, in central-west New South Wales (NSW), with a cumulative capacity of 13.3 MWp. It also includes a 180 MWp solar project currently under development that Enerparc said is expected to start producing electricity at the end of 2025.
Although not identified, the only project Enerparc has of this scale in Australia is the 152 MW (AC) Tilbuster Solar Farm being developed north of Armidale in northern NSW.
Enerparc established its Australian operations in 2017 and the managing director of Australian operations, Benjamin Hannig, said the company remains “committed to delivering innovative and sustainable energy solutions in Australia and look forward to advancing further projects of our pipeline in the near future.”
“This transaction is a testament to Enerparc Australia’s success in developing and realising solar projects in NSW led by our team of professionals based in Sydney,” he said. “We are excited about accelerating the energy transition with the prospect of further developments and partnerships in Australia.”
Other projects under development by Enerparc Australia include the 25 MW Innes Park Solar Farm in Queensland, 25 MW Tenterfield Solar Farm in NSW, and 12 MW Carag Carag Solar Farm in Victoria.
Enerparc Chief Executive Officer and Chair Christoph Koeppen said the deal with Ingka aligns with the company’s plan to develop a total of 10 GW solar globally for its own portfolio and another 10 GW of third-party solar projects by 2030.
“These and future Australian projects developed by Enerparc Australia will contribute to this strategy,” he said.

The total production of the three solar farms acquired by Ingka will be approximately 340 GWh per year, which is equivalent to the electricity consumption of about 65,000 Australian households.
Ingka said the output of the solar farms will initially be “steered contractually” towards local Ingka Group operations, and in future to value chain partners and customers.
The solar investment, which follows last month’s acquisition of a 15% stake in stage one of TagEnergy’s planned 756 MW Golden Plains Wind Farm near Geelong in Victoria, is part of Ingka’s global clean energy strategy and its push to becoming a 100% renewable energy organisation by 2025.
Ikea Australia Chief Executive Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer Mirja Viinanen said the new investment in solar would better diversify the company’s renewable portfolio and better match production with consumption.
“In addition to the recently acquired stake in a wind farm in Victoria, this is the next vital step towards reaching 100% renewable energy across all operations,” she said. “We have ambitious targets when it comes to reducing our climate footprint across Ingka Group globally, and meaningful investment like this is leading the way.”
Ingka has committed to invest $10.55 billion (EUR 6.5 billion) in renewable energy projects with the aim of reducing more greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2030. It has already invested more than $4.85 billion in wind and solar projects globally and Ingka Investments Managing Director Peter van der Poel said Australia has been identified as a location with rich potential for renewable investments.
This is the “next step in accelerating our energy production in the Asia and Pacific region,” he said. “With our own solar parks and wind farms, we want to make renewable energy available throughout the IKEA value chain and beyond.”

Shell and GIG said the project, which planning documents estimate will cost approximately $80 million, has already reached financial close and will be completed in late 2024.
GIG Global Head of Energy Technology Greg Callman said the battery, to be built near the existing Cranbourne Terminal Station, will deliver a range of benefits for the grid, including increasing Victoria’s renewable energy hosting capacity and delivering essential system services.
“Grid-scale batteries are an essential element in the decarbonisation of the energy sector, and the need for storage solutions is growing rapidly,” he said. “This project will help provide communities with reliable and flexible energy.”
Once fully operational, the Rangebank BESS will have the capacity to power the equivalent of 80,000 homes for an hour during peak periods.
Shell will hold the rights to charge and dispatch energy from the battery through a 20-year offtake agreement.
Shell Energy Australia Chief Executive Officer Greg Joiner said the project signals the company’s commitment to accelerating the energy transition and contributing to growth of firming capacity.
“The Rangebank project is our first grid-scale battery investment in Victoria and marks Shell’s first direct equity investment in a utility-scale BESS globally,” he said.
“Located in one of Melbourne’s fastest-growing population centres, the Rangebank BESS will help to stabilise Victoria’s state electricity supply by providing additional storage capacity which can be discharged at times of peak demand.”

The Rangebank project is the latest addition to Shell’s utility-scale battery portfolio.
Earlier this year the company acquired the development rights for a 500 MW/1000 MWh battery located at the former Wallerawang coal power station site near Lithgow in the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales (NSW).
Shell has also partnered with Ampyr Australia to develop a 500 MW/1,000 MWh battery in Wellington, near Dubbo in the state’s central west.
The Rangebank battery is to be built, serviced, and maintained by United States-headquartered energy storage technology firm Fluence and will utilise the company’s latest Gridstack product.
Melbourne-based real estate company Perfection Private is a minority shareholder in the Rangebank project.
GIG said it will transfer its interest in the project to its newly formed battery storage platform Eku Energy, which has a 4 GWh pipeline of utility scale battery projects in the UK, Australia, Japan and Taiwan.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/31/feds-back-15-billion-fund-to-boost-clean-energy-manufacturing/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 31, 2023",Feds back $15 billion fund to boost clean energy manufacturing,"The federal government’s $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund (NRF), designed to boost investment in onshore manufacturing, including the production of solar panels, batteries and hydrogen electrolysers, will be established in law after the Bill passed through both the Senate and lower house earlier this week.
Federal Industry Minister Ed Husic said the fund is “one of the largest peacetime investments in Australian manufacturing capability” and the progress of the legislation paves the way for Australia to ramp up high-value manufacturing and jobs.
“The most successful modern economies are built on strong, advanced manufacturing capability,” he said. “The NRF will help deliver this for Australia. We want Australia to be a country that makes things, a nation that has faith in its know-how and ability to get the job done.”
The NRF will deliver co-investments in projects across a range of strategic industries including renewables and low-emissions technologies, resources value adding, agriculture, transport, defence capability, and critical technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics.
The fund will be administered by an independent board which will make independent investment decisions, modelled on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s (CEFC) ‘co-investment’ model with government planning to partner with businesses and superannuation funds to unlock further potential private investment of more than $30 billion through the fund.
An initial $5 billion will be provided to the fund by the federal government with a further $10 billion made available in mid-2029. The government has earmarked up to $3 billion of the NRF’s initial $15 billion to support the manufacture of renewables and low-emission technologies.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the NRF will revitalise industries that have been allowed to lag and provide a welcome boost for Australian renewable energy technology and know-how.
“Australia has all the resources that go into solar panels, batteries and other finished products,” he said. “We should be making them here. And that’s what this investment is all about. It will mean more secure jobs and more world-class products made in Australia.”
While the legislation has been widely welcomed, Glen Ryan, co-founder of Perth-based solar innovator Sunovate, said more needs to be done to provide surety for companies looking to develop clean energy technology in Australia.
Ryan, who is also behind Western Australian ocean energy company Bombora Wave Power which was moved offshore in search of financial backing and support, said government needs to establish hard targets to underpin the clean energy industry or risk loss of jobs, export potential and technology options.
“I have had to watch too many cleantech ideas including my own having to leave our shores to get a foot up,” Ryan said in a linkedin post. “We need hard targets to guarantee sustained project revenue opportunity and investable projects. We need hard targets to drive investments in the technology platforms to service the projects. Only then will we have the basis to consider local manufacturing opportunities.”
Ryan said the recent announcement by Melbourne-based company Wave Swell Energy that despite a successful trial of its technology it is unlikely to set up in Australia due to a lack of political and financial support is a perfect example of the challenges facing clean energy companies.
“Here we go again,” Ryan said. “Another Australian innovative wave energy device looking overseas for ongoing support.”

Wave Swell Energy chief executive Paul Geason told the ABC that he was delighted with the results of a 12-month trial of its technology off the coast of Tasmania’s King Island, and believed the technology would become an important part of future global electricity production.
Geason said the company is now aiming to scale up its operations but despite the success of the pilot, which was granted $4.03 million in federal government funding, the company will be setting its sights on the overseas market due to a lack of incentive from both state and national governments.
“We are an Australian, a Tasmanian invention. Australia’s an important market for us … we’d dearly love to set up here,” he said.
“Ideally, Australia would become home to a world-leading manufacturing capability for these wave energy converters.”
“But right now … there are other markets in the world that are further advanced. Frankly, it would be irresponsible for us not to participate in those opportunities.”

“The installation of solar panels at Avonlie Solar Farm is now complete,” the company said on Thursday.
Victorian-based Beon Energy Solutions, which constructed the project for Iberdrola Australia, said workers had endured “some trying conditions” in the past nine months to deliver the project with a total of 455,868 modules installed on single axis tracking systems.
While production is still some way off, Iberdrola said it has already secured grid registration for the project and will shortly commence a period of hold-point testing which will see the plant ramp up to full export capacity.
When fully operational, the facility is expected to generate approximately 500 GWh of electricity annually, enough to power more than 100,000 Australian homes.
The Avonlie project, which has planning approval for a big battery, is the first standalone solar farm in Iberdrola’s expanding Australia renewable energy portfolio, which includes the almost 320 MW Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/31/missing-investments-jeopardise-energy-transition-says-irena/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,GERMANY,WORLD",MICHAEL FUHS,"MARCH 31, 2023","Missing investments jeopardise energy transition, says IRENA","From pv magazine Germany
Investment barriers are becoming the biggest hurdle to meeting the world’s 1.5 C climate target. To achieve this, global investments in the energy transition must quadruple to more than €5 trillion ($8.05 trillion).
This is one of IRENA’s main conclusions in the World Energy Transition Outlook, which the agency presented at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue this week in Germany.
“Two years ago we said that the window of opportunity was closing,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. “Last year we called for a dramatic change in the way we use energy and this year we see no reason for more optimism.”
In 2022, the share of renewable energy in the global electricity mix exceeded the 80% mark.
“But that’s the only positive graphic I show,” said La Camera during the opening press conference for the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue, which is held every year at the German Federal Foreign Office in Berlin to bring together policymakers and renewable energy companies from all over the world.
IRENA said the current growth rate is not enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. By 2030, the share of fossil fuels must be reduced from 79% in 2020 to 60%. To do this, the annual increase in renewable energy would have to be tripled.
It is not just a matter of expanding generation capacity, as all countries must be involved. A major challenge is to address investment inequality. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also noted such inequalities and said that interest rates for investments in some countries are sometimes four times higher than in Germany.
“That’s unfair,” said Baerbock, adding that leading G-7 economies have initiated the establishment of a fund at the World Bank for climate investments.
However, investments in renewable energy need companies and electricity buyers, and not just capital.
“Development must therefore go hand in hand with investment in renewables,” said La Camera.
Kenyan President William Ruto echoed similar sentiments.
“Unlike in Europe, Africa must first increase demand,” Ruto said, noting that Africa has enormous potential with electricity generation from renewable energy and a young population, Europe, on the other hand, cannot cover its energy requirements alone.
Baerbock said the world should not repeat the mistakes of the past, when countries were treated as pure raw material suppliers. She noted the example of lithium mining in Chile. Currently, a large amount of global lithium supplies come from Chile. Baerbock noted that 78% of that output goes to China, which she argued is the opposite of supply chain diversification.
“The decisions we make now will affect hundreds of millions of people over the next 1,000 years,” said German State Secretary Jennifer Morgan.
