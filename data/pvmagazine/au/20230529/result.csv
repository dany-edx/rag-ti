While the technology to add hydrogen to liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) is already established, the CSIRO said until recently there have been no commercial dehydrogenation processes for these hydrogen carriers, especially for small- to medium-scale decentralised applications.
The CSIRO said its hydrogen generator, which will feature the agency’s patented Catalytic Static Mixer (CSM), will solve that problem by allowing hydrogen to be economically recovered from the carrier liquid at the site where it will be used.
CSIRO Researcher Dr John Chiefari said the CSM, a 3D printed scaffold with a catalyst coating, would be central to the development of the hydrogen generator.
“Catalytic static mixers are special tools that mix fluids to speed up and better control chemical reactions without any moving parts,” he said. “This level of control allows the process to be highly scalable without the technical challenges that this usually entails. This gives us a key advantage over the current packed bed reactor technology.”

Chiefari said the hydrogen generation system will enable hydrogen to be produced locally and on demand from the carrier, with the “added advantages of the carrier fluid being safely stored in a similar way to diesel or petrol.”
The CSIRO aims to build a pilot-scale hydrogen generator capable of producing 5 kg of hydrogen per day, followed by a demonstration-scale unit that will produce 20 kg per day. It is expected the demonstration unit will be similar in size to a 12-metre shipping container making it ideal for hydrogen refuelling stations or replacing diesel generators where off-grid power supply is required.
It is expected that once the generator has been proven, Advanced Carbon Engineering will establish a facility in Australia to produce the generator technology for domestic use and exports.
CSIRO Deputy Hydrogen Industry Mission Lead Dr Vicky Au said the project will be the first unit using Australian technology to produce hydrogen from a liquid carrier and addresses some of the key challenges to the growth of the hydrogen sector.
“Australia has the potential to become an energy superpower through hydrogen, but we need to find better methods of safely transporting and storing it at scale,” she said.
“To get the hydrogen industry moving, we need to be able to get hydrogen where it will be used by the consumer. This generator unit will do just that and will be compact enough to move to where it’s needed – whether that’s a farm, a festival, an industrial facility or, a mine site.”
The project is being delivered as a part of CSIRO’s Hydrogen Industry Mission, which is designed to contribute to the establishment of a commercially viable Australian hydrogen industry.

Victoria Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio confirmed she has signed a ministerial order to progress the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) preferred route for the proposed 500 kV double-circuit overhead transmission line that will connect to the EnergyConnect project in NSW and the planned Western Renewables Link (WRL) in Victoria.
“Progressing critical transmission projects like VNI West is necessary to deliver cheaper, more reliable renewable energy to Victorian homes and businesses,” D’Ambrosio said in a statement. “There can be no energy transition without new transmission infrastructure. As Victoria moves towards 95% renewables by 2035, we have a duty to modernise our electricity network.”
AEMO Victoria Planning (AVP), which is developing the project in conjunction with network company Transgrid, is now working to finalise the route for the VNI West project after outlining the preferred option and a geographic area of interest for the transmission link in the Project Assessment Conclusions Report (PACR).
The preferred option, Option 5A, would connect the VNI West to the WRL at a terminal station at Bulgana in Victoria’s west, then link up with a substation near Kerang in north central Victoria before crossing the Murray River north of Kerang, linking to the EnergyConnect line at Transgrid’s Dinawan substation north of Jerilderie in NSW.

AVP Group Manager Nicola Falcon said the preferred option has reshaped where VNI West crosses the Murray River, with the final option adjusted to reflect stakeholder feedback identifying constraints around culturally and environmentally significant areas as well as zones of irrigated agriculture.
“Feedback received has helped us identify a preferred option for the critical transmission line – a variant of the previously proposed option – that delivers the most benefits for consumers and more electricity generation from three REZs in Victoria and NSW,” she said.
“By crossing the Murray River further north-west, the project can also avoid some sensitive cultural areas and prime irrigation land identified in feedback from local communities.”
AVP said the preferred option also harnesses more renewable generation than the previously proposed option, allowing for an estimated 3.4 GW of renewable generation to be built across the solar-rich South West NSW, Murray River and Western Victoria renewable energy zones (REZs).
Identified as a core component and priority project in AEMO’s 2022 Integrated System Plan, VNI West has the potential to add 1.93 GW of electricity export capacity from Victoria to NSW, and 1.67 GW of electricity import capacity from NSW to Victoria, improving the reliability and security of electricity supply as ageing coal-fired power stations are retired.
It has however attracted widespread opposition with more than 500 submissions received in response to a call for stakeholder feedback on the project with some critics labelling the project a “monumental mistake”, claiming it would be easier to upgrade existing transmission lines and that the project could triple transmission charges.
Communities and landowners in the affected areas have also raised concerns about disruptions during construction of the transmission towers and lines, ongoing impacts on the environment and farming operations, and negative effects on land values.
In a bid to smooth the way for the project, the state government has announced it will offer private landowners $8,000 per year for 25 years for every kilometre of land over which they allow transmission lines to be installed and AEMO said consultation with potentially impacted landholders will now intensify as they seek to refine the route, with a focus on minimising impacts on landholders, the environment and farming.
While the VNI West project still requires relevant planning and environmental approvals, AEMO said a new company, Transmission Company Victoria (TCV) has been established to undertake early works in Victoria, including community, landholder and traditional owner consultations and ongoing investigations into the corridor and ultimate route.

The 16th International Photovoltaic Power Generation and Smart Energy Conference and Exhibition in Shanghai is breaking all previous attendance records for any solar energy trade show in the world.
The talk in the packed 28 halls of SNEC (another record) is of 400,000 visitors and more than 2,800 exhibitors. SNEC 2023 is the first post-pandemic show and with China expected to install at least 130 GW this year, it fits this booming market that its leading trade show is also breaking all records.
Leading Chinese module manufacturers have some of the biggest booths at this show and are touting record conversion efficiencies, both on the cell- and module-level, and both in the lab and in mass production. There is much talk of the migration from p-type PERC to n-type technologies, including TOPCon and HJT. Higher and higher conversion efficiencies are accompanied by higher and higher production scale to meet both Chinese demand and overseas demand.
Scaling up quickly is not an art reserved to module manufacturers. pv magazine met with one Chinese inverter manufacturer that is scaling up in blocks of 40 GW. Several production blocks are already in place and either churning out product already or in the near future and additional blocks (up to a cumulative total of ten) can readily be added to meet global demand.
The scale and execution speed of Chinese PV manufacturers is very impressive and flexibility is also at hand when needed. This year’s SNEC is a case in point: when the show’s organisers ran out of conventional exhibition halls they simply filled the old “valley of death” (the vast empty area in the middle of the triangular arrangement of the SNEC exhibition halls) with temporary tent-like exhibition halls. But even without the old “valley of death” it remains a heroic feat to cover all 28 halls in the two-and-a-half days of the SNEC exhibition.
Meanwhile, almost all major research institutes raised their installation targets for China in 2023. BloombergNEF said it expects now 154 GW on new PV, while in its previous forecast it said 129 GW. S & P said 136 GW.
Representatives from multiple module makers expressed even greater optimism, with projections ranging from 150 GW to 200 GW. While last year the technology was heralded as a competitor in the new high-efficiency squad, the trade show floor in Shanghai this year showed a different picture. A whole range of new companies, some of which just a few weeks old, touted modules using TOPcon cells with efficiencies beyond the 23% mark.
These suppliers also stated to make a start in manufacturing in the two-digit gigawatt scale. While it appeared that most manufacturers have made their bet on TOPCon, there were also many new module makers offering HJT modules, similarly with efficiency of above 23%. With some companies offering both module types.
Once a supplier can make modules there is no holding back on storage or inverters. Another trend that could be observed at SNEC that many companies now get their feet wet in the entire solar product portfolio. This was true for well-esteemed players of the solar market, such as GoodWe, which presented a range of BIPV options including solar tiles, or Jinko which has aside from its modules also storage and inverters on offer. But also new market entrants don’t hold back widening their product portfolio.

German redox flow battery manufacturer Prolux Solutions, a unit of Swiss building supplier Arbonia, has developed a new residential storage system with a capacity of 10 kWh.
It claims that the STORAC 4/10 battery has a charging and discharging capacity of 4 kW and a peak power of 5 kW. It is designed to be coupled with PV systems in homes with a high consumption profile.
The AC-coupled storage device can provide emergency power and can be cascaded. Its depth of discharge is 100%, according to the manufacturer. The battery features a Modbus RTU (RS485) interface and does not use rare earth minerals, says the company. It reportedly consists of easily recyclable metal and plastic.
Prolux Solutions says that all components can be repaired indefinitely. It notes that the vanadium electrolyte also retains at least 95% of its capacity, even after 20 years, so it can be reused indefinitely.
The company develops its storage systems in Germany and manufactures them in Stribro, Czech Republic. The plant has up to 700 employees.
