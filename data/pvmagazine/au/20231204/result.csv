https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/04/aussie-green-hydrogen-a-blueprint-to-slash-carbon-emissions-and-yield-billions/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",Aussie green hydrogen: a blueprint to slash carbon emissions and yield billions,"For this to become a reality, there must be a strategic overhaul in Australia’s green hydrogen industry, with an emphasis on pivoting from primarily exporting carbon-neutral fuel to leveraging it for the local production of traditionally carbon-intensive goods earmarked for export. The production of steel, shipping and aviation fuels, fertilisers, explosives and cement alone, account for over a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.
By concentrating on local production, not only can Australia reduce its own emissions through renewable energy, but also significantly impact the emissions of our trading partners. The substitution of Australian-made products created using locally produced green hydrogen stands to massively slash Australia’s upstream emissions.
The global demand for these environmentally friendly products reaches into the trillions of dollars. Critics often downplay Australia’s emissions efforts, citing the country’s mere 1.5 per cent share in global emissions. However, Australia’s abundant land, sunlight and wind resources position us uniquely – to generate enough renewable energy to produce green hydrogen. This green hydrogen can be used in the production of products that other countries are producing with large carbon footprints. Australia can displace those producers and massively reduce emissions occurring in other countries.
The sight of wind turbines for me signifies hope. No longer will other countries rely on Australian coal and LNG to manufacture steel, fertilisers, aviation and shipping gas and ammonia, thus significantly reducing their greenhouse gas emissions produced from burning Australian-sourced coal or used in the production of steel from our iron ore.
Steel production globally is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Australia supplies a substantial share of iron ore exports (over 55%) and is the world’s largest exporter of metallurgical coal, we are therefore in a unique position to impact a significant portion of global emissions through the provision of green iron, green ammonia, green eFuels, green mining explosives, and green cement.
To fully realise this potential, regulators must play an important role in implementing pro-renewable rules. Mandatory usage of eFuels for all ships visiting Australia, or setting quotas for locally produced steel manufactured with green hydrogen are examples of regulatory initiatives that can drive the transition. Acknowledging the capital-intensive nature of green hydrogen production, regulatory support becomes crucial for scaling up these efforts.
One area with immense potential for improvement is the production of ammonia. About 176 million tons of ammonia is currently produced globally per year, primarily for use as fertiliser. The century-old process involves stripping hydrogen from natural gas using steam, emitting CO2 as a by-product. The hydrogen is combined with nitrogen from the air at high pressure and temperatures of hundreds of degrees Celsius. Green ammonia, however, utilises renewable energy to extract hydrogen from water, eliminating the CO2 by-product and aligning with sustainable practices.
The application of green ammonia extends beyond fertilisers, with liquid ammonia being considered a potential fuel shipping, which is responsible for three per cent of global emissions.
The versatility of green hydrogen is further emphasised in the production of eFuels, which can power vehicles, trucks, and aircraft. This involves combining green hydrogen with recaptured carbon dioxide through synthesis, often in methanol form. Methanol can directly power vehicles or be further refined, even transformed into gasoline through methanol-to-gasoline processes, serving as a substitute for petrol and diesel.
Another promising avenue for emission reduction lies in the cement sector. By incorporating green hydrogen as a reducing agent in raw material blends, clinker content can be reduced, potentially leading to CO2 emission reductions of up to 50%.
Australia stands on the cusp of a transformative era where embracing green hydrogen can spearhead both environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. By targeting industries responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions, such as steel, shipping, aviation fuels, fertilisers, explosives, and cement, Australia not only mitigates its own emissions but also wields influence over the emissions trajectory globally.
This strategic pivot, reinforced by forward-thinking regulatory measures and innovative solutions like green ammonia and eFuels, can position Australia as a global leader in emissions reduction. The potential to simultaneously contribute to a greener planet and generate substantial economic rewards underscores the significance of seizing this opportunity for a sustainable and prosperous future – the time to act is now.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/04/agl-to-put-nickel-hydrogen-battery-tech-to-test-at-torrens-island/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",AGL to put nickel-hydrogen battery tech to test at Torrens Island,"AGL and United State-headquartered energy technology company SLB have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to pilot a nickel-hydrogen battery – expected to be the first of its kind in Australia – at AGL’s Torrens Island site in Adelaide.
SLB will supply AGL with a 180 kW/360 kWh nickel-hydrogen battery for the two-year pilot program which is expected to commence in 2025. The pilot project will test the operational performance of the technology, with the battery providing storage for on-site power use.
Travis Hughes, general manager of AGL’s Energy Hubs unit, said nickel-hydrogen battery technology is an example of the battery technologies the company is exploring as part of its broader ambition to add up to 5.9 GW of firming capacity to its portfolio by 2035.
“This is the first new battery technology AGL is piloting since it established an emerging battery technology team,” he said, noting that nickel-hydrogen technology could be a potential alternative to the lithium-ion solutions that currently dominate the stationary energy storage market.
“Nickel-hydrogen batteries have been identified as a technology which may offer different benefits when compared with lithium-ion batteries such as the potential for a longer cycle life, the potential to withstand a greater temperature operating range – meaning more potential applications and reduced need for cooling – and the potential cost benefits associated with these advantages,” he said.
“Exploring and testing innovative technologies as they are developed and bringing them to market at scale is critical as we try to accelerate our efforts to transition our business over the coming decade.”
While the Torrens Island pilot is expected to be the first deployment of a nickel-hydrogen battery in Australia, the technology is not new. Nickel-hydrogen batteries consist of a stack of electrodes inside a pressurised gas tank. The cathode is nickel hydroxide and the anode is hydrogen. When the battery is charging, a catalytic reaction generates hydrogen gas. During discharge, the hydrogen oxidises and converts back to water.
The technology has been used for decades in aerospace applications but the use of expensive platinum catalysts has ruled out the use of the batteries in grid-scale scenarios.
SLB said that has now changed with California-based battery startup EnerVenue having made a breakthrough in catalyst design, swapping out the platinum catalyst for an inexpensive nickel-molybdenum-cobalt alloy catalyst.
EnerVenue said its nickel-hydrogen batteries can last for 30,000 charge cycles, are fireproof, and outperform lithium-ion batteries on a number of key metrics for energy storage at the large scale.
If the potential benefits of the nickel-hydrogen battery are verified during the pilot, the next step for AGL could be to explore the development of a grid-scale project using the same technology.
SLB Vice President of Energy Storage Oktay Sancar said the Torrens Island pilot project will help de-risk the technology by augmenting the solutions with advanced system design, integration and deployment optimisation.
“This type of collaboration will set the stage for the next generation of utility-scale applications,” he said.
The announcement follows the opening of AGL’s 250 MW/250 MWh battery energy storage system at Torrens in August 2023. That system uses lithium iron phosphate technology.
AGL aims to add about 12 GW of generation and firming by the end of 2035 – comprised of up to 6.3 GW of renewables and 5.9 GW of firming.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/04/rio-approves-new-solar-and-battery-storage-project-on-cape-york/,"INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",Rio approves new solar and battery storage project on Cape York,"Rio Tinto has provided the green light for a new 12.4 MW solar farm and 8.8 MW/2.1 MWh battery energy storage system that will connect to the existing mini-grid at Weipa on Queensland’s western Cape York Peninsula, helping power the miner’s bauxite operation and processing facilities as well as the surrounding community.
Rio said early works have already begun on the new solar farm, which is expected to be operational by early 2025. Once completed, the Amrun solar farm will provide about 21 GWh of renewable power annually.
The new solar plant and battery storage system will complement the existing 5.6 MW of solar and 4 MWh of battery power built for Rio’s Weipa operations and the local electricity network since 2015.
Shona Markham, general manager of Rio’s Weipa Operations, said the new solar farm and battery storage system is an important milestone for the Amrun operation and will contribute to the company’s commitment to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions.
“The Amrun solar farm will be one of three Weipa Operations solar stations, which will together provide 18 MW of solar generation capacity to our mines and the Weipa town,” she said.
“This project helps us make inroads towards our ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operations.”
Scottish-headquartered energy solutions provider Aggreko has been contracted to build, own, and operate the solar farm to supply renewable electricity to the mine operations, in addition to its current contract to supply electricity generated from an existing diesel power station.
The project will help Rio reduce Scope 2 emissions at its Weipa operations by up to 10%. Once operational, the solar farm and battery storage system are expected to reduce Amrun’s diesel electricity consumption by 37% or approximately 5.5 million litres per year. This will reduce annual CO2 emissions by approximately 14,000 tonnes.
Combined with the existing Weipa renewable power generation network, the solar farms are expected to reduce Weipa operations’ diesel consumption by an estimated 10 million litres per year.
The new solar farm and battery storage system are part of Rio’s global decarbonisation strategy and ongoing efforts to reduce emissions at its Pacific bauxite, alumina and aluminium operations.
Rio aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 across its global operations, with approximately $11.87 billion (USD 7.5 billion) planned to be spent on decarbonisation projects.

Acciona Energia Managing Director Brett Wickham said the solar farm will create a peak workforce of 350 jobs and inject $150 million back into the local economy during the 18-month construction period.
“Acciona Energia have been working closely with the supply chain as part of our local content strategy which will source at least $150 million in work from local companies and suppliers around Gladstone and the Sunshine State to help build the project,” he said.
The entire output of the PV plant, being developed about 20 kilometres northwest of the industrial centre of Gladstone, is linked to a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland’s publicly owned energy company Stanwell Corporation.
Stanwell plans to use all the energy produced at Aldoga to help power the proposed $12.4 billion (USD 8.47 billion) Central Queensland Hydrogen Hub (CQ-H2) project which would initially involve the installation of up to 640 MW of electrolysers to produce green hydrogen for domestic use and export.
The CQ-H2 project, being built on a 236-hectare site alongside the solar project, is now in the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) stage. Commercial operation for CQ-H2 is slated for 2028.
“The Aldoga Solar Farm will be a catalyst for a vibrant hydrogen industry here in Gladstone and we’re proud to finally be getting construction underway,” Wickham said, noting that the project underlines Acconia’s commitment to Australia as a strategic country to accelerate its growth.
The company is also building the 1,026 MW MacIntyre Wind Farm near Warwick in southwest Queensland and developing the adjacent 1,000 MW Herries Range Wind Farm, an expansion of the MacIntyre Wind Precinct that will double the precinct’s total generation capacity to 2 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/04/massive-solar-array-installed-at-sydney-shopping-centre/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",Massive solar array installed at Sydney shopping centre,"The freshly installed solar rooftop powerplant at Narellan Town Centre shopping complex has been officially launched by Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen. According to CEP.Energy, the PV array now generates enough energy to provide just over one-third of the total energy consumed by the shopping centre.
The project first kicked off towards the end of 2020, when the owners of Australia’s largest privately owned shopping centre inked a deal with CEP.Energy with a 30-year lease agreement. CEP.Energy agreed to invest up to $40 million (USD 26.6 million) to install, own and operate the embedded solar and battery network. In 2021, CEP.Energy engaged renewable infrastructure specialist RACV Solar to supply and install stage one works now completed.
In this first phase, a 2.6 MW solar system has been installed across 12,577 square metres of rooftop with what RACV Solar has said are 5,624 Trina 500 W PV modules.
In 2021, RACV Solar said the project was also to involve 22 Sungrow CX range inverters and 4 MW/10 MWh CATL and Delta battery energy storage systems (BESS).
According to CEP.Energy, there are 12 of these batteries on onsite, which is equivalent to 800 residential batteries, holding the capacity to feed enough power back into the grid to supply electricity to more than 1900 homes. The power generated is enough to supply 35% of the electricity consumed by the shopping centre.
In announcing the completion of this first phase, CEP.Energy Chief Executive Officer Peter Wright said, “We now look forward to working on stage two at Narellan Town Centre, which has the potential to deliver an enhanced solar system totalling 10 MW, and increased battery storage of up to 20 MW.”
When CEP. Energy announced the project in 2020, the company said that when complete, it will include a 50,000 square metre array of solar modules delivering 10 MW of renewable energy supported by a 20 MWh battery storage system.
The Narellan Town Centre lies between two major roadways in Sydney’s airport corridor and is owned by Dart West Retail in a partnership between the Vitocco and Perich families. Besides 220 retail outlets and a cinema complex, the shopping centre also houses 3,000 customer car parking spaces.
Herein lies a future challenge for the large-scale shopping facility – if all these car parking spaces are to be electrified, the shopping centre will need vastly more power production to maintain the same ratio of renewable power production to consumption as has been achieved with this first solar array. This will be a growing concern since Dart West Retail aims to expand the shopping centre from 76,000 to 135,000 square metres over the next 10 years.
Electric vehicle charging facilities at shopping centres elsewhere in Australia are moving forward as charging points draw customers, reduce local pollution levels, and meet climate change targets. This year, Ampol announced it would install fast charging stations across Australia, partnering with Mirvac to roll out 72 charging stations at retail precincts from the end of this year.
Shopping centre conglomerate Vicinity also recently announced that it will install electric vehicle charging infrastructure at up to 30 locations within the next two years. In Sydney, Vicinity owns Chatswood Chase, the Queen Victoria Building, the Strand, and other similarly large centres elsewhere in Australia.
Shopping centres can, of course, also reduce their transport electricity demand with the provision of more sustainable transport options such as public transport options and increased cycling infrastructure in collaboration with municipal and state governments and public transport providers.
Either way, renewable energy providers like CEP.Energy have a greatly expanding market to look forward to.
CEP.Energy has already declared it wants to install gigawatts of solar and battery storage around Australia by 2025. Its partner in the Narellan Town Centre project, RACV Solar, is the photovoltaic wing of the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria, which has an obvious incentive to produce more power for its members as the transport transition inexorably progresses.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/04/australia-backs-global-renewable-energy-boost/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",Australia backs global renewable energy boost,"Governments of 118 countries have pledged to triple renewable energy generation capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 as part of a push to cut the share of fossil fuels in the world’s energy production.
The signatories agreed to triple worldwide installed renewable energy generation capacity from the current installed capacity of about 3,400 GW to at least 11,000 GW by the end of the decade and to double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements from around 2% to more than 4% every year until 2030. The Global Decarbonization Accelerator (GDA) initiative also calls for “the phase down of unabated coal power” and an end to the financing of new coal-fired power plants.
“This can and will help transition the world away from unabated coal,” said Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates’ COP28 summit president.
The International Energy Agency has estimated that tripling of renewable energy generation capacity has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about one billion tonnes every year.
Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen said other major energy exporting countries including the United States, Canada and Norway have also committed to initiative, adding that “for emissions to go down around the world, a big international push is needed.”
“We know that renewables are the cleanest and cheapest form of energy, and that energy efficiency can also help drive down bills and emissions,” he said.
The pledge follows on from last month’s commitment by the Australian government to fast-track the federally supported expansion of domestic renewable energy capacity to 32 GW.
“Australia has the resources and the smarts to help supply the world with clean energy technologies to drive down those emissions while spurring new Australian industry,” Bowen said.
Greenpeace Australia Pacific head Shiva Gounden agreed Australia is well positioned to reap the economic benefits of the green energy transformation but warned without concurrent action to phase out coal and gas, this latest commitment is just dealing with one side of the equation.
“The Australian government continues to drag its heels on fossil fuels,” he said, noting that new data compiled by Greenpeace shows that if all the coal and gas projects currently undergoing federal approvals went ahead they would release a 22 billion tonne emissions bomb, severely undermining global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.
“The science is crystal clear that to keep 1.5 degrees alive, we must keep fossil fuels in the ground,” Gounden said.
Bowen and Assistant Minister Jenny McAllister are set to land in Dubai this week to attend the COP28 summit.

Hanwha Qcells, a unit of Hanhwa Group, said it will close its 3.5 GW panel manufacturing facility in Eumseong, South Korea.
“This decision has been taken as a result of Qcells’ efforts to optimise module production capabilities, and in response to a stagnant domestic solar market in Korea,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The total volume of solar installations in Korea has been decreasing over the past three years, from 4.7 GW in 2020, to 3.4 GW in 2022, and a further decline is expected in 2023.”
The company said it will continue to invest in its flagship manufacturing facility in Jincheon, South Korea, where it still produces TOPCon products and operates a perovskite tandem pilot line.
“The shutdown of Eumseong will have a minimal impact on Qcells’ global module supply capabilities,” the spokesperson said. “The company’s manufacturing capacity has expanded a great deal, and current module production capability is large enough to cover our global markets.”
Hanwha Qcells said it offered voluntary redundancy packages to its employees.
“The company has not set a target number on this,” the spokesperson said. “Those staff that wish to remain in Qcells’ employ will be absorbed into the Jincheon operation, where the additional manpower will boost TOPCon and Tandem line operations.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/04/220-million-bailout-so-griffin-coal-mine-can-continue-till-mid-2026/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,"DECEMBER 4, 2023",$220 million bailout so WA coal mine can continue to mid-2026,"The Western Australian government has issued a statement saying that the $220 million (USD 146 million) it is allocating to Griffin coal mine near the town of Collie is necessary to protect local jobs and keep the electricity system stable. The government said that the mine is at risk of sudden closure, despite the $39.3 million that the state government has already pumped into the mine over the past 12 months.
Premier Roger Cook admitted, “It is disappointing that the private companies involved in Griffin have been unable to find a commercial solution to their problems, despite significant support from the government.”
In support of transitioning off fossil fuels and onto more future-proof cleantech industries in the area, the Cook government has already allocated $660 million to sustainable enterprise. Among other goals, this funding should make up for job and power production losses as the Griffin mine inevitably closes after having posted losses for years and already entered receivership.
Cleantech industries emerging in the area include one of Australia’s biggest batteries in Collie, which will create 500 construction jobs.
The Western Australian Premier said about this latest bailout that a sudden closure of the Griffin mine would see “hundreds of workers lose their jobs overnight and put at risk the stability of our electricity system,” without revealing exactly how many jobs would be affected or how much power would theoretically still be required.
In September just past the Western Australian government awarded contracts for its 500 MW/2,000 MWh big battery in Collie and the 200 MW/800 MWh extension to the existing Kwinana battery. Another large renewable energy project for the production of green hydrogen is currently being put through a feasibility study, which was announced in April 2022. In May this year, Perth-based company International Graphite selected the preferred site for its proposed Collie graphite battery anode material (BAM) manufacturing facility. This company plans to deliver a feasibility study for the facility in the third quarter of 2024.
The Griffin mine provides coal to industry as well as to the privately-owned Bluewaters Power Station. According to the state government, WA’s electricity system will have the capacity to remain reliable and affordable without requiring power from Bluewaters once new cleantech power generation and storage projects come online. Overall, the government aims to retire all state-owned coal-fired power stations by 2029.
In its statement about the latest funding shot for the failing coal mine, the state government assured that measures and funding to diversify Collie’s economy “will ensure there are a range of industrial jobs available in the town ahead of June 2026.”
Energy Minister Johnston said, “It is critical we support Griffin Coal at this time to ensure a stable transition to a higher renewable energy system.”
The minister, who is stepping down from cabinet and will not seek re-election in the 2025 state election, has been a strong advocate of the “Just Transition” for a new future for the coal town of Collie and a supporter of cleantech industries.
“Western Australia is in the middle of an unprecedented energy transition, with growing energy demand,” Johnston said in the government’s statement on the bailout.

When pv magazine reached out to Professor Ray Wills, managing director of Future Smart Strategies and adjunct professor at the University of Western Australia, for a statement on the bailout, he noted: “There isn’t growing energy demand on the SWIS,” referring to the state’s main electricity network, the South West Interconnected System.
“Since about 2021, growth has actually levelled off, and it is about to level off even more because every year we are putting on more solar,” he said. “Monthly generation growth is set to peak because the amount of solar we’re putting on rooftops is really having an impact.”
In October just past, the government published a statement saying that the expected demand for renewable energy supplied through the SWIS will increase significantly – considering the requirements of existing industrial users and the potential growth of new industries like hydrogen and critical minerals.
“Initial modelling suggests that if 7.2 GW of new industrial loads were to connect to the SWIS by 2042, the level of electricity required could grow to be five times greater than it was in 2022,” the government said.
Wills, however, noted, “$220 million seems to be a lot of money if all they are going to do is burn it in a coal-fired power station.” Nevertheless, he acknowledged the difficulty in managing the energy transition.
“Having said all of that, I fully accept that there needs to be a just transition and a great effort made to ensure that people are given new opportunities,” he said.
Giving workers opportunities has been a strong stated goal of the outgoing Energy Minister. In announcing his stepping down he said, “I joined Labor because I know only Labor can make a difference for working people.”
Johnston has said he will serve out the rest of his term as the member for Cannington to avoid the need for a by-election.
Commenting on the outgoing minister, Wills said: “Overall, he’s done a great job. He’s been cautious and conservative, but a sure set of hands. Would I have preferred he was more adventurous? Absolutely. But overall he’s been a great minister.”
Meanwhile, the town of Collie finds itself at a crucial turning point. “We all support a just transition, but the money could’ve been better utilised in a targeted way,” surmised Will.

British oil and gas company BP announced today in a press release that it had come to an agreement with UK-based PV producer Lightsource BP to purchase the remaining 50.03% of Lightsource BP’s shares it does not already own.
Once the deal closes, which is expected for mid-2024, BP will control all of Lightsource BP. The company paid £254 million ($321 million) for the stake, according to the announcement.
BP said it will scale up Lightsource BP’s PV operations with the acquisition and will “target double digit equity returns.”
“BP intends to use Lightsource BP’s world-class capabilities as a developer of cost-competitive utility-scale onshore renewable power to help meet its own demand for low carbon power,” the company said.
“This integration is expected to underpin and de-risk delivery of BP’s targets for its transition growth engines – in hydrogen, EV charging and biofuels as well as in power trading.”
BP executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath said the purchase will allow for BP to meet the increasing demand for low-carbon power from “transition growth engines.”
BP first invested $200 million in Lightsource – subsequently named Lightsource BP – in 2017 for a 43% stake in the company. In 2022 BP bumped up its share to 50%.
Lightsource BP completed its first utility-scale solar installation in 2016. Since then, the company has launched more than 16 renewable energy projects in the United States alone, with Lightsource BP announcing last year it wanted to pursue a project in New Zealand.
