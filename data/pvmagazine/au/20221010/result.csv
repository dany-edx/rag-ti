Forrest has just placed a very large bet on green hydrogen through his Fortescue Future Industries company. It’s no surprise Forrest has hit back, calling Musk “just a businessman” rather than a “real climate avenger”.
The stoush might sound tabloid. But at its heart is serious debate about the world’s industrial future. Battery-electric cars have already proven their worth, whereas hydrogen fuel-cell cars are still emerging. But green hydrogen isn’t a one-trick pony – it can replace fossil fuels in many high-emissions industrial processes, such as making steel or cement.
As we accelerate towards a green future, will batteries or fuel cells power the world? The short answer is, we’ll need both.

Musk and his company Tesla are backing batteries and battery-powered electric vehicles. And Musk is doing this at colossal scale, with his large-scale gigafactories churning out millions of lithium-ion battery packs to power battery-electric vehicles. Other corporations such as LG and Samsung are following suit, rolling out their own gigafactories.
By contrast, Forrest is heavily backing green hydrogen. To make it a reality, he envisages vast solar arrays across Australia’s sun-drenched north and west to power the electrolysis process which splits water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. In a fuel cell car, green hydrogen once again combines with oxygen and produces electricity.
While Teslas and many other battery-electric cars are now seen on roads around the world, fuel cell cars have had limited appeal to date. While Japan’s Toyota and South Korea’s Hyundai have backed them, they’re a rarity in other nations. This, Forrest believes, can change as green hydrogen arrives in large volumes and costs fall.
Musk does have a point. What, he asks, is the point of producing clean energy to produce hydrogen to produce electricity to propel a car? Why not just store the green electricity in a battery and use it directly?

While this truth might limit the uptake of fuel-cell vehicles in the medium term, Forrest sees green hydrogen as a miracle commodity and a long-term prospect. Speaking last year, Forrest said green hydrogen could become the biggest industry in the world, boasting revenues of AU$18.5 trillion by 2050.
How? Green hydrogen is versatile. Unlike batteries, green hydrogen can replace oil, coal and gas in virtually all their uses – including as fuel in fuel cell electric vehicles. Green hydrogen can produce green steel, green cement, green glass, green plastics and even green fertiliser (through green ammonia).
This is the real reason green hydrogen matters. It makes total fossil fuel substitution possible, as I argue in my forthcoming book.
Forrest and his green hydrogen company are focused on green hydrogen as a universal substitute, rather than just fuel for vehicles.
This changes how we should view the hydrogen-battery debate. While battery-electric technology has taken a commanding lead in consumer cars, batteries are much less effective in powering heavy transport such as trucks. That’s because you would need immensely heavy batteries to get enough range and power. By contrast, the ability to store large volumes of hydrogen means fuel cells may well be needed to power trucks, trains, boats and ships.
Giant industrial economies to Australia’s north like such as South Korea, Japan and China are increasingly seeing green hydrogen as a way to decarbonise. The technique should also produce major water savings, given the water used in electrolysis is a fraction of that needed to make fossil fuel use viable through mining, cooling power stations and fracking for gas or oil.
While these nations will be able to produce some of their own green hydrogen using water, solar and wind, they are also likely to look for overseas suppliers such as Australia, given our vast solar and wind resources.

But there are cost and scale challenges to overcome, notably the cost of electrolysers. Recent research suggests this bottleneck is significant, but could be overcome with government and industry backing.
Costs should drop rapidly in the next few years. By the end of this year, the world will have its first gigawatt of electrolysis capacity. By 2030, according to a new International Energy Agency report, it could be between 134 and 200 gigawatts of capacity if all planned projects proceed. As of 2021, 38 gigawatts of capacity were planned in Australia. Some of these won’t proceed, of course. But many will.
Green hydrogen is not a direct competitor with light battery-electric cars. It’s complementary – and it will open up many new urgently needed pathways to net zero in hard-to-decarbonise sectors. So Musk is wrong about hydrogen. But he’s right about batteries – we’ll need them too.
For our part, Australia has everything to gain from accelerating the green hydrogen industrial future. It’s entirely feasible we could have a vast export industry to take up the slack as coal, oil and gas decline. And we’ll benefit from our rich deposits of minerals needed in batteries, too.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/10/line-hydrogen-partners-with-blue-cap-on-gigawatt-scale-green-energy-solution/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 10, 2022",Line Hydrogen partners with Blue Cap on gigawatt-scale green energy solution,"Line Hydrogen on Monday announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Blue Cap Mining to develop a 100% renewable energy solution to replace fossil fuel-based power generation at the resource company’s Lord Byron mining operation in Western Australia’s Goldfields region.
The project, slated to begin development in early 2023, will see the Brisbane-based Line Hydrogen design, develop and operate a large-scale renewable energy generation facility and green hydrogen production plant at the Lord Byron mine site about 250 kilometres northeast of Kalgoorlie.
Line Hydrogen did not disclose the make-up of the renewable energy generation facility but said it would be capable of “producing circa 49 GWh of power each year” and would be used to power the mining operation and make green hydrogen for use on-site.
The company said the green hydrogen will be used to power the Lord Byron gold mining operation during non-renewable energy generation periods and will also provide a replacement for diesel-fuelled activities on the site including mining and processing equipment, generators and vehicles.
Blue Cap Mining managing director Ashley Fraser said he expects the project will deliver significant economic and environmental benefits, including potentially lowering the company’s cost of production “quite significantly”.
The incorporation of renewable power and green hydrogen in the mine’s operations is expected to displace about 13.2 million litres of diesel per annum that would typically be consumed in the course of normal operations.
The combined renewable power generation, green hydrogen and mining operations are expected to result in an additional 150 full-time jobs in the region.
Fraser said the pre-feasibility phase of the project will be completed by the end of 2022, with bankable feasibility status milestones set for 2023 and construction likely to begin within an 18-month period.
Line Hydrogen executive chairman Brendan James said the partnership with Blue Cap Mining is a significant step for the green hydrogen hopeful.
“For Line Hydrogen, the partnership provides guaranteed offtake,” he said. “It will be an important starting point for Line Hydrogen providing commercial-scale green hydrogen to the WA Goldfields and represents a significant step towards achieving our goal to support regional and remote industries to access renewable energy sources.”
The project is the latest for Line Hydrogen which is also looking to develop a green hydrogen production facility in Tasmania’s north. It is expected the proposed $100 million project will produce 1,500 kilograms of green hydrogen a day using solar power as the energy source. The company earlier this year signed a term sheet with Climate Capital’s Bell Bay Solar Farm to build up to 5 MW capacity in George Town.

Located about 150 kilometres east of Perth, the facility will comprise 128 MW of solar coupled with a 55 MW/220 MWh battery energy storage system and will connected to Western Australia’s islanded grid, the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
FTC said the integration of a DC-coupled battery energy storage system with a large-scale PV power plant will enable additional flexibility in plant operation, allowing the facility to also support the wholesale energy market (WEM) during peak demand periods.
GPG chief business development officer Pedro Serrano said the project will use FTC Solar’s two-in-portrait (2P) Voyager+ tracker solution designed for large format modules. The US-based engineering company said the system offers improved installation speeds, high slope tolerance, reduced part count, high energy density, and a DC collections advantage.
“We’re pleased to be utilising FTC Solar’s tracker technology on this important project,” Serrano said. “The Cunderdin project will be the largest of its kind in Australia, and the high energy density and highly constructible design of FTC’s 2P Voyager solution will lend itself well in this development.”
Construction of the project is expected to start later this year, with commercial operation anticipated to commence in the first quarter of 2024. The asset will operate on a merchant basis.
FTC chief commercial officer Patrick Cook said the project is a notable achievement for the company as it continues to expand its presence in Australia.
“Over the past 18 months, we have continued to expand our presence in Australia with orders and deliveries of more than 240 MW of trackers,” he said. “This project represents our 23rd project in Australia, and our largest single project in the country to date, with another impressive customer.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/10/gunner-targets-world-changing-projects-for-northern-australia/,"EMPLOYMENT,HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 10, 2022",Gunner targets ‘world-changing’ projects for northern Australia,"Months after stepping down as Northern Territory (NT) chief minister, Michael Gunner has accepted the role as head of renewable energy company Fortescue Future Industries’ (FFI) new northern Australia team.
Gunner, who resigned as chief minister in May, said his new role would see him focussed on creating renewable energy jobs across the NT and northern Western Australia that would bring about “world-changing, economy building projects”.
“Territorians are keen for the renewable energy sector to take off and the employment intensive industries that renewables need,” he said.
“(FFI) is a massive global company with one ambition: create green energy sustainably and commercially that ends our reliance on fossil fuel. FFI are at the starting line for world-changing, economy building mega projects to create green energy in WA’s northwest, and in the Territory.”
FFI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Australian-based iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group, has repeatedly declared the company’s goal is to become the world’s leading, integrated, fully renewable energy and green products company.
Its plans include establishing a global portfolio of renewable green hydrogen and green ammonia projects capable of producing 15 million tons per year of green hydrogen by 2030, rising to 50 million tons per year in the decade thereafter.

Gunner, who remained on the backbench until July, will start as the company’s head of Northern Australia in November, in accordance with ministerial guidelines that forbid a former minister from taking up work relating to any of their previous portfolios for six months.
Fortescue chair Andrew Forrest said Gunner was the right man for the job and would aid the company’s vision for FFI in northern Australia.
“We see enormous potential in the Northern Territory, with abundant wind and solar energy, and a community enthusiastic to embrace renewable energy and the employment intensive industries that come with it,” he said.
The confirmation of Gunner’s appointment is the second major announcement made in recent days that involves the renewable energy industry in the NT.

On Friday, Australian technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes was named chairman of clean energy start-up Sun Cable, which is seeking to secure funds for a proposed $30 billion-plus (USD 19.3 billion) solar power export project.
Singapore-based Sun Cable plans to supply solar power from the NT to Singapore and eventually Indonesia through the world’s longest subsea high voltage cable, linked to a 17-20 GW solar farm, as well as an energy storage facility of up to 42 GWh.
“Australia can and should be a global leader in clean energy exports,” said Cannon-Brookes, who has been an investor in Sun Cable through his private firm Grok Ventures since November 2019.
FFI founder Forrest is also backing the project, formally called the Asia-Australia Power Link, through his private firm, Squadron Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/10/solar-powered-synthetic-kerosene-could-be-vital-bridge-to-zero-emission-flying/,"RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,EUROPE,WORLD",MAX HALL,"OCTOBER 10, 2022",Solar-powered synthetic kerosene could be vital bridge to zero-emission flying,"From pv magazine Global
The European Parliament has released a new report on the critical role to be played by synthetic kerosene in achieving sustainable flying.
Synthetic kerosene is a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from renewables-powered green hydrogen, which offers greater carbon emission reduction potential than the advanced biofuels which complete the range of SAFs. With the EU’s European Green Deal targeting aviation emission reductions of 89% by mid century, SAFs are set to be a bridge technology before hydrogen-fuelled and electric aircraft become a genuine proposition, according to the report commissioned by the parliament’s committee on transport and tourism.
SAFs offer no emission reductions when burned in aircraft, but they offer emissions savings during their production, from the carbon absorption of their feedstock material in the case of advanced biofuels.
The “Investment scenario and roadmap for achieving aviation green deal objectives by 2050” study envisages hydrogen and electric aircraft as holding the long-term answer. However, it also says that they are unlikely to be widely available before the 2030-40 period, which is “too late to be the main methods for decarbonising aviation.”
In fact, industry insiders told the paper’s authors that electric aircraft would be more likely to enter operation in 2035, rather than the 2030 date suggested. There was a similar lag in expectation, to 2040, for hydrogen-powered flight. Until more advanced tech becomes available, SAFs offer a more immediate emissions-reduction option, as they can be mixed with the kerosene that powers jet aircraft today.
The European Commission, under its proposed RefuelEU Aviation regulation, wants the bloc to mandate a minimum 2% of SAFs in jet aircraft fuel in 2025, rising to 63% in mid century. Recognising the greater emission reduction value of synthetic kerosene over cheaper advanced biofuels, the EU executive said at least 0.7% of all SAFs in the bloc in 2030 should be synthetic fuel options, rising to 28% in 2050.
The 149-page report noted regulators will have to encourage the production of synthetic kerosene to avoid airlines instead opting for advanced biofuels and must also encourage home-grown production, given most of the SAFs available in the EU at present are imported. That regulatory role will be even more important to persuade the air travel industry to invest in SAFs now, rather than hold off until they are replaced by hydrogen and electric aircraft, the study added.
To achieve the technological leaps required for low-emission aviation – including new aircraft designs and more efficient air traffic management measures – the report made policy recommendations including the use of income from aviation emissions trading, and from any future aviation fuel tax, to support R&D.
The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation established by UN body the International Civil Aviation Organization should be brought more in line with the EU Emissions Trading System, to focus on more than offsetting flight-related emissions, according to the report. The document’s authors said the EU should drive SAF production and the availability of hydrogen infrastructure and should regulate SAFs to encourage investment and the prioritisation of their production methods for aviation purposes.
The EU taxonomy of sustainable investments – which was controversially amended to include gas and nuclear this year – should also be “carefully” extended to include investment in sustainable flying, according to the report. The report estimated that €50.4 billion (AU$96.9b) must be spent to develop the necessary tech and a further €378 billion (AU$576b)to deploy it. With fuel savings of an estimated €395 billion (AU$602b) available to mid century, however, the total bill would come in at a net €33 billion, according to the paper.
