The company says the capital will enable it to connect distributed energy sources via virtual power plants,  diversify its retail presence, and develop utility-scale generation assets. 
Hanwha Energy already has development approval to build two solar farms in New South Wales, including a 43 MW (AC) project at Gregadoo near Wagga Wagga, and 120 MW (AC) solar + 30 MW / 60 MWh battery at Jindera, close to Albury. 
Hanwha Energy Australia’s Managing Director, Tae Hong Kim, called the investment a “clear endorsement of the value of our business model.”
“The capital injection will enable us to significantly expand our presence in utility-scale projects, grow our retail and distributed energy customer base, and continue to develop technology platforms to connect Australian consumers with reliable, affordable, renewable power,” he added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/27/google-to-use-australian-power-tracing-tech-in-sydney-trial/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022",Google to use Australian power tracing tech in Sydney trial,"Sydney-based company Enosi is working with technology giant Google and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) to advance energy accounting technology to certify 24/7 carbon-free energy.
The last years have seen much talk of companies committing to 100% renewable energy – which, while admirable, almost never means what it says. 

While Google has been matching 100% of its operational electricity use with renewable purchases since 2017, the company only used ‘carbon free energy’ 66% of 2021 – meaning renewables actually powered its data centres two thirds of the time, while coal and other fossil generation was still consumed for the difference.
Following on from this discovery, Google set itself a new target of reaching 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030 and is enlisting Australian companies and research institutes to help it get there.
It will be part of an EnergyTag demonstration led by UNSW’s Cooperative Research Centre, which looks to progress time-based renewable energy certificates.
As part of the trial, Enosi’s PowerTracer software will track clean energy from its source to Google’s Sydney operations and provide real-world case studies to the UNSW Research Centre for analysis.
The question of what constitutes green power use is being examined around the world with both the US and Europe moving towards 24/7 time matching – that is, ensuring renewable power is actually used at the time it was generated. 
This logical definition is far from the benchmark applied in Australia, where green power use is recognised with certificates which don’t impose limits on either their time of use nor location.
“We’ve separated the characteristics of energy from the energy itself,” Enosi founder and CEO, Steve Hoy, previously told pv magazine Australia.
Aside from being misleading, Hoy believes Australia’s lax standard could prove extremely problematic for its burgeoning green hydrogen export industry.
In 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order committing the government to use “100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030, at least half of which will be locally supplied clean energy to meet 24/7 demand.” More broadly, the US is targeting a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.
Meanwhile, by 2027 the European Union is proposing hydrogen projects must match the electricity they consume with renewable generation on an hourly basis. In the UK, that time window drops to 30 minutes– meaning to be certified as green, electrolysers really can only run when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining.

As part of the deal, Edify will deliver the Koorangie Energy Storage System (KESS), a new lithium-ion battery to be located in the Gannawarra Shire Council and connected to AusNet’s 220kV transmission network.
The contract appears to fit in with today’s announcement from the Victorian government about its target for 2.6 GW of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030, and 6.3 GW by 2035. 
In that announcement, the Victorian government said it would invest $119 million investment “to support a 125 MW big battery and grid forming inverter in the Murray Renewable Energy Zone, between Bendigo and Red Cliffs.”
While Edify is not mentioned in the government announcement, it appears to be the same project.
Edify says the objective of its Koorangie Energy Storage System is “to augment the renewable hosting capacity of the Murray River REZ by up to 300MW, through the provision of system strength to improve network stability.” That is, it will use grid forming inverters to virtually provide system strength.
Commercial operations on the project are expected to begin in 2025. The contract term is 20 years.
“This contract with AEMO as testament to the growing recognition of the role that advanced power electronics and batteries can play in supporting the stability of the network and creating the conditions that will enable the acceleration of a 100% renewable system,” Edify’s CEO John Cole said.
“Edify was early to identify the enormous potential of batteries with grid forming inverters and has been working closely with suppliers, network companies and AEMO for a few years to advocate for their multi-use properties in providing both technical and market services.  
“It is pleasing to see continued recognition of advanced inverter technology… We look forward to continuing to work with AEMO and the Victorian government to finalise the development of the KESS project and to bring it into operations.”

The targets are for both short and long-duration storage systems, including batteries, hydroelectricity and hydrogen technologies. The government expects the targets to secure $1.7 billion in investment by 2035.
By that date, Victoria aims to have enough storage capacity to power around half of its current homes at their peak energy use.
“These commitments demonstrate real national leadership,” Chief Executive of the Smart Energy Council, John Grimes, said of the news.
To start making these targets a reality, the Victorian government simultaneously announced a $119 million investment from its $540 million Renewable Energy Zone Fund to support a 125 MW big battery and grid forming inverter in the Murray Renewable Energy Zone, between Bendigo and Red Cliffs.
That contract has been awarded to Edify Energy.
Alongside the storage target, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Minister for Energy, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the state will deliver a $157 million package to support renewables and storage projects though details remain scarce.
What the Victorian government did say was $38.2 million from its Energy Innovation Fund has been awarded to four projects.
The fund will provide $7 million for a 100 MW battery and inverter in Terang, as well as $19.3 million for two bioenergy projects at farms in Gippsland and Barwon. Yarra Valley Water will receive $11.9 million to install an electrolyser to make renewable hydrogen using recycled water in Wollert.
Victoria is already home to the largest battery in the Southern Hemisphere – the 300 MW Victorian Big Battery owned by Neoen.
Developer Maoneng is also progressing with its plan to build a 240 MW / 480 MWh project on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula.
Last year, Engie began constructing its 150 MW big battery at Victoria’s former Hazelwood coal-fired power station.

Enel Green Power (EGP), a unit of Italian utility Enel, unveiled its newest solar panel at the 8th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion this week in Milan, Italy.
The new product is a heterojunction bifacial panel for applications in utility-scale PV projects. It is based on an n-type solar cell with G12 format and a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%.
“Production will begin in September 2023 with the first 400 MW production line of our 3Sun Factory in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy,” the head of 3Sun, Eliano Russo, told pv magazine. “The cell efficiency was certified by the Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH) in Germany. According to our roadmap, however, we should be able to increase the efficiency to 25% efficiency in 2025 and over 26% in the second half of 2026.”
The cell has currently a thickness of 150 µm, but the company’s roadmap has set a target of 120 µm by the end of 2025.
“Our cell is flexible and, compared to TOPCon and PERC cells, has a higher resistance to mechanical stress,” Russo explained. “We conducted several tests which showed that if microcracks arise, they don’t expand as significantly as in PERC cells.”
The new panel is available in nine versions, with power outputs ranging from 640 W to 680 W and average efficiency spanning from 22.6% to 22.9%. The open-circuit voltage is between 43.3 V and 44.2 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 18.9 A to 19.8 A.
All versions of the solar module measure 2,172 mm × 1,303 mm × 35 mm and weigh in at 36 kg. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V and the bifaciality reaches 95%. The panel can be used in operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C, with an operating temperature coefficient of -0.24% per degree Celsius. It is enclosed between 2 mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, and also features a junction box with an IP 68 rating and an anodised aluminium frame.
The new products come with 30-year linear power output guarantees and 20-year product guarantees. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 93% of the nominal output power.
“The factory will start operations around September 2023,” Russo said, noting that the factory’s capacity at that time will be around 400 MW. “The levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of our panel allows us to tackle the market while ensuring remarkable profitability.”
EGP will initially target the European market, where it is obliged to sell up to 60% of its products, as it has received a significant amount of funding from the European Union.
“We are also targeting non-European markets such as the United States, Latin America, and Asia, and we may also consider opening new factories abroad,” Russo said. “By choosing the heterojunction technology, we decided to bet on technology and innovation, but we are also considering increasing our scale. All the economies of scale which we can capture will only increase our competitiveness.”
Enel is investing €600 million (AU$892 million) in the expansion of its 3Sun facility. Out of that amount, €188 million euros are expected to be provided by European Commission and the Italian government through grants coming from the Innovation Fund and National Recovery and Resiliency Plan (NRRP).
EGP started production at the 200 MW facility in October 2019. It invested around €80 million in reviving the factory, which was built in 2011 with Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp and French-Italian semiconductor business STMicroelectronics. Enel took full control of the facility in July 2014. At the time, the factory was intended to produce multi-junction, thin-film silicon PV modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/27/iea-pvsp-predicts-high-cost-low-revenue-scenario-for-solar-recycling/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE,NORTH AMERICA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2022","IEA PVSP predicts high-cost, low-revenue scenario for solar recycling","A group of researchers and industry experts from across Europe, the Asia Pacific, and the United States have compiled a review of current regulations and industrial policies for the management of end-of-life PV modules.
The IEA PVSP report found that the volume of end-of-life PV modules is still small, but there are appropriate treatment and recycling measures in place in countries and areas with end-of-life regulations.
“However, the current low volumes, limited available recycling technologies, logistics challenges, and undeveloped markets for recovered materials result in a high-cost, low-revenue scenario for PV module recycling globally,” the report said.
The scenario is expected to improve with the implementation of regulations in more countries and investment in R&D for PV recycling.
Around 1.7 million tons of waste volume of end-of-life PV modules are expected by 2030 under the regular loss scenario of a 2016 analysis by PVSP and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), with approximately 60 million tons expected by 2050. If the early loss scenario pans out, there could be 8 million tons of PV waste by 2030, and a total of 78 million tons by 2050.
Focus on Europe
PV module recycling has been mandatory in Europe since 2012 under the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. The directive requires all producers of PV modules in the EU market to either operate their own take-back and recycling scheme or join producer compliance schemes. All EU member states have adopted the WEEE into national law. According to Eurostat statistics, 13,951 tons of PV module waste were collected in 12 European countries in 2018.
Germany reportedly collected 7,865 tons of PV modules in 2018, 7,708 tons of which were recovered. Of those, 6,896 tons were recycled and prepared for reuse. The country requires registration and specific end-of-life treatment for all PV modules. Business-to-costumer PV modules are collected without charge for the customers at municipal waste collection points, but business customers require a paid take-back/collection service, administered by specialized service providers.
Monocrystalline silicon modules are mostly recycled by glass recycling companies, and First Solar operates a specific recycling line for thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV panels in Frankfurt. According to IEA/PVPS, there will be around 400 thousand tons to 1 million tons of PV waste by 2030 in Germany, with this figure increasing to 4.3 million tons in 2050.
France reportedly collected 4,905 tons of PV waste in 2019, thirteen times as much as in 2015, when the figure stood at 366 tons. Soren, a nonprofit eco-organization, has a monopoly on PV module waste management in the country, managing both its collection and recycling through private tenders, according to the report. In February 2021, it launched a new tender for three new PV recycling facilities in France. One started operations in 2021, and the other two will start in 2022, according to the report. France may see 43 thousand tons of PV waste by 2030, and more than 118 thousand tons by 2040.
Spain reportedly collected 226 tons of PV waste in 2019. Its treatment of waste is still in a “very preliminary stage,” according to the report. Producers are obliged to adopt the necessary actions to manage waste according to product design, and must bear the cost of the process, as well as register the products in the national producer registry of electrical and electronic equipment (RII_AEE). Spain still sees small amounts of PV waste, but these are expected to increase in the medium term, as its first plants near end of life.
Italy reportedly collected 1,350 tons of PV modules in 2018. The Italian energy services manager, GSE, defines instructions for the disposal of modules installed in plants benefiting from feed-in-tariff schemes. End-of-life modules from plants with less than 10 kW nominal power are sent to a national collection center, whereas modules with more than 10 kW are destined to an authorized waste management entity. Italy may see between 140 thousand to 500 thousand tons of PV waste by 2030, with an increase up to 2.2. million tons by 2050.
North America
Various US states have introduced regulations to incentivize the expansion of PV module recycling industrial capacity. Washington was reportedly the first state to introduce a regulation for take-back requirements for PV manufacturers at no additional cost for the PV system owners. California implemented regulations to classify end-of-life PV modules are universal waste at the beginning of 2021, to decrease costs and thereby incentivize a domestic PV recycling industry. North Carolina is considering following suit. PV waste management policies are also being considered in Illinois, Hawaii, Arizona, North Carolina, and New Jersey.
“Despite the regulatory developments at the state level, there is no US federal regulations specifically designed to regulate PV waste management. PV waste is regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which does not contain any specific regulatory requirement for PV waste,” said the report.
First Solar, the world’s largest PV recycler, has a recycling capacity of 150 metric tons/day in the US for its thin-film CdTe PV modules, according to the report. The United States has also witnessed an increase in the number of companies dedicated to recycling crystalline silicon PV systems.
“The potential economic and environmental gains from sustainably managing PV waste have motivated the allocation of R&D funds toward accelerating the scaling of startups focusing on recycling silicon PV waste,” the report says. There may be 5.5 to 10 million tons of PV waste in the US by 2050.
Asia-Pacific region
There are currently no nationwide PV recycling schemes in the Asia Pacific, according to the report. China reportedly does not have any specific policies or regulations on PV module recycling, and it also lacks the necessary recycling industrial chain. It recently implemented several PV recycling R&D projects, including the establishment of the China PV Recycling Center in 2022.
In Australia, only the state of Victoria has mandatory regulations on PV module disposal. Victoria passed legislation banning all electronic waste from landfill sites, including PV modules, inverters and batteries.  The country’s Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence is designing a nationwide extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme for PV systems, which should be implemented by June 2023.
Japan currently includes PV waste under the general regulatory framework for waste management, as it lacks specific regulations for end-of-life PV module recycling. The country has published guidelines for promoting the proper end-of-life treatment of solar panels and is developing research on high-value glass and low-cost recycling.
South Korea also lacks mandatory PV waste recycling policies, but “PV module waste will be included in the list of items affected by EPR regulations, which will be enforced in the PV industry beginning in 2023,” said the report. The country may see 9,665 tons of PV waste in 2023, up to 112,564 tons in 2040, according to predictions from the Korean Environment Institute.
