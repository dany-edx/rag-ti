Meanwhile, electricity prices in Victoria are rising dramatically – in turn, driving up prices for consumers.
The Andrews government has signalled a major shake-up of Victoria’s energy sector. Its pre-election commitments – a 95% renewable electricity target by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2045 – are definite moves in the right direction.
And plans to reinstate the State Electricity Commission, including a constitutional amendment to cement this change permanently, speaks to the government’s intention to regain control of the electricity market and skyrocketing energy prices.

Today’s high energy costs are driven primarily by fossil fuel supply constraints. The reduction in gas supply due to sanctions on Russia has exposed the delicate balance of supply and demand, and the fragility of the global fossil-based energy system.
For more than a decade, specialists have known the long-term solution to reduce electricity prices and cost volatility: a large-scale shift to renewable sources of energy.
This would shield us from short-term supply and demand shocks because the cost of renewables-produced wholesale energy is fixed at construction, with no variable costs such as fuel.
Shifting to renewables would also make electricity cheaper than coal and gas in countries with major wind and sun advantages, such as Australia and Indonesia. And it would decouple electricity production from strongly geographically concentrated sources of fossil fuels such as in the middle east.
But realistically, in the next two years or so the Victorian and Australian governments can only manage energy prices by curbing the worst excesses of an unfettered free market operation in natural gas and retail electricity.

We are still working with precisely the same market frameworks as when deregulation started in 1998. Victoria, and the other states, need to accept that this framework has failed to produce benefits to consumers, particularly for households.
For example, in the decade to June 2013, electricity prices for Australian households increased by an average 72% in real terms.
We must go back to the drawing board to determine what the energy market should look like. In the meantime, Australian states and territories must consider reimposing price caps on energy retailers.
An immediate relief measure would be to delink Australia’s natural gas market from global markets for a limited period.
The only sure way to do this is by implementing a domestic gas reservation policy, which entails reserving a portion of Australian gas for domestic use, rather than exporting it. This must be nationally coordinated, as we have a strongly interconnected national gas market.
Western Australia uses its own isolated energy system and put a gas reservation policy in place years ago, which seeks to make the equivalent of 15% of gas exports available for people in WA. This policy has helped mitigate price shocks.
Since winning the election, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has continued to urge the federal government to impose such a policy Australia wide. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese should heed these calls.

Our energy futures are intrinsically intertwined with addressing climate change.
The world has only eight years left for global warming to be limited to 1.5℃. This means accelerating the switch to renewable energy without any further delays.
Our first step must be to make all electricity renewable by 2035 in Victoria (and, indeed, in the rest of Australia).
Second, we need a transition to electric vehicles across all transport systems as fast as possible and well before 2040. The Andrews government is investing $100 million to decarbonise the state’s road transport sector, but the transition won’t be complete until 2050.

Third, hard-to-abate sectors – such as certain manufacturing operations, shipping and aviation – need ongoing technological development.
They require significant government support to progress clean fuels, likely based on the renewable hydrogen to ammonia pathway. Victoria has a range of hydrogen and ammonia related industry development policies that show the government recognises this sector’s importance.
Ultimately, the incoming Victorian government’s promises address the first issue well, while making some headway on the second and third.
We can’t rely on the rest of the world for innovation. Governments in Australia must play a more prominent role in infrastructure investment, technology research and development, energy industry development and significant market reform.
Tackling all these challenges isn’t really a job for a single state, particularly given Australia has one major east coast electricity grid and one national energy framework.
The Victorian government cannot achieve any significant changes without working closely with other states and the federal government. In this, state governments must be brave and go against the past three decades of hands-off government approaches to essential energy infrastructure.
This isn’t a time for leaving things to the market to resolve. The Victorian government must take immediate and giant leaps to ensure a stable and climate-friendly energy sector.

An additional 270 MW of solar has also been proposed.
Sydney-based Genex and joint development partner J-Power said the decision to increase the size of the wind farm followed a study of its options and came as the developers announced China-based supplier Goldwind would provide the turbines for the project being developed at an old gold mine site about 270 kilometres northwest of Townsville.
“We are … delighted to announce an increase in capacity of the project from up to 200 MW to up to 258 MW,” Genex Chief Executive Officer James Harding said in a statement. “Our Kidston stage 3 wind project is the final piece of our flagship Kidston Clean Energy Hub which will comprise of solar, hydro and wind generation.”

The planned wind farm will connect into the new transmission line being constructed by Powerlink for the 250MW, eight-hour pumped hydro facility which is expected to be energised in 2024, ahead of the completion of the wind project.
Queensland transmission network service provider Powerlink has already started work to deliver 186 kilometres of new high voltage transmission line and construct two new switching stations at Mount Fox and Kidston to facilitate the connection of the clean energy hub to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Powerlink Chief Executive Paul Simshauser said the Genex Kidston Connection Project marked the largest package of transmission construction works the state-owned transmission network service provider had undertaken in eight years.
“We’re building nearly 350 transmission towers along this stretch of line, utilising 5,500 tonnes of galvanised steel,” he said. “Our first phase of construction will include upgrading existing access tracks, establishing vehicle wash-down bays and preparation of the transmission tower pads.”

It is expected the connection project will support about 400 jobs while Powerlink said to complete preliminary project works it had partnered with more than 20 local suppliers to deliver contracts valued at nearly $14 million.
“It goes without saying that solid planning and engagement paves the way for the successful delivery of large-scale projects like this,” Simshauser said.
It is anticipated the Genex Kidston Connection Project will undergo commissioning in April 2024.
Genex Chief Executive Officer James Harding said the Kidston Pumped Storage Project was Genex’s flagship project and the first of its kind to be developed in Australia in more than 40 years.
“Genex and Powerlink have been working together since 2016 to facilitate the connection of this landmark project to the national electricity grid,” Harding said.  “We look forward to continuing to work closely with Powerlink throughout the construction phase and look forward to energisation of the Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project, expected in the second half of 2024.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/28/australian-start-up-to-fast-track-gravity-energy-storage-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 28, 2022",Australian startup to fast-track gravity energy storage system,"Green Gravity and international engineering heavyweight GHD have executed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop new applications for the startup’s storage solution, which moves heavy weights vertically in legacy mine shafts to capture and release the gravitational potential energy, providing long-duration storage to the grid.
In a wide-ranging partnership, Wollongong-based Green Gravity and GHD will collaborate on technical engineering, policy, regulatory matters and electricity grid connectivity practices.
Green Gravity founder and Chief Executive Mark Swinnerton said the partnership marked the next crucial stage in the commercialisation of the company’s “home-grown” gravitational energy storage technology.
“Recent escalating power prices declared in the Federal Budget demonstrate how important it is for innovative Australian companies to commercialise new technology quickly,” he said. “Solving the power pricing challenge requires collaboration across sectors, innovation, and determination. We are up for the challenge.”

Green Gravity’s technology harnesses the fundamental principles of gravity and kinetic energy to store and dispatch energy by lifting and lowering ultra-heavy weights in legacy mine shafts. As the weights are lowered, the cable holding the weights passes through a device called a ‘winder’, which then turns a motor.
The company aims to raise the weights when excess renewable energy is available and lower the weights to satisfy demand; either for industrial purposes or simply because prices in the electricity grid make it an attractive time to dispatch.
The concept is similar to other gravity energy storage technologies, but Swinnerton believes the use of old mine shafts, rather than purpose-built tall towers, will be his competitive advantage.
“Green Gravity’s energy storage technology represents a breakthrough in the search for economic long-duration storage of renewable energy,” he said. “By re-using mining assets, costs can be kept low. By using gravity as the fuel, we dispense with consuming the critical water, land, and chemicals which other storage technologies rely on.”
The signing of the agreement with GHD follows the announcement that Green Gravity will work with Australian coal producer Yancoal to explore the potential application of its energy storage technology at the Austar coal mine site near Cessnock, New South Wales.

Austar has been idle for more than two years and Swinnerton said decommissioned ventilation shafts that connect the underground mine to the surface look like a prospective place for Green Gravity to deploy its technology.
The MoU with Yancoal will see the two companies work together on a feasibility study for the installation of Green Gravity’s equipment at the site, potentially paving the way for widespread application of the technology.
“This study represents an outstanding opportunity for Green Gravity and Yancoal to identify new economic potential at the former Austar mine site,” Swinnerton said. “Successfully identifying the best method of fitting gravitational technology at the former Austar mine site will create a template for beneficial re-use of legacy mining sites for Yancoal, and for thousands of other mines around the country.”
Yancoal Australia Chief Executive David Moult said the study will also assess how gravitational energy storage assists in delivering beneficial post-mining land use.
“An important element of the project will be to show how renewable energy projects can play a potential role in beneficial post-mining land use,” he said. “This MoU with Green Gravity is a demonstration that we are serious in assessing potential renewable energy opportunities and in collaborating with innovative partners to progress our strategy and vision for Yancoal’s future.”

The precinct, located in the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone, will now include Acciona’s 923 MW MacIntrye and 1,026 MW Herries Range wind farms, and state government-owned CleanCo’s proposed 102.6 MW Karara Wind Farm.
Acciona Energia Managing Director Brett Wickham said the Herries Range Wind Farm would be the company’s third clean energy project in Australia’s Sunshine State, with the 600 MWp Aldoga Solar Farm also under development near Gladstone.
“Expanding the MacIntyre Precinct has been a natural decision for us,” he said. “Our plan is to roll from construction of MacIntyre straight into Herries Range which will mean that workers can move from one large-scale project to the next whilst staying in the same area.”
Construction of the MacIntyre wind farm has already commenced and is expected to be completed in 2024.
Wickham said more details about the Herries Range facility would be made available as the project progresses.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the 180-turbine Herries Range project would support up to 600 additional jobs during construction.
“The first two wind farms within the MacIntyre Wind Precinct, Acciona Energia’s 162-turbine MacIntyre Wind Farm and publicly-owned CleanCo’s proposed 18-turbine Karara Wind Farm, were already expected to support 400 construction jobs,” he said.
“And that’s always been in addition to the 220 workers needed to build Powerlink’s transmission infrastructure that, as part of our new SuperGrid, will deliver the clean energy from MacIntyre Wind Precinct where and when it’s needed.”
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the expanded MacIntyre precinct is another significant step for the nation as it strives to shield households and business from exposure to volatile and expensive global fossil fuel markets.
“It means another big step towards energy independence, edging closer and closer to a point where our exposure to global fossil fuel markets and their inflationary impact on energy prices will be over,” he said.

Facilitated by Melbourne-based procurements services company Procurement Australia, the agreement with Red Energy will deliver enough solar-driven renewable energy to power the electricity needs of the Wingecarribee, Albury City, Bega Valley, Camden, Penrith City, Queanbeyan-Palerang and Wollongong councils.
The renewable energy will be provided by Fotowatio Renewable Ventures’ 115 MW Metz Solar Farm near Armidale in the NSW New England region. The facility achieved commercial operation status in September and is now operating at full capacity, generating 320,000 MWh annually. The federal government-owned Snowy Hydro has a long-term supply agreement in place with the facility.
Under the 10-year PPA, the participating councils will transfer their power supply in a staged approach to renewable electricity from January 2023. Approximately 90% of the councils’ operational electricity use will be immediately transferred to the new power supply with the remaining assets to be rolled in when possible.
Wingecarribee Shire Council General Manager Lisa Miscamble said eventually all the councils’ nominated large and small market sites will be powered by renewable electricity.
“This is the largest single-emissions reduction commitment in council’s history and one of the most significant in the Southern Highlands,” she said.
“We’re absolutely thrilled to be part of this historic undertaking that will see council’s largest sites transition to renewable electricity as of January 2023.
“It’s also one of the cornerstone actions towards achieving net zero carbon emissions and leading long-term sustainability across our shire.”
Miscamble said the PPA leveraged on the joint participation from all seven councils.
“Together this 10-year agreement will ultimately see all council assets, including public lighting, powered by renewable electricity generated from within NSW,” she said.
Procurement Australia Chief Executive Joe Arena said he expects the success of the PPA will deliver more cross-council contracts with work on another agreement having already commenced on the back of intensifying interest from other councils and regulatory bodies.
“This PPA is just the beginning of the work we want to do in NSW,” he said. “We’re already fielding numerous council enquiries for the next NSW PPA, and I’m looking forward to collaborating with members and the wider energy market to make it happen as soon as possible.”

Longi has signed an agreement with the government of Heshan, Guangdong province, to build a new 10 GW module factory. The company plans to invest CNY 2.5 billion ($522 million) in the new facility, while the local authorities will facilitate its construction by providing factory buildings.
Risen Energy said it will invest around CNY 2.76 billion in a new 10 GW solar cell factory in Chuzhou, Zhejiang province. The panel manufacturer said it will implement its expansion plan in two phases within 36 months.
Daqo has signed a five-year supply agreement for high-purity polysilicon with an undisclosed “leading solar manufacturing company in China.” The Xinjiang-based polysilicon supplier will deliver 148,800 MT of high-purity mono-grade polysilicon from January 2023 to December 2027. Prices will be negotiated by the two parties on a monthly basis, according to market conditions.
Canadian Solar said it recorded $1.93 billion of revenue in the first three quarters of the current financial year, up 57% year on year. It said its net profit rose 59% year on year to USD 363 million ($537 million). It said it shipped 6 GW of PV modules in the third quarter and noted that its total module capacity will reach 50 GW by the end of 2023, from around 36.7 GW at the end of this year. Looking forward, the manufacturer said it expects module shipments to fall within the range of 30 GW to 35 GW this year.
Solargiga said it has sold a 45% stake in Qujing Yangguang, a monocrystalline silicon wafer manufacturer. The company entered into an equity transfer agreement with two purchasers. The transaction has been valued at CNY 1,350 million.

Comunidad de Regantes de Águilas, a Spanish irrigation community, recently completed the installation of a floating PV plant on one of its irrigation ponds in the municipality of Águilas, in the southern Spanish region of Murcia.
The 786 kW floating array features 4,256 Isifloating 4.0 floats from Isigenere. The floating structures support 1,728  solar panels, each with a nominal power of 455 W.
Due to the dimensions of the pond, a flexible joint has also been designed along the entire floating platform. In addition, the PV installation is directly attached to the outer slopes of the pond via aluminium profile supports. This installation, together with the floating one, provides electricity to the pumps to lift the pond and part of the desalination plant.
The installation is the second floating PV project to support water pumping in Spain. In September, the Sur-Andévalo Irrigation Community in the southern province of Huelva completed the installation of a 1.6 MW floating solar plant for this purpose. The system, which was built on a pond in the municipality of Cartaya, features floats provided by Isigenere and 3,584 solar panels, each with a rated power of 450 W.
In March, the Spanish government submitted a royal decree to regulate the installation of floating PV plants. According to its estimates, around 7.5 GW of floating solar capacity could be deployed on public bodies of water.
