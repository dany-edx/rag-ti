Solar is leading the clean energy revolution in Australia with about 80 million PV panels already installed and many of those are approaching the end of their life. The federal government has identified solar materials as the fastest growing electronic waste stream in Australia – by 2030, solar panels are expected to create a cumulative waste volume of more than 500,000 tonnes and that is predicted to increase to more than 1.1 million tonnes by 2040.
It is forecast that by 2025 NSW alone will generate between 3,000 and 10,000 tonnes of waste solar panels and battery storage systems each year. By 2035, that is expected to increase to between 40,000 and 71,000 tonnes per annum.
To prepare for this emerging waste stream, the state government has released the Going circular in clean energy issues paper to stimulate discussion on how NSW can create more value from a circular clean energy sector.
“Scaling up clean energy is critical however it is vital that this transition is as environmentally sustainable as possible,” the NSW government said.

The NSW Office of Energy and Climate Change (OECC) said linear supply chains currently dominate the uptake of clean energy technologies and adopting circular economy principles presents a significant opportunity to build new economic value, while reducing waste and environmental impacts.
“The circular economy offers opportunities for new and better growth that … will promote the recovery and reuse of materials, reduce environmental impacts, enhance local manufacturing and create jobs in NSW,” it said.
The circular economy involves shifting away from a linear ‘take, make, use and dispose’ approach towards one that maximises the value of resources and ensures the entire cradle-to-grave process of designing, producing, deploying, and decommissioning those technologies is sustainable.
“This means instead of taking resources from the earth, using them once, and disposing of them in landfill, resources are kept in use and circulating through the economy for as long as possible,” the OECC said.
The NSW government highlighted that the issues paper does not propose solutions but aims to start a conversation to help identify key barriers and opportunities to adopting a circular economy for clean energy.
The paper focuses on energy generation and storage technologies including PV, wind, battery storage, electric vehicle (EV) batteries, hydroelectricity, pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) and green hydrogen.

The release of the paper follows a warning from the federal government that businesses and manufacturers are on notice over their recycling practices, and that the solar and electronics industries will soon face regulation.
The issue of solar waste has been on a “minister’s priority list” for stewardship action for years but Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek recently confirmed that new Australian recycling regulations are on the horizon to prevent tonnes of potentially hazardous waste entering the environment.
“I have moved solar panels and electronic goods from that minister’s priority list into a category where I will regulate because they [businesses and manufacturers] have been warned but haven’t got their act together,” she said.
“The next step is to regulate for solar panels and electronic goods to be recycled, and to have a stricter set of rules about recycling in these industries.”
Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have already banned solar panels ending up in landfill with regulations in place dictating they have to be taken to e-waste drop off points to be recycled.

Qcells said the technology reduces both electrical and optical losses, respectively, by halving the current passing through each cell and making use of incident light more effectively.
The manufacturer said the technology, in combination with half cells, multi-busbars and wire interconnection provided a power gain of 7.5% over standard PERC technology.
The Q.Maxx BLK-G5+ solar panel is available in two versions: a 415 W product with a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% and a white frame; and an all-black 390-400 W module with an efficiency of 21%.
Both measure 1,722 mm × 1,134 mm × 30 mm and weigh in at 21.1 kg. Qcells said the new panels are “Installation friendly” with the frame allowing multiple clamp and bolt options and up to 13 mounting configurations.
The panels come with a 25-year product warranty and a 25-year performance warranty. The first-year degradation is said to be no more than 2.0% and 25-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 86% of the nominal output power.
According to the manufacturer, orders for the new modules are already open and the panels will be ready for installation on Australian homes by next month.

The first creditors’ meeting was held on Friday after Sun Cable, which is largely owned by mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s private firm Squadron Energy and technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ private investment company Grok, entered voluntary administration on January 11 citing an “absence of alignment” among shareholders.
The administrators said on Friday Sun Cable will be put up for sale before the end of January amid a “strong level of interest” in the company and its Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) venture. The administrators said they plan to appoint an adviser shortly to conduct the sale process which is expected to be finalised by April.
“Indicative timing for the sale process is approximately three months,” FTI Consulting said in a statement released after the meeting of creditors.
Both Forrest and Atlassian co-founder Cannon-Brookes, who on Friday provided $65 million in interim funding through Grok to allow Sun Cable to continue to operate, are expected to submit bids for the company.
Sun Cable’s AAPowerLink project aims to power Darwin and export solar from the NT to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometre submarine transmission link. The proposal includes building up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in the Barkley region.

Fortescue Metals Group chair Forrest, who has made no secret of his support for green hydrogen as the fuel of the future, has indicated he intends to bid on the company but has questioned the technical viability of the submarine cable. It is expected that if Squadron Energy gains control of Sun Cable it will scrap the undersea cable plan.
Cannon-Brookes, who is chairman of Sun Cable, is also tipped to bid for the company and has indicated if successful he intends to proceed with the original proposal, saying he fully back the project’s ambition and the team.
John Park, the head of corporate finance and restructuring in Australia for FTI Consulting, said the administrators have worked to preserve the value of Sun Cable and “keep all options for the future of the project on the table.”
“We will seek to crystalise the interest expressed in the future of Sun Cable into a firm offer for the benefit of creditors and other stakeholders via the sale process,” he said in a statement.
“Ultimately, the successful bidder will have the opportunity to take the business forward in line with their vision.”
FTI said it is now seeking proposals from advisors to act on the sale and run the sale process. An appointment is expected shortly.
The sale process is expected to take three months. The second creditors’ meeting would normally be held on or before 14 February, but FTI said it would apply for an extension to carry out the sale process in advance.

AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said it will be the first of company’s thermal generation sites to be converted into an integrated, low-carbon industrial energy hub, which will support the energy market and regional economic development.
“After over 50 years of generating electricity for Australia, Liddell Power Station has reached the end of its operational life and will close in April 2023,” he said.
AGL has already secured planning approval to build a 500MW big battery with up to four hours of storage at the site, which the company said will provide a new source of dispatchable power and allow the company to reuse the existing grid connection infrastructure.
The demolition process is expected to commence in early 2024 and take approximately two years. Work will include removal of all main structures (boilers, chimneys, turbine houses, coal plant) and ancillary buildings, and levelling of the site using recovered crushed concrete.
More than 90% of the materials in the power station, including an estimated 70,000 tonnes of steel, are expected to be recycled during demolition. Critical infrastructure, such as transmission connections, will be retained to support the ongoing use of the site as an industrial energy hub.
The demolition of the Liddell power station signals the beginning of the end for AGL’s coal-fired generation fleet.
The company has confirmed its Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley will close down between 2030 and 2033 and last year announced it will shut down the Loy Yang A power plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley 2035, a decade earlier than planned.
To replace that capacity, AGL said it plans to have up to 12 GW of new generation and firming capacity in place before 2036. This includes an interim target to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by the end of the decade.

Shenzhen-based ESYSH has launched a new all-in-one home storage system with an inverter and battery module.
The 5.12 kWh, 230 V battery uses LiFePO4 as the cathode material and has a cell conversion efficiency of 95%. Up to six modules can be combined to accommodate up to 32.72 kWh of energy storage capacity. The smallest energy storage system measures 600 mm x 778 mm x 305 mm and weighs 93 kg. The largest measures 600 mm x 1,878 mm x 305 mm and weighs in at 343 kg.
The inverter has 7.9 kW power output. It has two maximum power point tracking (MPPTs) with an input voltage range of 100 V to 540 V. It has an efficiency rating of 98% and the maximum PV input voltage is 550 V.
The HM6 solution comes with a 10-year warranty and can purportedly operate for more than 6,000 cycles. It operates in temperatures ranging from -20 C to 55 C.
“Product installation is extremely simple; all it takes is stacking the battery modules together to enable normal use, thereby removing the potential for installation errors and saving 60-70% on labor-based installation fees,” the company said in a statement.
The new storage system features IP66 protection and can is reportedly unaffected by violent storms due to its waterproof and dustproof performance.
ESYSH has established branches in Sydney, Australia, and Munich, Germany.
