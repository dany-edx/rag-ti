The approval is expected no later than the end of March.
On the floor of the Smart Energy Conference held in Sydney last week, Aiko’s Back Contact (BC) module range stirred excitement. While generally the Australian solar market is split into two main streams – more affordable Chinese brands and premium European brands – Aiko is looking to buck this trend. It wants to position itself as a premium brand, although Aiko’s Asia-Pacific President, Alex Hang, says pricing will be competitive. 
“We position ourselves as a premium brand but we cannot make it an unaffordable product… our aim is just to have a bit of premium but not a lot,” Hang told pv magazine Australia. According to the company’s Australian National Sales Manager, Ross Crawford, prices should sit between $0.30 – $0.35/W.

The ABC range boasts a 25.15% conversion efficiency, certified by TÜV-SÜD, with Alex Hang saying that this equates to between 20 – 30 Watts of additional power compared to a traditional panel of comparable size. 
Specifically, the company’s residential panels from the ABC range, named Neostar, sit between 440W to 470W. The commercial and industrial (C&I) panels, the Comet series, sit between 605W to 630W. Meanwhile, the company’s utility-scale offering, the bifacial Polaris series, is between 620W to 640W. Hang also noted the company is launching a version specifically designed for floating solar. 
With N-type TOPCon modules dominating global manufacturing, Aiko has taken a slightly different approach – still negatively doping its cells, but focussing on back contact (BC) panels. This approach, says Han He, Aiko’s Director of Product Management, has allowed the company to achieve its shading optimisation. “We can control the p-n junctions and also the voltage of the cell, sort of creating bypass diode function in every cell,” He explained. The details of exactly how this process works remains confidential, He said, but the end effect is that individual shaded solar cells are able to be bypassed without affecting the string.

Aiko started out manufacturing solar cells for many of the Chinese solar giants in 2009, but more recently moved into manufacturing complete solar modules. Its ABC module range has already been launched in Europe, with Crawford noting it has gained popularity in that market. Now Aiko is turning its sights on Australia, assuring that its distribution channels will cater not only to metropolitan cities but also regional and rural areas.
It has signed partnership deals with Australian distributors Solar Juice, AC Solar Warehouse, Sol Distribution, and Tradezone. Through these, the company has committed to delivering 2 GW of its GEN 2 ABC solar modules to Australian shores over the next three years.
The company has also introduced an ultra-lightweight 8.8kg module to the Australian residential market, swapping solar glass for high chemical plastic, affording the 450W ‘Air Series’ module its light weight.
Crawford said Aiko is planning a cross-country roadshow and a series of monthly online webinars to help educate installers about selling its technology in the Australian market.

The project, comprising 4,320 solar panels spread across a 6.2-hectare site about 3 kilometres from Newstead, 140 kilometres northwest of Melbourne, will also include a 5 MWh battery energy storage system that Flow Power said will include a “Victorian-first” DC-coupled system.
The Newstead solar farm, developed by Flow Power in collaboration with local community group Renewable Newstead, will feed electricity into the grid and then to Newstead homes and businesses. It’s estimated that once operational the PV power plant will generate enough clean energy for up to 1,600 homes, about three times Newstead’s current requirements.
Renewable Newstead committee member Gen Barlow welcomed the latest construction milestone, saying there’ll be champagne flowing at the news.
“It’s a very exciting time and there’ll be some very happy people in Newstead,” she said. “We were out this morning with Flow Power and government reps and it’s exciting to see the very modern tracker system and while the battery is yet to come, it’s very pleasing we’ve got to this stage.”
Flow Power said work has already commenced to prepare the foundations for inverters, switchgear, and battery containers which are expected to arrive on site in the coming weeks.
“We’re hoping that by the middle of the year, or at the very latest the third quarter, there’ll be connection and some generation, though the battery is yet to be installed,” Barlow said.
Flow Power, which will own and operate the solar farm and retail the electricity it generates, said excess energy will be stored in the DC-coupled battery and traded into the grid to maximise returns.
The Newstead Energy Project is Flow Power’s seventh clean energy project since 2021, and once fully operational will boost its renewable portfolio to more than 400 MW.
For Renewable Newstead, the project – first conceived in 2008 – is part of the group’s ambition to achieve 100% renewable energy.
The collaboration with Flow Power, meant the project did not require initial community up-front investment, and the model allows for any Newstead business and household to purchase renewable energy from the solar farm by simply switching to the retailer.
“We are finalising the retail offer and how Flow Power will retail to our community and some of us have been participating in a retail trial to see how it works and we’ve been in constant dialogue with Flow Power,” Barlow said.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/11/australian-nuclear-organisation-turns-to-solar-for-savings/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-03-11,Australian nuclear organisation turns to solar for savings,"Installation company RACV Solar has completed its largest solar panel installation in Victoria to date, rolling out a 1.6 MW rooftop system at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation’s (ANSTO) Australian Synchrotron facility at Clayton, in Melbourne’s southeast.
The rooftop PV system and inverter will supply part of the Australian Synchrotron’s total energy requirements and is expected to deliver savings of about $2 million (USD 1.32 million) by 2029. It is expected the system will reduce ANSTO’s demand on the grid by more than 2 million kWh per year while reducing its carbon footprint by more than 1,680 tonnes per year.
ANSTO Australian Synchrotron Director Professor Michael James said the investment in solar technology was a “no-brainer” for the research facility that uses particle accelerator technology to generate brilliant beams of light used for research purposes.
The powerful beams of light – x-rays and infrared radiation – a million times brighter than the light from the sun, are used to examine the molecular and atomic details of a wide range of materials, including the next generation of solar cell technology.
James said the science facility operates 24 hours per day and the new solar plant provides a cyclical way to harness the power of sun during daylight hours to help power the facilities.
“Electricity is one of our largest operating costs, so our new solar plant will deliver substantial savings and also act as a buffer against increasing energy overheads in the future,” he said.
“Going solar was a no-brainer. The size of our rooftops, paired with the ample, uninterrupted exposure to sunlight at our location within the Monash precinct was a major incentive for us to become more energy efficient.”
James said the benefit of driving down operating costs is paralleled by ANSTO’s ongoing commitment to a greener future.
“This investment in renewable technology is just one way we can meet our own sustainability goals while also contributing to a cleaner and greener environment,” he said.
ANSTO is aiming to reduce its grid electricity dependency by 20% by 2035.
RACV General Manager Energy Greg Edye said the project is the company’s largest rooftop deployment in Victoria yet and the five-month-long install had provided some unique challenges.
The rooftop system includes more than 3,200 panels spread across an area of nearly 6,600 square metres, including across the large circular roof of the main research facility.
“The solar panel installation … covers the rooftops of the main Australian Synchrotron building, the Australian Synchrotron guesthouse, and the environmentally controlled storage facility,” Edye said.
“The engineering and technical expertise required to deliver this type of project is complex.”

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/11/trina-presents-all-black-450-w-solar-modules-with-22-5-efficiency/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-03-11,Trina presents all-black 450 W solar modules with 22.5% efficiency,"China-headquartered manufacturer Trina Solar has introduced the NEG9R.25 solar module for rooftop applications. The dual-glass module incorporates n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells and has a power output of up to 450 W with a power conversion efficiency of 22.5%.
The new product, which uses 210 mm diameter wafers and features double-glass design in place of the conventional glass-and-backsheet structure, has been specifically designed for residential installations as well as for commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftops.
Edison Zhou, head of Trina’s operations in Australia and the Pacific, said customers are increasingly demanding solar modules that are not only efficient and highly reliable but that are also aesthetically pleasing,
“A lot of our customers were asking for an all-black module,” he told pv magazine during the recent Smart Energy Expo in Sydney.
“They were also asking for a dual-glass solution so we put that to our product managers and they’ve come up with this.”
Trina said the NEG9R.25 dual-glass module combines n-type i-TOPCon technology with 210mm rectangular silicon wafer cell technology, that delivers a longer lifespan, exhibits less light-induced degradation, and achieves higher conversion efficiency compared to p-type modules.
The modules feature 1.6 mm heat-strengthened glass on the front and back while the all-black aesthetic has been achieved by incorporating black cells with thin busbars, along with a black frame and encapsulation material.
The module, expected to be available in Australia next quarter, measures 1,762 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 21 kg.
Trina said the modules are highly resistant to scratches, cracks and other damage-related issues and have passed the 35 mm hail test and requirements for IEC fire protection.
Trina offers a product guarantee of up to 25 years and a performance guarantee of 30 years. It claims the modules have low degradation rates with just 1% degradation in the first year and less than 13% over 30 years.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/11/perovskite-perovskite-silicon-tandem-solar-cell-achieves-record-breaking-efficiency-of-27-1/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SINGAPORE",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-03-11,Perovskite-perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell achieves record-breaking efficiency of 27.1%,"From pv magazine Global
A research group at the National University of Singapore (NUS) has fabricated a triple-junction perovskite-perovskite-silicon solar cell that integrates cyanate (OCN) ions in an ultrawide-bandgap (UWBG) perovskite absorber.
“The incorporation of OCN ions significantly reduces the nonradiative recombination in the ultrawide bandgap perovskite film,” the research’s lead author, Yi Hou, told pv magazine. “Therefore, the single-junction perovskite solar cells incorporated with cyanate can achieve a higher open-circuit voltage of 1.422 V compared to 1.357 V for conventional perovskite solar cells.”
The scientists explained that OCN may be a suitable replacement for bromide as a precursor material in the perovskite lattice structure. “Our research confirms the atomic-scale incorporation of OCN anions into the perovskite lattice,” Hou said. “The low-damage, atomic-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirms the incorporation effect at atomic resolution for the first time. This is also the first time atomic-resolution TEM images have been captured for a hybrid ultrawide bandgap perovskite film.”
The academics fabricated the triple-junction cell with a bottom silicon device with a heterojunction (HTJ) architecture, a middle perovskite solar cell, and a top perovskite cell integrating the UWBG perovskite absorber with a 5% OCN content.
The triple junction device had a structure integrating the HJT cell, a substrate made of glass and indium tin oxide (ITO), a hole transport layer (HTL) based on a phosphonic acid called methyl-substituted carbazole (Me-4PACz), a perovskite absorber with an energy bandgap of 1.55 eV, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) layer, another ITO layer, an HTL made of nickel(II) oxide (NiOx) and Me-4PACz, the UWBG perovskite absorber, a buckminsterfullerene (C60) electron transport layer (ETL), a SnO2 layer, an ITO layer, and a lithium fluoride (LiF) as an inorganic ionic dopant.
“The UWBG perovskite uniformly covers the middle cell without obvious damage to the underneath layer,” the researchers explained. “The smooth top surface and robust performance of the dual-junction half-cell create an ideal substrate for the subsequent deposition of UWBG perovskites.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the triple-junction cell achieved a maximum efficiency of 27.62%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.132 V, a short-circuit current density of 11.58 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 76.15%. For comparison, a benchmark device without the incorporation of OCN ions achieved an efficiency of 25.32%, an open-circuit voltage of 3.021 V, a short-circuit current density of 11.48 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 73.01%.
According to the research team, the introduction of OCN elevates the open-circuit voltage from 1.357 V to 1.422 V and results in the highest combination of open-circuit voltage and fill factor for UWBG perovskite solar cells. The cell was also able to retain around 80% of its original efficiency after 300 h.
“This accomplishment significantly surpasses the power conversion efficiencies previously reported for all other perovskite-based triple-junction tandems as well as single-junction perovskite and silicon solar cells,” Hou stated.
The cell was introduced in the study “Triple-junction solar cells with cyanate in ultrawide bandgap perovskites,” published in nature.
