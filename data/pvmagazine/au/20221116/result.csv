Belinda Fan, X-Elio’s country manager in Australia, said the completion of the project strengthens the company’s position in the Australian market and supports the state government’s recently announced renewable energy targets to generate 70% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2032, and 80% by 2035.
“The Blue Grass Solar Farm is among Queensland’s 50 large-scale renewable projects, coming online at an opportune time to help support the state government’s clean energy ambitions,” she said. “We’d like to think of this project as a small but important step in the state’s march to net zero.”
The 200 MW solar plant, located 14 kilometres west of Chinchilla in the planned Darling Downs Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), is expected to deliver an estimated 420 GWh of 100% renewable energy annually, enough to power 80,000 homes and offsetting approximately 320,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
The electricity generated at the facility will be supplied to the national electricity market (NEM) through the existing 132 kV Chinchilla to Columboola transmission line, which is operated by Queensland’s transmission network provider Powerlink.
The project is supported by power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Queensland government-owned energy generator Stanwell, Australian electricity retailer ZEN Energy, and United States-based software company Salesforce.
Stanwell has signed an agreement with X-Elio for 49 MW offtake from the Blue Grass solar farm while Salesforce has signed an agreement for 25% of the output of the facility, more than enough renewable energy to match its electricity use for its entire Australian operations.
The PPA is Salesforce’s first international renewable energy offtake agreement and Salesforce Australia and New Zealand CEO Pip Marlow said the launch of the Blue Grass Solar Farm is a milestone moment in the company’s sustainability journey.

“Salesforce has net-zero residual emissions and reached 100% renewable energy for its global operations in 2021,” she said, adding “projects like Blue Grass Solar Farm are critical to our vision for a net-zero world.”
X-Elio CEO Lluis Noguera said the Blue Grass Solar Farm marks the opening phase of the company’s long-term interest in the Australian market where it continues to pursue new growth opportunities.
“Australia is a key strategic market for X-Elio and our Blue Grass Solar Farm will spearhead our continued expansion along Australia’s east coast, with additional projects planned for New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria,” he said.
X-Elio has announced plans to build a 300 MW solar farm and battery energy storage system near Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW. The 120 MW Forest Glen and 80 MW Wunghnu solar farms in NSW and Victoria respectively are also part of the more than 500 MW of projects X-Elio has in development in Australia.

The collaboration was formalised at the G-20 summit in Bali where Sun Cable founder and CEO David Griffin signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM). The deal will see them advance a technical program for grid connectivity in the archipelago.
The deal between Sun Cable and the ESDM will include working through the key potential areas for renewable energy generation, defining the resources available, identifying the key energy intensive locations and industries, and then building a plan to unlock these opportunities.
Indonesia’s Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif said linking Indonesia’s archipelago through subsea transmission corridors will play a critical role in enabling the nation to unlock its green industry opportunity by matching renewable potential with industrial demand centres.
“Energy infrastructure is very important to connect the centres of great energy production to centres of high energy consumption,” he said.
Indonesia is planning to build a “super grid” to overcome the nation’s geographical mismatch between renewable resources and high-demand areas, as well as ensuring a stable and secure system.

The preliminary findings of a joint study conducted by Sun Cable and the ESDM identifies five key “green industries” that have the potential to underpin green growth and add an estimated $170 billion to Indonesia’s GDP by 2035. The five industries are mining and minerals processing, energy and fuels, transport manufacturing (including the production of electric vehicles), food processing and agriculture, and IT infrastructure.
The study highlights Indonesia’s access to critical mineral resources, and strategic location at the heart of ASEAN growth and says the nation “has some of the best renewable energy resources in Asia and many of the core capabilities to become a green industry powerhouse.”
The ESDM said unlocking the Indonesia’s green economic potential will require rapid acceleration of new generation with a 25-fold increase in renewable capacity required to supply zero-carbon demand.
The agreement with Sun Cable, which is seeking to develop the giant Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink), which would export solar power from the Australian outback to Singapore via a submarine transmission link through Indonesian waters, positions grid interconnectedness at the centre of the Indonesian policy agenda.
Griffin said the next steps will focus on evaluating specific transmission corridors and investment required, with the joint study to be completed in early 2023.
“We are looking to share Sun Cable’s expertise in solar energy generation and long-distance transmission with Indonesia as it shapes its policy and technical approach to inter-island connectivity,” he said.

Sun Cable has an established relationship with Indonesia, having already secured government approvals for the submarine transmission cable route for its ambitious $30 billion-plus AAPowerLink project.
The project, which comprises up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage to be built on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory’s Barkly region, would supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission network, including a 750-km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800-km HVDC submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore.
Construction on the project is expected to commence in 2024, with first supply of electricity to Darwin in 2027, and capacity expected by the end of 2029.

The panel is based on its TOPCon mono cell technology, which achieved a record efficiency of 26.1% in mid-October. The results, which were confirmed by Germany’s TÜV Rheinland, builds on the company’s previous record of 23.53%, set in July.
“The module adopted JinkoSolar’s latest TOPCon cell technology and advanced welding and packaging technology and achieved conversion efficiency of 23.86% for the first time for 2 mm2 above large-size solar modules,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
“The advanced welding and packaging technology effectively reduces the internal resistance loss of the module, while significantly improving conversion efficiency. In addition, this lab result has the practical foundation to be introduced into mass production, and technically set the direction for mass production of subsequent advanced products.”
In January 2020, Jinko said it managed to improve panel performance by applying a new anti-reflection coating and advanced metallization technologies. It also incorporated New Tiling Ribbon (TR) technology into the cell design, to eliminate inter-cell gaps. At the time, the panel power conversion efficiency was 22.39%.
Its new solar module features solar cells with a 267.72 cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate, grown using the Czochralski method.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/16/india-china-us-rated-worlds-most-attractive-solar-markets/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,INDIA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 16, 2022","India, China, US rated world’s most attractive solar markets","London-based Ernst & Young (EY) has once again ranked India as the most attractive destination for PV investment in its latest Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index. The country received a score of 62.9, followed by China and the United States, with scores of 61.1 and 58.5, respectively.
Australia, Israel, Germany, Egypt, France, Brazil and Morocco completed EY’s top 10. For overall renewables investment, the U.S. ranked first, followed by China, and then Germany, which moved up one spot from last year.
“The U.S. retains its top position due to the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022, which is viewed as a game changer for its green hydrogen industry,” the report says.
China is expected to add 100 GW of solar this year, according to the China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute. Germany’s rise to third place was reportedly bolstered by its Easter package commitment to renewables. The United Kingdom lost its spot in the top three, taking fourth place. France, Australia, India, Spain, Japan and the Netherlands rounded out the top 10.
The report also ranks markets in terms of the attractiveness of renewable power procurement via offsite corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs).
“The volume of power generation committed through PPAs in 2022 is set to be less than 2021, although higher than 2020,” the report says, noting that this will be the first year-on-year reduction in signed corporate PPAs since 2013.
Key factors in the reduction include uncertainty around government policy and rapidly changing cost profiles, according to EY. Spain remained the most attractive PPA market in 2022, with Germany overtaking the United States for second place. The United Kingdom, Australia and France completed the top five.
EY also introduced a new renewables attractiveness ranking, normalised to countries’ gross domestic product. It highlighted Morocco, Chile and Portugal as markets performing above expectations for their economic size.
