Tindo CEO Shayne Jaenisch said on Monday the $1 million grant, announced as part of a $55 million package awarded under round two of the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund (MMF), would allow the company to compete on equal footing with the world’s biggest module manufacturers.
“We’re looking forward to being able to take the next step,” Jaenisch told pv magazine.
“It allows us to compete at the front end of technology.
“Once we bring the new line into production in January I think we’ll be able to compete with the top 10% of manufacturers globally in performance.
“We’ve always had the quality. Now we’ve got to that point where we can compete head on with some of the biggest manufacturers around the world.”
The funding is the first the company has received from any level of government and Jaenisch said it was very much welcomed.
“There’s a lot of emotion. There’s excitement, there’s relief. We feel like it’s the validation we’ve been looking for for a long, long time,” he said.
“The timing couldn’t be better for us.”
Tindo has been manufacturing solar PV modules at its Mawson Lakes facility in Adelaide’s northern suburbs for more than a decade but the company recently announced expansion plans to allow it to satisfy growing demand for its Australian-made modules.

Construction work on the new factory is already complete and Jaenisch said the production equipment is set to arrive later this year with manufacturing for retail to commence in Q1 2022.
The new plant will boost the company’s production capacity to 150 MW per annum and see Tindo transition to the latest M10 cell technology with Jaenisch revealing a 144-cell 550 W module is set to be among the first modules to roll off the new line.
Tindo is one of 86 businesses across Australia to share in the latest round of MMF grants.
Sun Cable, the Singaporean consortium behind the $26 billion Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPL) also secured a $1 million grant under ound two of the MMF to progress its plans to develop a proposed solar array manufacturing assembly facility in Darwin.
Sun Cable earlier this year announced plans to construct a facility to manufacture the prefabricated, pre-wired Maverick solar systems, designed by Sydney-based manufacturer 5B.
The system has been selected as the module of choice for the AAPL project – a 14 GW solar farm and approximately 33 GWh battery energy storage system to be constructed in the Northern Territory’s Barkly Region.
Sun Cable said the first stage of the proposed manufacturing facility will pilot a semi-automated production line which will provide opportunities to supply other solar farms across northern Australia with the Maverick solar array systems. Phase two of the development will expand the facility to manufacture systems for the AAPL project.

Sydney-based E3Sixty was also included in the list of MMF grant recipients, securing $469,950 to help finance a $1.9 million e-waste recycling facility in the city’s western suburbs.
E3Sixty Solar, which incorporates PV Industries, recently secured a 3,000 square metre site in Auburn where it has already commenced a solar module recycling operation.
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Christian Porter said the MMF, part of the government’s $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy, is designed to help business to modernise their manufacturing processes, improve productivity and target new export opportunities.
Businesses are required to match government funding on a three-to-one basis, with government grants covering up to 25% of eligible project expenditure. The minimum grant amount is $100,000 and the maximum grant amount is $1,000,000. Projects must be completed within two years.
“Australia’s manufacturing sector is vitally important to our economy, directly employing more than 900,000 Australian workers and contributing almost $120 billion to our export earnings last year,” Porter said.
“Investing in the latest manufacturing technology and equipment helps them to remain internationally competitive by improving their productivity and increasing their capacity to target new export markets for their products.
“Just as importantly, these investments also help to grow well-paid and highly skilled jobs in the modern manufacturing sector for Australian workers.
“We know that for every manufacturing job we create, at least three additional jobs are created in other areas of our economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/28/accc-report-shows-solar-is-economic-winner-in-nem/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 28, 2021",ACCC report shows solar is economic winner in NEM,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) latest electricity markets report has found that residential and small business customers with solar PV systems paid much lower rates than non-solar customers thanks to feed-in tariff (FIT) payments earned for exporting electricity generated by their solar panels to the grid.
The Inquiry into the National Electricity Market report examined the residential and small business billing data of 11 electricity retailers, who together supply the majority of electricity customers across the National Electricity Market (NEM) states of New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Victoria.
The report, released on Friday, found the price paid by solar residential customers in the NEM was 7.9 c/kWh or 29% less than those paid by non-solar customers, after accounting for any FIT payments.  Prices paid by small business customers with solar were 10.8 c/kWh or 31% less than their non-solar counterparts.
The average household with solar paid $94 less on their quarterly bill in 2020. Residential solar customers had a median quarterly bill of $253, down 2% on the previous year, while non-solar customers had a bill of $347, an 8% increase on 2019.
Small business customers also enjoyed lower bills with those of solar customers down 6% to $610. Bills for non-solar small business customers also decreased, dropping 16% from $545 to $458 courtesy of reduced business activity due to Covid-19 restrictions.
While the ACCC report highlighted the price advantages for solar customers, it also revealed early adopters of solar PV are better off than newer solar customers.
ACCC chair Rod Sims said those who had embraced solar PV early continue to benefit from premium FITs, the legacy subsidised rates that were set at much higher levels than the negotiated FITs that apply for electricity exported to the grid by newer solar customers.
Residential solar customers on premium rates earned more than two and a half times that earned by customers on negotiated rates due to their higher median feed-in rate, earning 53 c/kWh compared to 11 c/kWh. The average residential solar customer with premium rates earned $858 in 2020 while those on a negotiated FIT earned $307.
Small business solar customers on premium rates (55 c/kWh) earned three times that of customers on negotiated rates (11 c/kWh). The average small business customer with premium rates earned $1,993 compared to $553 for those on a negotiated rate.
The earnings discrepancy came in spite of solar customers on negotiated FITs supplying more electricity to the grid than those on premium rates.
“Customers on negotiated rates supplied higher volumes to the grid in 2020 than in 2019, while this was generally not the case for premium rate customers,” the report reads.
“This is likely due to negotiated customers investing in new solar capacity and also bigger systems being installed over time, whereas many of the eligibility requirements to remain on a premium rate prohibit augmenting the solar panel system, so the scope for premium rate solar customers to export more electricity to the grid over time is limited.”
The report shows that on average, residential solar customers on a negotiated FIT supplied 716 kWh to the grid while premium rate customers supplied 341 kWh.
Small business solar customers on a negotiated FIT supplied 1,177 kWh to the grid, while premium rate customers supplied 751 kWh.
“Solar installation in homes and small businesses has been one of the biggest changes in the electricity sector over the last decade,” Sims said.
“The early solar adopters who are receiving premium feed-in tariffs are getting great deals.”

AGL chief customer officer Christine Corbett said on Friday the systems, which are expected to deliver the equivalent generation of more than 415 average Australian homes, would help the not-for-profit organisation reduce operational costs and meet sustainability targets.
“AGL will install up to 1.6 MW solar systems across Vinnies’ Victoria properties, reinforcing their commitment to net-zero emissions,” Corbett said.
“We estimate that these installations will save up to $1.26 million in energy costs – much-needed funds that can be redirected back into the community.”
The first of the solar installations was unveiled at Hughesdale in Melbourne’s south-east on Friday with Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio saying the switch to solar aligns with the state’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions.
“It’s fabulous to see community organisations reducing their bills and slashing their emissions by installing solar panels,” she said.
“It all counts as we work towards halving our carbon emissions by 2030.”
Corbett said the rooftop rollout is in line with AGL’s climate statement, with the energy retailer “committed to supporting businesses create more sustainable operations with tailored and innovative energy solutions”.
Identified by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) as the nation’s biggest polluter, AGL has in recent months made a series of announcements, vowing to transition to “full decarbonisation” by 2050.
AGL has announced plans to establish a 200 MW grid-scale battery at its Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, has commenced construction on its 250 MW one-hour-duration battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia, and has entered into a joint venture with the UK’s Ovo Energy for the exclusive rights to the company’s energy management platform.
The energy retailer has also acquired commercial and industrial solar businesses Epho and Solgen Energy Group. The acquisitions will see AGL deliver more than 70 MW of C&I solar each year, making it the largest commercial solar provider in Australia.

The decision to ban products from four Chinese solar manufacturers based in the Xinjiang province taken on Friday by the U.S. Biden Administration has already provoked reaction from both analysts and market players.
John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), issued a statement that said, “The news of enforcement action on solar products coming from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is not unexpected and we fully support the Biden Administration’s efforts to address any forced labor in the solar supply chain.
“SEIA will continue to work with the administration and our partners to stand against forced labor and build a clean energy future we can all be proud of.”
Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said in a note to clients that the move could have a “significant negative impact on the whole U.S. solar industry.” He said that Hoshine is an annual supplier of around 800,000 MT of MG-Si (magnesium silicide), a raw material needed for polysilicon production.
Shen said that PV module imports may now need to prove that there is no content from Hoshine in order to enter the U.S. “Access to solar modules in the U.S., in our view, could be severely limited by this order as we believe isolating and tracing MG-Si through the supply chain could present a significant challenge.”
Adding to pressure on the Biden administration, members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China. The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee.
Reuters reported that Hoshine Silicon Industry said on an investor platform that it backed the Chinese foreign ministry’s reaction, adding that the firm does not export industrial silicon to the United States directly and that the impact on its business would be limited.
Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co. sent the news agency an email saying the company has “zero tolerance” towards forced labor, and that it does not sell directly to U.S. companies, or buy from the United States, and there would not be “a significant impact on the company’s business.”
Last September under the Trump administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued five Withhold Release Orders (WRO) on products from the Xinjiang region. Products included hair products, apparel, cotton, and some computer parts.
Th Biden administration may have had no choice but to act on the ongoing allegations of forced labor in the solar supply chain, said Mark D. Herlach, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Eversheds Sutherland. “No one wants to be in a position of not responding to forced labor,” he told pv magazine in an interview.
In a note to clients, the firm said that possible sanctions could have implications on purchasers of PV modules. These could include direct legal jeopardy, financing challenges, supply chain disruptions, and reputational risk. The note said that reputational concerns, for example, have led major brands such as Calvin Klein, Gap, H&M, IKEA, Patagonia, and Tommy Hilfiger to stop buying cotton sourced from Xinjiang.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/28/pv-driven-air-conditioner-coupled-with-ice-thermal-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 28, 2021",PV-driven air conditioner coupled with ice thermal storage,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists in China have developed a direct-drive photovoltaic air conditioning system that can store solar power through ice thermal storage. The latter is common thermal storage technology based on standard cooling equipment and an energy storage tank that is able to store cooling while shifting energy usage to off-peak, nighttime hours.
“The novelty of this work is that a solar cooling system directly driven by distributed PV is proposed and the rechargeable storage battery is replaced completely by low-cost ice,” research-co author Guoliang Li told pv magazine. “Solar air conditioners with different sizes of PV panels, with and without MPPT controller and different types compressors were built and tested outdoors to experimentally investigate the running characteristics of air conditioning at various solar irradiations.”
PV-driven air conditioners, according to the research group, are often equipped with batteries for energy storage and this results in challenges of low performance, high initial investment, and complex configurations for practical applications. “The ice thermal storage for the PV driven air conditioner with reduced batteries was explored in our previous work,” it explained. “It proved the feasibility of the ice thermal storage, where the batteries were only used as a buffer and the system average energy efficiency could reach 7.65%.”
The proposed new system consists of: A PV system built with 12-16 monocrystalline modules with a power output of 190 W mounted with a tilted angle of 30 degrees; a control system based on an inverter and an MPPT controller; an ice-making system comprising a variable-speed compressor with a frequency range of 360 Hz; a condenser; a liquid storage device; a capillary; an evaporator; an ice thermal storage tank; a gas-liquid separator; a variable speed pump; and a heat exchanger.
The performance of the system was evaluated considering operating efficiency and stability. “The optimal matching relationships were found and experimental results of the system with variable speed compressor and an MPPT controller have shown very good ice-making capability and reliable operation as well as a great improvement in the available photovoltaic power,” Li stated, noting that the average PV-to-compressor power efficiency (PPE) and coefficient of performance (COP) of the systems were improved by reducing the power ratio, which in turn reduced the operation stability ratio (OSR) of the compressor.
Through their analysis, the academics found that the use of an MPPT controller improved the PPE of the system by 81.7% compared to that of the system without MPPT, and that the variable-speed compressor was more adaptive for the PV-driven cooling.
The proposed system is presented in the paper “Study on matching characteristics of photovoltaic disturbance and refrigeration compressor in solar photovoltaic direct-drive air conditioning system,” published in Renewable Energy. The research group includes scientists from the Yunnan Normal University and the Jiaxing University.
