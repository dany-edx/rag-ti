With South Australia on track to reach 100% net renewables before the state government’s 2030 target date, ElectraNet’s latest Transmission Annual Planning Report (TAPR) reveals that interest in large new load connections to the South Australian electricity transmission system has risen sharply with applicants looking to take advantage of low-cost electricity from renewable sources.
ElectraNet Chief Executive Officer Simon Emms said the state is “witnessing a level of interest from large new and diverse electricity loads not seen in half a century.”
“We are experiencing an unprecedented level of enquiries and applications from renewable energy generators, battery providers and customers wanting to connect to the grid to access and provide low-emission electricity,” he said.
“The load enquiries total almost 2,000 MW of new demand, which is massive, relative to the state’s current maximum electricity demand level of approximately 3,300 MW.”
The mining sector, hydrogen industry, data centres and processing facilities are among the key drivers behind the high-demand growth forecasts.
Widespread adoption of electric vehicles, electrified residential and commercial developments, and increased connections of residential battery energy storage systems are also predicted to increase demand on the network with Emms declaring transmission infrastructure will be critical to ensuring the transition to 100% renewables.
“To ensure the infrastructure is available when required, now is the time to commence assessing the feasibility of further strategic investments to meet the state’s forecast clean energy needs,” he said.

ElectraNet has identified four priority project options that “could deliver benefits if development occurs within approximately five years.”
These include the construction of high-capacity double-circuit twin conductor lines in the state’s mid-north. The new transmission infrastructure project, valued at approximately $1.5 billion, would link Cultana, near Whyalla, to Bundey in Adelaide’s north.
ElectraNet said this would enable higher transfers of low-cost renewable energy from the mid-north to the Adelaide metropolitan load centre, unlocking potential for increased connection of renewables in the Mid North, Riverland and Northern renewable energy zones.
ElectraNet has also outlined a $700 million plan to construct a new double-circuit line stretching from Bundey to Para in Adelaide’s northeast or to a new site between Parafield Gardens West and Torrens Island in the city’s northwest.
Other proposed projects include an estimated $60 million to string the vacant 275 kV circuit between Tailem Bend and Tungkillo in the state’s southeast, and an estimated $90 million to upgrade the operating voltage of the new Cultana to Yadnarie transmission lines from 132 kV to 275 kV.
ElectraNet said it anticipates work on the four projects would commence in the mid-2020s, before becoming operational before the end of the decade.
The company is now seeking feedback from interested stakeholders on the demand forecasts, renewable energy sources and network development options. The proposed projects remain subject to the Australian Energy Regulator’s approval process.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/02/agl-eyes-solar-panel-remanufacture-facility-for-victoria-site/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 2, 2023",AGL eyes solar panel ‘remanufacture’ facility for Victoria site,"AGL has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Melbourne-headquartered Solar Recovery Corporation (SRC) to conduct a feasibility study into establishing a facility to remanufacture end-of-life solar panels at the Latrobe Valley site.
SRC is the Australian-owned partner of La Mia Energia, an Italian consortium which has developed a panel recycling process it claims can recover up to 99% of raw materials from of all types of end-of-life solar panels.
The feasibility study will look at establishing a facility to remanufacture end-of-life solar panels at AGL’s planned Latrobe Valley Energy Hub. The study will also explore training and employment opportunities for the local community to build the new skillsets required for the energy and manufacturing industries of the future.
AGL announced last year it will shut the 2,210 MW coal-fired Loy Yang A power station in 2035, a decade earlier than previously planned, as it seeks to develop 12 GW of renewable and firming capacity by 2036.
The company has since outlined plans to transform the Loy Yang site into an integrated, low-carbon industrial energy hub dominated by a 200 MW/800 MWh battery energy storage system. It is also exploring proposals for floating solar developments, electrothermal solar storage, and hydrogen supply chain facilities.

SRC will be the first manufacturing supply chain focussed organisation to explore being part of the transformation of the Loy Yang site and AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said the MOU marks an important first step in the site’s transition.
“It’s clear that the world is changing, and so is AGL,” he said. “We are proud to be supporting SRC’s mission to find new ways to deal with end-of-life solar PV panels.”
Brokhof said AGL will also recycle its end-of-life solar panels at the company’s facilities as looks to build a circular economy.
SRC Chairman Rob Gell said the signing of the MOU aligns with the company’s ambitions to ensure solar generation lives up to the promise of providing clean energy throughout its lifecycle.
“SRC was founded as part of a circular solution for end-of-life solar PV panels and to repurpose the materials for manufacturing industries,” he said. “It feels fitting that we are working with AGL as part of their ambition to reimagine the end-of-site transformation of AGL Loy Yang into a cleaner low-carbon hub.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/02/solar-leads-way-with-renewables-on-course-to-shatter-deployment-records/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 2, 2023",Solar leads way with renewables on course to shatter deployment records,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) says global additions of renewable power capacity are expected to surge by 107 GW to reach 440 GW in 2023, the largest annual addition yet. The figure represents about one third more renewable energy than the world added the previous year.
Overall, cumulative world renewable capacity is forecast to reach 4,500 GW at the end of 2024, equivalent to the total power output of China and the United States combined, as growing policy momentum, higher fossil fuel prices and energy security concerns drive strong deployment of solar and wind power.
“The global energy crisis has shown renewables are critical for making energy supplies not just cleaner but also more secure and affordable,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.
“Governments are responding with efforts to deploy them faster. This year, the world is set to add a record-breaking amount of renewables to electricity systems – more than the total power capacity of Germany and Spain combined.”
Overall global renewable energy capacity additions rose by almost 13% to nearly 340 GW in 2022 with solar responsible for nearly 220 GW, up 35% from 2021.

In its Renewable Energy Market Update, the IEA says solar remains the main source of global renewable capacity expansion in 2023, accounting for 65% of growth. The agency said distributed applications, including commercial and residential rooftop systems, account for almost half of all global PV expansion.
Annual PV market growth is expected to continue, reaching almost 310 GW in 2024, with declining module prices, greater uptake of distributed solar systems and a policy push for large-scale deployment driving higher annual solar additions in all major markets. The IEA said these factors are outweighing rising interest rates, higher investment costs and persistent supply chain challenges.
The IEA said the market conditions had “created a favourable environment for solar PV, especially for residential and commercial systems that can be rapidly installed to meet growing demand for renewable energy.”
“These smaller distributed PV applications are on track to account for half of this year’s overall deployment of solar PV, larger than the total deployment of onshore wind over the same period,” the agency said.
While the IEA has predicted global renewable capacity additions will reach 440 GW in 2023, in one scenario it has estimated that additions could reach more than 500 GW this year.
The agency said reaching this level would depend on “the pace of permitting, construction and timely grid connection of projects under development.”
“Achieving stronger growth means addressing some key challenges,” Birol said. “Policies need to adapt to changing market conditions, and we need to upgrade and expand power grids to ensure we can take full advantage of solar and wind’s huge potential.”
The IEA said electricity generation costs from new onshore wind and PV plants are projected to decline by 2024 but will likely remain 10-15% above their pre-Covid levels in most markets outside China. Although commodity and freight prices have dropped from last year’s peaks, they remain elevated. At the same time, developers’ financing costs have increased due to rising interest rates. Despite this, the IEA said solar and onshore wind remain the lowest cost options for new electricity generation in most countries.
Global manufacturing capacity for all PV production segments is expected to more than double to 1,000 GW by 2024, led by China and increasing supply diversification in the United States, India and Europe.
While supply chains are diversifying, China’s contribution to global renewable capacity additions is expected to increase in 2023 and 2024, consolidating its position as the undisputed leader in global deployment.
In 2022, China accounted for almost half of all new renewable power capacity worldwide. By 2024, the country is expected to deliver 50% of all new solar PV projects globally, as well as almost 70% of all new offshore wind projects and more than 60% of onshore wind projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/02/rail-operator-eyes-australian-first-with-battery-electric-retrofit/,"EV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 2, 2023",Rail operator eyes Australian first with battery-electric retrofit,"Aurizon has engaged Progress Rail, part of the Caterpillar group, to retrofit one of its existing 4000-class diesel locomotives with batteries in a move which the company said has the potential to reduce Australia’s transport emissions and transform the nation’s freight supply chains.
Aurizon said the prototype will be the first freight unit to be constructed in Australia powered by batteries, allowing the potential future use of totally renewable energy sources for freight hauls. The project will also explore using re-generative energy created when trains brake or travel downhill to recharge the onboard batteries.
Aurizon Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Harding said the project would contribute to the company’s decarbonisation initiatives with a target of achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2050.
“Modern freight locomotives using renewable energy sources have the potential to transform the nation’s freight supply chains for customers, communities and the Australian economy,” he said. “Not only will this dramatically reduce the carbon footprint for our freight transport needs and the community in general, but it will also provide a significant competitive advantage for Australian industries and exporters in global markets.
“Delivering high-quality Australian products for export across zero or low-carbon supply chains will be a win- win for Australian companies and Australian communities.”
The train is being built at Progress Rail’s Redbank facility in south-east Queensland and will be designed as a heavy-haul freight locomotive, capable of working across Aurizon’s national rail footprint.
The prototype is expected to feature similar battery technology to that provided in Progress Rail’s EMD Joule electric locomotive which the company said has battery capacities up to 14.5 MWh, and a run time of up to 24 hours on a single charge.
Progress Rail said the design phase and preliminary work on the retrofit has commenced at Redbank with construction of the locomotive expected to be completed by early 2023, with on-track trials commencing in the first half of 2025.
Aurizon said the charging infrastructure on the selected Australian rail corridor will be completed in conjunction with the locomotive project with the University of Queensland and Central Queensland University commissioned to undertake modelling work and research on emerging battery technology, network infrastructure and charging facilities required to provide renewable electricity to the locomotive batteries.
