Harmonics refer to periods of distortion in the voltage waveform and can be caused by inverters such as those used in solar systems. However, the influx of renewable energy systems in recent years means current regulatory guidelines do not cover new complexity. In order to ensure that the level of distortion in the grid is below a tolerable level for grid-connected equipment, Network Service Providers (NSPs) must ensure harmonic distortion does not exceed the tolerance level.
However, if NSP’s implement their own bespoke methodologies the network may suffer from a raft of inconsistencies which can result in unnecessary curtailment or overinvestment on harmonic mitigation equipment. UOW’s assessment will bolster this tolerance, better ensuring the overall health and longevity of the network.
Currently, the primary tool to limit harmonic disturbance is known as emission allocation. But it is up to the load or generator to prove that it can meet this allocation through a less than robust compliance assessment.
According to ARENA, the new methodology will be used as an “interim best practice guideline for voluntary use by participating industry stakeholders, and as the basis for submission to amend the Australian Standards.”
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said new national standards would “smooth the transition to renewable electricity,” and potentially “reduce the grid connection costs associated with renewable energy generation, while also addressing the integration challenges of the new grid scale supply. This will help ensure secure and reliable grid operation at high levels of renewables penetration.”
UOW’s Australian Power Quality and Reliability Centre Director Duane Robinson described the project as “extremely exciting.”
“As an industry facing research centre, we expect the outcomes of this very practical work to provide clarity with respect to the methodologies for compliance assessment for harmonic distortion leading to less complex connection processes and even more renewable energy in our power system,” Robinson said.

The UOW project is also supported by 12 industry stakeholders including network service providers, renewable energy developers and equipment suppliers. The cost of the entire project is $2.28 million.
The project is expected to take place over 29 months, the last five of which will be devoted to developing the documentation to be used in the submission processes.

Martin Green says the funding represents a “turnaround” after many projects faced being scrapped under the uncertain government support of the previous Scott Morrison-led federal government.
“We have heard that the funding for our centre, of which I’m the director, along with a number of other centres and research groups, is going to be extended,” said Green, speaking to pv magazine at the WCPEC conference in September, 2022. “As of just a couple of years earlier, we thought that we were about to be terminated and now it looks like we’re going to live through to 2030. With this recent grant success, we will be able to really push things along.”
At the 2022 WCPEC conference, the world’s leading solar academic conference that is held every four years, Green was awarded the prestigious WCEPC Award – adding to his already bulging trophy cabinet.
Referring to the previous federal government attempts to scrap ARENA, Green noted the stark change in fortunes for solar research in Australia. “A couple of years ago our funding source was going to be closed down by the government that was in power then. With the change in government, things are looking a lot brighter.”
The UNSW PV research programs to receive funding include work on high efficiency tandem and multi-junction solar cells, along with approaches to reduce production costs by dramatically reducing silver consumption.
“There is a lot of silicon technology [among the successful grant programs], but also on thin film technology, where we are trying to develop thin film cells in their right but also for stacking onto silicon,” said Green. “There are grants on the system level, so it really is across the whole cross section of the industry. It will be really good for the group to have more of a diversification of the research fields that we are looking at.”
The successful UNSW solar system-level research projects are into areas including operations and maintenance, including inspection technologies, and applications of machine learning.
Green notes that UNSW will now be able to expand its research teams. “Instead of [just] being able to keep our present researchers employed, we will actually be able to take on some new initiative, new people and ideas – so it’s a real plus for solar research in Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/06/gravitricity-to-deploy-prototype-underground-hydrogen-storage-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED KINGDOM",BERNADETTE GEYER,"JANUARY 6, 2023",Gravitricity to deploy prototype underground hydrogen storage system,"From pv magazine Global 
Gravitricity, a Scottish energy storage specialist, has signed a memorandum of understanding with structural engineering contractor VSL Systems UK to develop its first full-scale demonstration project in the United Kingdom for the underground storage of hydrogen. The company told pv magazine that initial use cases for its purpose-built storage systems will include industrial uses and heavy transport, so the systems will likely be located at industrial sites.
Gravitricity’s FlexiStore technology can store up to 1,000 tons of compressed gaseous hydrogen per shaft, and multiple shafts can be co-located at a single site. Current salt mine storage solutions do not provide for flexibility of location, but the FlexiStore system can be installed close to renewable energy facilities, where green hydrogen storage can also help to provide grid-balancing services.
“A single FlexiStore would store the green hydrogen generated by a 460 MW offshore wind farm and could be emptied and refilled daily,” the company said in a statement, noting that multiple shafts “could soak up vast amounts of otherwise wasted or ‘constrained’ wind – which amounted to 3.6 TWh in 2020.”
Gravitricity said its underground steel-lined rock shafts will be safer than current above-ground storage technologies, which have a higher risk of damage and leaks. Under the terms of the deal, VSL Systems UK will contribute its expertise to the design and construction of the FlexiStore structures, which will be 6 metres in diameter and 365 metres deep, with a capacity of 100 tons of gaseous hydrogen at 220 bar.
Gravitricity estimates that the daily storage capacity could be sufficient to refuel more than 1000 HGVS, or to power 500 buses for a week.

A Gravitricity spokesperson told pv magazine that FlexiStore systems will eventually also tap into the potential of gravitational energy, as heavy weights (up to 12,000 tons) are dropped through the hydrogen stored in the shaft. The company is in advanced discussions with Bendalls Engineering to fabricate the linings for the rock shafts, and it is seeking funds for the UK demonstration project.
The company’s gravity-based storage technology is currently being demonstrated in existing mine shafts in Czechia. The technology purportedly has a faster response time than lithium-ion storage technology and can help to stabilize electricity networks at 50 Hz by responding to full power demand in less than a second.
