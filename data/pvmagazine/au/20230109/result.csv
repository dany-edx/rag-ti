Gas and oil major BP, South Korean steel producer Posco, power utility Alinta Energy and United Kingdom-headquartered miner Tees Valley Lithium have all been allocated land at the 4000-hectare Boodarie strategic industrial area (SIA) near Port Hedland on WA’s north coast.
Iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group has also been allocated land at Boodarie while its clean energy offshoot Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has secured land at the 8000-hectare Ashburton North strategic industrial area near Onslow, 530 kilometres south of Port Hedland. Western Gas subsidiary Equus Energy has also secured land at the Ashburton North precinct.
WA Development Minister Roger Cook said providing the land for the projects is an important step in transforming the Boodarie and Ashburton North strategic industrial areas into globally competitive, multi-product industrial precincts.
“The projects across the two SIAs will deliver a range of projects including ammonia, green iron ore, and hydrogen,” he said. “From job creation to growing the local advanced manufacturing industry and servicing international markets, we will see the economic benefits of these land allocations and these projects flow through the WA economy over time.”

BP, which bought a 40.5% stake in the proposed Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in June 2022, welcomed the land allocation, saying it will support the ongoing development of the project, which it said has the potential to be one of the largest renewables and green hydrogen hubs in the world.
“This is a positive move forward,” the company said. “The land provides excellent access to Port Hedland and the proposed Australian Renewable Energy Hub.”
The AREH, which until recently was called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, is to comprise up to 26 GW of onshore wind and solar power generating capacity. At full capacity, AREH is expected to be capable of producing about 1.6 million tonnes of green hydrogen or 9 million tonnes of green ammonia per annum.
BP intends for the asset to supply renewable power to local mining customers in the Pilbara region and also produce green hydrogen and green ammonia for the domestic market and export to major international users.
Fortescue is said to be considering producing and using green hydrogen at both the Boodarie and Ashburton North sites. The mining giant only last year announced plans to build a 5.4 GW solar, wind and battery energy storage project to power its iron ore mining operations in the Pilbara.

Posco, which also secured land at Port Hedland, has said it plans to use green hydrogen to produce hot briquetted iron, a raw material from iron ore processing.
Posco Chief Executive Officer Jeong-woo Choi said the company plans to increase its investments in Australia in not only raw material for steel making but also across renewable energy, hydrogen and green steel.
Alinta Energy, is considering producing green hydrogen at Boodarie where it already plans to build a 45 MW solar farm and 35 MW battery energy storage system.
Late last year Alinta signed a power purchase agreement with international mining giant BHP which will precipitate the construction of the solar farm and big battery near the utility’s existing gas-fuelled power station at Boodarie, approximately five kilometres southwest of Port Hedland.
The Boodarie and Ashburton SIAs are among 13 similar such industrial precincts across WA. State government development agency DevelopmentWA said the concept is to provide “appropriate locations for investment in strategic, heavy industrial and downstream processing industries.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/09/first-ore-shipment-sails-from-nt-lithium-mine-to-china/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 9, 2023",First ore shipment sails from NT lithium mine to China,"Adelaide-headquartered miner Core Lithium announced the bulk carrier Rossana, loaded with 15,000 dry metric tonnes of 14% lithium oxide spodumene direct shipping ore (DSO) sourced from the company’s Finniss lithium project in the Northern Territory, has set sail from the Port of Darwin.
The Liberian-registered ship left Darwin on Wednesday bound for China’s southernmost port, Fangcheng, where the unprocessed ore will be used in the manufacture of lithium batteries for renewable energy storage and to power electric vehicles (EVs).
Core Lithium said the ore was sold to an unidentified “lithium-ion battery supply chain participant” in China for USD 951 (AUD 1,382) per dmt. This values the shipment at approximately $21 million (USD 14.25 million).
Core Lithium Chief Executive Officer Gareth Manderson described the maiden shipment of ore from the $89 million (USD 60.7 million) Finniss project as a significant milestone for the company, allowing it to successfully commission the logistics chain linking the mine site to the Darwin Port.
“Our focus now is to safely complete construction of the dense media separation plant at Finniss to enable us to produce high-quality spodumene concentrate,” he said.
The Finniss mine is the Northern Territory’s first new mine in more than a decade and the country’s the first lithium supply project to be developed outside of Western Australia. The project, located about 80 kilometres southwest of Darwin, is expected to produce about 16 million tonnes of lithium-bearing ore over the mine’s 12-year life expectancy, primarily for overseas exports with a focus on Asia.

Mining operations commenced at the site in October 2022 and while the project has not yet started producing spodumene concentrate – a feedstock for battery-grade lithium chemicals – the company said it is “on track” to begin in the first half of 2023.
“Core has made good progress during 2022 to transition from a mine developer to lithium producer,” Manderson said. “In 2023 we will continue this transition and the work required to build a good quality operating business in the Northern Territory.”
ASX-listed Core Lithium has already secured offtake for 80% of Finniss production with binding agreements in place with China-based lithium processors Ganfeng Lithium and Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group to supply 75,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of spodumene concentrate to each company over four years from 2024.
Core Lithium also holds a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Geneva-based Transamine Trading for the supply of 50,000tpa of spodumene concentrate from Finniss over a five-year period.
Core Lithium had also signed a term sheet to supply United States-headquartered EV giant Tesla with 110,000 dmt of lithium spodumene concentrate over four years but the deadline for the deal passed in October 2022 without the agreement being completed.
Despite the breakdown of the Tesla deal, Northern Territory Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said the Finniss mine remains a globally significant project for lithium battery production, which she said will “power the future through electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.”
“This a major milestone not only for Core Lithium, but for the renewable and critical minerals industry,” she said. “Lithium is the way of the future.”
Australia’s Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre has forecast the global battery market – which continues to be dominated by lithium-ion models – to grow by nine to 10 times by 2030 and 40-fold by 2050. This would equate to approximately $23 trillion being spent on the technology before 2050.
Australia is the world’s biggest producer of lithium, accounting for an estimated 30% of known resources. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources predicts the nation’s lithium export earnings will increase more than ten-fold in two years, from $1.1 billion in 2020–21 to $16 billion in 2022–23 and $17 billion in 2023–24. This would make lithium Australia’s sixth largest “resources and energy” export commodity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/09/neoen-begins-building-fifth-big-battery-in-australia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Neoen begins building fifth big battery in Australia,"French renewable energy and battery storage company Neoen said it had given notice to proceed to a EPC consortium comprising Italy-headquartered energy storage specialist NHOA Energy and Spanish infrastructure development group Elecnor, signalling the start of construction for its 200 MW/400 MWh Blyth Battery project.
The 200 MW/400 MWh battery is being built next to the Blyth West substation in South Australia’s mid-north and will be linked to ElectraNet’s transmission network. NHOA Energy will be the battery storage specialist in the consortium, while Elecnor will act as balance-of-plant contractor.
In line with its develop-to-own business model, Neoen will be the long-term owner and operator of the Blyth Battery. The asset is expected to commence operating in 2025.
Neoen said the system will mainly be deployed to supply 70 MW of “renewable energy baseload” power to BHP as part of a contract to help power the miner’s Olympic Dam operations. The battery will be used to firm the production of Neoen’s 412 MW Goyder South Stage I wind farm, the first phase of the planned Goyder Renewables Zone, a hybrid wind, solar and storage project that has development approval for a total of 1200 MW of wind generation, 600 MW of solar generation and 900 MW of battery storage capacity.

The Blyth Battery, which received the support of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Large Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, will ultimately be equipped with grid-forming inverter technology, allowing it to provide essential system strength services and inertia which have historically been provided by baseload coal and gas power plants.
“Battery storage is an essential technology in the transition to renewable energy, allowing us to smooth out variable generation and store electricity for when it’s needed,” ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said. “Next generation grid-scale batteries will underpin this transition, with inverter technology that can maintain grid stability without fossil fuels.”
Neoen Chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said the Blyth Battery will also demonstrate the potential of renewable generation coupled with energy storage as the future of Australia’s baseload power supply.
“We are delighted to be building our second storage asset in South Australia, the state where we delivered the world’s first big battery back in 2017,” he said.
“Blyth Battery will play an essential role in providing 24/7 energy, serving as a template for future baseload contracts for our customers, both in Australia and in our other countries.”

The Blyth Battery is Neoen’s fifth big battery in Australia, elevating the company’s total Australian assets close to 3 GW in operation or under construction with its storage portfolio approaching 1 GW.
“Neoen is now operating at the gigawatt scale in storage, making us one of the leading global players in batteries and one of the true accelerators of the energy transition,” Barbaro said.
Neoen, whose 150 MW/194 MWh Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia was the first grid-scale storage project in the country, also owns and operates the 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery and is building the 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery in the Australian Capital Territory and the 200 MW/400 MWh Western Downs Battery in Queensland.
The company has also received state government approval to build a stand-alone 1 GW/4 GWh battery near the town of Collie in Western Australia and is pursuing plans to develop a 200 MW/400 MWh battery facility to be built near Chittering in the state’s Wheatbelt region. Neoen is also developing a 500 MW/1000 MWh battery near Wallerawang in New South Wales.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/09/unsw-researchers-say-solar-needs-to-slim-down-on-silver/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 9, 2023",UNSW researchers say solar needs to slim down on silver,"Solar cells use silver to conduct the electric charge out of the cell and into the system. Each cell produced today requires just a few milligrams of the precious metal, but this quickly adds up and plenty of recent studies have illustrated how the rapidly growing solar industry could exhaust much of the world’s known silver reserves by 2050 or even earlier.
Even before the alarm began to be raised about availability of silver, cell makers were keen to cut their consumption of it anyway, as it is one of the most costly materials used in solar manufacturing. Now, new research from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) shows silver reduction efforts need to ramp up significantly to avoid a supply problem, particularly with the introduction of new n-type technologies that require more silver than the PERC cells that still represent more than 80% of the market today.
The UNSW group’s latest paper, “The silver learning curve for photovoltaics and projected silver demand for net-zero emissions by 2050,” was recently published in Progress in Photovoltaics. It examines the impact of different PV technology pathways on silver demand.
“The results show that the current rate of reduction in silver consumption is not sufficient to avoid increasing silver demand from the PV industry and that the transition to high-efficiency technologies including TOPCon and SHJ could greatly increase silver demand, posing price and supply risks,” the researchers said.
The key conclusion is that increased investment is needed in research and development of “silver-lean” PV technologies, and recent achievements with copper plating are presented as particularly promising.
“Although plating requires a major change from existing manufacturing practices, copper plating represents a promising opportunity to accelerate the reduction of silver usage by the PV industry, while overcoming any physical constraints imposed by printing technology,” the group said.
Over the longer term, the recycling of older solar modules could provide a significant source of silver. However, further investment and research is needed here, and it may still be several decades before the volume of PV waste processed each year is enough for more than a marginal contribution of new silver.
The scientists further warn against relying on the possibility of increased silver production, noting that the most accessible silver resources have already been mined. They said that opening up new mines will likely mean digging deeper or processing lower quality ores – all of which leads to increased energy consumption.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/09/huasun-unveils-715-w-heterojunction-solar-module/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 9, 2023",Huasun unveils 715 W heterojunction solar module,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese PV module manufacturer Huasun has unveiled new bifacial, dual-glass HJT solar panels for ground-mounted PV applications.
Huasun originally introduced the G12 Himalaya series in mid-2022. It came in five versions, with power outputs ranging from 680 W to 700 W. It has now announced a new 715 W module, certified by TÜV SÜD Group.
“Recently, Huasun’s Himalaya G12-132 HJT module successfully passed the full sequence test of TÜV SÜD Group and obtained the standard certification IEC61215 on PV module performance,” the company said in a statement. “The maximum output power of the module has reached a breakthrough of 715W, setting a new high in the power of the same dimension of PV modules in the industry.”
The first five variants have power conversion efficiencies ranging from 21.90% to 22.5%. The open-circuit voltage is between 49.5 V and 50.13 V and the short-circuit current spans from 17.19 A and 17.43 A. Huasun did not disclose the efficiency rating of the 715 W module.
The new panels measure 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm and weigh 38.7 kg. They feature 132 half-cut monocrystalline HJT cells measuring 210 mm x 105 mm, combined with single-sided microcrystalline and super multi busbar (SMBB) cell technology.
“It has double-glass structure, encapsulated with PIB, which not only has the high-efficiency properties of HJT, but also has better water resistance and anti-PID performance,” the company said.
The new products can operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and feature an IP67/IP68 enclosure, with black anodised aluminum frames. They have a temperature coefficient of -0.26% per degree Celsius and their operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C. Both sides of the bifacial modules are covered with 2.0 mm glass. Their bifaciality reportedly reaches up to 85%
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 15-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 88% of the nominal output power.
Huasun expects its production capacity to exceed 10 GW in 2023.
