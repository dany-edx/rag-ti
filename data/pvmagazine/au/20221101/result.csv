The company entered the Australian market through its takeover of UPC/AC Renewables, which began in stages in 2021 and is scheduled for completion in early 2023. Once the acquisition is fully completed, UPC/AC Renewables will be absorbed into the ACEN Australia brand.
In terms of the company’s projects, it is currently developing the massive 720 MW New England solar farm and battery project near Uralla in northern New South Wales (NSW).
It is also progressing the 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW / 200 MWh battery energy storage project in NSW, as well as the proposed 600 MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project.

ACEN Australia holds a share in the Rise Renewables 250 MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300 MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia, not to mention the 160 MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system.
CEFC’s support comes as part of a $600 million debt raise from ACEN Australia, which in September also executed a loan agreement with Japanese lender MUFG for up to $140 million and a $100 million facility agreement with DBS Bank Australia.
The company says the funds will allow it to expedite the “fully developed” 400 MW Stubbo Solar project, which is slated for construction commencement in January 2023.
ACEN International COO, Patrice Clause, said the finance from CEFC will also help the company reach its target of 4 GW of attributable capacity before the end of. 2022.
ACEN is seeking to grow its renewable portfolio in the Asia Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030. The company has previously said the Philippines will remain its core market but it plans to “aggressively grow its investments in Australia,” which is expected to be its second largest market within the decade.
ACEN said it will also continue to grow its presence in Vietnam, Indonesia and India.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/01/the-rise-of-the-full-stack-strategy/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,EV,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 1, 2022",Rise of the ‘full stack’ strategy,"As the decarbonisation deadline draws ever closer, there was a resounding damnation of yesteryear’s “piecemeal approach” among the attendees of 2022’s All Energy event. This holds as true for the big picture national energy strategy as it does for the residential segment, where brands like QCells, Maxeon SunPower, even SMA sought to demonstrate their new energy ‘ecosystems.’
The problem this strategy seeks to solve comes down to fatigue. Shopping for solar is exhausting, and every additional technology from the inverter to the home battery adds another layer of complexity. The assumption is then that by making one sleek, integrated product family, the customer can have a single point of contact under a single brand with a single bill and single warranty set, allowing them to take a singular sigh of relief.

“There’s a real need for simplicity and one of the ways to deliver simplicity is by stacking things together from one provider,” Mick Fell, General Manager at Qcells Australia, tells pv magazine Australia.
The premise is hardly novel – as Fell points out, it is how the majority of Australians today came to have their smartphones. That is, a telco company aggregates hardware, software, and services into one offering so tight “we just don’t think about it anymore,” Fell says. 
Like these mobile plans, energy propositions are increasingly including a finance component, which enables customers to pay month to month, rather than outlay one great expense at the get-go.
“I think the thing that makes a massive difference for integrated solution providers is, instead of saying ‘here’s a solution, give me $20,000,’ is saying ‘here’s a solution, it will deliver a service which is equivalent to the service you used to get from your old electricity provider at a cheaper price and you’ll get one bill,” Fell says.

But in a country like Australia, where the majority of low hanging solar homes likely already have the technology, the question becomes: is the remaining market big enough to warrant all these branded home energy stacks?
In regions where the rooftop segment is still nascent, integrated solutions are proving an important selling point, Managing Director for BayWa r.e Solar Distribution in South East Asia, Junrhey Castro, tells pv magazine Australia.
In countries like Thailand and the Philippines, fully integrated systems with battery storage and electric vehicle (EV) charging are, Castro says, in fact inspiring investment in the residential sector. This is especially true in wealthy circles, where technologies like solar and EVs add to social status.
Likewise, integration has been decisive in Europe. In countries like Germany, where Maxeon Solar Technologies’ Executive Vice President Ralf Elias heralds from, the vast majority of rooftop solar systems today are installed as a component of a larger, integrated home energy suite.
For Elias, the value of this integration became obvious when he installed his own solar system a few years ago. The interfaces between products quickly emerged as a “pain point” for him and an issue ripe for solving with better interindustry cooperation.
Maxeon, which sells in most parts of the world under the SunPower brand, is building its SunPower One suite by working with what Elias calls “category leaders.” As Elias points out, it doesn’t make sense for Maxeon to try to compete with technology experts in different fields, but rather build tight working relationships so their product lines fit seamlessly together.

Earlier this month, Maxeon announced its partnership with Star Charge, folding its EV charging products into the SunPower One suite. The company has also been working with Enphase, integrating its microinverter solutions, with plans to bring heat pumps, virtual power plants (VPP) and energy automation software into the fold within the next year. For some of these technologies, Maxeon plans to work with several partners to build scope and flexibility.
Which brings us to a clear issue in the full stack strategy – how to provide enough variation to cater to the different needs of households all within the one neat, easily deployable umbrella. 
Currently, Maxeon’s SunPower One battery storage hardware and hybrid inverter technology comes from Alpha ESS, with the company offering a 10 KWh battery and 5 kW hybrid inverter.
It will offer more battery sizing options in future, but for the time being this is the standard. To capture the booming interest in renewable systems amid soaring energy prices though, providing appropriate variations for different sized households seems like something that requires addressing urgently.

South Korea’s QCells is slightly further along in its vertical stack offering, having already integrated with VPPs and currently offering a modular battery design which can scale to 20.5 kWh. Likewise, Energizer’s Homepower ‘eco suite’ affords customers the ability to scale their batteries to a maximum of 24.4 kWh.
Even German inverter brand SMA is focusing on integration, investing significantly to build its software and grow its energy management platform, alongside its EV charger and home battery offerings, Boris Wolff, SMA’s Executive Vice President of Global Sales, told pv magazine Australia.
Coming back to QCells though, in October the company announced a finance partnership with loan-provider Plenti. The partnership speaks to the clear need to address cost, since a stacked system is a considerable investment.
This money question also leads back to one about the market’s actual size – especially in Australia. Here, suburbs in a number of states are already reaching up into 50% rooftop penetration – basically all of which has been installed in yesteryear’s dreaded piecemeal approach. With very few of these systems nearing their end of life, a big chunk of the ‘integrated’ market would then appear to be lost.

The focus then becomes new customers – households likely falling into the ‘late majority’ segment in the technology uptake curve. 
It is a market QCell’s MD Mick Fell acknowledges is relatively small, with roughly 7 million households in Australia “left” without solar, most of which have glaring barriers to entry – be they rented or apartments. 
Despite this – he’s optimistic the market will grow, largely at the hands of more comprehensive government subsidies for things like batteries, energy management, EVs and heat pump technologies.
“One way to think about it is ‘let’s grid it all out postcode by postcode, who’s left, who has blockers.’ It’s all very cold and unemotional. The other way to think about it is just to go ‘on the basis of equity, everyone should have access to this,’” Fell says.
“So whether you’re living in a fancy apartment or whether you’re living in a house you own in a country town and can’t afford to put on solar, how do we make it so those people have not just solar but the potential to access things like batteries and EVs and they’re able to electrify and get away from things like gas. I think once you frame the question like that, the answer becomes different.”

For Fell, the clearest “answer” is for governments to offer the “quick and dirty” solution of handing money to, say, landlords to install systems on properties they lease.
Complex solutions like neighbourhood batteries – which were given attention in last week’s federal budget – have a greater tendency to stall in Fell’s eyes. While the community approach might grapple with the question of equity in a far more nuanced way, he says the industry just isn’t ready to deliver those solutions in the same way it is ready to deliver rooftop solar and individual batteries.
“Civil and project development of any community asset is hard, even if it’s a playground. Whereas hanging assets on the side of someone’s wall or sticking them in someone’s garage is somewhat easy. Around 10,000 people here are trained to do that right now,” Fell says.

“The industry is set up to deliver solar on roof, battery in garage and increasingly providing services [like VPPs] to customers who are interested and signing up to them. Certainly the electricity retailer industry has been around for years as a competitive industry and it’s very good at what it does when it goes out there to acquire customers and so all these things are things that people know how to do.”
Certainly, integrated product suites do hold clear promise for easy and rapid installation, and a faster rollout overall.
But realising this will also require retailers and installers to adjust their business approach, moving from bundling their own favoured technologies to selling under single brands. 
To this end, Maxeon’s Vice President for APAC Sales, Chris O’Brien, says the company has focused on providing a single tool for their retail partners to use to design customer’s product suites. Again, O’Brien told pv magazine Australia, the goal is on ease which, in turn, will hopefully lead to efficiency.
Whether governments will indeed open the subsidy flood gates that would enable a significant market for these fully stacked suites in Australia, only time will tell.

Jinko Solar said on Friday that it sold 10,286 MW of solar modules and 570 MW of solar cells and wafers in the third quarter of 2022, up 117.4% year on year.
Sales increased by 127.8% on the year to USD 2.74 billion ($4.28b). Its net profit in the third quarter was USD 77.3 million.
Xiande Li, the CEO of Jinko Solar, said he expects China alone to see more than 40 GW of photovoltaic installations in the fourth quarter. He said this means that polysilicon prices will be high, but module prices will remain stable for now.
Li said that Jinko Solar has reached full production capacity for TOPCon solar cells, at 16 GW. Now, it aims to narrow the cost gap between n-type and p-type products. In the third quarter, it shipped around 3 GW of n-type modules, up 160% from the preceding quarter.
“Based on our business strategy and market demand, we have adjusted the pace of capacity expansion for wafers, cells and modules and expect our annual production capacity for monowafers, solar cells and solar modules to reach 65 GW, 55 GW and 70 GW, respectively, by the end of 2022,” said Li.
The company said it expects to sell between 13 GW and 15 GW of PV modules in the fourth quarter.

Anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries due to its low cost, non-toxicity and abundance. However, the low electronic conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics at high rates are holding back practical applications.
A team of researchers from the College of Materials Science and Engineering at Qingdao University in China has demonstrated a sol-gel approach to the synthesis of thermally stable anatase nanoparticles with a carbon shell as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries.
When the synthesised anatase was tested in a half battery, the researchers found that the battery exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 228 mAh g-1 – at a current density of 0.05 A g g-1 with 100% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 1 A g-1.
In-situ X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy results have revealed a nearly zero-strain characteristic of anatase during charge/discharge processes. In-situ transmission electron microscopy, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy results suggested an irreversible sodiation-activation process to form a sodiated-TiO2 phase during the initial discharge process.
A full coin cell assembled with anatase as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode delivered an energy density of 220 Wh kg.The scientists reported their results in “Sodium-ion Storage Properties of Thermally Stable Anatase,” which was recently published in Energy Material Advances.
Operando analysis
A joint research group from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, meanwhile, has used operando techniques to observe how solvated natrium ions embed themselves in electrodes.
The storage of ions, when accompanied by their solvation shell in a crystal lattice, is referred to as “co-intercalation.” Up to this point, this concept was limited to the negative electrode of the sodium-ion battery. Now, Berlin-based researchers have succeeded in extending the concept to the positive electrode of the battery.
“With titanium disulphide (TiS2) and graphite, we have for the first time combined two materials that absorb and release the same solvent during charging and discharging of the battery,” said Guillermo A. Ferrero, one of the researchers behind “Co-intercalation batteries (CoIBs): Role of TiS2 as electrode for storing solvated Na ions,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
The scientists could observe changes in the material during charging and discharging via operando measurements performed in the X-Ray Core Lab at HZB on the LIMAX 160. This helped them to assign the co-intercalation mechanism inside the battery.
“The process of co-intercalation could improve upon efficiency by enabling better low temperature performance,” said Katherine A. Mazzio of HZB. “It could also be utilised to improve upon alternative cell concepts such as using multi-valent ions instead of Li+ or Na+ storage that are particularly sensitive to the solvation shell.”
