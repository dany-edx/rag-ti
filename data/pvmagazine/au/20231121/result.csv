The $1.4 billion project is set to use technology from Johnson Matthey (JM), which Abel Energy described as the “world’s leading methanol synthesis technology and catalyst supplier.” 
It will also use biomass gasification technology and equipment systems from SunGas Renewables, a subsidiary of US-based GTI International. Abel said it has been working closely with both companies on the design and optimisation studies to fully integrate these technologies into the proposed Bell Bay facility.
The scale of the Bell Bay project has “increased substantially” since the company published its Knowledge-Sharing Report in June 2022 off the back of its $1.3 million feasibility study, partly funded by the Tasmanian government. 
“The increase in scale is partly in response to an extraordinary surge in forward demand for green methanol as a shipping fuel over the last 12 months,” Abel said. “The surge in demand for green methanol follows a host of new orders by most of the world’s major container shipping companies, led by Danish multinational A.P. Moller – Mǽrsk,” it added.
The project will now require 240 MW of electrolysis to produce the green hydrogen which will eventually become methanol.
The Bell Bay project is focussed on exports, with Abel noting its annual production is three times Australia’s current methanol consumption.
In June, Abel announced that it and its partner, Spanish energy group Iberdrola, had inked a deal to secure a site for the project. It plans to redevelop the mothballed Bell Bay Power Station, which was shuttered in 2009.

While two of the projects are in Australia, by far the company’s biggest spend will be in the US. 
Around $835 million (USD 550 million) will go towards the  Phoenix Hydrogen Hub, an electrolyser and liquefaction facility in Arizona. Stage one of the project is planned to include an 80 MW electrolyser and liquefaction facility capable of producing up to 12,000 tonnes of liquified green hydrogen annually. Fortescue expects to begin construction on the Phoenix hub in the second half of 2024, and is aiming for first production in mid-2026.
Just yesterday, the company also revealed plans for a new clean energy technology manufacturing plant in the US, lauding and looking to take advantage of the country’s Inflation Reduction Act.

In Australia, Fortescue is moving forward with the first stage of its 50 MW Gladstone project which will sit adjacent to its existing Gladstone electrolyser manufacturing facility. The project is set to use Fortescue’s own proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers manufactured next door, with 30 MW of electrolyser capacity expected to begin being installed in 2024. The further 20 MW is expected in 2028, depending on the availability of water, the company said.
Finally, the company’s board has approved its green iron pilot plant at Christmas Creek in the Pilbara. Just $76 million (USD 50 million) has been set aside for this project, which is seeking to pilot new pure green ironmaking in Western Australia.
Fortescue’s energy division, formerly known as Fortescue Future Industries, increased its capital expenditure guidance this financial year to USD 500 million from USD 400 million (to $760 million from $608 million).
Conservative newspaper The Australian noted it has been three years since the Fortescue boss, billionaire Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest, started telling shareholders the company would be producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year. These projects will only produce around 19,000 tonnes per year, the paper noted.
The future of some of the company’s lauded projects like the Gibson Island green hydrogen and ammonia project in Queensland remain unclear. The company said that project still requires more work, pointing out Australia “still suffers structurally high green electricity costs.”

In terms of the general meeting (AGM) held this morning in Perth, shareholders rejected the company’s contentious executive pay and bonus policy. Fortescue has been mired in news of shock departures of senior executives this last year.
There was also a technical malfunction which meant Forrest’s microphone continued casting following the closure of the event, with attendees noting they could hear the non-executive chairman complaining about the duration of the meeting.

It has now revealed that about 6,000 of the recalled batteries have not yet been located, adding that “about 8,000 affected LG batteries remain at risk in homes across Australia.”
At least nine incidents of property damage involving the LG batteries have been reported to the ACCC and, in one case, a personal injury. “One home has been completely destroyed by a fire linked to an LG battery overheating,” a statement issued by Australia’s Assistant Treasurer, Stephen Jones, noted.

“Thousands of people may be unaware they live in homes that have one of these affected batteries installed in their solar energy system,” ACCC Deputy Chair, Catriona Lowe, said. “It is vitally important that everyone with a solar system checks their battery now to make sure they keep their family safe.”
The repeated warning for Australian battery owners comes amid reports of a spate of battery fires in Europe that have been linked to LG-branded batteries.
The first recall for the battery systems was issued in February 2021, at which time it was estimated that 7,200 systems were involved. The scope of the recall has since been expanded several times.
“When these batteries malfunction there is a serious risk of injury or death due to the affected batteries overheating and causing a fire,” the ACCC has said.
“LG will provide a refund, replacement or software update to fix the problem, and has also committed to paying compensation to consumers who incur higher energy bills while their system is switched off,” the watchdog added.
Further information is available at Product Safety Australia, and at the following recall notices: PRA 2020/18529 and PRA 2022/19550 and PRA 2022/19420.

In an update released this morning, the Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator (CER) said the new installer and designer accreditation scheme operator will not be charging a fee to transition accreditation from the previous CEC scheme. “The new [scheme operator] will honour CEC accreditation expiry dates and fees paid,” it added.
Fees will, however, be due on expiry of installers’ existing CEC accreditation. “If your accreditation expires on or after the CER has made and announced its decision, you must accredit yourself with the new [scheme operator] to remain eligible for STCs [small-scale technology certificates]. This will attract a fee.” No details on the fees have been made public.
Solar installers and designers will have three months, so until May 2024, to transition their accreditation to remain eligible to claim Australia’s solar rebate in the form of STCs.
There are no immediate changes to the requirements for accreditation, meaning installers and designers will not need to complete any additional training at this point.
The CER said one new scheme operator has been selected, and another application refused. This would suggest only two organisations applied to take over the role, but this is not confirmed.
The CEC has released information to assist CEC accredited persons to prepare for the transition to the new scheme operator.
The role of publishing Australia’s approved solar products and equipment lists has also gone to market. Again, this role was previously the remit of the Clean Energy Council. The Clean Energy Regulator previously said it expects to announce its proposed nomination for the product list role between March and April 2024.*
*Article amended on November 23 to reflect that the role of product list publishing is still being decided, and it may be possible the CEC retains the role.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/21/china-module-prices-hit-new-record-lows-operating-rates-estimated-around-60/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 21, 2023","China module prices hit new record lows, operating rates estimated around 60%","From pv magazine Global
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), which is the OPIS benchmark for mono PERC modules from China, and TOPCon module prices hit another historical low this week falling USD 0.008 per Watt peak (wp) and USD 0.002/wp to USD 0.130 and USD 0.140/wp respectively, according to OPIS data. Weak market sentiment and lackluster export demand continue to weigh on the module segment.
Module prices have fallen for a fourth consecutive week with CMM seeing its largest percentage drop of 5.8% in over two months. Most buyers and sellers priced mono PERC modules in the USD 0.120-130/wp range and TOPCon modules in the USD 0.130-140/wp range. Successively lower prices continue to emerge, a module seller said. “Now, we all don’t know how to predict module prices,” he said.

Module manufacturers have lowered their manufacturing output due to the oversupplied market, with one stakeholder estimating the segment’s overall operating rates are 50-60% lower than the previous 70-80%. A module seller said that his firm’s operating rate is now around 60%. “In the present stage, maintaining current operating rates is enough,” he said. Small factories “with inefficient production capacity” that can’t maintain rates will gradually exit the market, he said.
China’s export markets continue to look weak. Installation rates will slow as Europe celebrates the Christmas holidays in December, said one stakeholder. Low-priced cargoes continue to be offered in Europe, according to multiple people. People are frantically attempting to “clear their inventories,” said one module seller. Persisting with these low prices means “victory,” an employee at a tier-1 solar major said. “If you can’t carry on, you’ll go bankrupt,” he said.
Weakness was evident in other export markets too. Module imports in Brazil, the largest solar market in Latin America, could decrease at least 11.2% year-to-year, assuming total imports of up to 15.8 GW in 2023, according to Brazilian consultancy Greener. “Everyone is not doing well,” said a module manufacturer with clients in Brazil. According to multiple sources, prices in Southeast Asia below USD 0.130/wp for PERC are low but realistic.
Prices are expected to keep falling. One module maker is offering PERC modules at 0.99 yuan/wp this week, which is a signal that the market is on the threshold of the psychologically significant barrier of 1 yuan/wp.
The entire solar value chain will “go through a phase of inventory-clearing before the end of the year,” a module manufacturer said. Bottom prices across the value chain will come between December and China’s Spring Festival next year. After the 1 yuan/wp era arrives, “one may wonder when we will see [prices] below USD 0.10/wp,” a solar market veteran said.
