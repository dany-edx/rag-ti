Chinese solar manufacturer JinkoSolar claimed to have reached a 25.25% conversion efficiency for a large-area, n-type, TOPCon, monocrystalline-silicon cell.
The result was confirmed by China’s National Institute of Metrology and beats the company’s previous record of 24.9%, achieved in January.
“Material upgrades integrated into the cell process and fabrication on a practical size of 267.4cm2 of high-quality monocrystalline Czochralski (CZ) silicon substrates allowed the Company to achieve 25.25% cell efficiency,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “To achieve this extremely high solar cell efficiency using ultra-thin polysilicon, several advanced technologies have been implemented including JinkoSolar’s high-quality N-type wafer, passivating contact technologies, advanced diffusion system, surface passivation, metallisation of crystalline solar cells and other innovative technologies.”
In January 2020, when the cell had, still, an efficiency of 24.2%, Jinko said it was based on its HOT design and featured tunnel-oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) technology. The cell features a 267.72cm2 monocrystalline silicon substrate grown using the Czochralski method. At the time, JinkoSolar had also announced it achieved a 23.1% conversion efficiency for an n-type monocrystalline solar PV module based on this cell technology.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/01/wa-oil-and-gas-company-enters-green-hydrogen-market-by-acquiring-stake-in-patriot-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 1, 2021",WA oil and gas company enters ‘green’ hydrogen market by acquiring stake in Patriot Hydrogen,"Prominence Energy’s 20% acquisition of Australian green hydrogen business Patriot Hydrogen is to “complement” the company’s oil and gas activities, it said.
Patriot Hydrogen’s intention is to construct a ‘biomass to hydrogen’ plant at Port Anthony in Victoria. Patriot holds a binding term sheet to lease the site and construct the plant, which is expected to take around 12 months to be planned, constructed, commissioned and reach steady state production of two tonnes of hydrogen per day.
Patriot and its major oil and gas stakeholder Prominence join a growing number of not only Australian hydrogen projects, but specifically projects seeking to produce hydrogen by burning biomass – essentially wood. While burning wood emits carbon, it is classified as net zero because technically trees grow back and then can subsequently “recapture” the emitted carbon.
Patriot Hydrogen also plans to licence and develop its brand “Patriot 2 Hydrogen (P2H) units” which are modular and designed to bypass some of the infrastructure challenges associated with the sale and use of hydrogen.
Prominence Energy, a public company based in Perth (ASX: PRM) has set out to raise AU$3.2 million to facilitate not only the acquisition of Patriot Hydrogen but also its Bowsprit drilling program, an oil venture in Louisiana, United States.
“It is exciting to be drilling and appraising the upside potential of Bowsprit this year and announcing our first step into the hydrogen sector. We believe the Patriot investment is an exciting entry for PRM into the growing Australian Hydrogen sector,” Alexander Parks, Managing Director of Prominence Energy, said in a statement.
The growing investments of fossil fuel companies in Australia’s burgeoning hydrogen sector has caused concern in many circles, with a choir of voices warning that without proper oversight the green “future fuel” could become a fossil lifeline.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/01/nsw-launches-renewable-gas-certification-pilot-as-debate-around-the-sectors-decarbonisation-escalates/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 1, 2021",NSW launches renewable gas certification pilot as debate around the sector’s decarbonisation escalates,"The Renewable Gas Certification Pilot is the result of partnerships between the NSW state government; electricity and gas company, Jemena; renewable energy accreditation program, GreenPower; and Energy Networks Australia, the industry body in charge of network transmission infrastructure.
The scheme will be piloted at the Malabar Biomethane Injection Project, Australia’s first wastewater biomethane facility. The new facility will convert raw biogas into biomethane, which will then be injected back into the NSW gas distribution network.
Minister for Water, Property and Housing Melinda Pavey said by using Sydney Water’s existing biomass and waste streams the project will be turning waste into clean energy.
“As part of the treatment process, Sydney Water produces biogas, which is about 60% methane. A combustion engine transforms this biogas into electricity and heat to power Sydney Water’s Wastewater Treatment Plants,” Pavey said.
“From 2022, approximately 95,000 gigajoules of biomethane will be generated each year through Australia’s first biomethane-to gas project – enough to meet the gas demand of 6300 homes.”
NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment
The pilot will design and test a simplified renewable gas registry, which will make renewable gas available to a “small number” of customers in early 2022, around the same time as the Malabar Biomethane Injection Project is scheduled to come online.
GreenPower, which is managed by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, will administer the pilot, providing independent verification of the creation and use of renewable gas.
Tim Stock, Chair of the National GreenPower Steering Group, said biomethane produced from existing biomass and waste streams is a major opportunity for decarbonisation and recycling of waste.
Head of Gas at Energy Networks Australia (ENA), Dennis Van Puyvelde, said body was supporting the pilot through customer research and advice on the design of the scheme.
“Customers are looking for options to purchase renewable gas and this requires appropriate certification schemes to be developed,” he said.
“The design project conducted by ENA and Energetics will help inform the pilot which will enable gas users to purchase renewable gas and to do so with confidence.
“Investing in Australia’s renewable gas industry is vital if Australia is to reach net zero emissions and deploying gases such as hydrogen and biomethane is a logical pathway to achieving a decarbonised gas network.”
Jemena
While hydrogen is referenced in statements about the NSW program, whether the “future fuel” will be part of the pilot’s future is not yet clear. The program’s announcement follows a massive year for hydrogen projects in Australia though, with many gas companies and networks openly hailing it as their future at the Australian Hydrogen Conference held last week in Sydney.
Blending hydrogen into natural gas pipelines is being lauded as one of the quickest and easiest ways of abating some of the sector’s carbon emissions. There are a number of programs seeking to mix up to 10% hydrogen into gas pipelines underway or being planned across Australia currently.
Despite moving towards decarbonisation, many have voiced concerns that hydrogen becoming ensconced with natural gas could make it lifeline for fossil fuel, elongating its existence in the grid rather than shortening it. Former prime minister Malcom Turnbull, speaking at last week’s conference, urged participants to be wary of this, noting that gas is responsible for an enormous amount of emissions in Australia. Turnbull went on to describe hydrogen as “fashionable” saying fossil fuel companies are trying to “slip in” to the growing market.

Though hydrogen only emits water when burned, the fuel can only be considered carbon-free depending on how it was made. Despite being the most abundant molecule on earth, hydrogen is rarely found by itself and therefore needs to be produced – this can either be done through electrolysis powered by renewables like wind and solar energy (producing green hydrogen) or through fossil-fuel powered processes (essentially the production of blue, grey, or brown hydrogen). Green hydrogen accounts for less than 1% of the hydrogen made today.
As part of the NSW pilot, GreenPower would be in charge of auditing the green credentials of the gas in the program.
“Established in 1997, the GreenPower program has expanded nationally and successfully made renewable electricity available through energy retailers, driving almost $900 million in investment into the renewable energy sector since 2005,” Stock, Chair of the National GreenPower Steering Group, said.
Drawing on this long history of recognising renewable energy sources, GreenPower will see renewable gas accreditation become available in a similar way in the NSW pilot.
Jemena Executive General Manager of Energy Networks, Shaun Reardon said the Renewable Gas Certification Pilot would inform the development of a permanent certification scheme for renewable gases. Numerous bodies in Australia are seeking to certify hydrogen’s origins in Australia, including the Smart Energy Council and more recently the Clean Energy Regulator – though GreenPower in this program seems to be targeting multiple gases in this program rather than just hydrogen.
Utility company Jemena, which owns gas and electricity infrastructure on the east coast and northern Australia, last week called for a renewable gas target in Australia, saying it is a crucial step to achieving net-zero emissions.
Jemena’s Managing Director, Frank Tudor, said a Renewable Gas Target would likely replicate the success of the Renewable Energy Target (RET) which helped to spur the development of renewable technologies in the electricity sector.
“This is the jump-start the gas sector needs to truly commercialise zero-emission gases such as hydrogen and biomethane and make them available to Australian homes and businesses at scale,” said Tudor.   
 
“By decarbonising our existing gas infrastructure we can avoid unnecessarily building new alternative forms of energy infrastructure, which will have a significant impact on customer bills.
“In the short-term this will make the transition to a low-carbon future seamless and means Australian homes and businesses can continue to use their gas stoves, heaters, and other appliances.
“From 2050, conservative estimates suggest Australian energy consumers can save anywhere between $12 to $14 billion per annum by simply utilising existing gas infrastructure to decarbonise our economy.”
“We believe a Renewable Gas Target could see up to 9PJs of zero-carbon gas injected into Jemena’s New South Wales gas distribution network by 2030. This would remove around 464,000 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere each year, the equivalent of over 200,000 cars, and help New South Wales achieve a 10% renewable gas target. Our initial analysis has found that this can be done at an estimated cost of around $15 for a typical NSW household,” Tudor said.

Switzerland-based start-up PWRstation has developed a container-based retractable PV system solution that is claimed to allow a large number of solar panels to be deployed very quickly by a single person.
The solution is based on the company’s Exorac Tryptic racking technology which can include two racks able to host up to 30 solar panels. The system can be retracted, tilted and locked into the container, which the manufacturer says protects it from threats such as theft, vandalism or hurricanes.
The racking system is designed in Switzerland at the company’s headquarters, which also manages the suppliers of the components, distributed between Europe and Asia, the routing to the assembly sites and the delivery to customers.
“We are working on a 40-foot container product for the military and emergency response markets, which will offer 100 solar arrays of 3 kW each that can be loaded and unloaded in less than half an hour,” the company’s CEO and founder, Roberto Albertella, told pv magazine.
The price for a tryptic able to host 15 solar modules is CHF 6,350 ($7,050). This price includes 15 lightweight solar panels rated at 375 Wp each. A double-door container can accommodate two tryptics. PWRstation only provides the PV solution, including the Exorac deployment system and solar modules.
The solution is sold to customers that design solutions for power generation, water or air treatment and other applications that require solar energy. It is more complex and more expensive than traditional PV installations, as it is designed to be easily relocated to allow the use of solar energy in locations where a fixed installation is not an option. “Exorac-based systems are suitable for use in the military, to preserve freedom of movement, and in emergency response to quickly deploy a reliable energy source that is not dependent on supply logistics, as is the case with diesel for example,” Albertella further explained.
The mobility of PV implies a good compromise between the costs and weight of the components, he added. “The heavier the modules, the stronger and more expensive the support structure must be. Therefore traditional modules, which are cheap but heavy, may be a less good choice than lightweight modules, which are more expensive but have lower racking costs.”
PWRstation has decided to adopt lightweight and powerful semi-rigid modules and has adapted them to its products in order to achieve the maximum degree of integration and optimisation.
The Swiss start-up has also developed a small six-module unit, called Veetoo, which is intended for use in military deployments of semi-permanent installations of unlimited size or for flat roofs in commercial and industrial applications. “These small six-module units can be folded up in the blink of an eye, allowing for roof maintenance or even total re-roofing, without having to dismantle the PV system,” Albertella emphasised. “More than half of the commercial and industrial roofs are still left unused because of their age, which is an obstacle for non-folding racking systems.”
The company’s main markets are island regions such as the Caribbean for containerised and hurricane-resistant solutions. For the Veetoo product, the US market for commercial and industrial installations with capacities between 300 kW and 2-3 MW is the primary target.
PWRstation has already sold its systems to companies such as Schneider Electric, humanitarian organisations such as UNHCR and delivered a donation installation to Iniciativa Comunitaria in San-Juan (PR) in partnership with Schneider Electric and local partners.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/01/solar-catamaran-100-powered-by-heterojunction-modules-headed-for-australia/,"MARKETS,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 1, 2021",Solar catamaran 100% powered by heterojunction modules headed for Australia,"From pv magazine Global
A catamaran designed by English racer and engineer Phil Morrison and set to undertake a 100-day solo transatlantic trip from Chile to Australia will be exclusively powered by a PV power generator.
The boat will be helmed by Russian adventurer and survivalist Fedor Konyukhov in a first-ever solo transpacific 9,000 nautical mile expedition from Chile to Australia, which is set to start in December.
Called Nova, the vessel is 11m long, 7m wide and able to reach speeds of 5-7 knots. It is made of carbon-fibre composites and weighs only 2.2 tons. “The craft is designed to break down into two hulls and four deck sections, which together with ancillary equipment, launching and assembly, will fit into two 40ft containers,” Morrison said in a statement.
The boat is equipped with an 11 kW PV system built with flexible heterojunction solar panels developed by Russian module maker Hevel Solar. “The cost of solar elements plus labor and without the storage system was RUB 1.1 million, which makes up to €12,000,” a spokesperson from the manufacturer told pv magazine.
The solar array will cover a surface of around 66 m2 on the vessel and the sides of the hull will also carry panels, providing an additional 12m2 per side. “Whilst these panels are not expected to be as efficient as the deck panels it is hoped they will gather valuable additional energy when the sun is low on the horizon and from light reflected off the water surface,” Hevel Solar explained.
The PV system will also ensure the supply of freshwater, as the boat is equipped with a desalination system powered by solar-generated electricity itself.
The catamaran is also equipped with an energy storage system designed by Enel X, a unit of Italian utility Enel. The system relies on 26 Li-Fe-phosphate batteries to ensure a stable power supply for the PV system, which could peak in excess of 5 kW in ideal conditions. “Sophisticated MPPT charge controllers capable of adjusting the current and voltage to maximise the charging potential will be allied with a complex monitoring system allowing the craft to optimise the power obtained,” Morrison stated.
Nova is claimed to be able to navigate with full autonomy in the ocean for up to six months.
The boat was also conceived with technologies provided by Mikhail Lifshitz, general designer at ROTEC JSC, which specialises in developing methods to power sea and river vessels using electricity-supplied engines, solar panels and the albedo effect.
