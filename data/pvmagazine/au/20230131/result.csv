The company says the acquisition followed an extensive period of working with the project’s initial developer, Tetris Energy, and local authorities to bring the project to shovel-ready status.
The acquisition builds on MPower’s Build-Own-Operate strategy, through which it plans to establish a distributed portfolio of “exempt” solar energy and battery storage projects across Australia. MPower says it currently has binding Asset Purchase Agreements for two similar projects in New South Wales and Victoria, both of which are approaching shovel-ready status.
“The Faraday site is directly aligned with our stated strategy to build a network of efficient 5 MW projects that can supply stable clean energy to regional areas,” MPower CEO Nathan Wise said.
This focus on the mid-scale segment is growing in Australia, with projects of 5 MW or less being particularly attractive as they can avoid more protracted and precarious grid connection processes.
The sub-5 MW strategy has been deployed by companies including Yes Group and SEI, as well as Green Gold Energy. Speaking during the 2022 All Energy Conference in Melbourne, the team at Green Gold told pv magazine Australia it can take just six to 12 months to develop and realise these mid-scale projects, with the company noting the ease of development makes them valuable assets.
According to MPower, each 5 MW project has an approximate capital cost of $10 million (USD 7 million) including all development and construction costs required to commence generating revenue from the sale of clean energy.
MPower said the total consideration for its Faraday Renewable Energy Project comprised a purchase price of $462,000 including GST. 
“Pending the commencement of construction and the finalisation of longer-term financing arrangements, the purchase price has in the interim been 100% funded by an unsecured loan to the project entity from MPower’s largest shareholder, Tag Private Pty Limited, an entity associated with MPower Chairman Peter Wise and CEO Nathan Wise,” the company said.
The Faraday project covers a land area of 14 hectares and will deploy over 11,000 bifacial modules. It is expected to generate 11,500 MWh of electricity per annum.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/31/longi-increases-product-warranty-to-25-years/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,QUALITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 31, 2023",Longi increases product warranty to 25 years,"Longi has announced it will move from a 15 to 25 year product warranty on its rooftop Hi-MO 5m modules in Australia. The move brings its product and performance warranties into line at 25 years and follows a much broader trend of ballooning solar warranties.
The product warranty increase applies to the Longi module types: 
This series was designed mainly for residential and C&I rooftop systems, producing a maximum power output of 415 Watts with an efficiency of 21.25%. The modules use P-type technology, which Longi remains loyal to amid a migration towards N-type technology among its peers.
Brett Robinson, national sales manager at Longi Solar Australia, told pv magazine Australia during the 2022 All-Energy conference in Melbourne that Longi has chosen to stand by P-type as it believes this path holds more ultimate value for the customer. 
That is, while N-type is considered to have a superiorities in terms of its wafer, the cells are harder to produce and those benefits are outweighed by the added costs.
Robinson said of the warranty boost: “We want to make sure that our products and our warranties are clear evidence of the strong R&D support our operation has.”
Growing solar warranties hold an uneasy position in the minds of some installers though, who claim they are a marketing function for manufacturers and it is ultimately them – the installers – who take the fall when products have problems.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/31/ci-customers-to-offtake-25-of-generation-from-australias-biggest-solar-farm/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 31, 2023",C&I customers to offtake 25% of generation from Australia’s biggest solar farm,"SmartestEnergy Australia, a subsidiary of Japanese business conglomerate Marubeni, has entered into a “long-term agreement” with renewables business Octopus Australia to buy a quarter of the generation from its 333 MW (DC) Darlington Point Solar Farm in the mid-south of NSW.
The exact duration of the power purchasing agreement (PPA) was not revealed, but the agreement will see retailer SmartestEnergy Australia offer the renewable power to commercial and industrial companies, it said.
Darlington Point Solar Farm was commissioned in 2020 and is the largest solar farm in Australia with nearly 1 million solar panels, supplying enough energy to power 110,000 households annually. It was previously held by Edify Energy and Octopus Australia jointly, but was acquired fully by the latter in. 2022.
Octopus Australia has been pushing the envelope on renewables since entering the market from its base in the United Kingdom, where its owner Octopus Group operates. Speaking to pv magazine Australia, Managing Director Sam Reynolds said the company realised quite quickly it would have to shift its approach in Australia, where he says both the renewables markets and projects were “more difficult.”
Its approach was to develop technical expertise across key areas including grid, engineering and community engagement, and bring these teams together with its fund management arm. “Different people and different worlds, so getting them under the one roof to all work and talk to each other,” Reynolds said.
Developing this cooperation between different arms of the company has been key for Octopus Australia, he added, and has given it a point of difference in a market that is screaming out for better communication between financial and engineering players.
To that end, the company last year introduced two new investment platforms for the Australian market. Its OASIS fund focuses on big institutional investors while the OREO fund is open to smaller investors. These funds are then aggregated and used to invest not in singular renewable projects but diversified portfolios. 
“There’s some different things in each [fund], but pretty much it allows wholesale investors and mums and dads to invest alongside big institutional investors and get access to big projects in Australia.”
In fact, the first project jointly acquired by the OASIS and OREO funds was the the Darlington Point Solar Farm.
The company has also been paying an unusual amount of attention to questions of land stewardship – something sadly often overlooked in renewables industries. In 2022, it announced its joint venture Desert Springs Octopus with Traditional Owners in the Northern Territory. 
In terms of Darlington Point Solar Farm, Octopus Australia said it has invested over $5.5 million (USD 3.87 million) to establish a biodiversity stewardship scheme safeguarding large areas of native grasslands on the site and “offsetting” any impact from the development of the solar farm. These grasslands, separate to the solar farm, are undergoing registration under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW) protecting them from further development.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/31/green-hydrogen-straight-from-the-ocean-adelaide-researchers-find-successful-method/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 31, 2023",Green hydrogen straight from the ocean: Adelaide researchers crack new method,"University of Adelaide researchers have led an international team to the discovery of a method in which ocean water has been used in a commercial electrolyser to efficiently produce green hydrogen.
“We used seawater as a feedstock without the need for any pre-treatment processes like reverse osmosis desalination, purification, or alkalisation,” Associate Professor Yao Zheng, from the University of Adelaide’s School of Chemical Engineering said. The team simply filtered the seawater, which came from the Huanghai Sea in China, to remove solids and microorganisms.
“The performance of a commercial electrolyser with our catalysts running in seawater is close to the performance of platinum/iridium catalysts running in a feedstock of highly purified deionised water,” Zheng added.
The discovery addresses concerns about water scarcity that have lingered around green hydrogen discussions, with the researchers noting the ocean is an “almost infinite resource,” accounting for 96.5% of the earth’s water reserves, but has proven challenging due to the complexities of the water’s profile.
The team’s solution boils down to adjusting the local reaction environment of the catalyst, which they did by introducing an acid layer on its surface which captured problematic ions and reduced the formations of solids which can block the electrode.

The team, consisting of researchers from China’s Tianjin University and Nankai University, and Kent State University in the United States, alongside those from the University of Adelaide, published their research in Nature Energy.
They noted the approach was most practical for regions with long coastlines and abundant sunlight, à la Australia.
The team will now work on scaling up the system by using a larger electrolyser so that it can be used in commercial processes such as hydrogen generation for fuel cells and ammonia synthesis.
Given the ocean’s vastness, it is considered a natural feedstock electrolyte. As the researchers note, “direct seawater electrolysis without the purification process and chemical additives is highly attractive and has been investigated for about 40 years.”
The issue – using seawater for electrolysis tends to cause electrode side reactions and corrosion, leading to low efficiency and poor stability of the electrolysis system.
This is because seawater has high concentrations of harmful chlorine ions as well as unwanted positively charged ions like magnesium and calcium ions. Since the pH value of seawater near the cathode increases remarkably during electrolysis, these magnesium and calcium ions can form into massive precipitates like magnesium hydroxide, becoming insoluble solids that can block the electrode.
To address these issues, the team introduced a “hard Lewis acid layer” on the catalyst surface to split water molecules and capture many of the the negatively charged ions surrounding the catalyst. They also found their approach created a strongly alkaline environment, pH 14, which inhibited chlorine production on the catalyst, reducing the formation of these electrode blocking solids.
The team introduced this acid layer on a series of common catalysts to manipulate the local reaction microenvironment, they said, – noting this was a “general strategy that can be applied to different catalysts without the need for specifically engineered catalysts and electrolyser design.”
“With this in situ generated local alkaline environment on a series of Cr2O3-modified catalysts, a substantial activity enhancement was achieved, and simultaneously, the harmful chlorine chemistry and precipitate formation were avoided,” they said.
“The flow-type seawater electrolyser with Cr2O3-modified catalysts afforded a good stability up to 100 h at 500 mA cm−2 and exhibited an industrially required current density of 1.0 A cm−2 at 1.87 V and 60 °C,” the team concluded.

Acen Renewables, the renewable energy unit of Philippines-based Ayala Corp., has revealed that it has started building two solar power plants in its home country. It said the two facilities will have capacities of 60 MW and 300 MW and will be located in the provinces of Pangasinan and Zambales, respectively.
The Pangasinan solar farm is being built at a cost of PHP 2.8 billion ($72 million).
“It will be directly connected to the grid through a 2 km transmission line to the NGCP 69kV San Manuel Substation,” said Acen Renewables.
The second project, the Palauig 2 Solar farm, will require an investment of PHP 16 billion. The company said that module manufacturer Seraphim will supply 540 MWp high-efficiency solar panels for the installation. The project will be built near Acen’s existing 63 MW Palauig 1 solar project.
“This expansion of our Palauig solar assets comes at an exciting time for ACEN’s Philippine operations as we are relying on our core market to boost our energy transition efforts in the region,” said the company’s chief development officer, Jose Maria Zabaleta. “Palauig 2 Solar is the first of several new plants to commence with major construction works this year, and the need to sustain this accelerated pace towards the exponential growth of the renewables space is on top of our agenda.”
In February 2022, AC Energy completed and switched on a 40MW/60MWh storage facility at the 120MW Alaminos Solar plant. It is now one of the largest operational PV projects in the country.
The Philippines plans to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030. Recent statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that the nation had 1.08 GW of installed PV capacity by the end of 2021. Most of the nation’s solar facilities were secured under its old feed-in tariff regime, as well as auctions and net-metering programs.

India’s SCCL has commissioned its first floating solar power plant at the Singareni Thermal Power Station (STPS) in Jaipur, in the Indian state of Telangana. 
State-owned SCCL is setting up a 15 MW (AC)/19.5 MW (DC) floating solar power plant at the STPS reservoir. In the first phase, it commissioned 5 MW of floating solar capacity. It expects to finish the second 10 MW phase by the end of March.
The 5 MW(AC)/6.5 MW(DC) floating solar plant was executed by Hyderabad-headquartered Novus Green Energy Systems.
“The plant uses transparent glass-to-glass solar modules, which are more efficient than traditional solar modules,” said Anshuman Yenigalla, managing director of Novus Green.
Novus Green’s in-house teams built the 5 MW floating PV plant. The solar panels were manufactured at its facility in India. Domestic supplier FloatVolt provided the floating boards.
“The project faced several challenges, such as the design and manufacturing of floating boards meeting all testing standards and fixing frameless glass-to-glass modules onto the float boards,” said Yenigalla. “The overall design was vetted by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), making it the first floating solar project to be vetted by a premium institute like IIT.”
