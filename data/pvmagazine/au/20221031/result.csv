The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and Singapore-based developer Keppel Infrastructure have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly study the technological and economic feasibility of a hybrid offshore floating solar park paired with ocean, tidal, and wind capacity.
The study will deploy floating solar platforms, integrated with other renewable sources, at an undisclosed offshore testing site in Singapore waters, subject to regulatory approval. If the study is successful, the parties plan to design and deploy a pilot system with at least 100 MW of renewable generating capacity.
“With limited land space in Singapore, moving into waters offshore presents opportunities to unlock the potential for more diversified renewable energy sources, thereby enhancing energy security and supporting Singapore’s transition to a greener energy mix,” said Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel Infrastructure.
Keppel will study how to develop and operate the park, while the two universities will look at how to overcome the challenges presented by high winds and the impact of waves on the mooring and anchoring system. They will also study the effects of salinity on corrosion and biofouling issues.
National University of Singapore (NUS), which houses SERIS, will provide expertise in design and components selection, as well as the implementation and operation of the floating solar platforms. NTU will create tidal models of tidal flow conditions to assess the power density of the turbines and paddles.
“As one of the leading research institutes on floating solar worldwide, SERIS is very excited to provide its expertise to this novel approach of integrating floating solar with other renewable energy solutions,” said Thomas Reindl, deputy CEO of SERIS. “If successful, the proposed hybrid technology would also have great export potential.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/31/german-brand-launches-australia-adapted-rooftop-module-for-distribution-in-november/,"MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 31, 2022",Australia-adapted rooftop module from AE Solar launches for distribution in November,"Already well established in Europe and closing in on two decades of manufacturing, AE Solar has been trying to break into the Australian market for some time. Now, with an Australia-adapted panel and an exclusive distribution partnership with wholesaler One Stop Warehouse under its belt, the company seems poised to do just that.
Beside a giant dancing polar bear, pv magazine Australia sat down with the company’s head of research and development, Dr Hamed Hanifi, who has been leading the modification team and is something of an expert in engineering panels for harsh environments, having written his PhD on desert solar modules.
What the company has come up with for the Australian market is a bifacial, double glass, mono-crystalline PV module with half-cut cells. The panel’s power range sits between 395 Watts and 415 Watts, with up to 21.27% efficiency.
Essentially, the AE415MD-108BD panel is a redesign from AE Solar’s cornerstone Aurora Series, using different materials its engineers say will better endure in Australia’s severe climate.
“What UV [ultraviolet] is doing to panels is that it is degrading the polymer materials very, very fast,” Dr Hanifi said. “So if you have the modules outside with glass and normal backsheet, normal EVA [glue], you see that after sometime, they start to discolour, they start to crack the polymers, they start to chalk and also they start to delaminate… the module itself, if you put it in Germany, it’s perfect. If you put it here, then you see the degradation much faster.”
To tackle this deterioration problem, the company has opted for a double glass configuration, doing away with the traditional, degradation-prone backsheet and employing a design uses less polymer overall.
Rather than sticking to EVA or ethylene vinyl acetate glue, AE Solar’s Australia modified panel will use polyolefin elastomers, better known as POE, to adhere surfaces. This material, Dr Hanifi says, fairs better in humidity and doesn’t degrade with UV exposure.
The panel is also bifacial, a feature which can increase a panel’s yield by up to 25%, though Dr Hanifi says a more realistic projection for rooftop panels sits between 3% to 10% since it’s dependent on factors like framing and the particular roof’s colour.

“This is basically not a matter of ‘we have a module, let’s put it in the Australian market.’ We thought about it, and then we put it in the Australian market. We really adapted it to the Australian environment and stress factors,” Dr Hanifi said.
Targeting the rooftop segment, the panel is also lightweight and small, weighing 22.5kg and measuring 1722 x 1133 x 30mm. The panel includes a 30-year product warranty and performance guarantee.
“Of course, we also thought about the optics,” Dr Hanifi added, noting the panel’s sleek black aesthetic – a feature increasingly preferred in the Australian rooftop market.
In terms of pricing, Dr Hanifi says AE Solar is far closer to Chinese manufacturers like Trina and Longi than, say, the “premium” brands like Maxeon Sunpower or QCells.
This is likely because AE Solar manufactures in China, as well as Turkey, though the company’s research and development team remain based in Germany. 
The company seems to be looking to leverage Germany’s reputation for high quality and pairing it with low costs to break into the market here – a play it has had on the cards for at least a few years, with pv magazine reporting back in 2020 that the company would launch its lauded anti-shade technology here.
The company had a fancy demonstration of this technology in action at All Energy, setting up its patented anti-shade panel with lights and a water pump next to a conventional panel using real time shading to show the difference – which was indeed notable.
To be clear, AE Solar’s patented anti-shade panels, which include a “micro” bypass diode between individual cells to make them resistant to shading and hot spots, are not among the first shipment the brand will offload with One Stop Warehouse (OSW).
Anson Zhang, founder of OSW assured the technology would be among their offering of AE Solar products in the near future.
One Stop will be the exclusive distributor’s of AE Solar’s technology in Australia, part of a partnership also announced at All Energy. This partnership, Dr Hanifi says, will afford AE Solar access to the Australian market, without having to work the sales side themselves – which may be behind the brand’s spluttered start in Australia. 
According to OSW product manager Charles Wang, the aim is to have 15 MW of AE Solar’s products available in Australia in the first year.
After having solidly established its marketshare in the world of Australian solar distribution in the last decade, OSW is in a period of evolution. The company, CEO Anson Zhang tells pv magazine Australia, is looking to expand its C&I offerings. Recently, it’s seen a big jump in demand from that sector, which now provides around 25% of the company’s revenue, with the remaining 75% coming from residential, Zhang said.
It is also quite literally expanding, currently in the process of opening offices in the US and Europe. OSW is set to open a warehouse in Dallas, Texas, in January, and is planning a second location in Tampa, Florida, later in 2023.
In Europe, Zhang said the OSW team already has around 20 people, with bases in the Netherlands, Poland, and plans to enter Germany and France. More announcements on the company’s overseas expansion are expected in the coming months.

In an effort to meet the growing market for green, zero carbon ammonia, Yara is collaborating with Engie to build a green ammonia plant adjacent to its existing fertiliser plant in the Pilbara.
Stage 1 of the Yuri project, as it’s named, will see a 10 MW industrial scale electrolyser installed beside an 18 MW solar plant capable of producing 600 tonnes of green ammonia each year. The biggest electrolyser currently operating in Australia is 1.25 MW at Tonsley Park in Adelaide.

Hydrogen and ammonia can be made through a number of different production pathways. In addition, the supply chain from raw materials and energy all the way to end-consumer can involve many steps. The resulting carbon footprint of the hydrogen and its derivatives being consumed can therefore also vary significantly, depending not only on things like the origin of the energy and the feedstocks, but also on the methodology used for the calculation. 
There is currently no detailed, widely-agreed definition of what exactly constitutes “green/blue/low-carbon/etc” hydrogen. So far, most people have been relying on different colours to differentiate between different kinds of clean hydrogen, but there are increasing calls and efforts for a more transparent and robust classification based on the specific carbon footprint of the product. 
Developing such a methodology, and harmonising standards across countries and markets is critically important so that all stakeholders can make informed decisions based on facts, rather than risk falling victim to greenwashing claims.

In December 2020, Hydrogen Australia (a division of the Smart Energy Council) launched its Zero Carbon Certification Scheme for renewable hydrogen, renewable ammonia and renewable metals. A world leading scheme to provide a guarantee of origin for hydrogen produced from 100% renewable energy and with zero carbon emissions.
Smart Energy Council engaged Bureau Veritas, a world leader in laboratory testing, inspection and certification services to undertake a pre-certification audit of the planned green ammonia plant.
Following a detailed engineering assessment and analysis, Bureau Veritas concluded that the ammonia plant can produce ammonia and hydrogen with carbon footprints of 0.109 kgCO2-e/kgNH3 and 0.26 kgCO2-e/kgH2, respectively. The Smart Energy Council considers this level of embedded carbon de minimis and able to be certified as Zero Carbon Renewable Ammonia. When the facility is commissioned there will be a further audit to verify that the plant has been built according to plans and specifications to achieve these standards.
“This certification will provide guarantees to Yara’s customers in Asia, Australia or Europe that the quantities supplied have been produced according to set standards and will inform the customers about key attributes such as renewable origin and greenhouse gas footprint,” Magnus Ankarstand, President of Yara Clean Ammonia, said.
The Zero Carbon Certification Scheme is backed by some of the biggest green hydrogen companies in world, the German Energy Agency, state governments of Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and the Ammonia Energy Association. 
The first project certified under the scheme was the ActewAGL green hydrogen refuelling station in Fyshwick, Canberra. The German Energy Agency (DENA) and the Green Hydrogen Catapult are advisors to the scheme.
“Smart Energy Council’s scheme is important because it will enable hydrogen and related products to be certified as zero emissions. It is critical that we can track how these products are manufactured so customers can be certain that the product they select is genuinely zero emissions,” John Grimes, CEO Smart Energy Council, said.
The world is now rapidly moving to decarbonise and urgently needs zero carbon products such as renewable ammonia. Zero carbon certification is an imperative to establishing new markets with integrity and to give investors the confidence to make the leap forward.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/31/malaysia-to-grant-4-year-ppa-extensions-to-bidders-in-large-scale-solar-tender/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,MALAYSIA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 31, 2022",Malaysia to grant 4-year PPA extensions to bidders in large-scale solar tender,"From pv magazine Global
All of the shortlisted projects from the fourth round of Malaysia’s large-scale PV tender will have their power purchase agreements extended from 21 to 25 years, according to the Malaysian authorities.
“The extension gives confidence in the market regulator,” Moritz Sticher, a senior adviser at Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, told pv magazine. “Without such extension, we would have probably seen a number of stranded assets. That not only hinders reaching Malaysia’s [renewable energy] targets but is also detrimental in attracting investment.”
The Malaysian Energy Commission made the decision in August. Apricum said the decision was a response to concerns about the bankability of projects, due to rising material prices and fears of rising interest rates.
A number of project owners have also asked the Malaysian Energy Commission to review electricity bid prices, but the regulator rejected this, according to local media reports. Prices submitted by projects between 10 MW and 30 MW in size range from MYR 0.1850 ($0.061) /kWh to MYR 0.2481/kWh. For projects with capacities between 30 MW and 50 MW, the bids range from MYR 0.1768/kWh to MYR0.1970/kWh.
The LSS4 program awarded 823.06 MW of capacity across 30 projects. In total, it has awarded 2,457 MW, but only 1,160 MW of that was operational by the second quarter of 2022, according to the report. The next round, LSS5, is expected to start in 2023, with the government currently studying the inclusion of virtual PPAs.
Malaysia currently has 2,165 MW of total installed solar capacity, according to data from Apricum. It aims to add an additional 1,098 MW by 2025, and another 2,414 MW by 2035. The country has raised its renewable energy targets to 31% by 2025, equaling 8.53 GW of total renewable generation capacity, and to 40% by 2025, or 10.94 GW.

PV and wind power are the most important way to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, the IEA said in its new “World Energy Outlook 2022” report. Their share of electricity generation will increase from 10% in 2021 to 40% in 2030, reaching 70% in 2050, according to the agency.
Solar provided more than 3% of global electricity generation in 2021.  Annual capacity addition reached 150 GW, making 2021 another record year. Solar panel prices have fallen by 80% over the past decade, thanks to economies of scale and continuous innovation throughout the supply chain. As a result, PV has become the most affordable power generation technology in many parts of the world. The IEA expects annual growth to more than quadruple to 650 GW in 2030.
By then, annual solar and wind power installations in the United States will increase two and a half times from today’s levels, thanks in part to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). New targets are also driving the massive build-up of clean energy in China, with the country’s coal and oil consumption peaking before the end of this decade. Accelerated renewable energy deployment and efficiency improvements in the European Union mean that EU demand for gas and oil will fall by 20% and coal consumption by 50% over the course of this decade, according to the report.
The average selling price of solar panels rose for the first time in 2021 – by around 20% from 2020 – due to higher freight and commodity prices, particularly for polysilicon. While module prices remained at high levels in the first half of 2022, the IEA said that continuous innovations, further improvements to materials, and energy efficiency will lead to further cost reductions.
The energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy system, according to the IEA. Although the use of fossil fuels will peak in this decade, it will then decline in the long term. The IEA forecasts that more than $2 trillion will be invested every year in climate-neutral technologies by 2030, through programs like the IRA, REPower EU, and others in Japan, South Korea, and China. This corresponds to an increase of more than 50% compared to today. However, that would still fall short of 1.5-degree target, which would require a $4 trillion investment by 2030.
“The energy markets and energy policies have been changed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and not just temporarily, but for the coming decades,” said Fatih Birol, director-general of the IEA. “Even with today’s political framework, the energy world is changing dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this an historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.”
