https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/03/elexsys-targets-rooftop-solar-increase-with-trial-of-next-gen-technology/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022",EleXsys targets rooftop solar increase with trial of next-gen technology,"Brisbane-based eleXsys Energy will seek to demonstrate the potential of its new technology which has been designed to increase distributed energy resources (DER) hosting capacity on low-voltage power lines after securing $451,000 in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
EleXsys said the device works by regulating voltage on low-voltage power lines by dynamically providing or absorbing reactive power. By maintaining voltage within normal operating bands, eleXsys can better utilise DER, such as locally produced solar and battery storage, effectively preventing curtailment of exports and without expensive grid upgrades.
EleXsys chief executive Bevan Holcombe said the trial will demonstrate “the applications of eleXsys in the residential DER market and how existing distribution grids can be supported to host much more exported solar energy than is typically the case in Australia today”.
“We believe that distributed energy is the most efficient form of energy generation that you can have,” he said.
The $1.92 million trial project will be undertaken in conjunction with distribution network service provider (DNSP) Energy Queensland.
EleXsys will install five of the devices, with three to be directly connected to Energy Queensland’s network. One will be trialled behind the meter on a customer’s premises, and one will be tested at Energy Queensland’s Real Time Digital Simulator facility in Cairns to show how the device performs across a wider range of network types.
The project will also benefit from the insights of several other DNSPs participating in a dedicated stakeholder reference group.
The final findings of the project are to be made public with a knowledge sharing report to be published.

ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said technology like the eleXsys device will play an increasingly important role in the addition of more renewables to Australia’s energy makeup.
“To help increase the amount of distributed energy we can have on Australia’s energy network, it’s vital that ARENA supports these new technologies such as the eleXsys which not only help to connect more home solar and batteries, but also helps to avoid expensive network augmentation works to support increased demand,” he said.
“After a successful trial in southeast Queensland, we could see the technology installed across the grid to save costs for users while also enabling more distributed renewals to be connected to the grid.”
The funding for the trial comes after ARENA last year awarded eleXsys $3.5 million under the Modern Manufacturing Initiative, enabling the construction of a purpose-built manufacturing facility.
Assistant Energy Minister Tim Wilson said on Thursday that ARENA’s latest investment will allow clean energy producers to feed much more energy back into existing electricity distribution grids.
“With one in four households powering the nation through rooftop solar, and another 2,000 added every business day, we’re investing $450,000 to boost their contribution to the grid, so they play a bigger role in our carbon neutral future,” he said.
“The devices will be trialled on the Energy Queensland network for now, but the technology could be applicable to any low-voltage area in Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/03/labors-plan-to-green-the-kurri-kurri-gas-power-plant-makes-no-sense/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022",Labor’s plan to green the Kurri Kurri gas power plant makes no sense,"This is disappointing for three reasons.
One, we don’t actually need the Kurri Kurri power station. It will be a government-built white elephant.
Two, retrofitting it to burn hydrogen would be so expensive as to be unrealistic.
And three, burning hydrogen for power is about the least useful thing you can do with it.
The gas/diesel plant under construction and Labor’s hydrogen proposal came from the realm of politics. It should have stayed there.
Labor has long been split on the Kurri Kurri power station, which has been touted as a way to augment dispatchable generation. At first, Labor denounced the Morrison government’s plans, with climate change spokesman Chris Bowen describing it as a “cynical attempt to pick a fight on gas and continue the climate wars, or to reward the major Liberal donor who owns the Kurri Kurri site”.
Now they say it will create jobs and help provide reliable and affordable electricity.
As a nod to climate change action, Labor leader Anthony Albanese and climate spokesman Chris Bowen announced the switch with the caveat that Kurri Kurri will use green hydrogen to power 30% of its production when the plant enters service in 2023 and 100% by 2030. Labor says it is prepared to spend up to another $700 million on the plant.
It has been widely suggested the proposed plant is the government’s way to take advantage of Labor’s internal divide.
When the plant was first proposed for the small town 35 km inland from Newcastle, Energy Security Board chair Kerry Schott questioned its viability. “Nobody is going to build it from the private sector because it doesn’t stack up,” she said.
She’s right. It didn’t stack up then and doesn’t stack up now, regardless of how it’s powered.

When my colleagues and I took a deep dive into this proposed power station, we found there was no need for it until at least 2030. That’s the best case. But as time goes by it is increasingly unlikely it will ever be needed as much cheaper and more efficient alternatives including batteries come to meet the increasing demand for stored energy.
That’s to say nothing of the fact the initial proposal would only have had enough gas stored to run for six hours and then take a day to recharge. Snowy Hydro has since upped these plans to 10 hours of storage.
And Snowy Hydro’s price tag of $600 million? Fiddlesticks. It will cost vastly more. We estimate well over $1 billion when costs of the pipelines, storage and other infrastructure are included, even without hydrogen. As a result, there is no way Kurri Kurri would attract enough income to recover its costs. It’s hardly surprising private investors are steering clear. Why bankroll a dud?
You can add up to 10% of hydrogen to conventional gas fired turbines without trouble. And you can use hydrogen as the primary fuel in turbine-based power plants, as South Korea has done using hydrogen produced as a by-product in the process of refining oil.
The problem is the two Kurri Kurri turbines ordered by the government can run on a maximum of 15% hydrogen. Snowy Hydro suggests the turbines could be extended to a maximum 30% hydrogen mix, with changes to the internal equipment and piping. But the gas lateral pipeline/storage system is only being constructed to accommodate a 10% mix, and would need to be completely rebuilt to transmit a higher blend.
In short, converting Kurri Kurri to hydrogen means completely rebuilding the plant and its pipeline and storage infrastructure. These are not minor changes.

Let’s imagine Labor is elected and proves determined to press ahead with these plans. Where, exactly, will they get the green hydrogen from and how will it be stored to run the plant? At present, the world has no large scale source of climate-safe hydrogen produced from water. While there is a great deal of interest in large scale electrolysis – the process where we split water to get hydrogen and oxygen – there is a long road ahead.
Is that the end of the issues plaguing this plant? Nope. Even if we get to the point where green hydrogen is plentiful, burning it in a combustion turbine is one of the most wasteful ways to use it.
 
That’s because combustion turbines are very inefficient ways to produce electricity. They waste half the energy they consume in the form of heat vented to the atmosphere. That alone makes the use of hydrogen in turbines uneconomic. In fact, we doubt hydrogen will ever be used in combustion turbines to produce electricity. There is absolutely no need to bother doing so, given much better alternatives already exist. Batteries already dominate the market for new storage in Australia and elsewhere and this will surely continue.
We’d be much better off using green hydrogen to decarbonise more difficult industries, such as the production of fertiliser, in industrial processes and chemical manufacturing, and for long-distance land or sea heavy freight where hydrogen still has a weight advantage over batteries.
There are enormous challenges to be met in the transition towards renewable energy and away from fossil fuels. These kinds of obviously economically and technically infeasible proposals serve only to set us back. We should give these plans short shrift.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/03/bhp-begins-work-on-northern-goldfields-solarstorage-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022",BHP begins work on Northern Goldfields solar+storage system,"Mining giant BHP announced on Wednesday work had begun on a combined 48.2 MW solar PV and battery energy storage system (BESS) which will help power the miner’s Mt Keith and Leinster nickel operations in Western Australia’s (WA) northern Goldfields region.
The $73 million Northern Goldfields Solar Project, which was announced last year, will comprise a 27.4 MW solar farm at Mt Keith, about 430 kilometres north of Kalgoorlie, and a 10.7 MW solar farm and 10.1 MW/5.4 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) at nearby Leinster.
BHP said the project, which will replace power currently supplied by diesel and gas, will help it reduce scope 2 emissions at its Mt Keith and Leinster operations by about 12% resulting in an estimated reduction of 54,000 tonnes CO2-e per annum.
BHP Nickel West asset president Jessica Farrell said the miner is committed to delivering sustainable, low-carbon nickel to its customers, a product that is in high demand to power batteries and electric vehicles (EVs).
“I am delighted to see construction start at what will be one of the world’s largest off-grid mining solar and battery energy storage systems,” she said.
“The Northern Goldfields Solar Project is BHP’s first off-grid large-scale renewable energy project across our global operations and, significantly, will remove the equivalent of up to 23,000 combustion engine cars from the road every year, supporting our greenhouse gas reduction targets.”

BHP, which last year signed an agreement with Tesla to supply the United States-based EV manufacturer with nickel from its Nickel West plant, said on Wednesday it expects “to power up with solar energy by November this year”.
The Australian arm of Canadian independent power producer TransAlta Renewables will build, own and operate the Northern Goldfields Solar Project as part of a power purchase agreement (PPA) extension signed in October 2020.
The renewable energy asset will be integrated into TransAlta’s 169 MW Southern Cross Energy North remote network, which currently comprises two simple-cycle power stations, each with one gas turbine.
TransAlta Australia managing director Kelvin Koay said the construction phase of the solar and battery facility is an exciting step for the project.
“The Northern Goldfields Solar Project is TransAlta’s first renewable energy project in Australia and is an important element of our clean electricity growth plan,” he said.
It is expected the construction phase of the project will create more than 100 direct and indirect jobs in the Goldfields and Perth regions.

As well as beginning work on the solar and storage project, TransAlta also announced it had entered into an agreement with BHP to identify potential sites for 40-50 MW of wind generation to add to the renewable mix. The proposed wind farm would connect to TransAlta’s northern grid and reduce scope 2 emissions at the Mt Keith and Leinster operations by an estimated further 30%.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston described the Northern Goldfields Solar Project as a “game-changing renewable energy project”.
“The companies are setting a great example of new social and environmental standards,” he said.
As well as its PPA with TransAlta, BHP has also signed a PPA with Risen Energy which will see the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in WA supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs at its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
Nickel West’s bundled PPA (which combines tradeable Large-scale Generation Certificates with purchase of power) commenced on February 1 and will displace around 364,000 tonnes of CO2 over the duration of the contract, which also has an option for extension beyond its scheduled 2031 end date.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/03/ampol-makes-move-into-energy-retail-market/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022",Ampol makes move into energy retail market,"The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) confirmed earlier this week it had received an application from Ampol Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of ASX-listed petroleum giant Ampol, for electricity and gas retailer authorisations under the National Energy Retail Law.
In its application to the AER, Ampol Energy said it is eager to utilise its existing infrastructure and its 3 million weekly customers and 80,000 corporate customers as the basis of its energy retailing offer.
“By becoming an energy retailer, Ampol will be able to bring new customer propositions to market off the back of its generation and mobility investments,” the company said.
“By launching Ampol Energy, Ampol will be able to partner with Australians to work towards a low-carbon future.”
Ampol, which supplies approximately one third of all Australia’s transport fuel needs, said retailing energy to household and business consumers is a “key pillar” of the company’s future business direction.
“Ampol Energy is focused upon the evolving and charging energy market as Australian consumers and businesses continue a trend towards decarbonisation,” the company said. “Energy markets and consumer preferences will continue to converge, so as such, the structure of the business is aligned to our future view of the market.”
Ampol said it would offer electricity and gas products to all jurisdictions of the National Electricity Market (NEM), and to household customers as well as to commercial and industrial businesses.
In its application to the AER, Ampol gave a provisional start-up date for the operation of February 2022 but that will not be achievable with the AER closing date for submissions on the application open until 2 March 2022.

Ampol also announced its leadership team, which will be headed by James Myatt, former chief executive of energy retailers Australian Power and Gas, and Mojo Power.
Former Energy Australia regulatory response leader Adam Lourey has been appointed regulatory and compliance manager, Doug Darley, former CFO of Ampol’s Fuels and Infrastructure division, will join as chief operating officer while Rochelle Schuenker, former energy lead for the Amaysim Group, will serve as acting head of retail.
Ampol first revealed its plan to enter the energy retail space in March 2021 with the release of company’s Future Energy and Decarbonisation Strategy, which also outlined plans to target new opportunities in electricity, hydrogen, gas, biofuels and carbon emissions reductions.
“Ampol is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and playing a key role in the energy transition,” the company said.
“Our financial strength, integrated end-to-end supply chain, Australian brand, customer relationships and industry knowledge will enable us to build energy solutions that can support the energy transition and broader change across the Australian economy.
“Over the next four years we will invest a minimum of $100 million to realise this strategy.”

Included in the initiatives, which underpin the company’s ambition of reaching net zero emissions across its operations by 2040, is a partnership with Tesla to create a virtual power plant trial in Adelaide.
Ampol is also working with Fusion Fuel Green to develop a solar-powered green hydrogen production plant at its refinery site in Brisbane, is supporting Endua which is working on the development and delivery of a modular hydrogen-powered energy generation and storage unit, and rolling out more than 120 electric vehicle fast-charging sites across its service station network.
Ampol’s move into electricity and gas retailing is the latest in the Australian market with fellow oil and gas giant Shell, and telecommunications major Telstra, and renewable energy player Enel Group among those to recently announce they would also be expanding into the sector.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/03/microgrid-project-using-vanadium-redox-flow-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022",Microgrid project using vanadium redox flow battery,"From pv magazine Global
San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) and Sumitomo Electric (SEI) completed a zero-emissions microgrid pilot project using a vanadium redox flow (VRF) battery.
Microgrids, mini power grids that can operate independently of the larger grid and keep critical facilities powered during emergencies and power shut downs, are becoming more important in states like California that have seen a dramatic increase in wildfires, critical weather events, and other causes. Just last week about 6,000 SDG&E customers were without power due to unknown causes.
The 5-year demonstration project is located in the Bonita community in south San Diego County. The 2MW VRF battery at the heart of the demonstration project can store 8MW hours of energy,  potentially enough to power the equivalent of about 1,000 homes for up to four hours. In one of the test runs the 2MW/8MWh VRF battery powered 66 residential and commercial customers for close to five hours.
“Climate conditions increasingly threaten the continuity of essential services that our customers expect and deserve from us, which is one of the many reasons we are so focused on innovation and technology,” said SDG&E CEO Caroline Winn. “There is a critical need to develop breakthrough solutions like zero-emissions microgrids to not only minimise disruptions, but to also support the transition to a cleaner, safer and more reliable energy grid of the future.”
Different from more prevalent stacked lithium-ion battery cells, VRF batteries consist of tanks of liquid electrolytes and pumps that charge and discharge electrons to the grid. According to the U.S. Energy Department, VRF technology has several upsides including the potential to store MWh of power in simple designs, the ability to discharge power for up to 12 hours at a time, and the fact that VRF batteries do not present a fire hazard and use no highly reactive or toxic substances, can sit idle for long periods of time without losing storage capacity, and more.
Downsides include the fact that VRBs generally have lower energy densities than other battery types (although increased energy density would help reduce costs and broaden applications), the standby current drain can lead to power loss, the technology’s small operating temperature window requires the use of air conditioning systems that can result in significant energy losses, and the cost of the vanadium electrolyte.
During the pilot, the batteries charged when solar energy was abundant and discharged during peak hours to meet demand.
The microgrid demonstration project was completed late last year and included two successful tests. One was a seamless transition in which customers did not experience any loss of power when they were transitioned to the microgrid for electric service. The other was a black start, where microgrid operators established and sustained service after a complete loss of power. Customers experienced a momentary outage before they were transitioned to the microgrid, which operated in island mode separate from the power grid. The microgrid provided energy service as expected, even on a cloudy day when solar power output was not optimal.
SDG&E began operating the first utility-scale microgrid in America in 2013 in Borrego Springs and is currently in the process of upgrading it to run on 100% renewable energy. The utility is building four additional microgrids and is on track to integrate about 145MW of utility-owned energy storage with the local grid in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/03/high-performance-seawater-batteries-based-on-novel-anode-material/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SOUTH KOREA",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 3, 2022",High performance seawater batteries based on novel anode material,"From pv magazine Global
One particularly promising type of sodium-based battery technology are seawater batteries (SWBs), which use seawater as the cathode. Despite their numerous potential applications, the commercialisation of SWBs has been hampered by the lack of low-cost, high-performance and environmentally friendly anode materials.
Whereas traditional carbon-based materials are a cost-efficient option, their electrochemical performance is below par so they have to be co-doped with multiple elements, such as nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S). Another issue is that currently known synthesis routes for co-doping are complex, potentially dangerous, and even unable to yield acceptable doping levels.
Now, a team of scientists from Korea Maritime and Ocean University has managed to overcome the complexity of synthesis and safety issues caused by harmful dopant precursor via a new synthesis route. They developed a one-step plasma-in-liquid process to synthesise N and S co-doped carbon-based anode material, which displayed great potential for seawater batteries.
Their process involved preparing a mixture of precursors containing carbon, N, and S and discharging plasma into the solution, resulting in a material with high doping levels of N and S with a structural backbone of carbon black. “The co-doped anode material we prepared exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance in SWBs, with a cycling life of more than 1500 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g,” Associate Professor Jun Kang said.
Namely, the NS/C anode created in this way even allowed seawater batteries to outperform lithium-ion batteries, making them a sustainable alternative to the ubiquitous battery technology. The material exhibits a large specific surface area (476.8 m2 g−1) and abundant active sites on its surface owing to its void structure. It has high initial coulombic efficiency of 84%. When the anode is applied to a sodium-ion half-cell, NS/C showed a remarkable cycling life of 35,000 cycles at an ultrahigh current density of 100 A g−1 with high reversible capacity of >72 mAh g−1.
“Owing to the advantages of this structure, NS/C evidently caused a co-intercalation reaction in an ether-based electrolyte while avoiding solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation on the anode surface,” the researchers wrote in their paper Facile in situ synthesis of dual-heteroatom-doped high-rate capability carbon anode for rechargeable seawater batteries, recently published in Carbon.
The potential maritime applications of SWBs are versatile, since they can be safely operated while completely submerged in seawater. They can be used to supply emergency power in coastal nuclear power plants or be installed on buoys to aid in navigation and fishing. But as Kang explains, seawater batteries can be most powerful when used in conjunction with renewable energy such as solar power.
“In other words, if renewable energy is used to charge the seawater battery, it can be the cleanest energy storage device,” Kang tells pv magazine. “Specifically, in the case of buoys for navigation signs, power is supplied using lead-acid batteries. However, lead-acid batteries are weak against corrosion, so their durability is very poor. In Korea, products that replace these lead-acid batteries with seawater batteries are being developed, and solar power is being used as an energy source to charge seawater batteries.”
Finally, seawater batteries can be installed as a power source for salvage equipment on passenger ships. “They would not only supply a higher energy density than conventional primary batteries, but also enable stable operation in water, thereby increasing survival probabilities,” Kang says.
