Producing green hydrogen at such a scale, AEMO’s Chief System Design and Engineering Officer Alex Wonhas later noted, would require a renewable energy input between two to three times the total electricity consumed by the entirety of Australia today.
Behind this ambition is Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries, which has been on a global quest for green hydrogen projects for the better part of two years. The market Forrest is trying to corner is, he believes, going to be immense.
Green hydrogen industries could be worth as much as US$12 trillion (AU$16 trillion) by 2050, he said, noting Australia’s iron ore business is barely one 100th of this scale. 
Touting green hydrogen it as the “answer” to the climate crisis, Forrest framed his company as leading the pivot from polluter to clean energy pioneer. “This is a clear cut economic choice, beyond the science,” he said.

Calling for Australia to follow the rest of the world in committing to net zero by 2050, Forrest said Australia must begin changing today and needs to have “turned a corner” by 2030. He described the climate conference happening in November in Glasgow as a “critical opportunity for Australia.”
Unfortunately, doubts are already being cast on Australia’s contribution there. It was expected the federal government would release its long-term climate plan ahead of the meeting, which is now less than 80 days away, but earlier this week the Australian Industry Group, the country’s largest employer group, revealed it had yet to be consulted on any plans.
Forrest was also critical of the federal government in his speech, taking sharp aim at the government’s spruiking of ‘clean hydrogen’, a term it’s using to disguise the fact its hydrogen projects are fossil fuel based. Forrest compared the “clean hydrogen” claim to the oxymoron “healthy smoking.”
His words mirrored those of former prime minister Malcom Turnbull and New South Wales’ environment minister Matt Kean, who have both come out in strong opposition to non-renewable hydrogen.
“Don’t be fooled by any other colour coded spin. Any other colour than renewable green is dirty hydrogen,” Forrest said.
“And don’t get me started on the smokescreen of sequestration,” he added.
Forrest also said he expects fossil fuel industries to put up a fierce fight, forecasting the slashing of oil and gas prices almost down to zero in a bid to hold onto the market. Nonetheless, Forrest said he was undeterred.
“Our greatest natural resource isn’t iron ore, it isn’t gold, it isn’t gas, it’s certainly not oil or coal, it is green hydrogen,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/18/union-boss-says-renewable-industries-must-do-better-by-workers-theyre-fighting-because-theyre-proud-of-their-legacy/,"EMPLOYMENT,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 18, 2021",Union boss says renewable industries must do better by workers: ‘they’re fighting because they’re proud of their legacy’,"Michele O’Neil, who has a long history has a trade unionist and has been president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) since 2018, this morning called out clean energy industries for their record dealing with workers.
Speaking at the Clean Energy Council’s Infinite Australia event on Wednesday, O’Neil said unions have had “mixed experiences” with renewables industries, pointing to examples of unsafe working conditions, the use of short term visa workers and labour hire over permanent workforces. Job insecurity and how it colours workers’ views on renewables industries O’Neil described as a “critical issue to confront.”
Addressing this, she added, is imperative for there to be any hope of scaling clean industries to the levels required to tackle the climate crisis.
“Industry needs to do a lot more work to ensure workers are sharing in the benefits of renewable energy projects,” she said. While many Australian workers are eager to be part of clean energy industries and are cognisant those are the jobs of the future, she said, industries must make themselves attractive and fair to workers – which is currently not often the case.

Addressing an issue which has saddled almost every climate action debate in Australian politics for the last decade, O’Neil put forth a nuanced perspective on the ongoing challenges put before clean energy industries up by fossil fuel workers and their unions.
“They’re fighting because they’re proud of legacy of turning dangerous, hard jobs into jobs with good pay, good conditions and job security for many decades,” she said.
“These conditions were fought for by unions over many years. They didn’t just materialise, and very big changes were make over that time as a result of the efforts of workers in those industries.”
Renewables industries must find ways to earn the support of workers, she said. “What are you doing for future workers in this sector to make them want to stand up for your industry?” she said. “What’s your vision to make the renewable energy industry the best place to work in the country?”
“Unions are ready to work with you to achieve this mission, but that vision has to be a shared one.”
O’Neil also pointed to soon-to-be-published research carried out in conjunction with the ACTU, which confirmed the clean energy economy will indeed offer as many employment opportunities as fossil fuels have traditionally, especially in industries like green steels and other green metals, green hydrogen, battery manufacturing, and technical expertise.
She also noted the serendipitous fact that regions set to lose fossil fuel jobs are often those with good renewable resources and potential for new, clean industries.
Be that as it may, O’Neil said it still isn’t clear to many fossil fuel workers precisely how they will enter these emerging industries. Firstly, she said, mining communities still can’t see, touch or feel these new industries, which are not entering as quickly as mining job are vanishing.
Secondly, she said the bridges from old roles to new ones remain unclear. Skills transfer, she said, was an area which has been chronically under researched. And while it is understood that carbon workers do have some of the skills required to join new industries, there are nonetheless missing links and no clear programs or ways to bridge those skills of yet.
She described renewables industries as asking Australian workers to essentially take “a leap of faith,” an ask which she deemed “not fair.”
Exasperating the problem, she added, was the distress put on our higher educations system from TAFEs to universities, which lost huge quantities of staff during the pandemic. She called the events of the last 18 months the “biggest brain drain” the education sector has ever seen.
“We’ve got a huge disconnect here, a problem between what we need to do to develop skills… and we need to urgently reverse the damage that’s been done.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/18/how-solving-energy-poverty-could-afford-renewables-a-twofold-opportunity/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,SUSTAINABILITY,QUEENSLAND,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 18, 2021",How solving energy poverty could afford renewables a twofold opportunity,"Solving energy poverty, a lack electricity for cooking, heating and lighting, is key to solving poverty itself, says SolarBuddy’s CEO, Simon Doble.
As insidious and longstanding as energy poverty is, Doble says flip it on its head and suddenly it  can be seen as a unique opportunity.
That is because energy poverty is greatest in countries which don’t have established grid networks and electricity infrastructure. Which means they also don’t have any historical reliance on polluting systems.
“Ultimately that’s an opportunity in developing countries that a lot of developed nations haven’t identified,” Doble told pv magazine Australia.
Doble points to the mobile phone industry as an example. That industry identified early on that Africa would be one of its biggest markets. Africa, unlike Western countries, had barely any landlines. There was no telephone system in the country, which meant the customers didn’t have to migrate to the new technology, they came to it fresh, making the uptake far more rapid.
In the case of renewables, Doble says today the majority of Madagascans live in energy poverty, but they could very quickly live on clean energy because their rollout won’t encounter any of the roadblocks thrown up by incumbent systems. “The shift that we as a country, Australia, are terribly dragging our heels on, isn’t required in countries that don’t have historic reliances.”
SolarBuddy
“That’s key for us to solve the issue of energy poverty very quickly,” Doble said. Delivering clean energy systems to energy poor countries like Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Cambodia, India, Madagascar, Kenya, and the Dominican Republic, can teach us a lot about how to rollout the technology, its applications and perhaps unforeseen drawbacks in a setting where it can be installed unhindered by by governments and industries with vested interests in maintaining old models.
“That to me is an opportunity,” Doble said.
Doble founded SolarBuddy in 2016, after working on the problem of energy poverty for over a decade, including developing solar solutions for the United Nations. Since energy poverty disproportionally impacts children and women, locking them into cycles of poverty, Doble put children at the heart of his solution.
How the Brisbane-headquartered charity operates is by visiting Australian schools and teaching about energy poverty while the schoolchildren assemble, wire and waterproof a small solar light. That light then gets sent to children of a similar age in an energy-poor country. The aim is to educate Australian children on the global issue at the same time as giving them the tools to act.
“I wanted to design a program where kids didn’t make things for the sake of making it,” Doble said, “and they didn’t learn about an issue far away and not be able to do anything about it.”
The charity also runs similar programs for corporations and at conferences.
The solar lights participants build are small “like a little lego kit” and come from a factory Doble part-owns in China. The education for the kids is twofold as its also gives them a hands on experience of solar technology. “So they get to see a solar panel and how it works in the sun.”
Doble said the charity is currently in negotiations with two major solar companies, one Chinese and the other Canadian, regarding panel donation. He added the charity is always looking for new partnerships, be it with residential installers or manufacturers.
So far, SolarBuddy has distributed more than 130,000 lights worldwide, but this year it has significantly ramped up its ambition, targeting the delivery of six million solar lights to children living in energy poverty by 2030. 
Energy poverty kills around 2.6 million people every year, Doble said. Unlike disease or disaster though, the deaths it causes are slow and those suffering are often unaware. That’s because the lack of access to electricity condemns people to using toxic fuels like kerosene or firewood which cause ill health, it also means as much as 40% of the household’s income goes towards heat and light, trapping them in a cycle of poverty that’s nearly impossible to claw back from. The lack of light means children cannot study after dark, impacting their education, and further reducing the possibility of escaping the cycle.
Social justice and clean energy have long been seen as intertwined issues – with many advocating the best way to address both inequity and the climate crisis is simultaneously with multi-tiered actions.
To this end, Hoble’s ongoing involvement with the UN and various global NGOs means he’s witnessed this happening firsthand. “A lot of countries are doing a lot of good stuff,” he said.
“Would I say Australia is? No.”
For Hoble, the bipartisan breakdowns of conversations about clean energy are endlessly frustrating. “It’s counterproductive,” he said. He’s witnessed polluters be cast out of the global conversation – a move he sees as naive. “You can’t just a flick a switch, there has to be a transition.”
“Until everyone comes to the same table and has the same objectives and listens to one another and actually comprehends the answers, then there’s going to be a lot of circling and that’s a waste of time as far as I’m concerned.”
This is precisely the cycle Hoble is trying to get away from through SolarBuddy. As a charity, it has tried to learn from the mistakes of its predecessors. “I have a moderate dislike for the repetition of charity from a high, large organisational point of view where it’s very bureaucratic or a very low, grass roots point of view where there’s lots of replication and lots of people scrambling around trying to solve the same problems when they should be collaborating,” he said.
“We sit somewhere in the middle of that, where we operate on a global scale and we partner and complement other NGOs which are trying to do something similar or certainly educate and trying to lift children out of poverty.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/18/monash-chemists-find-novel-salt-solution-for-lithium-ion-battery-fires/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MICROGRID,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"AUGUST 18, 2021",Monash chemists find novel salt solution for lithium-ion battery fires,"The potential safety concerns surrounding lithium-ion batteries have burst into the public eye of late with the fire at the Victorian Big Battery (VBB). However, researchers at Monash University School of Chemistry and Australian company Calix Ltd have been working on alternative solutions without such fire hazards and toxicity issues. 
As the VBB fire illustrated, fire hazards in lithium-ion batteries, though relatively rare, especially when compared to combustion engines, are a pressing issue. After all, utility-scale energy storage is set to replace and grow across large sections of the grid, and a few tonnes of concrete isn’t always around to douse such resilient fires. 
Monash University’s Prof. Doug MacFarlane and Dr. Mega Kar have been working with Calix Ltd on electrolyte development in the higher power batteries used for energy storage solutions and electric vehicles (EVs). And in recent research published in Advanced Energy Materials, the chemists forward “Lithium borate ester salts for electrolyte application in next-generation high voltage lithium batteries”, which is to say, a novel lithium salt that could replace the more hazardous hexafluorophosphate salt. 
“The lithium salt currently being used in lithium-ion batteries is lithium hexaflurosophosphate, which poses a fire and safety hazard as well as toxicity,” said MacFarlane. “In smaller portable devices, this risk can be partially mitigated. However, in a large battery pack, such as electric vehicles and outdoor grid scale energy storage systems, the potential hazard is much intensified. Higher voltage and power batteries are also on the drawing board but cannot use the hexafluorophosphate salt.” 
The study’s lead author, the Monash University School of Chemistry’s Dr Binayak Roy, stated “our aim has been to develop safe fluoroborate salts, which are not affected even if we expose them to air. The main challenge with the new fluoroborate salts was to synthesise it with battery grade purity which we have been able to do by a recrystallisation process.” 
The researchers put these novel salts into a lithium-ion battery with lithium manganese oxide cathodes and were able to cycle the cell for more than 1,000 cycles, “even after atmospheric exposure,” Roy stressed, “an unimaginable feat compared to the hyper-sensitive hexafluorophosphate salt.” 

What is more, Roy said the new electrolyte, when combined with a novel cathode material, far outperformed the conventional salt, and was also found to be very stable on aluminium current collectors at higher voltages, as will be necessary for next-gen batteries. 
Researchers collaborated with Calix on this study as the company produces manganese-based battery materials from Australian sourced minerals. Calix hopes this research will assist it in achieving its goal of large-scale fabrication of Australian-based lithium-ion batteries. 
“Calix is developing a platform technology to produce high-performance, cost-competitive battery materials in Australia,” said Calix’s general manager for R&D, Matt Boot-Handford, “…the superior electrochemical performance and stability demonstrated by the Monash team’s new electrolyte system paired with Calix’s lithium manganese oxide electrode material is an exciting and important milestone that brings us one step closer to making batteries featuring Calix next-generation electrode materials a commercial reality.” 
Monash’s Kar noted that “in the near future we hope to turn these new anions into thermally stable, non-flammable liquid salts, making them beneficial for batteries operating at high temperatures. With the current climate conditions, designing such battery technologies with safety and stability will be important in implementing a sustainable grid-scale energy solution in Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/18/melbourne-phd-students-pioneering-new-method-of-recycling-li-ion-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 18, 2021",Melbourne PhD students pioneering new method of recycling li-ion batteries,"When Rabeeh Golmohammadzadeh went to look for a job in lithium-ion battery recycling, a field she’d spent over seven years researching, she discovered her prospects in Australia were bleak. In the final year of a chemical engineering PhD at Melbourne’s Monash University, her head was filled with ways to improve minerals recovery processes, methods which could have less toxic waste, be less energy intensive, and recover more light metals. So eager to put her knowledge to use but faced with an impoverished landscape, she set about learning how to set up company herself. “We are researchers, so our mindset is completely different,” Golmohammadzadeh told pv magazine Australia.
Along with her two co-founders, Isuri Perera and Henrique Bastos, both PhD students at Monash and Deakin University respectively, the three have set up Australian Circular. Still in its infancy, the startup has made it to the finals of 2021’s Climate Launchpad initiative, run by Climate-KIC Australia, a sister organisation of the EU’s Climate-KIC.
Australian Circular is still in the process of registering its intellectual property (IP), so it can’t reveal exactly how its technology works, but it claims marked improvements compared to current materials recovery in two areas: waste and simplicity. “One of the steps we did is quite novel. We will be the first researchers to do that,” Golmohammadzadeh said.
Without giving anything away, Golmohammadzadeh explained the startup’s process us  reagents which require less water, “so we don’t produce any waste water” and minimises toxic fumes. It’s also reduced the number of steps needed to recover high quality materials from li-ion batteries, cutting costs and reducing energy usage.
Australian Circular
Australia currently does not recycle lithium-ion batteries, with the exception of Envirostream, a Victorian company which opened the first and only onshore mixed-battery recycling plant in 2018.
Instead, Australia ships its electronic waste, or e-waste, which includes everything from TVs to batteries and mobile phones, overseas, mostly to Asia. That which isn’t exported is simply dumped in designated landfills. So, in short, its far from an ideal situation – especially with materials shortages for lithium-ion batteries looming at exactly the moment demand booms.
“We see a big gap in Australia for lithium ion battery recycling,” Golmohammadzadeh said.
“Processing and extraction of large amounts of virgin raw materials from national resources are costly, and are also having a big impact on the environment,” she added. “We can see lithium-ion batteries can stand as a great resource for the extraction of materials,” noting Europe and the U.S. already have well established industries dedicated to this.
Australian Circular
“There would be a lot of challenges for us to start [a lithium-ion recycling industry], but also a lot of opportunities,” Golmohammadzadeh said.
Even though all three of Australian Circular’s founders are technically still students, they’ve received unexpected amounts of support for their proposal, Golmohammadzadeh said. According to her, big minerals companies are particularly interested in recycling e-waste and recovering valuable materials.
Currently, Australian Circular’s technology is sitting on an efficiency of about 80%, but says there’s scope for improvement. The co-founders are also hoping that once they’re no longer students, they will be eligible to apply for more funding to take their technology out of the lab and into industry settings.
The hurdle they are grappling most with though is not technology, but rather Australia’s remarkably high labour costs. “These are things they are working on,” Golmohammadzadeh said.
Issues like profitability and balance sheets are a seismic shift from chemical engineering – but a necessary one.
Golmohammadzadeh said she’s seen lots of interesting research conducted at Australian universities, but lamented that most of it never leaves the lab. She thinks many students would benefit from programs to help them translate their knowledge into something with real word applications.
She first dipped her toe in the world of business by taking part in a hackathon, before participating in the Monash’s Generator, and then the Climate Launchpad program. For her, these programs’ value is really the training they provide – teaching things like how to identify customers, talk to them, and how to attract investors. Crucial lessons given the vast majority of startups fail,  Golmohammadzadeh said.
For instance, in Australian Circular’s case, the founders thought battery manufacturers would be their core clients. However, through the development of their business plans, they quickly realised that while our grid-scale lithium-ion battery pipeline is bulging, and while the country is home to deposits of virtually all the key minerals and metals needed for storage, Australian battery manufacturers are far and few between – especially those looking to actually produce their batteries here onshore.
Rather, the startup is now targeting construction and glass manufacturing industries, which also use many of the minerals extracted from spent batteries.
In the meantime, the startup is considering partnerships and figuring out how to grow organically out of its origins in university laboratories into something bigger. To that end, the Climate Launchpad’s $50,000 prize (Australian Circular are one of eight finalist startups) would prove helpful. The program’s national finals will be held virtually on August 27th, where the winner will be announced.  Golmohammadzadeh will, no doubt, be keenly looking on.

Chinese PV module maker JinkoSolar began work on a $500 million ingot and wafer manufacturing facility in the coastal economic zone of Vietnam’s Quang Ninh province in the second quarter of this year. The facility is expected to begin manufacturing activities within six months and to serve the company’s cell and module assembly factories in Malaysia, as well as the module assembly facility in the United States.
The manufacturer said planning on the 7 GW factory started in late 2020, with the Vietnamese government giving the approval for the project in March 2021. “The investment decision was made in the second half of last year, prior to the ongoing trade issue with the United States,” it told pv magazine, responding to Vietnamese media articles claiming the new factory is being built to diversify the company’s supply chain away from China and as an answer to new requirements from western countries and suppliers.
The trade issue referred to by JinkoSolar relates to the alleged use of forced labor in China’s Xinjiang province. The U.S. government announced it wants to ban products from four Xinjiang-based solar manufacturers over those allegations in late June. JinkoSolar was not among the companies named at the time.
The module manufacturer also stressed that the new factory is part of its plan to diversify its production globally. “While overseas supply chains are often associated with slightly higher costs, this investment is expected to assuage concerns by developers and off-takers about the security of supply – an invaluable asset for one of the largest solar module manufacturers in the world,” it further explained.
