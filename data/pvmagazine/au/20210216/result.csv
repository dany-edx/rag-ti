Few details of the pilot have been released at this stage, so it is not clear what size and specifications the solar systems being installed in the program will be. A solar provider is also yet to be selected, with the government asking providers to apply to deliver the program via the SA Tenders and Contracts website before February 26.
What we do know is that the $4.25 million program is open to residents who receive an eligible Centrelink payment, meet low income provisions, or hold an eligible concession card. Eligible households will need to own their own home and not have an existing solar system.
The suburbs selected for this pilot include Hope Valley, Banksia Park, Tea Tree Gully, Vista, Modbury, Modbury Heights, Modbury North, Felixstow, Campbelltown, Newton, Paradise, Athelstone, Dernancourt, Holden Hill, Highbury, Redwood Park and Ridgehaven and Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island in regional SA. These were selected by the government based on where the network can best accommodate the volume of solar installations.
Once a solar provider has been selected, eligible households will be contacted about the offer.
“Our new Switch to Solar pilot is a win-win for everyone,” Minister for Human Services Michelle Lensink said.
“Not only is the Government injecting money into the economy and supporting vital jobs through the purchase of 1000 new solar [systems], our concession holders will get big bill savings off their energy bills
“It’s estimated that eligible South Australians will save up to $890 on their power bills.
Customers could be more than $400 better off under this program annually – and this is after they forgo their concessions.”
Concession holders receive up to $215.10 per year from the Cost of Living Concession and up to $231.41 per year towards their energy bill, totalling up to $446.51. Swapping this payment for a decade would mean the government recovers a total of $4,460 for the solar system. A fairly average price for a midrange system, the program’s edge is that the money doesn’t have to be forked out upfront, giving households currently priced out of the market the opportunity to install solar and ultimately save on their electricity bills.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/16/installers-identified-in-one-stop-warehouses-improper-stc-debacle/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Installers identified in One Stop Warehouse’s improper STC debacle,"While multiple installers, installation companies and retailers are claimed to have been involved in the 379 non-compliant rooftop PV installations that gave rise to 49,400 improper STCs listed on One Stop Warehouse Finance Enforceable Undertaking with the Clean Energy Regulator, One Stop says that they cannot be named due to confidentiality clauses.
The assistant to One Stop Warehouse Finance’s director, Hongwei Zhang, Me Me Ong told pv magazine Australia “the parties [involved in providing false information] consist of multiple individual installers, as well as the larger ones.
“They are currently working with us to reinspect and rectify the installations – and we have confidentiality clauses in place with them and the homeowners.” The installers reinspecting the sites have been agreed upon by the Regulator.
Ong did, however, name some of the parties, including two individual installers and one company, Global Home Solutions, which was liquidated but seems to have since been resurrected under new ownership.
Installations by Global Home Solutions, a Sydney-based company which has since gone into administration in 2019, account for “at least 25% of the installations in the Enforceable Undertaking,” One Stop’s Ong told pv magazine Australia. The Clean Energy Regular has confirmed this figure.
That would make Global Home Solutions responsible for roughly 95 non-compliant installations and about 12,500 improper certificates.
Global Home Solution’s website is no longer accessible but according to SolarQuote’s installer review page, the company went into Liquidation on July 31, 2019.
It seems the company name and remaining assets has since been bought by two new owners and continues to trade.
Nonetheless, One Stop says it has had to bear the brunt of reinspecting and ratifying Global Home Solution’s non-compliant installation, as the company’s original owners are longer around, meaning the Regulator is not able to pursue them directly.
While it does not seem that Global Homes Solution’s new owners are linked to the previous owners who were found to have been operating non-compliantly, SolarQuotes founder Finn Peacock says that “phoenix” operators remain an issue in Australia’s solar installation industry. The term phoenix is applied to solar retail or installation companies that go out of business only to return under another name.
The sales tactics used by some phoenix companies are often the subject of criticism. These tactics can include rock-bottom pricing, and sometimes poor installation quality. Suspected phoenix companies are frequently criticised in quality-focused solar communities such as the Solar Cutters, or the somewhat notorious Crap Solar Facebook page.
“It’s easy to get away with phoenixing – which isn’t just a solar industry issue,” Peacock told pv magazine Australia.
While the Clean Energy Regulator can pursue installers through Enforceable Undertakings and thereby publish their names, as seen below in this instance, often the details of wrongdoers remain opaque.
Likewise, the Clean Energy Council publishes the names of approved retailers who have had their “CEC approved” status suspended or revoked. This transparency often seems skin deep though. “Although they’re being transparent publishing the names of suspended or cancelled retailers, I’d be interested to know what percentage of complaints … are turned into action,” Peacock said. He suspects that most of the time the matter is deemed resolved with “a quiet word in their ear” rather than a public action.
One Stop has also named two individual installers that falsely signed off on installations, but both are subject to separate Undertakings from the Regulator, meaning their installations are not included in One Stop’s Undertaking.
Of the two other installers named by One Stop Warehouse as being responsible for the non-compliant installations, one is a Queensland CEC-accredited installer. The second is from NSW. Both are involved in Enforceable Undertakings with the Clean Energy Regulator, totalling some 50 installations between the two.
In May of last year, the renewables peak body announced it had suspended the accreditation of 18 installers over the misuse of accredited installer details. It is believed a number of these installers were linked to One Stop.
The Clean Energy Council told pv magazine Australia it is unable to share details of the suspended or cancelled installers as it is not public knowledge and is only shared with government bodies or state regulators.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/16/ausgrid-launches-sydneys-first-community-battery-with-more-to-come-in-two-year-trial/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MICROGRID,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021","Ausgrid launches Sydney’s first community battery, with more to come in two-year trial","The launch marks the start of a two-year trial being run by Ausgrid, which seeks to shift the way solar power is being utilised in the state, ultimately allowing for more renewables on the grid, while also decreasing costs for residents and stabilising local grids.
The battery installed in Beacon Hill is a 150 kW / 267 kWh MTU Energy Pack QS. Residents with solar systems who live in the Northern Beaches trial area have been invited by Ausgrid to register their interest to participate in the trial, which will see them able to store up to 10 kWh of excess solar energy each day at no cost. This excess energy will be credited against their electricity use for that day, and eventually credits will be paid to the participant each quarter via bank transfer.
Ausgrid’s other two community batteries are planned for the Canterbury Bankstown and Lake Macquarie areas. 
“Put simply, a community battery allows multiple households within a certain radius to ‘share’ a storage system for the excess energy generated by solar panels. This can save households thousands of dollars on the upfront cost of an individual battery, and allow them to effectively use more of the solar energy their home systems generate – bringing down their electricity costs,” Ausgrid CEO Richard Gross said.
“This is an exciting milestone for Ausgrid and the first step in our community solar battery project which we know can benefit customers by keeping downward pressure on energy prices by reducing peak demand, and supporting the use of renewable energy.
“We are confident the trial will show that community batteries have a huge role to play in the low-cost transition of our energy system,” he added.
 
The trial is in a similar vein to those underway other states, most notably Western Australia. Run by retailer Synergy and network operator Western Power, WA’s highly successful PowerBank trial last week announced its expansion. Its latest edition, PowerBank 3, is the largest in the scheme to date with up to 600 Western Australian households able to leverage battery storage technology. It follows the installation of nine 116 kW batteries across the state late last year.
Likewise, Victoria’s CitiPower and Yarra Energy Foundation announced in January they will parter to create a community battery network in the Melbourne CBD and inner-city suburbs.
While New South Wales remains behind states like South Australia and Victoria in terms of its renewable energy transition, the state’s Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean is hell bent on not only steering the state towards renewables, but making it a superpower. The state is leading the charge with new rooftop solar system installations, accounting for almost a third of the 2.6 GW of rooftop pv added in Australia in 2020. Kean’s ambitious Infrastructure Roadmap, which plans to add 12 GW of renewables by 2030, has indeed revved up bigger action in NSW since it was announced just over four months ago, inspiring companies like Neoen and Origin to declare plans for whopping batteries in the state. With Australia’s notoriously rickety grid and groundswell of renewable support, batteries, it seems, have begun their moment in the sun.
“It’s exciting to see Ausgrid share the vision we have in NSW to use technology and innovation to deliver some of the cheapest, cleanest and most reliable electricity anywhere in the world,” Kean said at the battery launch.
“We believe community batteries are the most cost effective way to bring renewable energy into the grid. They provide a service to the residents, allowing them to store their solar, a service to the community by supporting the local network and they provide system security benefits by helping to firm renewables wherever they are generated,” Ausgrid CEO Gross added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/16/historical-wholesale-price-trend-bucked-thanks-to-renewables/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,LOOKING BACK,MARKETS,QUICK HITS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Historical wholesale price trend bucked thanks to renewables,"Wholesale electricity prices are trending lower in the first month of 2021 across all states, according to research from Cornwall Insight Australia, continuing on from the low-price outcomes seen in December 2020. As seen in its generation mix chart above, solar and wind have been accounting for more of the electricity mix, pushing down the contributions of fossil fuels as well as wholesale prices.
“At $23.73 in January 2021 for Victoria, it is, in fact, the lowest monthly average price since December 2012. Unsurprisingly, this price drop had a large impact on more expensive natural gas generation in Victoria,” Cornwall Insight Australia’s Modelling Consultant, George Wong, said.
“The largest decrease in natural gas generation percentage can be seen in Victoria, where it only accounted for 0.7% of the total generation in January 2021. In Victoria, the brown coal generation also saw a decrease in percentage share from 78.8% to 74.9%. In contrast, solar PV generation has increased from 1.5% to 2.9%, while wind generation increased from 11.2% to 16.3%.
“This is the same story for other states, with a low average monthly price driven by increased solar PV and wind generation. The consequence of which is a reduction in the share of fossil fuels in the generation mix.
“As noted by the QED, as the wholesale electricity price has fallen, out-of-market costs to keep the system secure have also increased, with SA particularly seeing a 91% increase in out-of-market costs when comparing 2020 with 2019. AEMO expects four upcoming synchronous condensers will curb this trend by the middle of the year.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/16/arenas-future-fuels-fund-gets-the-green-light/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",ARENA’s Future Fuels Fund gets the green light,"When the Australian Government finally extended the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) funding by $1.4 billion in September 2020, it was also announced that $70.2 million of that funding would go toward the Future Fuels Fund (FFF). Today, ARENA announced the official launch of the FFF with a budget of $71.9 million and the aim of flattening out the speedbumps in the road to new vehicle technology. 
In the first round of this funding’s allocation, the effort to lay out a public fast charging infrastructure network for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) will see a $16.5 million boost. EVs only make up 0.6% of new vehicle sales in Australia, lagging well behind many other developed nations, and one of the reasons the adoption of EVs has been so low in Australia is a lack of a reliable charging network.
This money will go toward the roll out of fast charging stations (50 kW and above) throughout eight regions nationwide, including each Australian capital city and regional centres including the Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast, Newcastle, NSW Central Coast, Wollongong and Geelong. 
All applicants for this first round of funding must be able to cover these key geographic regions, show that charging stations are powered by renewable energy, maximise private sector investment and deliver the infrastructure within two years.
The spread of fast charging stations is hoped to increase consumer choice and encourage the uptake of BEVs against the range-anxiety that still hampers their uptake. According to an ARENA statement, industry consultation suggested that the lack of public fast charging stations in population centres was a “key barrier to uptake of BEVs for both the public and fleets.” 
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the FFF will help businesses and regional communities take advantage of opportunities offered by new vehicle technologies across battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell and biofuels.
“Through this initial round,” said Miller, “we are addressing one of the barriers to roll out of new vehicle technologies by significantly increasing the number of fast charging stations available to consumers across Australia, and reducing charging blackspots in both metropolitan and regional centres.”
“As electric vehicles continue to become more competitive,” Miller continued, “it is important we have the recharging infrastructure in place to give motorists confidence they can choose an EV and recharge it conveniently and cost effectively.” 
Applications for the first round of funding closes on Tuesday 6 April 2021. Further rounds of funding will place later this year, including efforts to aid the transition of business fleets as well as in the hydrogen and biofuel sectors.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/16/thailands-first-floating-pv-project-goes-online/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,THAILAND",GWÉNAËLLE DEBOUTTE,"FEBRUARY 16, 2021",Thailand’s first floating PV project goes online,"From pv magazine France.
Greenyellow Thailand, a subsidiary of the French solar company Greenyellow, which is itself a subsidiary of French mass-retail company Groupe Casino, has announced the commissioning of Thailand’s first floating solar power plant.
The 2 MW plant was deployed in Thailand on the historic site of local agro-food company SPM group. The 6,000 solar panels used for the project occupy a 1.6ha area on a 4.3ha pond. The plant will produce 2.8 GWh of low carbon electricity per year, covering up to 20% of the annual energy consumption of the site.
According to Greenyellow, as the price of solar electricity sold to SPM is significantly lower than that of the electricity grid, this project will allow the group to achieve significant savings on its monthly electricity bill. SPM will also benefit from the maintenance and performance monitoring system provided by Greenyellow at no additional cost, the company said, noting that the project makes it possible to exploit an under-utilised basin.
“For the past 2-3 years, we are seeing a clear trend in the solar market with the commercial and industrial customers choosing the private PPA model where they outsource the capital expenditure (capex), the hassle and the operational risk to independent power producers (IPPs) like Greenyellow. This allows them to generate significant energy savings and focus their time and money on their core business, ”said Frank Glück, CEO of Greenyellow Thailand and Asia. 
Thailand aims to develop its capacity for floating PV installations, particularly on dams. According to Bloomberg, the country plans to install nearly 2.7 GW of solar capacity on nine dams by 2037. In June 2019, the Thai Government Electricity Authority issued a call for tenders to develop 55 MW of floating solar. Four months later, French floating PV specialist Ciel&Terre, and SCG, an Asian petrochemical company, signed a memorandum of understanding to develop floating PV systems on hydroelectric dams in Thailand.
Greenyellow was established by Groupe Casino in 2007. In 2016, the company obtained authorisation to implement the sale of power to final clients and power providers through its subsidiary, Greenyellow Vente d’Énergie. It has mainly deployed solar projects on France’s mainland and overseas territories and in French-speaking Madagascar. In 2018, Greenyellow joined forces with France’s energy giant Engie by creating a common subsidiary that will be primarily active in the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of PV power plants. The unit is specifically dedicated to solar production for B2B.
