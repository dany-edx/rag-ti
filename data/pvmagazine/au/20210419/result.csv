In 2020, BZE brought its intelligence to bear on the Million Jobs Plan, which CEO Heidi Lee says has been quietly influencing government initiatives behind the scenes; the Renewable Energy Industrial Precincts (REIP) campaign seeks to now focus government attention on the infrastructure needed to electrify manufacturing with clean, renewable energy.
In its pre-budget submission to the Federal Government in February this year, BZE wrote, “REIPs will support the development of advanced manufacturing clusters powered by low-cost renewable energy.” It calculated that REIPs in five locations (Hunter, Gladstone, Darwin, Collie in Western Australia, and Bell Bay in Tasmania) would secure 46,500 jobs and create an additional 46,500 jobs.
In the first instance, BZE is seeking expressions of interest from companies in The Hunter and Gladstone regions in plugging into the metaphorical renewable-energy power boards in these regions that will provide reliable renewable energy, green industrial process heat and district green hydrogen solutions.
“The Precincts are a 10-year vision,” Lee tells pv magazine Australia, “and capacity will come on in stages.”
Expressions of interest from big hitters such as would-be green-steel manufacturers and battery makers, to data centres, down to small manufacturers will demonstrate an ecosystem of participation — “its strength will be in its diversity”, says Lee.
In The Hunter region, foundation enthusiasts for the REIP concept include Ampcontrol which provides electrical, electronic and control solutions for mining, renewables and industrial applications; innovative virtual-power-plant and microgrid technology provider, SwitchDin; 3ME which designs and supplies battery systems for challenging conditions such as mining, military and marine; Diffuse Energy small wind turbine manufacturers; and Molycop, a worldwide supplier of mining consumables and services.
Says Michael Parker, Executive General Manager and President of Molycop Australasia, “Molycop is committed to further reducing the carbon emissions associated with our products and operations and Renewable Energy Industrial Precincts will help us achieve that.”

Such companies are already clustered around Newcastle, the research and education capital of The Hunter region, also because of its transport links, export opportunities and skilled workforce.
Lee adds its proximity to budding Renewable Energy Zones, such as NSW’s first-planned 3GW Central West Orana REZ and the most recently announced Hunter-Central Coast REZ, to The Hunter’s many attractions for manufacturers.
Gladstone is also well endowed with port facilities, access to the Central Queensland Renewable Energy Zone, an education hub in the form of Central Queensland University, a large, skilled, technically capable workforce, and diverse and established industries including alumina processing.
Alpha HPA, for example, is developing a high-purity aluminium plant which will supply products to the global clean energy and mobility sectors, and has committed to using sustainable electricity to power its plant.
The coastal region has also become the home of choice to several green hydrogen and green-chemical projects, including Eco Energy World’s $500 million solar-to-hydrogen plant; and Sumitomo’s plans for a plant that will initially produce 250-300 tonnes of hydrogen a year with the intention to scale up production.
Lee says that although green hydrogen “doesn’t stack up yet, we think it will be online, and under $2/kg as targeted by the Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap in less than 10 years, but what you need is the infrastructure piece to come ahead of it, so that the investment in that green hydrogen isn’t also carrying unnecessary costs from infrastructure that could be shared and used to benefit a whole lot of other processes”.
The REIP concept is about gathering intentions so that the Federal Government recognises the need to do what it does best, connecting the cross-state-border dots.
“There are buckets of money available at the state level if you want to do some energy efficiency stuff in your factory,” says Lee. “There’s even some Federal money available.” 
But, she argues, “Until regions and precincts are provided with appropriate infrastructure for manufacturers to use vastly more electricity than they currently do, you won’t see these big ideas take place.”
BZE is seeking a national statement of intent from the Federal Government on “what the country’s manufacturing sector will look like”, followed by action on financing infrastructure that cuts across jurisdictions: “the Feds can make a better go of it than state bodies trying to coordinate”, she says.

BZE’s outlook is relentlessly optimistic. Its so far successful strategies have focused on opportunities for Australian workers and businesses, but Lee acknowledges that there will be a downside to not acting.
She says the country must capitalise on growing global demand for zero-carbon products and the Federal Government must position Australia as a global leader in zero-carbon sustainable manufacturing, or it will miss out.
“Australia isn’t decarbonising very fast, but overseas more than half the world is already engaged in coordinated actions.”
BZE’s Renewable Energy Industrial Precincts pre-budget submission gives the UK’s low-carbon Industrial Clusters strategy as an example of how the Old Dart is targeting zero-carbon manufacturing via a two-stage competition that offers £170 million in assistance — call it prize money — through its multi-billion pound Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund.
Benefits within a year
Companies that express interest in participating in REIPs in Australia should start to see benefits within 12 months, says Lee. BZE will support them to apply for existing funding, while also coordinating group contracts for renewable energy, and for other connections as needed, to avoid each individual company devoting resources to decarbonising.
“The biggest gains will come when you start connecting renewable energy directly to those precincts,” says Lee, or getting green hydrogen on tap. “But having certainty that it’s going to happen means these local economies will have more capacity to absorb jobs that might be coming offline in other sectors, such as coal.”
There’ll be more opportunities in constructing energy infrastructure and industrial buildings spaces for companies eager to join the low-cost-energy clusters.
Manufacturers of all ilks can learn more about the model for Renewable Energy Industrial Precincts proposed by BZE in industry briefings this month and throughout May, and/or register interest in participating.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/19/hunter-valley-coal-void-moves-closer-to-filling-with-pumped-hydro/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 19, 2021",Hunter Valley coal void moves closer to filling with pumped hydro,"Open-cut coal mining by Muswellbrook Coal began on its Upper Hunter site in 1944. Now owned by Idemitsu Australia Resources (IAR), it is next year scheduled to cease operations in their current form. Energy gen-tailer, AGL, and IAR today announced near completion of a preliminary study into the next phase of the pit’s life — as a pumped-hydro facility.
In July 2019, AGL and Idemitsu signed an MoU to investigate the engineering feasibility of the Bells Mountain 250 MW, eight-hour duration pumped-hydro energy storage (PHES) project, after the potential for repurposing the pit was identified by Muswellbrook Shire Council.
Around six gigalitres of water are expected to be stored in the void, and excess renewable energy will be used to pump stored water 2,000 metres up Bell’s Mountain to a new 1.9-gigalitre reservoir yet to be constructed. Water will be released to flow through energy-generating turbines as needed.
With only a month to expected completion, the study so far indicates that the $450 million dollar project has legs.
IAR Chief Commercial Officer, Chris Walsh, said in a statement, that the results are promising.
Markus Brokhof, Chief Operating Officer at AGL, added, “As we transition to more renewable energy sources, pumped hydro provides a reliable on-demand generation source.” He indicated that AGL views the project as potentially beneficial to both the local community and to Australia’s energy transition.
“Innovative rehabilitation solutions, such as the reuse of mine voids … ensure that sites like Muswellbrook can continue to generate investment and long-term employment,” said Walsh.

The PHES facility is expected connect to the grid via a nearby 330 kV substation, and Idemitsu plans to reroute water licenses currently applied to coal mining and the running of AGL’s Liddell Power Station, which is scheduled to close in 2023, to fill the void over a period of 18 months.
The project is currently mooted for completion in 2027, and both companies today expressed their intention to proceed to a full feasibility study — including targeted geotechnical drilling, detailed design of the project, securing of environmental approvals and contractor engagement — when the current study is complete.
AGL’s other plans for transforming electricity generation on its Liddell and Bayswater Power Station sites include pilots for waste-to-energy and solar-thermal plants, under its new entity Prime Co.
The splitting of AGL into the energy-generating company,dubbed Prime Co, and a retail provider of energy and other services temporarily named New AGL, was announced last month. It has been viewed by some as a cynical move to separate the responsibilities of coal-plant closure — unattractive to investors — from a cleaner, more investible entity, in advance of a full demerger.
However, after last month’s investor briefing AGL Chief Executive Brett Redman characterised the companies soon-to-be decommissioned coal plants in the Hunter as the site of an emerging “energy hub … where we are starting to show some of the vision about where we can invest in all sorts of energy-based projects that build into the longer-term future.”
He added that the company is moving to “repurpose the grid connections that we have got as well as the land and the other infrastructure”.
AGL is certainly investing in dispatchable stored energy, although at least one of its planned forays into PHES has recently been shelved: that is, the use of voids at Hillgrove Resources Kanmantoo copper mine in South Australia to construct a 250 MW pumped-hydro facility was terminated in February.
Its other planned energy storage projects, based around fast-response batteries, include: a 200 MW grid-scale battery at AGL’s Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, and a 250 MW one-hour-duration battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia.
Idemitsu, meanwhile, has coal-mining operations in Queensland and New South Wales which produce a total of around 14 million tonnes of coal per annum, and Walsh says it is investigating additional renewable energy developments and export opportunities via its new subsidiary Idemitsu Renewable Development Australia (IRDA).
In Japan, parent company Idemitsu Kosan, also operates solar, wind and geothermal projects, and commercial fuel-cell-vehicle stations. Walsh says IRDA plans to leverage such global expertise, plus battery storage, to develop renewable power projects across its existing coal sites, and thereby “continue to contribute to regional communities like Muswellbrook”.
Brokhof says that the feasibility study into Bells Mountain, is part of AGL’s “commitment to deliver a mix of technologies to the energy system and aligns with our Climate statement and target of net-zero emissions by 2020”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/19/solar-battery-system-saves-lives-securing-power-for-marine-rescue-narooma/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 19, 2021",Solar-battery system saves lives securing power for Marine Rescue Narooma ,"Last week saw the energising of a 6.3 kW solar PV array and a matching 6.3 kWh battery at Marine Rescue Narooma, funded due to the efforts of volunteer organisation Southcoast Health and Sustainability Alliance (SHASA).
The system is designed to augment and expand the essential rescue organisation’s existing Emergency Power facility which provides electricity for wireless communications and maintains lighting in the building during a mains power blackout.
Marine Rescue Narooma is part of a network of coastal guardians that responds to vessels in distress; searches for missing boats; operates the Marine Rescue App, which provides weather warnings and a logging system for vessels heading out and returning to port; and trains volunteers with the skills and knowledge needed to save lives on the water.
Working out of the old Pilot House that overlooks Narooma Inlet and Bar — one of the most tricky to navigate on the east coast — the Narooma crew operates rescue vessel NA30 and two other Rescue Water Craft, as well as the latest radio communications technology.

Its rooftop installation is the third solar PV project in Narooma and the eleventh in the shire facilitated by SHASA, which also runs the Eurobodalla Solar Bulk Buy opportunity in collaboration with Micro Energy Systems Australia (MESA), a local Clean Energy Council-accredited solar installer and retailer which specialises in providing solar equipment suited to the community’s coastal environment.
SHASA chair, Kathryn Maxwell, says the organisation is “committed to supporting the transition to renewable energy”. Its goal is to see the Eurobodalla coast 100% powered by renewables by 2030.
SHASA’s recently updated strategic plan includes: researching and assisting in the development of community solar farms, microgrids and battery storage; educating home and business owners on the benefits of energy efficiency measures; promoting electric vehicles and e-bikes as a way of reducing transport emissions; and supporting subsidised low-income access to solar power.
SHASA also applies for grants on behalf of community organisations, under various schemes designed to fund solar installations — in the case of Marine RescueNarooma, it successfully applied to the Federal Government’s Community Energy Efficiency and Solar Grants 2020.
Although envisaged in 2020, the project hit a snag in that the roof of the Pilot House was made of corrugated asbestos sheeting, which had to be replaced before the solar panels could be installed.
In cases where an organisation has limited funds and grant funding only partially covers the cost of a project, SHASA and MESA have combined their resources to cover the shortfall.
In 2019 it contributed more than $5,000 for the cost of 18 solar panels and an inverter that have helped the local Uniting Church to more comprehensively support the 80 or so people who come to its weekly community lunch in the church hall known as Monty’s Place. Its solar system has saved the charitable “event”  — that serves good food in an atmosphere of good company for people in need — more than $2,000 a year in electricity bills, with those savings readily redeployed to support the provision of services such as Legal Aid and Anglicare.
Other solar installations successfully enabled by SHASA since it was inaugurated in 2014, include a 12.82 kW PV system for Batemans Bay Surf Life Saving Club in Malua Bay, and a 9.45 kW system for Narooma Men’s Shed.
In a release celebrating the Marine Rescue installation, Maxwell asks, “Can volunteer community groups make a difference?” She already knows the answer: “They most definitely can.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/19/sas-1-08-billion-deal-with-the-feds-to-produce-more-gas/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"APRIL 19, 2021",SA’s $1.08 billion deal with the Feds to produce more gas!,"In a $1 billion-plus so-called State Energy and Emissions Reduction Deal between the Commonwealth Government (contributing $660 million) and the South Australian Government (contributing $422 million), announced on the weekend, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor blew a very loud trumpet for gas extraction, “to help increase the supply of reliable and affordable gas to users in South Australia and the broader east coast market”. But a number of urgently needed, renewable-energy-boosting projects also got a leg up.
The parties to the deal agreed on $100 million of joint support for Project EnergyConnect, a superhighway of new electricity transmission infrastructure connecting South Australia and New South Wales, with a diversion into Victoria, which promises to unlock gigawatts of planned renewable energy projects in its path, and help stabilise the tail end of the National Electricity Market, facilitating bi-directional energy flows as needed.
The funding will be allocated to “underwriting of key early works” for the 900 km, $1.53 billion project, which has been jumping through regulatory-approval hoops since 2018, and which is expected to commence construction this year, subject to completion of environmental planning and assessment process, resolution of land access discussions, and route refinement.
The eventual upshot for residential consumers is an expected $100 per annum reduction in electricity costs in South Australia, and between $58 and $64 less to pay in NSW; businesses will also benefit, and the project is expected to generate 1,700 jobs during construction, plus 950 ongoing positions.
The most substantial piece of the funding pie — $400 million from the Commonwealth — is allocated to investment in Federal Government “priority areas such as carbon capture and storage”, “electric vehicles”, neutral-coloured (unspecified) “hydrogen” and “other emissions reduction projects in South Australia to help meet and beat Australia’s commitments under the Paris Agreement”.
South Australian Premier Steven Marshall gave slightly more detail in his statement, saying that the agreement, “coordinates our efforts to deliver … the infrastructure needed for electric cars, and generate new revenue for farmers from carbon reductions”. 
The Commonwealth is also proffering up to $110 million in concessional finance for solar thermal and “other storage projects in South Australia”, Morrison’s press release said.
But the most detailed and primary of the key components of the deal is that South Australia agrees to generate an additional 50 petajoules per annum of gas by the end of 2023, and chase a stretch target of 80 petajoules per annum by 2030 “to help increase the supply of reliable and affordable gas to users in South Australia and the broader east coast gas market” — a general statement to which Angus Taylor added, “as part of our gas-fired recovery”.
It seems incredible in the wake of this month’s ABC Four Corners expose — Fired Up: What’s driving the Federal Government’s push for a gas-fired future — of the partisan machinations that contributed to this line of thinking, that the Government could still be brazenly pursuing it.
Tim Buckley, Director of Energy Finance Studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) in Australia and South Asia, commented last week that, “Conventional or ‘natural’ gas use in Australia’s National Electricity Market has fallen 59% in the last five years due to massive overpricing and supply concerns, while renewable energy has grown strongly.”
Almost at the same time as the Four Corners’ report, the Clean Energy Council released its study, Battery Storage: The new, clean peaker which showed that batteries are now able to more cheaply and efficiently meet peaks in electricity demand in the NEM than open-cycle gas turbine plants, or gas peakers, can. And they generate far fewer emissions.

As if in concert, in March, Australian gentailer AGL announced it would build one of the world’s biggest batteries (250 MW/1,000MWh) at its Torrens Island gas power plant in South Australia.
“The significance of this project is the four hours of storage, suggesting that AGL now sees batteries as already competitive with gas generators to meet peak demand periods,” says Buckley.
Morrison’s announcement of the State Energy and Emissions Reduction Deal elaborates on its gas focus as, “Achieving improved and lower cost gas production in the Cooper Basin and a step change in gas production in the Otway Basin”.
Beach Energy has recently made new gas discoveries in the Otway Basin: first gas from two new wells in the Geographe field are expected in 2022, and its rig is then expected to move on to drill four more wells in the Thylacine discovery.
But only last Friday, Origin Energy gave an update on its share price guidance for FY2021 to investors, announcing “an adverse and unexpected outcome on a domestic gas contract price review” for gas purchased from Beach Energy’s Otway Basin fields, which had been referred to arbitration.
The arbitrator issued a partial award which will result in the gas price likely being above Origin’s expectations “and recent comparable wholesale contracts”, the company said.
Its update continued: “The outcome is expected to result in an increase in Origin’s cost of supply of $30-$40 million for FY2021, increasing further to $60-$80 million in FY2022 consistent with an expected increase in volume.”
This is just one example of the cost of gas belying the promise constantly made by Morrison and Taylor in relation to gas that it will provide “affordable, reliable power” and that “That is what reduces prices and creates  jobs,” as Morrison said again on Sunday.
An agreed, minimal role for gas
Another recent report, Go for net zero: A practical plan for reliable, affordable, low-emissions electricity, released by Australia’s The Grattan Institute — a non-partisan think tank dedicated to informing public policy in key economic and social areas — this month confirmed that Australia “can achieve a net-zero carbon emissions electricity system without threatening affordability or reliability of supply”.
Authors of the report, Tony Woods, Director of Grattan’s Energy Program, and Associate, James Ha, summarise, “Gas is likely to play the critical backup role” to ramped up renewable supply, “though not an expanded role”.
That is, “Australia will make a gas-supported transition to a net-zero emissions electricity system – but not a ‘gas-led recovery’ from the COVID recession.”
Overall, yesterday’s SEERD but undercooked announcement by the Prime Minister showed a dogged adherence to gas-fired energy, some-kind-of-hydrogen, unproven carbon-capture-and-storage rhetoric that must make Australians nervous; given growing evidence in favour of other technologies providing cheaper, more reliable solutions that create far lower emissions in the first place.
The greater silk purse within the deal will likely emerge in specific projects over coming months. In the meantime, Premier Marshall, having signed up for gas, as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian did before him, reminded South Australians: “Importantly, this MoU backs the SA-NSW Interconnector” aka Project EnergyConnect, “which will secure the South Australian grid, increase renewable energy and bring down bills for consumers in SA by around $100.”
