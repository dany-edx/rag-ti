https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/12/h2c-gives-go-ahead-for-goondiwindi-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 12, 2023",H2C gives go-ahead for Goondiwindi green hydrogen project,"The Hydrogen Collective (H2C) said the $15 million (USD 10.1 million) Goondiwindi Hydrogen project is moving to the procurement and construction phase following the announcement of a financial investment decision and the formal execution of a 20-year agreement with the Goondiwindi Regional Council.
H2C said the new hydrogen production facility will utilise the power generated from a 2.5 MW solar array and wastewater from the Goondiwindi wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to produce green hydrogen via electrolysis with early estimates indicating the facility could produce up to 1,350 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year.
While most of the initial output has been earmarked for local customers including agricultural users and heavy industry, H2C, which will manage the production and sale of the project’s hydrogen, said it is now in a position to confirm supply arrangements for other businesses, governments and project consortia requiring green hydrogen.
“Given that the majority of green hydrogen projects currently in development are not supplying the domestic retail market, H2C is in a unique position to discuss viable supply solutions with businesses and projects situated along the eastern seaboard of Australia,” the company said.
“While the majority of supply for the initial stages of the project has been secured for locals in Goondiwindi, H2C has the capability to rapidly increase green hydrogen production to meet additional requirements. Pending volume requirements, this supply can commence in the first quarter of 2024.”
H2C said construction of the Goondiwindi Hydrogen project will commence within the next month and it is planned to be operational before the end of the year.
Brisbane-based H2C said coupling a green hydrogen production facility alongside a wastewater treatment plant helped overcome issues relating to securing water supply. About nine litres of water are needed to produce 1kg of green hydrogen via electrolysis, with 8kg of oxygen as a by-product.
With more than 1,200 wastewater treatment plants around Australia, H2C Managing Director Simon Shaw said the Goondiwindi Regional Council is forging a pathway that other councils can follow.
“Producing and using renewable energy within the local area supports local economic growth and the reduction of carbon emissions across the region,” he said. “The leadership shown by Goondiwindi Council to support this innovative concept will provide the platform for other councils to develop similar concepts and realise similar benefits that support their regions.”

Goondiwindi Mayor Lawrence Springborg welcomed the progress on the project and said the benefits of the green hydrogen production facility will go beyond generating commercial revenue for H2C.
Council said oxygen generated during the hydrogen production process will be used to aerate the wastewater, increasing operational efficiency and substantially extending the life of the border town’s wastewater treatment plant.
“Council has been very active in pursuing this project as it has the potential to save our ratepayers millions in the replacement cost of the existing aging infrastructure, as well as reduce the on-going operational expenses,” Springborg said.
“The technology we’ll be using isn’t necessarily new, but as far as we know it certainly hasn’t been used in this combination and towards this outcome before.”
“We’re very excited to be one of the first councils in the country to be involved with this process and to look at innovative ways of turning what was a waste product into a renewable energy source for local industry.”
H2C said it has secured $6 million for the initial stages of the project, including from Sydney-headquartered Juice Capital Energy, with further capital to be committed once local demand for green hydrogen increases.
The Queensland government has allocated $2 million in funding for the project as part of its $35 million Hydrogen Industry Development Fund.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/12/anteotech-turns-to-silicon-to-deliver-better-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 12, 2023",AnteoTech turns to silicon to deliver better batteries,"Graphite has served as the dominant anode material for much of the early phase of lithium-ion battery chemistry but Brisbane-based AnteoTech is now seeking to commercialise its silicon anode technology which it says delivers a performance-enhancement trifecta – increasing battery capacity, decreasing charging times, and lowering costs.
AnteoTech Head of Clean Energy Technologies Business Manuel Wieser said the company’s proprietary AnteoX additive reinforces battery binders and helps maximise the performance of silicon-containing anodes by increasing the energy density, cycle life, and cost efficiency of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems, and consumer electronics.
“The industry has experienced incremental improvements in energy density but… improvements that can be attained by the use of conventional anode and cathode materials are approaching their limit,” Wieser said. “Which is why we are seeing a spectrum of material and cell chemistry innovations that are pursued by the major cell manufacturers and automotive OEMs [original equipment manufacturers].”
Wieser said after pure lithium, elemental silicon has the highest theoretical energy storage capacity for lithium ions. In comparison to graphite, silicon can store up to 10 times more lithium ions by weight and up to three times more by volume.
“This means that the more silicon is incorporated into the anode the smaller and lighter the anode and, consequently, the full battery becomes,” he said. “This translates into battery cells that can store the same amount of energy in a smaller volume or more energy in the same volume.”
“Ultimately, this translates into electric vehicles with additional driving range without having to change the dimensions of the battery pack or, in wearable devices or consumer electronics, that last longer between charges.”

Wieser, who is scheduled to present on the future direction of lithium-ion battery chemistry at the Energy Next conference to be held in Sydney on July 18 – 19, said the shift to silicon also offers benefits when it comes to charging times.
“Given that the electrode reduces in thickness with an increase in silicon content, silicon anodes can also enable fast-charging performance for electric vehicle applications due to the shorter lengths ions and electrons have to travel through the electrode thickness,” he said.
Wieser said the anode electrode thickness of pure silicon anode designs can easily reduce up to three times compared to conventional graphite-based anodes.
Silicon does however have drawbacks, including that it expands by up to 280%, given its ability to store more ions compared to conventional graphite materials, and Wieser said if not addressed appropriately this leads to rapid capacity fade and battery life degradation.
The high cost of silicon is also an issue, but Wieser said the key differentiator of AnteoTech’s silicon anode approach is that it uses industrial silicon which is more than eight times cheaper on a dollar per kWh basis compared to other silicon materials in the market.
“AnteoTech’s silicon anodes contain up to 90% of silicon, where mass-produced cells currently contain silicon at levels that are lower than 10%,” he said. “In essence, the company provides the smarts to make this crude silicon work extraordinarily well by pairing the anode design with proprietary technologies.”
Wieser said AnteoTech has already demonstrated pure silicon anode battery cells that achieve 500 full charge and discharge cycles while retaining 90% of the battery’s initial capacity with the full silicon anode product being in late-stage development.
AnteoTech is currently looking to scale up production of AnteoX with a first manufacturing facility being established in Brisbane which will be able it to produce 20,000 litres in its first full year of operation.
The move comes after AnteoTech earlier this year signed separate non-binding agreements with Swiss-based battery developer Wyon AG and Trinseo Europe, a division of global plastics manufacturing conglomerate Trinseo.
The partnership with Trinseo aims to improve the binding processes in silicon anode battery construction, while the partnership with Wyon seeks to develop and test AnteoTech’s anode design to deliver a material improvement in the performance of Wyon’s battery cells.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/12/vehicle-to-everything-can-be-the-answer-to-support-the-grid-gridbeyond-finds/,"EV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 12, 2023","Vehicle to everything can be the answer to support the grid, GridBeyond finds","In its latest white paper, The Electrification Era – Scaling Up Electric Vehicles, GridBeyond looks at the impact of EVs in some of the world’s largest markets and the challenges and opportunities faced by each country. It also considers how EVs could revolutionise the way energy is managed and used through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology. The paper also looks at EV fleets and the opportunities for businesses to not only secure additional revenues but to further boost their green credentials by helping the grid to increase levels of renewables generation in the energy mix.
Australia has been regarded as a slow adopter on the world stage and EVs comprise about 3.4% of total new vehicle sales – compared with the global average of 8.6%. But things are now moving fast. The number of EVs in Australia has almost doubled over the past year, growing from 44,000 at the beginning of 2022 to more than 83,000, according to research based on sales data released in the Electric Vehicle Council’s yearly recap. That figure is expected to top 100,000 in the coming months, driven in part by government support. 

For example, New South Wales and Victoria have set a target of 50% of new cars sold to be electric vehicles by 2030. In NSW, electric vehicles are exempt from stamp duty and the first 25,000 EVs  sold for under $68,750 receive a $3,000 rebate. Meanwhile, Canberra announced in March 2023 that it was going live with what it claims to be a world-first project in V2G technology. The initial Realising Electric Vehicles to Grid Services (REVS) trial – which launched in 2020 – used a fleet of 51 vehicles to explore the ability of EVs to provide frequency regulation services.
The amount of new added demand for electricity will by itself become a challenge for grids all around the world, and in particular for  constrained grids. With charge timing, the challenge is when consumers will charge their vehicles. In most grids, the peak hours are the ones right when people are arriving home from work, so if business fleets finish operations at 5pm and immediately plug their EV fleet in to charge, that is going to be difficult for the grid operator. 

V2X is the overall term for different forms of bi-directional charging and discharging of the EV battery, including vehicle-to-grid (V2G), vehicle-to-building (V2B), and vehicle-to-load (V2L). These have the potential to revolutionise the way we use and manage energy in transportation, homes and businesses. This means that when power supply is low and demand high, connected EVs can instead release power back into the electricity network or the site on which they are parked. 
Price dynamics are already creating an opportunity for EV owners who, by automating their systems to charge only when the electricity price has fallen to a given level, can reduce their costs. For end users, V2X technology can provide an additional revenue stream. EV owners can sell the stored energy in their vehicle’s battery back to the grid during peak demand periods, earning credits or cash payments. This can help offset the cost of owning an EV and make it more affordable for more people to adopt this clean energy technology.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/12/cefc-backs-developers-vision-for-100-renewables-apartments/,"COMMUNITY,FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 12, 2023",CEFC backs developer’s vision for 100% renewables apartments,"The federal government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has issued an $80 million loan to Mulpha Australia to support the construction of the first stage of the developer’s proposed $1 billion Norwest Quarter master-planned community in the New South Wales capital’s northern suburbs.
The CEFC capital is being matched by an $80 million green loan from ANZ Bank.
The first stage of the planned nine-tower Norwest Quarter precinct, located 35 kilometres northwest of Sydney’s CBD, will include two residential towers featuring 196 “net zero-ready apartments” and 3,500 square metres of retail and commercial space.
Mulpha said the apartments will consume 50% less electricity from the grid and will be powered by 100% renewable energy with an all-electric and gas-free design.
Both towers will feature rooftop solar and electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities and the apartments will include energy efficient appliances, LED lighting, induction cooktops and heat pump hot water systems.
With the residential sector contributing 12% to Australia’s total carbon footprint and residential buildings responsible for about 24% of Australia’s overall electricity use, CEFC Chief Executive Officer Ian Learmonth said the project showcases how low-emission buildings can be achieved with existing technology.
“Sustainable high-density residential buildings have a leading role to play in the future of our cities and are particularly relevant to growing areas like north-western Sydney,” he said.
“Norwest Quarter is an ambitious development that has innovated by taking a holistic approach to optimise sustainability at every level of the building process. We need to lock in this approach to all new and existing buildings as we target net-zero emissions.”
The developer said each apartment in Norwest Quarter will consume two thirds less energy than a typical code compliant apartment and will underpin residents’ aspirations for zero carbon living at up to 25% less cost.
Mulpha Head of Developments Tim Spencer said the project is one of the most ambitious residential projects in Australia in terms of sustainable practices, initiatives and design considerations.
“The design of both buildings far exceeds standard sustainability regulations with best practice passive design principles and high-performance environmental initiatives throughout,” he said.
Mulpha said the 196 apartments will have an average 7-star Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) rating and will emit over their projected lifetime 30,132 tonnes of carbon dioxide less than the conventional equivalent.
When complete, the Norwest Quarter master-planned community will span more than 3.8 hectares and comprise 864 apartments over nine towers and 6,000 square metres of retail and commercial space.
The precinct is forecast to be completed in four to five stages and take eight to 10 years to complete.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/12/global-pv-manufacturing-capacity-to-reach-1-tw-by-2024/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"JUNE 12, 2023",Global PV manufacturing capacity to reach 1 TW by 2024,"From pv magazine Global
Global solar PV manufacturing capacity is set to nearly double next year, reaching almost 1 TW, according to the IEA. This expansion would be sufficient to meet the agency’s annual net zero demand for 2050, which anticipates PV deployment of nearly 650 GW in 2030 and almost 310 GW in 2024. However, the industry is grappling with the challenge of oversupply.
In 2022, global PV manufacturing capacity increased by more than 70% to nearly 450 GW, with China accounting for more than 95% of new additions across the supply chain. In 2023 and 2024, global PV manufacturing capacity is expected to double, with China again accounting for more than 90% of the increase.
Chinese manufacturers are investing in expanding wafer, cell, and module manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Additionally, manufacturing plants are expected to be deployed in India and the United States due to new industrial policies introduced last year.
India’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have led to a surge in new solar manufacturing projects. Between November 2022 and May 2023, more than 120% of such projects were announced, potentially creating national supply chains with more than 20 GW of capacity in each region.
In Europe, new manufacturing capacity accounts for just 14% of the announced projects since August 2022. The EU Green Deal Industrial Plan and the Net-Zero Industry Act aim for Europe to produce 40% of its PV targets by 2030, but specific incentives are not currently included. High prices of industrial energy have also increased the cost of manufacturing solar PV equipment in EU countries.
“Without a manufacturing policy or domestic content premiums, solar PV manufacturing in the European Union is less competitive than in India or the United States,” said the IEA.
In Europe, less than 1% of manufacturing capacity is dedicated to new cells, while ingots and wafers account for 9%, and polysilicon production is at only 6%. Integrated manufacturing facilities produce three or more components, but nearly 80% of their announced capacity excludes dedicated polysilicon production. Additionally, the capacity of new module assembly plants, which is almost 30 GW, does not align with the announced capacity for other components, particularly cells and polysilicon. As a result, these new plants will still need to import cells and other components from China.
The combined new solar PV manufacturing announcements in India, the United States, and Europe amount to 30 GW for polysilicon and 100 GW for module assembly.
