In the researcher’s base case scenario, these sites could generate 366.94 TWh over the project lifetimes and abate 300 kilotons of carbon emissions, they said. Looking also at the economics of the potential sites, the researchers said the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) ranged between $0.04/kWh – $0.27/kWh in the base case scenario.

The 14 sites were identified as part of a demonstration of the pumped hydro site selection tool the researchers had developed. Specifically, the tool combines Geographic Information System and Analytic Hierarchy Process to assess sites in a manner relevant for Australia.
To date, research on pumped hydro site selection is dominated by European case studies, the researchers noted, adding that often these tools only consider topography, without examining economics, environmental, or social impacts.
While elevation head, slope, and water accessibility are the most weighted criteria for the researchers, their tool considers a number of additional technical and environmental factors, which were then used to examine project economics.
In 2022, the Queensland government unveiled its $62 billion Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, which includes the biggest pumped hydro scheme in the world. Despite state government support for pumped hydro storage – which is viewed by many officials as a reliable, deep storage solution – the researchers note “information on suitable sites is still scarce.”
They developed the site selection tool to remedy this dearth. Their model has been designed to detect only three types of pumped hydro configurations from a large number of believed to be suitable sites. That is, linking pairs of existing reservoirs; linking one existing reservoir with a new reservoir on a greenfield location; or linking two greenfield locations, with an admissible head difference to form a pumped hydro system.
The researchers’ full paper, entitled ‘Integrated GIS-AHP-based approach for off-river pumped hydro energy storage site selection’ has been published in Applied Energy.

The $10 million (USD 6.677 million) Phillip Island Community Energy Storage System was switched on over the weekend, with the ceremony attended by the Victorian Minister for Energy and Resources, Lily D’Ambrosio.
The battery system is to monitored and maintained by Mondo, a commercial subsidiary of AusNet Services. The project was delivered by TEC-C.
While it has been dubbed a community battery, storing the local’s excess solar power appears to be a second tier priority, coming after the technology’s grid stabilisation services. The battery’s primary tasks include helping the island meet peak demand during summer holidays as well as helping to power the Australian motorcycle Grand Prix, which is held on the island. 

“Over the busy summer period Phillip Island’s population more than quadruples, causing a significant strain on the local electricity network and at times, leads to power dropping out,” Mondo said of the Phillip Island Community Energy Storage System (PICESS).
“The PICESS has been built to provide relief for the network and the local Phillip Island community over this peak period and in time, the system will also be powered by renewable energy,” it added.
The project was partially supported by the Victorian government’s $10.92 million Neighbourhood Battery Initiative. “The initiative strengthens our understanding of neighbourhood-scale batteries’ role in Victoria’s transitioning electricity system,” the state government said in its announcement.
“The government is also delivering 100 more neighbourhood batteries across the state through its Victorian Budget 2023/24 investment of $42.3 million – tripling the number of homes with access to renewable energy storage. Work is underway with community groups, councils, distribution companies to identify locations,” it added.

The 2.4 MW solar carpark will be used to load and park trucks.
The system produces 3,000 MWh of solar energy per year and was installed by NGE / Beon Energy Solutions.
The carpark is stage one of a three stage project, the next stages of which will involve installations on existing market and warehouse roof space at the Authority’s 67-hectare site in Epping in North Melbourne.
“Once the entire project is complete, the market will host a 10 MW rooftop solar panel system, which will be one of the largest rooftop installations in Australia,” CEO of the Melbourne Market Authority, Mark Maskiell, said.

Coming back to the solar carpark, the system uses 450 W LG panels and SolarEdge commercial inverters. The 5,432 solar panels have been placed on the newly built loading zone as well as an existing warehouse and are expected to offset 10% of the wholesale market’s annual energy usage and 1.77 tonnes of carbon emissions.
The Melbourne Market Authority, a Victorian government entity, links fresh food and flower growers with wholesalers, retailers and distributors.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/06/brisbane-company-unveils-100-kw-hydrogen-battery-using-csiro-tech/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 6, 2023",Brisbane company unveils 100 kW hydrogen battery using CSIRO tech,"To be used as a testing platform, Brisbane-based startup Endua has unveiled its first hydrogen battery in the Brisbane suburb of Archerfield, nearby the company’s headquarters. Endua’s hydrogen power bank uses electrolysis technology developed by the CSIRO and is capable of powering 100kW per unit.
The Archerfield hydrogen battery is roughly six metres long and three metres wide, and provides enough power to drive a water pump, farm shed or standalone telecom infrastructure, Endua said.
The solution is designed to replace diesel generators in off-grid and remote locations, with the company listing farms, telecommunications infrastructure, and microgrid communities as potential users.
Endua’s hydrogen battery works by using renewable energy to power the small-scale, CSIRO-developed PEM (Polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyser. The hydrogen produced is then stored as a compressed gas, and can be converted back to electricity on demand via the internal fuel cell.
“Our power banks mean we can decouple standalone and microgrid power systems from fossil fuel-generated diesel and provide a cheaper long-term solution than batteries,” Endua chief executive Paul Sernia, founder of EV charger maker Tritium, said.
According to the company, the hydrogen battery is highly configurable and can be scaled according to on-site demand due to its modular design.
Australia, especially Western Australia, has been rapidly deploying solar-driven standalone power stations and microgrids, as these technologies offer significant cost savings compared to maintaining poles and wires or diesel generators. These solutions, however, almost always include a small diesel backup generator. It seems Endua is seeking to fill this ‘last line of defence’ application.
In May, the company announced it had raised more than $11.8 million to scale its hydrogen battery solution. Investors in the raise included the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC), Melt Ventures, and long-time backers Ampol, Australia’s largest petroleum company, and the CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency.
Founded in 2021, Endua says its chemical and mechanical engineering expertise – which comes particularly from partner Sarb Giddey, Group Leader of the Thermal and Electrochemical Technologies Group in the Energy Technologies Program at CSIRO Energy – as well the use of cheaper materials and mass manufacturing has meant it could develop a “commercially viable” hydrogen battery. 
Hydrogen is energy-intensive to make, difficult to store and does is not particularly efficient. Nonetheless, the fact its energy is stored in a chemical composition has made it an intriguing backup solution in many eyes. In May, Australia’s federal government announced its $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program as part of its 2024 Budget. The Hydrogen Headstart will provide a credit per kilogram on the production price, though this seems to be mostly for large-scale projects. 
Endua is currently in the process of commercialising the newly-unveiled 100 kW power bank.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/06/vni-west-project-could-delay-the-retirement-of-coal-generators/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",,"JUNE 6, 2023",VNI West Project could delay the retirement of coal generators,"The ‘conclusions report’ from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) indicates that under the preferred scenario for the Project, which would see the transmission line crossing the Murray River north of Kerang (Wamba Wamba Country) instead of near Echuca, coal generation may increase in Australia by ~ 1 TWh a year for a period of three years, starting in 2030.

Despite accounting for just 6.5% of the annual expected coal generation during 2030-2033, the increase in transmission limits from VNI West opens up opportunities for New South Wales (NSW) coal to export energy to Victoria during periods when wholesale prices in NSW are lower than in Victoria. As a result, NSW may experience higher energy prices during these periods, while Victorian prices may decrease. Combined with the retirement of Eraring and delayed energy transition targets in NSW, this dynamic could lead to increased output and profitability for the remaining coal units in NSW. If a unit is forecast to be profitable, there is limited economic reason to retire that plant, and therefore VNI West has real potential to delay the retirements of NSW coal units.
Figure 1 below shows the annual coal generation outlook in NSW (based on 2022 Integrated System Plan (ISP) assumptions), available coal capacity in the state, and the time window that represents the required additional coal generation as a result of VNI West development (~1 TWh a year between 2030-2033).

It is crucial to note that this increase in coal generation may not align with the most efficient solution for emissions reduction. Energy Ministers have recently fast-tracked the introduction of an emissions reduction objective into national energy objectives, raising concerns about the compatibility of the expected coal generation surge with future emission reduction plans.
Mehrdad Aghamohamadi, Energy Market Analyst at Cornwall Insight:
“This projected need for increased coal generation presents an interesting dynamic for the industry, particularly for coal plants. With the anticipated rise in exports to Victoria, alongside the retirement of Eraring and the delayed energy transition targets in NSW, there exists the possibility of a considerable uptick in prices and potentially enhanced profitability, giving coal generators a reason to stay in the game.
“Despite this, it is important to recognise the value of considering the broader implications of this potential delay in retirement plans. While the short-term economic benefits may be evident, it is essential to evaluate the long-term alignment with emission reduction goals and the transition to cleaner energy sources.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has published a new market update on the outlook for renewable energy in 2023 and 2024.
It said global renewable capacity additions are set to soar by 107 GW to more than 440 GW in 2023 – the largest absolute increase ever. Solar will remain the main source of global renewable capacity expansion in 2023, accounting for 65% of growth or 286 GW, with distributed generation applications accounting for almost half of the expansion.
“Lower module prices, greater distributed PV system uptake and a policy push for large-scale deployment trigger higher annual additions in all major markets including China, the European Union, the United States, and India,” said the IEA.
However, the agency said that capacity additions will decrease in Brazil from 2023 to 2024, due to Law 14.300 entering into force in early 2022, changing remuneration rates for the distributed generation market. It revised its forecast for renewable capacity additions for 2023 and 2024 upwards by 38% compared to its predictions in December 2021.
“In the European Union, residential and commercial solar PV systems account for 74% of the increase to our forecast, with the majority (82%) of the rise coming from six key markets: Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Sweden,” it added.
The two main trends driving the revised forecast are the increasingly attractive business case for self-consumption since January 2021 and the market conditions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the IEA.
The agency said that it also increased its forecast for utility-scale growth, but to a much lesser extent due to permitting challenges, unsubscribed auctions, and long development timelines. Competitive auctions are expected to remain the leading procurement method in Europe, accounting for at least 65% renewable capacity growth between 2022 and 2024.
“Almost half of this growth will be from auctions for two-way fixed contracts for difference, led by Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain,” said the IEA.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) and merchant plants are expected to account for 22% of Europe’s capacity expansion until 2024. Corporate PPAs will account for most unused projects, led by Spain, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Some unsubsidised projects are also likely to emerge in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Poland, according to the IEA.
“While installations being developed on a fully merchant model are likely to constitute a minority, PPA projects are expected to stack revenues by combining a merchant tail,” it added.

Researchers in China have proposed to hybridise gravity energy storage (GES) with power-based storage solutions such as batteries and supercapacitors, which they say may offer the advantages of all these technologies in a single solution.
The scientists dubbed the proposed combination hybrid solid gravity energy storage system (HGES) and said this technology may find applications in both distribution and transmission grids, while solving the technical problems of GES by avoiding repeated starting and stopping of the motor, which could cause losses and significant fluctuations in output power. “Various possible system structure schemes for the proposed HGES have been investigated,” the research’s corresponding author, Wenxuan Tong, told pv magazine.
In the proposed system configuration, the GES unit is coupled with a power-based storage module. The GES unit is used to absorb excess power from the grid or release power when demand in the grid exceeds production, while the power-based module provides rated power in order to compensate for the fluctuating active power during the operation of the GES system.
The composition of the HGES depends on the type of motor used, the electric drive equipment, the grid access method, and the power-based energy storage access position. “From the perspective of system structural composition, HGES can be divided into mechanical systems, motors, electrical drive systems, grid access systems, and power-based energy storage systems,” the scientists explained.
They also explained that the proper functioning of the HGES system relies heavily on the control of power electronics, noting that different control strategies should be applied in different situations to achieve the best-integrated control effect. Furthermore, they said control strategies should also be implemented at the single-type energy storage system and hybrid energy storage system level.
The academics conducted a series of simulations via Simulink (MATLAB) and found that the proposed system is able to meet their theoretical expectations. “The power-based energy storage in the hybrid gravity storage system can well suppress the inherent power fluctuation problem of GES under the rectangular-based compensation strategy,” they emphasised. “The response speed of the HGES is improved by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to the single GES system.”
Furthermore, they claim the system may achieve an efficiency of over 80%, especially if applied in distribution and transmission grids. “It is an ideal energy storage system without obvious performance drawbacks and will be expected to provide critical technical support for developing renewable energy power systems,” they concluded.
Their findings are presented in the paper “The structure and control strategies of hybrid solid gravity energy storage system,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research team comprises scientists from the North China Electric Power University and the State Grid Smart Grid Research Institute Co., Ltd.
