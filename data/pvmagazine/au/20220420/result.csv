Neutralysis, also Australian, holds a stake in an established Nebraska project alongside Natural Hydrogen Energy, a company with one of the field’s preeminent researchers, Viacheslav Zgonnik, at its helm. The move would effectively be HyTerra’s ‘in,’ giving it access to expertise, room to demonstrate and, probably, a wellspring of naturally occurring hydrogen. 
While the world has known for many decades about hydrogen accumulating under the earth’s surface, the phenomenon has largely been ignored. The main reason for that, HyTerra’s business development manager Luke Velterop tells pv magazine Australia, is simply because there’s previously been no market for it. Hydrogen is finicky to handle and in the past oil and gas have been considered just fine.
Now the urgent need to decarbonise has changed that, and with it opened up new avenues of interest. In February, pv magazine reported that in the past year exploration licenses amounting to one third of South Australia’s total landmass have been either granted or applied for by companies in search of natural hydrogen.

As HyTerra executive director and chief technical officer Avon McIntyre explains, it isn’t that South Australia is particularly bountiful in natural hydrogen accumulations, but simply that the state leads the country in terms of exploration regulations for the nascent industry. Accumulations, he says, may well be found all across Australia. And HyTerra and a handful of other companies are vying to secure them first.
While there remains some debate natural hydrogen, which has until now rarely been a focal point, there is consensus around the two main ways underground accumulations of the molecule develop.
The first, called ‘serpentinisation,’ is an underground reaction between iron and water. As McIntyre, who spent 13 years at Shell as an exploration geologist explains, the reaction occurs when water comes into contact with iron rich rocks in the subsurface, deep enough to be unaffected atmospheric oxygen. “Then those iron-rich rocks, they effectively want to rust, they want to turn into iron oxides… so they will strip the oxygen atom off the H2O and that releases the hydrogen,” McIntyre tells pv magazine Australia.
“This is a well understood process and people have known about it for many, many years. It’s just that nobody’s really considered if this could be an economically viable process.”
The second mechanism is radiolysis of water, in which radioactive rocks split the H20 molecules into its component atoms. The hydrogen then migrates away from the radioactive rocks to accumulate or possibly get stuck in a fracture flux system underground. 
Gold Hydrogen
One of the major points of excitement here is that because these reactions happen naturally without human intervention, they are regenerative – and considered a ‘inexhaustible’ supply. While McIntyre says that’s not technically true, he believes exhausting an accumulation would take a very, very long time.
Here is where scientific opinions begin to diverge. Since natural hydrogen shares similar attributes to oil and gas, it has drawn attention from this industry, with a number of smaller companies and some bigger ones, looking into the world as a potential pivot point or subsidiary stream. These companies, McIntyre says, tend to think of natural hydrogen extraction in terms of trapping an accumulation and drilling it like one would with fossil fuels.
Other companies, however, are looking for fracture systems within rocks which could be intercepted. “Maybe both are right, maybe both wrong,” McIntyre says. “We’re still learning here.”
HyTerra
What is solid is that exploration companies, of which McIntyre estimates there is between four and seven in Australia (some differently named companies ultimately being owned by the same parent), are looking for certain rock types and water conditions.
Again, the question of how to handle the hydrogen which has been released from its underground hideout is far from sorted. The most convenient thing, McIntyre says, would be to burn the hydrogen at the source and generate electricity – but, he adds, that’s probably the least effective way to use resource.
Instead, HyTerra, in partnership with Natural Hydrogen Energy, hopes to blend the natural hydrogen from its Nebraska well into a nearby natural gas pipeline. The company, however, is far from wedded to the notion of pipeline blending, with its executives saying it chose that route in this case because an ammonia plant servicing the fertiliser industry is just down the road and already connected to the pipeline. Currently the ammonia there is produced from gas, and the project is hoping to switch that input to a cleaner alternative.
But the issue of how to handle the natural hydrogen in other project sites remains. “One of the real challenges with hydrogen is being able to store and transport it,” Velterop notes. He also works in this space consulting for Global Energy Ventures, a West Australian company developing hydrogen powered and carrying ships.

In Velterop’s view, it’s likely there are sites where wells could be established either close to market or near infrastructure which could take it to market since, he says, it appears that reservoirs can be accessed from multiple points. “If you can perhaps drill somewhere that’s on the fringes or slightly closer to market so you can minimise the amount of infrastructure needed to take that product to a customer, that’s a real opportunity.”
Velterop acknowledges that people might recoil from the fact the natural hydrogen industry is using essentially the same equipment as fossil fuel industries. The notion of ‘exploiting’ underground natural resources sounds all too familiar for many, and hardly fits into collective visions of green energy futures.
Be that as it may, proponents insist natural hydrogen projects would not only have a smaller footprint than most of the hydrogen rainbow, but that it in fact it would have a smaller footprint than even green, renewable hydrogen. 
This, they say, is because unlike the green hydrogen produced via electrolysis powered by renewable energy, natural hydrogen projects need minimal infrastructure (think, no sweeping solar farms or wind turbines) nor does it need a water source. “We’re clearing a very small footprint drilling a very shallow wellbore versus using tens of thousands of hectares with installations of PV and wind,” Velterop says.
“We would be zero or effectively zero CO2,” McIntyre adds.

Not a fan of the hydrogen colour classification system, Velterop says “we’re kind of scrapping all that and just saying natural hydrogen. 
“We’re confident that the carbon intensity of [natural hydrogen projects] will be the same as that of green hydrogen products, so we’ll be able to sell that at that premium as well.”
Which brings us to the important point of pricing, yet another source of excitement for the burgeoning industry. While HyTerra, which is currently going through the process of relisting on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), is unwilling to make hard price forecasts, Velterop says “the target is certainly to be cheaper than grey hydrogen today.”
At the world’s first ever natural hydrogen conference last year, H-Nat 2021, which was held online and attracted 500 participants, presenters floated pricing ballparks of between US$1 to US$0.5 per kilogram, roughly between $1.35 to $0.70 in Australian dollars. 
Given our federal government’s hydrogen stretch goal is “H2 under $2,” if natural hydrogen projects were demonstrated and proven viable, they could be extremely competitive. For comparison, in 2019 the International Energy Agency’s ‘The Future of Hydrogen’ report calculated grey hydrogen costs ~US$0.9-$3.2 per kg, blue is around US$1.5-$2.9 per kg, and green sits significantly higher at US$3.0-$7.5 per kg.

The cheapness of natural hydrogen rests on its lower upfront and ongoing project costs. McIntyre estimates to develop a natural hydrogen well would cost between AU$1 to $5 million, roughly the same as an oil and gas well since it uses the same equipment and should be (though it remains to be proven) technically straight forward.
Unlike green hydrogen projects, Velterop says, it appears natural hydrogen won’t require the same level of engineering and feasibility studies, meaning the projects should be far quicker to get off the ground. “It’s a lot more accelerated,” he says.
As mentioned, McIntyre estimates there are just a handful of Australian companies in the natural hydrogen game at the moment. Brisbane-based firm Gold Hydrogen is one pv magazine Australia has previously reported on after it secured exploration rights to areas in South Australia where high purity hydrogen was detected back in the 1930s.
As for HyTerra, it recently changed its name from Triple Energy and is hoping to be relisted on the ASX by mid-June. In terms the company’s partnership with Natural Hydrogen Energy, HyTerra will continue to invest in the Nebraska project it is codeveloping with them to earn additional stakes. How the joint venture works is that the more HyTerra invests, the more equity it earns, with the possibility of going all the way up to 51%.
The companies are hoping to complete a longterm well test for the US project later this year, which will inform them of the project’s commercial prospects.
Following this, McIntyre says HyTerra is “evaluating [its] path to Australian operations.” While the regulatory framework for natural hydrogen is still just being considered everywhere except South Australia, the company is hopeful it won’t take too long for the scaffolding to go up. West Australia, for instance, is already making strong headway in this direction.
Given the momentum growing around the vision of Australia becoming a ‘hydrogen superpower,’ the technical ease coupled with the commercial potential of natural hydrogen means we’ll likely be hearing more about this ‘gold’ rush in future.

A newly announced partnership between Quantum Power Asia (QPA) and German large-scale PV developer ib vogt could see that 2022 target overachieved in one fell swoop, as the pair look to construct a AUD$6.7 billion 3.5 GW solar and storage facility in Riau, Indonesia. 
However, rather than serving Indonesia’s renewable energy transition needs (the country is one of the world’s top ten greenhouse gas emitting states), the project development partners are planning to export the plant’s 4 TWh of annually generated solar energy to Singapore. 
The project 
Indonesia’s Riau Archipelago comprises 1,796 islands between Sumatra, Borneo and the Malay Peninsula south of Singapore. QPA and ib vogt plan to construct a 3.5 GW solar plant on 4,000 hectares with a storage capacity of 12 GWh which will be exported to Singapore via an undersea cable. 
The Anantara Project (its name taken from Anantara Energy Holdings, a joint-venture with ib vogt) comes in response to Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA) request for proposals to supply and import clean energy from neighbouring countries as it looks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. 
When fully commissioned in 2032, QPA says the Anantara project would be able to deliver approximately 8% of Singapore’s annual electricity generation. 
QPA managing director and CEO, Simon G. Bell, said the company is “excited to partner ib vogt and present this major integrated initiative to EMA. Should we be successful in being awarded an import licence to Singapore, we will bring up to $5 billion of capital into Indonesia from Singapore, creating more than 30,000 jobs to build what will become the largest PV-storage system globally to date. it will also contribute significantly to Singapore’s journey towards carbon neutrality.” 
ib vogt’s CEO Anton Milner agreed, noting the “bilateral energy import initiative is a landmark project globally and will be a catalyst for the region’s transformation towards clean, carbon-free energy.” 
“Based on the work done together with Quantum Power Asia and Union Energy Corporation” continued Milner, “we are confident we have submitted a compelling proposal to EMA in order to create sustainable long-term value both for Singapore and Indonesia.” 
Singaporean electricity retailer Union Energy Corporation (UEC) has also partnered with the Anantara project in order to distribute the clean imported energy to residential, industrial and commercial customers. 
UEC CEO Ellen Teo said “The recent volatility of energy prices and challenges faced by Singapore’s electricity market underscores the urgent need to review our supply of renewable energy. We are honoured to partner Quantum Power Asia and ib vogt in this transformational project which will greatly benefit Singaporean homes, businesses and the nation at large as we progress towards net zero.” 
Solar-powered Singapore 
Of course, this is not the first mega-scale PV project slated to import solar energy to Singapore via undersea cables. The proposed $26 billion Australia-ASEAN Power Link project, the brainchild of Singapore-based Sun Cable, is set to feature at least 14 GW of prefabricated and pre-wired 5B Maverick solar panels in the Northern Territory outback, coupled with an estimated 33 GWh of battery storage, and transported via a 3,800-kilometre high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. 
Of course, the length of undersea cable between the Riau Islands and Singapore is far shorter, but considering Singapore’s hunger for clean energy there is more than enough space in the market. 
Indeed, in January 2021, United Arab Emirates (UAE) state-owned renewables company Masdar signed a memorandum of understanding with Singapore-based Tuas Power, French energy group EDF, and Indonesian state-owned utility PT Indonesia Power to explore the development of a 1.2 GW solar and potential storage facility in Indonesia for export to Singapore.
Currently, approximately 95% of Singapore’s electricity is generated from natural gas.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/20/storage-projections-for-2050/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",WILLIAM DRISCOLL,"APRIL 20, 2022",Storage projections for 2050,"From pv magazine USA
NREL has presented eight “key learnings” in a newly published report, often in the form of projections. Below is a condensed version.
Battery deployments in the United States will boost storage capacity to 200 GW and 1,200 GWh in 2050 in the reference case, as shown in the image above. Pumped hydro storage capacity will not increase.
Lithium-ion batteries will continue to have the highest market share “for some time,” as system costs for four-hour storage, including all system components and installation, fall to $200/kWh capacity by 2030, and continue to decline. Other technologies “could have new opportunities” if they can compete with battery prices.
The ability to provide firm capacity – which is the greatest value of storage – depends on the fit between storage duration and the duration of the region’s net peak load. Firm capacity enables storage to meet demand during system peak times and to replace gas turbines.
“Time shifting,” or saving energy for discharge at times of high demand, provides a smaller but still significant portion of the value of storage. Providing operating reserves adds minimal value, due to “saturation” of reserve requirements from storage deployed for other reasons. The value of deferring transmission by adding storage was not estimated, as it is “difficult to isolate, and very regionally specific.”
Given the “largely untapped potential flexibility in end-use electricity demand,” storage faces competition from grid flexibility options such as time-varying retail rates and industrial demand response.
Storage and solar power are complementary, as increased deployment of PV shortens the peak net load period, so that shorter-duration storage, at lower cost, can pair with PV to provide firm capacity. The lower costs to provide firm capacity translate to increased storage deployments.
Driving a trend in the opposite direction, as storage deployments increase, the net peak loads become wider, requiring longer-duration storage to provide the same level of firm capacity. As a result, storage durations “will likely increase” as storage deployments increase. As shown in the image above, deployment of six-hour batteries would start around 2034 in a reference case, and deployment of eight-hour batteries would start around 2040. This dynamic “presents opportunities” for emerging technologies capable of longer durations, “or even for the next generation of existing technologies” such as pumped storage hydropower.
Customer adoption of building-level storage will increase as storage costs decline and if the value of backup power is perceived to be higher. Overall, the customer adoption potential will be lower than the economic potential due to long payback periods. At low battery costs and very low PV costs, distributed storage could reach 82 GWh by 2050.
Seasonal storage technologies become “especially important” for 100% clean energy systems, for storing excess generation in the spring and fall and shifting energy supply to the summer and winter. More than 400 GW of seasonal storage capacity, such as combustion turbines fuelled by renewably derived hydrogen, would be needed for 100% clean energy.
The report concludes by listing remaining uncertainties that “could alter the trajectories for storage growth and evolution.” The report briefly describes each of the six previous NREL studies on which it is based.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/20/molecular-thermal-energy-system-can-store-solar-energy-for-18-years/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 20, 2022",Molecular thermal energy system can store solar energy for 18 years,"From pv magazine Global
A Chinese-Swedish research team has developed an energy system that is claimed to be able to store solar energy as chemical energy for up to 18 years. The generator is described as the combination of a Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage System (MOST) with a micro-fabricated system combining a thermoelectric generator (TEG) with a low-dimensional material-based microelectromechanical system (MEMS). The MOST device stores solar energy as chemical energy and then releases it as heat that the MEMS-TEG system turns into electricity.
“The generator is an ultra-thin chip that could be integrated into electronics such as headphones, smartwatches and telephones. So far, we have only generated small amounts of electricity, but the new results show that the concept really works. It looks very promising,” said researcher Zhihang Wang.
The MOST device was built with 572 thermoelectric (TE) modules with TE films measuring 1 μm in thickness and a specially designed molecule of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. When it is hit by sunlight, the molecule changes shape into an energy-rich isomer described by the scientists as a molecule made up of the same atoms but arranged together in a different way.
“The isomer can then be stored in liquid form for later use when needed, such as at night or in winter,” the researcher stressed, noting that the system has a solar energy storage efficiency exceeding 0.70%. “A specially designed catalyst releases the saved energy as heat while returning the molecule to its original shape, so it can then be reused in the heating system.”
According to the research group, the generator is able to produce a power output of up to 0.1 nW, which corresponds to a power output per unit volume up to 1.3 W m−3. “The device continuously generated electricity, for the first time, for over 25 minutes,” they further explained. “Our results demonstrate that such a molecular thermal power generation system has a high potential to store and transfer solar power into electricity and is thus potentially independent of geographical restrictions.”
The device was introduced in the study Chip-scale solar thermal electrical power generation, published in Cell Reports Physical Science. The research group is formed by scientists from the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden as well as the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Henan Polytechnic University in China. “A lot of research and development remains before we will be able to charge our technical gadgets or heat our homes with the system’s stored solar energy,” Wang stated.
