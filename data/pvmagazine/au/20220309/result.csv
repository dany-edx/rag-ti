The strangeness begins with the Morrison government’s Emissions Reduction Fund itself and continues all the way until you arrive at the question of why it would want to devalue the credits when higher prices would advantage the projects it claims to champion. 
Given the perplexing situation, pv magazine Australia spoke to experts about what they think is happening, and why.
It’s difficult to grasp what’s happening here without a foundational understanding of what the Morrison government’s Emissions Reduction Fund actually is. 
Core Markets
Basically the fund incentivises projects which the government says abate carbon. To give you a taste of the fund’s most popular “methods,” as they’re known, the first is called ‘human–induced regeneration’ and it involves putting a fence around a piece of land so it can’t be accessed. Another is called avoidance deforestation, which awards landholders carbon credits for not cutting down trees. All fine activities, albeit more likely impacted by rain than human intervention.
For each these activities, proponents are credited with ACCUs measured in tonnes.
How well these carbon abatement projects work has been widely questioned for a whole range of reasons, largely because people think most of the 38 methods or projects probably would have happened naturally so the government shouldn’t be wasting taxpayer dollars incentivising them.
“You can safely say, 75% of carbon credits in the Australian market are ‘hot air,’” Australian Institute’s Climate and Energy advisor Polly Hemming told pv magazine Australia.
Players in this scheme include the landholders, often farmers, the federal government via the Clean Energy Regulator, and carbon credit aggregators. 
These guys, the aggregators, drive around to farms and properties and recruit landholders to start ‘carbon farming.’ These aggregators manage the credits, bundling them together and making handsome returns. Among the biggest carbon credit aggregators are companies GreenCollar and AgriProve.
Historically, the federal government has been the primary purchaser of these credits. It allocated a whopping $4.5 billion to pay for these projects.
On Friday evening, the Federal Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, announced he would give carbon credit creators the option to step away from the contracts they’d entered into with the government which would have seen them paid less than they can now get on the private market.

The average ‘fixed delivery price’ the government had agreed to pay for these credits was around $12 per ACCU. On the private spot market last week though an ACCU was worth around $50.
Instead of keeping the contracts, the minister allowed an out clause.
“Commercially it doesn’t make sense,” Director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, told pv magazine Australia. “The government had the entitlement to all of that gain. Why has it forgone that?”
“I think it’s begging for an explanation,” Mountain said. 
Taylor’s office declined to comment, simply pointing back to the minister’s previous release which categorised the decision as a win for government. 
Unsurprisingly, the price of carbon credits dropped immediately following the announcement, plunging from close to $50 a tonne to today being valued at $29, losing more than 40% of their value within a few days.
Taylor has said the $1.3 billion the government wouldn’t have to pay out should the contracts be voided would be reinvested into the scheme. “That’s just a misconstruction though,” Mountain said. “It’s not a gain for the government.’*
Whether the money goes to the landholders and farmers, as Taylor has implied, Mountain believes will largely depend on the contract they had with the carbon traders.
GreenCollar chief executive James Schultz has since said the “vast majority” would go to landholders, but Mountain and Hemming are skeptical.
“The argument that these carbon credit companies are going to share the gains with the landholders and what-have-you is, I suspect, in large measure, nonsense.”
At best, Mountain says the government could have access to information it hasn’t made public as to why stepping back from lucrative contracts would be a sensible thing to do.
 At worst, it may be a case of dirty dealing, someone getting an ill gotten gain.
As Hemming sees it though, the bigger question is why the government is increasing the supply of carbon credits which inevitably pushes down their value.
It pointed out the federal government has been fast tracking new “methods” or project types which can access the scheme. It said the government has also been varying existing methods, allowing more carbon credits to come out of the same piece of land, as well as lowering the bar for project participation.
All of these actions would increase the supply of credits, which Hemming says does the opposite of the scheme’s stated purpose of emissions reduction.
As Hemming sees it: if you want to reduce emissions, you want carbon credits to be expensive and in demand. This would encourage farmers and other landholders to enter the scheme.
Moreover, it would mean big emitters would be forced to change their ways because they couldn’t simply buy offsets and continue with business as usual.
Cheap carbon credits benefit Australia’s biggest emitters like AGL, Origin, and EnergyAustralia, Hemming said. “As it stands [ACCUs] are so affordable… it’s just always cheaper to go for the offset.” 
“No one is having to do anything, so the effect on emissions is nothing,” Hemming said.
The Emissions Reduction Fund “can’t be all things to all people,” she added. Either it reduces emissions by making that route more attractive than polluting, or it allows carbon credits to be affordable.
Long term, it isn’t clear what effect flooding the market with credits could have. “It’s hard to see what’s going to happen in terms of new projects feeling safe to come into the scheme,” Hemming said.
Hemming noted that whichever route you go, the common player is the carbon aggregator. “No matter what, they are profiting.”
The role carbon aggregators and traders have played in the design of the scheme has also been questioned. Some believe they’ve been able to influence how carbon credits are developed and regulated in Australia – which is obviously cause for concern since it would benefit them.

Just last week, Airbus officially launched its multi-year ZEROe demonstrator program to test a variety of hydrogen technologies. While the FFI news release didn’t specifically mention Airbus’ ZEROe initiative, it has made an animation titled ‘Introducing the ZEROe Airbus fleet, powered by green hydrogen,’ with its logo at the bottom, implying the company’s involvement in the European program.
What FFI and Airbus did say is that the pair had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at Airbus’ headquarters in Toulouse, France, on Tuesday, which will allow both companies to collaborate closely, “as one focused taskforce,” to implement green hydrogen as a fuel within the aviation industry.
The pair plans to “leverage their respective expertise” to support the entry-into-service of a green hydrogen-based aircraft by 2035, they said.
According to the agreement, FFI will provide cost outlook and technology drivers across the supply chain and will build infrastructure deployment scenarios for the supply of green hydrogen to targeted airports. Airbus will provide characteristics on fleet energy usage, scenarios for hydrogen demand in aviation, refuelling specifications and aviation regulatory framework.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI)
Back in November, FFI also began a partnership with Los Angeles-based Universal Hydrogen, its entry into the aviation space. Under that MoU, FFI agreed to take the lead on green hydrogen production and supply activities while Universal Hydrogen said it would lead on delivery logistics to airports and on-airport fuel services.
The aviation industry often cites its ‘fractional’ contribution to carbon dioxide emissions globally, accounting for around 2.5%. FFI founder and Chairman, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, noted however that the global industry’s emissions have doubled since the 1980s.
“People want to travel, reunite with family and friends and explore new places without being forced to pollute the planet,” he said. “The problem isn’t travel, the problem is how we fuel our planes and ships – all of that must turn emissions free. No greenwash, no mirage, just 100% green.”
Forrest gestured to the floods currently ravaging eastern Australia as proof industries must act faster. “Look no further than my home country of Australia to see the disasters of our changing environment. The catastrophic floods on the east coast are being described as “one-in-1000-year events,” which means that every year there is just a 0.1% chance of a flood of that severity happening.

“Australia’s climate has already warmed on average by almost 1.5°C since 1910, and these extreme events are going to occur more frequently if industry doesn’t come together to decarbonise quickly and completely,” he said.
“The future of air travel is green,” Airbus’ Vice President of Zero Emissions Aircraft, Glenn Llewellyn added. 
“Airbus has identified green hydrogen as the most promising option for decarbonisation to meet our environmental challenges. You heard it here first: We are starting the green aviation revolution,” he said.

Business data company IHS Markit has predicted lithium-ion battery prices will not fall until 2024, thanks to rising metal prices, soaring demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and China’s near monopoly on the industry.
The analyst, which has produced a list of cleantech trends for 2022, also said current green hydrogen project timescales will have the world on schedule for a supply crunch of the energy storage medium in 2025.
Amid fierce EV demand for lithium-ion phosphate batteries, London-based, S&P Global-owned IHS has predicted a battery module price increase of 5% this year will drive up the overall cost of stationary battery projects around 3%.
With the analyst having recorded lithium-ion battery price rises of 10-20% in the “later months of 2021,” it predicted price tags will not return to a downward trajectory for another two years and even that development will depend on manufacturers expanding production capacity and seeing off demand from EV makers.
The green hydrogen bottleneck anticipated mid decade is in part a result of project announcements which included plans laid last year for almost 250GW of electrolyser capacity – up from 70GW worth of announcements in 2020, and less than 15GW in 2019. IHS, however, predicted further electrolyser production plans this year and next will help ease any supply squeeze and reiterated an estimate Europe’s green hydrogen demand alone is expected to require up to 250GW of solar generation capacity this decade.
Noting moves by the US and India to onshore solar manufacturing, IHS said it expects the logistics and input cost headaches which drove up the price of solar panels last year will continue to inflate costs this year, particularly for the next four months. The market data firm did state, however, new manufacturing capacity of solar panel raw material polysilicon is coming online faster than expected, solar wafers are becoming more efficient, and new wafer producers are entering the market.
While solar and wind prices may continue to rise this year, IHS said, clean energy remains competitive, in part thanks to cheaper financing costs as banks become accustomed to backing such projects and the world experiences a continued enthusiasm for green finance.
Solar projects with generation capacities no larger than 5MW will account for 45% of new arrays this year, according to IHS Markit, with China and Germany driving more than 60% of demand in the segment.
Brazil will continue to see demand for sub-5MW projects, with net-metered arrays installed through next year not subject to grid charges, and established smaller-scale solar markets in the US and France will be joined by new entrants, with a graphic produced by IHS Markit suggesting they could include Japan, India and Italy.
Home and business rooftop arrays continue to be competitive despite rising panel prices, IHS said, because they are competing against retail energy prices rather than the wholesale levels which utility scale projects have to contend with.

Sacyr Industry, a Spanish engineering services provider, is building a heating system based on PV, geothermal heat pumps and vanadium redox flow batteries at the Moncloa multimodal bus and metro station in Madrid.
The main goal of the demonstrator is the hybridisation of geothermal sources with energy storage to create sustainable buildings with practically zero energy dependence on the conventional grid. Spanish battery provider E22 Energy Storage Solutions is participating as the supplier of the redox flow battery technology.
Underground geothermal drilling was conducted at a tunnel of the station’s metro line to install heat pumps that produce cold air and heat for a space spanning 41,000 square meters.
“We have drilled 150 meters deep,” said Daniel Muñoz, director of geothermal energy and energy efficiency at Sacyr Industrial. “The height available in that tunnel for the drills is four meters, and a standard small drilling rig is already between seven and nine meters, so the drilling cannot be deeper. In addition, we have to install a larger vent to evacuate the fumes from the drill’s motors, which makes the project more expensive compared to a traditional geothermal solution drilling from the surface. But the existence of this tunnel allows us to drill with less disturbance and impact.”
The Moncloa station also houses platforms for Madrid’s metro lines. The area is affected by all the heat generated by the subway and buses, and especially by the solar radiation that heats the asphalt on the outer surface, and cooling requires a lot of energy in the summer.
As chillers, the project uses heat pumps that work by producing only cold and dissipating heat into the atmosphere. Currently, they can produce 2MW of cold air, but the goal of the project is to scale the installation up in the future to provide about 1MW of geothermal energy.
“We could obtain 50% of all the energy demand of the station in a renewable way,” said Muñoz. “In addition, we have included some demonstrative vanadium flow batteries. If this works out, in the future we could ensure that all the air conditioning energy consumed by the station is renewable, considering that the system may be powered by photovoltaics. The thermal energy would be used to air-condition and the electricity to activate the compressors of the heat pumps and chillers.”
Muñoz said the demonstrator features two containers.
“The one with the heat pumps that we connect with the wells and thus provide energy in the form of heat and cold. The other, with the batteries that are recharged through a photovoltaic solar installation, is connected to an electrical panel,” he said.
The Spanish consortium claims this is the first project in which geothermal heat pumps have been hybridised with flow batteries. The developers said it could be replicated and made larger in the same facilities, with more drilling and more heat pumps, or heat pumps with greater capacity or cooling capacity.
