In a statement issued on Monday, Aquila said construction of the first battery energy storage system is expected to get under way in 2023 with Gransolar’s energy storage arm E22 to continue to manage the projects on behalf of the German company.
Gransolar has already built more than 1 GW of solar and storage capacity in Australia and battery division E22 has previously announced plans to develop 13 large-scale batteries in South Australia, Victorian and New South Wales.
Aquila Capital’s Asia-Pacific chief executive Alexander Lenz said the acquisition is the first for the company in Australia, but he expects the market to provide “immense opportunities” for investments in renewable energy and storage.
“In the clean energy mix, battery storage is crucial for system stability and efficiency, which makes them a key component of our investment and development strategy, as well as being essential to realise the full potential of renewables in Australia,” he said.
Lenz said Aquila, which manages more than 12 GW of wind, solar PV and hydropower assets globally, is also actively seeking other clean energy opportunities in Australia, including wind and solar PV, and is aiming to establish a local office this year.
The transaction comes just months after Aquila and New Zealand-based developer Far North Solar Farm announced they would begin construction on a 1 GW portfolio of large-scale solar PV projects across New Zealand’s North and South islands.
The two companies entered a partnership in 2021, announcing plans to develop the estimated $1 billion suite of large-scale solar PV projects which they said could supply about 4% on New Zealand’s total energy demand once completed.
The companies had planned to break ground on four North Island projects this year.

The project, identified as a priority by both the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the NSW government, involves an upgrade of Transgrid’s substations at Yass and Stockdill in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) using SmartValve technology designed by US-based company Smart Wires.
Smart Wires’ modular power flow controller technology enables the real-time control of electricity flows along power lines. The SmartValve system detects areas of congestion in the network and automatically redirects flows to less congested lines.
Transgrid executive manager of works delivery Craig Stallan said the system will increase the capacity for the efficient flow of energy across state lines, unlocking spare transmission capacity using existing transmission infrastructure.
“This is clever technology which benefits both customers and the environment and will allow renewable energy from Victoria to flow into NSW and the ACT when demand is greatest,” he said.
“We are maximising the capacity of the existing infrastructure, resulting in a more secure, stable network that will be able to integrate more renewable energy.”
The VNI project is the first large-scale use of the SmartValve technology in Australia but Smart Wires APAC general manager Aidan Lawlor said the technology has been successfully implemented by the United Kingdom’s National Grid, across Europe, the USA and Latin America.
“We have worked alongside Transgrid for three years to create the right solution for the VNI project with the use of SmartValve technology,” he said.
Nine SmartValve units have already been commissioned at Transgrid’s Stockdill substation, unlocking an extra 120 MW of additional energy to the NSW grid. Six of the units will be installed at Yass by the end of September with testing to get underway in October. These will unlock a further 50 MW of energy.
Commissioning of the units at Yass substation is expected by the end of 2022. The VNI upgrade is scheduled for completion in December.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/12/fortescue-proposes-9-2-gw-green-hydrogen-project-in-egypt/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,EGYPT",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2022",Fortescue proposes 9.2 GW green hydrogen project in Egypt,"The clean energy arm of Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Metals Group has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Egyptian government to explore the development of a green hydrogen production project with a 9.2 GW installed capacity. The project could also include the construction of local manufacturing facilities for wind and solar components.
Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), which is seeking to create a global portfolio of renewable energy projects to supply 15 million tonnes per year of renewable green hydrogen by 2030, said the project could also include the construction of local manufacturing facilities for wind and solar components.
The 9.2 GW project was the topic of discussion for Forrest and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi when they met at the weekend ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), to be held in Egypt from 6 to 18 November 2022.
“Egypt is on the way to becoming a global powerhouse in the green energy value chain and will be ready to show the world that at COP27,” Forrest said.
“Egypt’s excellent wind and solar resources can generate the renewable energy required to produce large-scale green electricity, green hydrogen and green ammonia.”
Sisi said the deal emphasised Egypt’s commitment to catching up with the global march to promote the use of renewable energy and forms part of a national strategy to increase the share of renewables in the country’s total energy mix.
“The meeting tackled collaboration between Fortescue Future Industries and Egypt’s electricity and renewable energy sector in the fields of green hydrogen production and green ammonia with a 9.2 GW installed capacity from renewable energy,” a presidential spokesman said.
“(It also discussed) the localisation of electricity production from solar and wind resources such as solar panels and wind turbines.”

The announcement is the latest for FFI which is exploring multiple projects across renewable energy generation, the manufacturing of clean energy components and green hydrogen production as it seeks to become a “vertically integrated green energy and resources company”.
One of the first key parts of the plan is a 2 GW electrolyser factory being developed in central Queensland. The Gladstone factory is expected to produce its first electrolyser by the end of 2023 but newly appointed chief executive officer Mark Hutchinson said the company is still some time off producing its first green hydrogen.
Hutchinson has been quoted as saying the first production of green hydrogen is at least two years away with first hydrogen exports likely to come from Queensland’s Gibson Island, where the company is working with fertiliser and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot to convert its ammonia-production facility to run on green hydrogen. Currently, the facility uses natural gas as a feedstock.
FFI plans to construct an on-site electrolysis plant which will produce up to 50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year, which would then be converted into green ammonia for Australian and export markets.
“I think the first green hydrogen we produce is probably going to come out of Australia,” Hutchinson said. “Starting off in Gibson Island in Queensland, I would say Queensland will probably be the first cab off the rank to be honest.”
Hutchinson said he expects FFI would start generating revenue by selling hydrogen or ammonia in either 2024 or 2025.
“I’m really hoping we will have some available [in the] ’24, ’25 timeframe,” he said.

The two companies will form a joint venture for PV production. Cells and modules will be produced in two phases of 600 MW each at Websol’s existing unit at Falta in West Bengal, said Amp Energy India, as it announced the signing of a term sheet for the establishment of the joint venture.
Amp Energy, which has a 2 GW portfolio of renewable energy projects built or under contract in Australia, said its entry into PV manufacturing was a “natural progression” and will help it to better control the supply chain.
“We believe that our entry into manufacturing would not only help in backward integration but also help us have better control over the supply chain of critical components,” Amp Energy India chief executive Pinaki Bhattacharyya said.
Websol will hold a 51% stake in the manufacturing venture, while Amp Energy will own the remaining 49%.
The project will be financed via a combination of debt and equity. It will supply up to 50% of its output to Amp Energy India under an off-take agreement. The rest of the power will be sold on the market, in order to fill the demand-supply gap for cells and modules in India.
Amp Energy is pursuing plans to develop the 1.3 GW Renewable Energy Hub of South Australia (REHSA). The $2 billion project hub would include large-scale solar, wind, and battery energy storage assets in South Australia, including three solar projects at Robertstown (636 MW), Bungama (336 MW) and Yoorndoo Ilga (388 MW), supported by a total energy storage capacity of 540 MW. 
As well as its operations in Australia, Amp Energy has established footholds in North America, Japan, Spain, the UK, and India where it has a renewable energy portfolio of more than 2 GW across 15 states in India.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/12/perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-24-efficiency-retains-87-of-output-after-100-days/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2022","Perovskite solar cell achieves 24% efficiency, retains 87% of output after 100 days","A team of US researchers at the federally funded National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have posted results of a new perovskite solar cell that achieved breakthrough levels of stability and efficiency for the photovoltaic material. The project was conducted in partnership with University of Colorado, Boulder, and the University of California, San Diego. 
A new architectural structure enabled the perovskite solar cell to demonstrate a certified 24% efficiency, while retaining 87% of its original output capability after 2,400 hours of operation at 55 degrees Celsius. 
Perovskites are defined by their crystalline structure. They are actively being researched worldwide for their ability to be manufactured at scale as readily printable materials that can be deposited as paper-thin solar cells.  
The flexible, lightweight cells are hailed for their numerous uses, like on low-load roofs, in aviation, wearables, and rapid delivery and rollout in disaster situations. Perovskites are naturally occurring minerals, but they also represent lab-made crystalline structured materials that imitate the natural minerals’ shape. 
Perovskites have made leaps and bounds in their efficiency, growing from 3% in 2009 to over 25% today. However, the material currently struggles with stability, in part because temperature sensitivity causes them to degrade relatively rapidly. The earliest perovskites worked for only a few minutes or hours, but today they have a lifespan of several months.
This research project, published in the journal Nature, employed the use of an “inverted” architecture, rather than the latest architecture that has unlocked record efficiencies. The inverted structure is achieved by using a different layering technique in the glass substrate the perovskite crystals are deposited into.
The team also made use of a new molecule on the surface of the perovskite, 3-(Aminomethyl) pyridine (3-APy). The molecule reacted to the formamidinium within the perovskite to create an electric field on the surface of the perovskite layer.
“That suddenly gave us a huge boost of not only efficiency but also stability,” said Kai Zhu, senior scientist in chemistry and nanoscience at NREL. The newly introduced molecule boosted efficiency from under 23% to over 25%.
Zhu described the results as “state-of-the-art levels of efficiency and operational reliability.”
The project was funded by the Center for Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Semiconductors for Energy (CHOISE), an Energy Frontier Research Center within DOE’s Office of Basic Energy Sciences, and from the DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).
SETO is also funding a project run by University of Arizona to develop a new method for identifying defects in perovskite solar cell development during the manufacturing process.
The University of Arizona is developing a method to detect the creation of defects not after the perovskites are made, which is the traditional operation, but rather during the manufacturing process.
The project uses what lead researcher Erin Ratcliff describes as” an in-line characterization tool.” The aim of the tool is to perform quality control assessment in the exact moments the perovskite cells are made. “This quality control method is also an indication for the long-term stability of the materials you’re making.”
“Large-scale manufacturing of these robust, high-quality perovskite-based photovoltaics will require low-cost and practical quality control methods that can be integrated into an operating line,” said Laura Silva, senior licensing manager for the College of Science at Tech Launch Arizona. “Ratcliff’s approach is overcoming these challenges and making the technology much more attractive in a marketplace that’s demanding higher and higher performance.”
