https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/16/albo-tips-queensland-hydrogen-hub-to-help-unlock-50-billion/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 16, 2023",Albo tips Queensland hydrogen hub to help unlock $50 billion,"With ambitions to establish Australia as a key player in the global hydrogen export market, the federal government has announced a $70 million investment to support the development of the Townsville Region Hydrogen Hub program in northern Queensland.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the funding injection, which the government expects will be matched by the private sector, will encourage innovation and the production of affordable clean hydrogen to meet the needs of a growing domestic and export market.
“This isn’t a niche industry,” he said. “Australia is already one of the largest exporters of energy in the world; a thriving hydrogen industry here in North Queensland will be critical for us to become a renewable energy superpower as well.”
“This is something that will make an enormous difference to Australia’s economy.”
The government said creating a hydrogen industry in Australia could generate $50 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050 while directly generating 16,000 jobs as well as another 13,000 positions for workers needed to build renewable energy projects needed to manufacture green hydrogen.
“The hub will help secure jobs and economic growth in Queensland, and could also pave the way for exports to our valued trading partners in Japan, South Korea and across Asia,” Albanese said.

The federal government funding will form part of a $140 million pool, with eligible organisations able to apply for grants of $30 million to $70 million to develop and deliver green hydrogen projects in the Townsville region.
Grants will be available under an open and competitive application process when applications open in March 2023. Applicants will be assessed in an initial open competitive process, followed by a formal application process for shortlisted applicants.
The Townsville region has already attracted the attention of both Australian and international renewables developers with Edify Energy planning to build and operate a green hydrogen production plant of up to 1 GW about 40 kilometres south of the city.
Queensland-based Ark Energy, a subsidiary of Korea Zinc, the world’s largest producer of zinc, is also pursuing plans to develop a renewable hydrogen facility in the region. The SunHQ hydrogen hub, which will be equipped with a 1 MW electrolyser, is to be located next to Korea Zinc’s existing zinc refinery.

The region’s port facilities, workforce capacity, and nearby renewable energy and sustainable water resources make it an ideal location for a green hydrogen hub. Townsville’s proximity to Asian markets ensure there is also significant export potential.
Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the federal government’s investment in hydrogen hubs now stands at more than $525 million, including the $454 million Regional Hydrogen Hubs program for projects in places like Gladstone, the Hunter Valley, the Pilbara, Port Bonython and Bell Bay.
Bowen said the government is also investing $89.5 million to help the transport sector make the switch to hydrogen, including through hydrogen refuelling stations along Australia’s busiest freight routes.
“Green hydrogen will play a crucial role in Australia’s clean energy transformation and create jobs for technicians, tradespeople and engineers, as well as significant opportunities in related businesses and service industries,” he said. “These regional hubs will give our green hydrogen industry an early-stage springboard to scale, which will help to promote further growth and investment in clean technology.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/16/30-billion-sun-cable-crash-is-a-setback-but-doesnt-spell-end-of-australias-renewable-energy-export-dreams/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 16, 2023",$30 billion Sun Cable crash is a setback but doesn’t spell end of Australia’s renewable energy export dreams,"Sun Cable is expected to cost more than $30 billion (USD 21 million). It proposes to build an enormous, 12,000-hectare solar farm in the Northern Territory, add an enormous 40 GWh battery for electricity storage, then connect Australia to Singapore via Darwin through an undersea cable more than 4,000 kilometres long. This would be by far the world’s longest electricity cable if it existed today.
It would see Darwin access 800 MW of additional electricity and Sun Cable could supply “up to” 15% of Singapore’s electricity by 2030. To put this into context, Singapore’s annual electricity consumption is about one quarter of Australia’s.
While this prominent and well-funded project has gone into voluntary administration, those enthused about rapid decarbonisation and Australia’s renewable energy export potential need not despair. These events are part of the usual discovery processes.
Sun Cable offers an enticing possibility of putting Australia’s land, and the rays of sunshine that fall on it, to use in displacing gas for electricity production in a distant land. Singapore is keen to procure renewable electricity, and has limited ability to produce that electricity itself.
The project has attracted the enthusiastic support of Australia’s two richest men: Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest. Each has already committed about $50 million to the project and both are experienced investors in renewable electricity in Australia.
When Cannon-Brookes first invested in the project he described it as “batshit insane” but also that the “engineering all checks out”.

Sun Cable is also supported by Australia’s governments. The NT government passed laws last year to facilitate its development. The federal government gave it “major project” status. And Infrastructure Australia called the project “investment ready” and placed it on its National Infrastructure Priority List.
Media commentary since Sun Cable’s announcement has drawn attention to the differences of view of its two most prominent shareholders, particularly about their differing level of support for Sun Cable’s management.
 
But the exact nature of their disagreement is unclear, and both men have said they remain interested in the project.
Commentators have suggested the apparent disagreement is a reflection on the commercial and technical viability of the project itself. Matthew Warren, former chief executive of the Australian Energy Council, went so far as to describe Sun Cable as “a quiet running joke inside the electricity industry” and that it: reflected the ignorance, egos and quest for notoriety of its proponents rather than the needs of its prospective customers.
But Federal Energy and Climate Minister Chris Bowen, commenting on conversations with Sun Cable’s management, said he was assured the project would proceed. He said the latest developments reflected only a change in corporate structure and approach.
Sun Cable is obviously a very ambitious project. Yet much too little information is publicly available to pronounce, with any certainty, on its commercial and technical viability.
While the project will certainly break new ground, it is not totally in its own league. The similar Xlinks project was proposed overseas in 2021 and is now advancing quickly. This project would connect Morocco and England with similar capacity renewable generation and storage, and has a comparably long cable to Sun Cable’s.
And at the end of last year, the European Commission committed funding to a high-voltage direct current link between Tunisia in North Africa and Sicily, Italy. It would export 600 MW of (mainly) solar electricity produced in Tunisia.
Although a much less ambitious project than either Xlinks or Sun Cable, it is founded on the same vision of long distance inter-continental transmission of renewable electricity. And it is almost certain to proceed.
Just like fossil fuel resources, the world’s renewable resources are unevenly distributed. There are powerful incentives now, on economic and sustainability grounds, to find ways to reliably and cost effectively move renewable electricity from where those resources are abundant to where they are scarce.

Inevitably, the latest Sun Cable developments draw attention to the questions of how best to exploit Australia’s endowment of land, sun and wind and how to capitalise on our track record as a reliable supplier with credible government and trusted courts.
For example, instead of trying to export electricity, should we focus on exporting renewably produced hydrogen or ammonia for fuel and fertilisers? Or, should we focus on using renewables to process and refine mineral resources before shipping higher-valued products (such as steel, alumina, aluminium and silicone metal) to distant shores?
These questions have attracted considerable interest from policy makers, investors and researchers – in particular, in books from economist Ross Garnaut (Superpower and The Superpower Transformation) and in former Australian chief scientist Alan Finkel’s forthcoming book Powering Up.
Both authors canvass many possibilities and neither categorically rule out direct renewable electricity export. They also suggest ore processing using renewable electricity is likely to offer great immediate value.
As best I can see, the latest Sun Cable developments provide no new publicly available information to confidently provide new insights into these issues.
The outpouring of “I-told-you-so” commentary following Sun Cable’s voluntary administration is to be expected. But perhaps the main import of Sun Cable’s developments is to draw attention to Australia’s good fortune in attracting ambitious and enterprising developers, supported by rich Australians who have been successful swimming against the tide.
Rather than dipping their hands into the public’s pocket to fund the discovery of the best way to exploit Australia’s renewable resources, these enterprising people are risking their own money and reputations in a discovery process likely to benefit us all.
There is no need for a crisis of confidence or a bout of hand wringing about the viability of Australia’s renewable energy export prospects.
Disagreements arise between investors all the time. Administrative and legal processes should provide ways for these to be resolved quickly and amicably, as we should expect here. Viva the discovery process.

Energy transition non-profit Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) will host the initiative, which the companies said will set standrads and also aim to shape policy, regulations, and the market rules required to promote the use of VPPs.
VPPs essentially aggregate the latent potential of decentralised energy resources like household solar and battery installations and electric vehicles (EVs) to support the grid. These devices can be flexibly charged, discharged, or managed to meet grid needs. In this way, VPPs can provide many of the same services as a traditional power plant.
The technology is now firmly established in Australia and RMI Chief Executive Officer Jon Creyts said VPPs are positioned for “explosive growth” in the U.S., where the 2021 Inflation Reduction Act has created or increased tax incentives for solar panels, EVs and other devices whose output and consumption can be coordinated to smooth grid load.
RMI estimates that by the end of the decade VPPs could reduce U.S. peak demand by 60 GW, and by more than 200 GW by 2050.
“Our analysis shows that VPPs can reduce peak power demand and improve grid resilience in a world of increasingly extreme climate events,” Creyts said. “A growing VPP market also means revenue opportunities for hardware, software, and energy-service companies in the buildings and automotive industries. For large energy users, VPPs can significantly reduce energy spend while providing new revenue streams.”

SwitchDin founder and Chief Executive Andrew Mears said the Newcastle-based company, an early innovator in the DER space, is determined to take advantage of the market growth in the U.S. and will look to share knowledge and experience from Australia where VPPs have emerged as an important part of the new energy mix.
Mears, who has previously suggested Australia is three to four years ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to VPPs, said SwitchDin is now looking for partnerships to take its technology to American shores.
“The acceleration of clean energy and the electrification of transport and heating will lead to a more distributed electricity system capable of greater consumer participation and new prosumer-focused energy service models,” he said. “We are looking forward to sharing lessons from Australia and delivering our Stormcloud to US customers to help in this global challenge.”
RMI said the VP3 initiative will work to build a future where businesses, households, and communities are empowered through VPPs which can help to ensure cost-effective energy, emissions reductions, and a more resilient electric grid.
Mark Dyson, RMI managing director for carbon-free electricity, said VP3 will look to research, catalogue, and communicate VPP benefits; develop industry-wide best practices and standards; and inform and shape policy development.
“The next 12 to 24 months are critical for policy and program development to seize the potential offered by virtual power plants,” he said.
“Policy change, customer and stakeholder education, and unilateral action by individual businesses or organisations all take time and resources. We’re excited to partner in this work with leading businesses in VPP-related sectors including electric vehicles, building controls, residential energy technologies, utility-facing software solutions, and more.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/16/risen-energy-is-taking-n-type-hjt-technology-mainstream-in-australia/,"INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 16, 2023",Risen Energy is taking n-type HJT technology mainstream in Australia,"Risen Energy Australia (REA) has made a fairly big impact on the Australian solar market, especially over the last few years. What do you see as its biggest achievements over that time? 
Archie Chen (AC): I can say that significant progress has been made in the Australian market since we began to seriously explore it in 2008. One of the achievements I would point to first and foremost is a strong brand presence by building up a large local team. From that foundation we’ve developed a solid distribution channel, and we’ve fostered key partnerships with our distributors and local retailers. 
When it comes to market share, we are regarded as one of the top panel manufacturers and have consistently been recognised as a top PV brand by the industry. And of course, there’s the Merredin Solar Farm, which has really demonstrated our abilities as a developer and operator of successful large-scale solar projects. 
Image: Risen Energy Australia
When it comes to the utility-scale and rooftop markets, where does REA see itself in five years? And what is your strategy for getting there? 
AC: We have already solidified our position as a tier 1 panel manufacturer, so our focus in the rooftop market now is to continue to grow market share. We’ll achieve this through a high performance yet affordable product range, not to mention the partnerships we build with our distributors and retailers. These partnerships will continue to mature over the next few years, especially due to our value-adding partnership program. 
In the utility sector, REA will be focusing on the project development of battery energy storage systems (BESS), hybrid projects, and other renewable opportunities. We already have 1 GW of projects in our pipeline, and this number is still growing. 
REA will not only be involved in project development but will also be actively involved in project finance, equipment supply, EPC management, operations, and divestment. We believe that by adopting this business model, we will be able to develop 3 GW and deliver 1 GW of renewable projects in five years’ time. 
Still looking ahead, what technology do you consider a game changer in the Australian PV market? 
AC: Our focus is on bringing n-type HJT technology into the mainstream. N-type panels offer greater efficiency and longevity than P-type and our ongoing investment in R&D is supporting more economic manufacturing which, in turn, is supporting more affordable price points. N-type panels will be the favoured technology in the coming years, facilitating higher performing solar solutions. 
BESS is the other major disruptor and is transforming the solar market. Continual government funding, paired with increasing private equity support, is spearheading BESS into a new era. REA is making its own headway with BESS in the form of several large-scale projects at various stages of development.  
Fundamentally, REA is an agile business; we are always exploring new technologies and opportunities. 
What role is Risen playing in the development and roll out of these technologies? 
AC: Risen is sitting at the forefront of n-type and BESS technologies. We currently hold a TÜV SÜD certification for our 700 W HJT hyper-ion series of n-type solar panels. We are the first company globally to be awarded this by TÜV SÜD, a global provider of testing, inspection and certification services. Moreover, our mass production capabilities ensure we are fully capable of meeting n-type solar demand. 
At the same time, our BESS projects across Australia have been successfully moving along the development pipeline. Our Bungama BESS project was granted funding by ARENA last year. As we move to 2023, we only expect this and other similar projects to grow, and we’re fully capable of handling that change. 
What are the top three things you want the market to know about REA? 
AC: Firstly, I want the market to know about our proven ability and financial capacity to consistently develop top performing solar farms. Partnering in this space is a priority for us, and we will continue to seek and engage new partners to bring more utility-scale solar into Australia’s energy mix. 
Secondly, the market should be aware of the quality, performance, and sustainable supply chains of Risen panels. Our panels hold industry-leading megawatt capacities and warranties, and our supply chains must adhere to our ESG policies. 
Lastly, we have a strong on-the-ground team – one of the largest local teams of any PV supplier – and we work hard to provide a superior level of support to our retailer and installer partners.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/16/queensland-group-map-pathways-for-perovskite-pv/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JANUARY 16, 2023",Queensland group map pathways for perovskite PV,"From pv magazine Global
The rapid progress made with perovskite solar cells – from the first working devices to efficiencies rivalling commercial silicon PV in little more than a decade – has been well documented, and the solar industry widely expects this technology to play a major role in its future.
The question is when. For all the talk of simple, low-cost manufacturing processes, we are yet to see perovskite solar devices produced at anything like the scale where they could claim meaningful market share. Scientists led by Australia’s University of Queensland examined the technological barriers that are still in the way of perovskite PV production, breaking it down into the needs of specific applications.
In its paper “Next-generation applications for integrated perovskite solar cells,” published in Communications Materials, the group outlines several challenges for the production of perovskite materials, including long-term stability and the use of lead. While arguments have been made that the amount of lead used in perovskites is unlikely to have major health or environmental impacts, the group here notes that the ability to tune the bandgap and control the parts of the light spectrum a cell absorbs is an important property for the development of commercial, and one that typically requires a least partial replacement of lead with tin.
“Sn-based perovskites also exhibit lower carrier lifetime, diffusion length and poorer stability,” the group explains. “Therefore, alternative strategies to design low-bandgap perovskites should be explored including the replacement of Sn with other stable metals and surface passivation techniques.”
For perovskite tandem cells in particular, new electrode materials with higher conductivity need to be developed, and here the group recommends increased efforts in investigation of carbon materials to fulfil this role.
The paper also outlines opportunities that perovskites could open up in terms of integration with other applications – from more conventional ideas such as building-integrated PV, to outlandish and less explored ideas like solar modules with integrated storage, devices to power space exploration and very high efficiency devices with three or more cells stacked on top of each other.
In the building-integrated space, perovskite devices bring the potential for much lower weight and more flexibility in terms of shape, along with semitransparency and other desirable properties. But these need to developed while also overcoming the challenges the technology faces in every case.
“There is no doubt that PSCs have appealing characteristics for the development of BIPVs,” said the group. “However, the key challenge lies in realising all of the following features in a single system: high PCE, excellent device stability and rapid response characteristics.”
