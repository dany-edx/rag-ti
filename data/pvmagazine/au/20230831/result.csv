RayGen said the plant, located about 20 minutes south of Mildura, has been “exporting electricity day and night and has been charging our storage from our solar and from the grid.”
“All component systems have demonstrated performance against specification,” the company said, noting an offtake agreement with energy generating and retailing giant AGL for the entirety of the plant’s production will soon come into effect.
The Carwarp plant uses a combination of RayGen’s solar and hydro technology to produce 24-hour renewable electricity. The system features a field of smart, rotational mirrors that concentrate sunlight onto a tower-mounted receiver containing an array of PV modules. That solar energy is combined with the energy stored across two water reservoirs to create a ‘hot and cold’ solar hydro solution.
Melbourne-based RayGen said the Carwarp plant will add 4 MW of renewable power and 17 hours of storage capacity to the West Murray grid. The plant is expected to provide enough renewable electricity to power approximately 1,700 average Victorian homes.
RayGen Chief Executive Officer Richard Payne said the successful commissioning of the Carwarp plant is a significant milestone in the commercialisation of the company’s energy generation and storage technologies.
“This project has validated the performance of our modular system at utility scale,” he said. “In just four years, we have progressed from a concept for dispatchable renewable energy to a utility-scale reality.”

Payne said the project has provided valuable, real-world ‘lessons learned’ which have been incorporated into the development of much larger projects.
“Successfully delivering this project is simply an outstanding result and provides a launching pad to deploy much larger projects,” he said.
Markus Brokhof, chief operating officer at AGL which is developing a similar solar-plus-thermal storage plant with RayGen at the former coal-fired Liddell power station site in New South Wales, said the technology provides a possible solution to the challenge of long-duration energy storage particularly given its potential to be scaled.
“This innovative approach to long-duration energy storage using concentrated PV and thermal hydro storage greatly improves the efficiency and economics of solar plus storage, providing a potential solution for long duration energy storage,” he said, adding “the technology has the potential to be deployed at greater scale.”
The official launch of the Carwarp plant coincided with an announcement from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) confirming that it will provide an additional $10 million (USD 6.5 million) in grant funding to accelerate the development of RayGen’s technology.
Payne said the new funding agreement will allow RayGen to “industrialise our supply chain, progress engineering for larger projects, and accelerate down the cost-curve.”
“Our pipeline is part of the energy transition of this country,” he said. “RayGen’s new approach complements other established solutions and offers the lowest cost pathway to a zero-carbon grid.”
As well as working with AGL to develop a plant at Liddell, RayGen is also working with Dutch company Photon Energy on a major project in South Australia. The proposed Yadnarie project would have a total solar generation capacity of 200 MWdc coupled with 24 hours of energy storage capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/31/snowy-hydro-plans-contract-reset-amid-12-billion-cost-blowout/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 31, 2023",Snowy Hydro plans contract reset amid $12 billion cost blowout,"Federal government-owned utility Snowy Hydro has confirmed that the total cost of the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro storage project has escalated to six times the amount originally budgeted for, with full commercial operation not expected to commence until December 2028.
The expansion of the existing 4.1 GW Snowy pumped hydro scheme, originally forecast to provide 2 GW of on-demand generation and 350 GWh of long-duration energy storage to the National Electricity Market (NEM), was initially due to be operational by 2021 and was expected to cost about $2 billion.
Earlier this year that had blown out to $5.9 billion and a 2029 deadline and a new internal review shows that the costs have continued to escalate while the target date for commercial operation of all units is now December 2028.
The review attributes the cost blowout and delays to factors including higher wages, inflation, and price increases and supply chain disruptions triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The report also highlights “design immaturity at final investment decision” and “site conditions and geology” as causes of the cost escalations and construction delays.
Snowy Hydro Chief Executive Officer Dennis Barnes said the utility is already working on a project reset with the principal contractor for the project, Future Generation Joint Venture (FGJV), overseen by Italy’s Webuild.
Barnes said the terms of the contract with FGJV are being finalised to move to an incentivised target cost contract model, which will mean that if contractors deliver on time and to budget they will benefit financially, while if the opposite happens they will suffer financially.
“Moving to an incentivised target model with FGJV will result in closer collaboration, stronger oversight and alignment of interests between Snowy Hydro and FGJV,” he said.
Barnes said the project reset will allow the commercially sustainable and successful delivery of the project.
“Snowy 2.0 is being engineered to deliver clean and reliable storage and electricity generation for Australians for the next 150 years,” he said.
“It is a truly transformative national project that is generating jobs and significant investment in regional areas.”
“It will deliver benefits immediately following its completion and will continue to do so for many future generations of Australians.”
Snowy Hydro said through the reset process, it has worked with FGJV and hydro technology contractor Voith Hydro to increase the capacity of the project by 10% with Snowy 2.0 to now deliver dispatchable generation capacity of 2,2 GW.
Despite the challenges outlined, Snowy Hydro said construction of the Snowy 2.0 project is now approximately 40% complete and solid progress continues to be made.
First power is expected to be delivered in the second half of 2027 with commercial operation of all units expected in December 2028.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/31/aemo-backs-248-gw-pipeline-to-counter-reliability-challenges/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 31, 2023",AEMO backs 248 GW pipeline to counter reliability challenges,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) says “imminent and urgent investment” is required to improve the reliability of the National Electricity Market (NEM) with a new report warning of potential supply shortfalls in the national power grid over the next decade.
The latest Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) report – which projects the market demand and supply over the coming decade for the eastern mainland states and Tasmania – flags supply concerns, heightened risks from coal outages and the need to incentivise continued supply in the NEM.
AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said the report “highlights the pace of Australia’s energy transition and the urgency needed to deliver new investment to ensure reliable, affordable and cleaner energy for consumers.”
“Over the 10-year outlook, we continue to forecast reliability gaps, which are mostly due to the expectation that 62% of today’s coal fleet will retire by 2033,” he said.
“To ensure Australian consumers continue to have access to reliable electricity supplies, it’s critical that planned investments in transmission, generation and storage projects are urgently delivered.”

The ESOO forecasts that electricity consumption and peak demand will grow in the next decade due to population growth and the electrification across all sectors of the economy, including transport and residential sectors, and the electrification of traditional gas loads.
Considering only existing, committed and anticipated projects as per the ESOO’s ‘central scenario’, reliability risks are forecast to exceed the “relevant reliability standard” in Victoria from this summer, in South Australia this summer and then again from 2028-29, in New South Wales from 2025-26, and Queensland from 2029-30.
The reliability gaps are larger than were forecast in the February ESOO update but AEMO said government programs and a pipeline of proposed generation and storage projects – totaling 173 GW of renewable energy generation and 74 GW of storage – have the potential to address the identified risks.

“While our central scenario shows increased reliability risk, it does not reflect the reliability potential from the 248 GW pipeline of proposed generation and storage projects, actionable transmission projects and government energy programs underway,” Westerman said.
“Transmission projects identified in the Integrated System Plan, federal and state government initiatives, including mechanisms delivering firming capacity such as the Commonwealth’s Capacity Investment Scheme, can address many of the identified risks over most of the 10-year horizon, if delivered to schedule.”
Westerman said there is also the opportunity for consumers’ rooftop solar, batteries and electric vehicles to actively participate in the power system, which would further reduce reliability risks.
More than 2.7 million homes in the NEM already have solar systems installed, supplying about 29% of the residential sector’s overall underlying consumption in 2022-23. By 2032-33, this is expected to increase to 4.8 million homes, meeting approximately half of the residential sector’s underlying consumption requirements. The ESOO shows that residential PV generation is expected to continue to grow into the 2050s, meeting 60% of underlying demand in 2052-53.
“These forecasts highlight the high value of solutions in which resources owned by consumers, such as residential electricity generation and storage devices, and increased demand flexibility, can help meet power system needs,” AEMO said. “With a high level of consumer participation and coordination of consumer energy assets and demand to help meet power system needs, the need for utility-scale solutions would be much lower.”
Australian Energy Council (AEC) Chief Executive Officer Sarah McNamara said she expects the new report will act as a spur to the private sector to invest in new generation.
“It also reinforces the need for careful coordination and prioritisation of the necessary generation, firming capacity and transmission,” she said, noting that the electricity industry is well positioned to meet the challenges outlined in the report.
“There is still time to meet these challenges and realise these opportunities if the market is permitted to provide the price signals necessary to bring forward investment,” she said.
“Even if new investment were not forthcoming, it’s worth noting that most of the near-term reliability shortfalls relate only to the ‘interim’ reliability standard, which is a very conservative measure, and not the traditional reliability standard.”

Ten scientists have projected the innovation pathways for the major PV cell technologies over the next five years, in an open-access article in Cell.
Although installed PV capacity worldwide exceeds 1 terawatt (1,000 GW), solar’s contribution to worldwide electricity generation remains small, the researchers said, at 5% to 6%. Given an “urgent need” to deploy PV at multi-terawatt scale over the next two decades to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, “PV device innovation takes on new urgency and impact.”
Continued research that leads to “even relatively small advances” in efficiency, reliability and manufacturing efficiency “will have major future impacts at multi-TW scale,” the researchers said, noting these factors combine to make “the increasingly compelling value proposition” for PV power generation.
While crystalline silicon PV had a 95% market share in 2022, in a “terawatt-scale future” with “PV everywhere,” multiple technologies may be complementary, or combined, they said.
The silicon PV technology known as TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivating contact), with a market share of 23%, will “overcome” production of PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) PV by 2025 and “is likely to become the technology of choice for new-cell manufacturing in the US,” the article predicts.
Crystalline silicon PV cells are approaching the single-junction theoretical maximum efficiency of 29.4%, they said.
Research is still needed, they note, to develop high-temperature, selective area passivating contacts on both sides of the PV cell (“advanced TOPCon”), to improve the transparency and conductivity of heterojunction technology (HJT) contacts (“advanced HJT”), and to combine the latest HJT or TOPCon technologies with an interdigitated back contact (IBC) structure, “which could reach an ultimate practical efficiency of 28% possibly as soon as 2025.”
Yet as the theoretical limit is approached, “several new modes of degradation, called carrier-induced degradation, and metastable defects are unveiled,” the researchers said.
The industry “is working to reduce or eliminate” the use of scarce materials such as silver for the formation of grid lines and indium used in transparent conductive oxides, the authors say. Several PV companies and research laboratories have announced HJT PV cell design with reduced indium consumption “or even indium-free” HJT cells.

Eurac Research scientists have analysed data from 21 fuel cell electric buses (FCEB) and battery electric buses (BEB) in Italy, comparing efficiency, consumption, temperature sensitivity, distances, and cost. The team has found that the Solaris Urbino 12 FCEB model covered the maximum distance (300 km), followed by Solaris Urbino 12 Electric BEB (279 km), Mercedes O530 Citaro FCEB (271 km), and Solaris Urbino 18 Electric BEB (215 km). Hydrogen buses’ tank-to-wheel (TTW) efficiency is lower than battery electric buses, indicating higher consumption variation for BEBs.
DNV has released service specification DNV-SE-0654, outlining procedures to verify low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia claims. Oslo-based DNV’s new service helps hydrogen producers document compliance, ensuring transparency and credibility in claims, offering validation based on specific attributes.
Worley has collaborated with Princeton University to devise a 10-point action plan for Europe’s renewable hydrogen sector. Broad adoption of the plan could reduce delivery times by 40% while maintaining disciplined investment. The plan advocates for increased global electrolyser manufacturing capacity, offshore wind capacity additions, and desalination capacity to achieve the EU’s 10 MTPA renewable hydrogen production goal by 2030.
The Malaysian government has outlined plans for three low-carbon hydrogen hubs in Sarawak State by 2027, featuring a green hydrogen production plant in Kuching by 2025 and two Bintulu plants by 2027 for export. Senior Electrical Engineer Dinesh Manoharan stated that Malaysia’s aim to phase out gray hydrogen by 2050, producing up to 2.5 Mtpa of green hydrogen from renewables, targeting hydrogen adoption in 5% of heavy vehicles by 2050.
Enoah said it has placed an order for 101 AEM Electrolysers EL 4.0 from Enapter, scheduled for delivery between the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. The purchases is in line with the company’s expertise in producing fuel cells and electrolysis systems for Power-to-Power applications.
