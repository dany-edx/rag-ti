The distributed network service provider said the SAPS, featuring a combination of solar, batteries and a back-up generator, offer an independent, reliable and renewable power supply solution to energy users in remote locations without the need to be connected to the network.
AusNet’s commercial arm, Mondo, said the trial units include ground-mounted solar panels, a battery energy storage system, and a back-up diesel generator. The self-sufficient units also include control hardware that allows electricity use to be tracked.
“We now have 17 systems successfully installed and operational across Victoria and look forward to seeing more homes and businesses benefiting from reliable and renewable energy,” Mondo said.
The trial has prioritised residents in remote areas with a single-wire network connection. The targeted areas also are typically in bushfire and extreme-weather-prone zones where the poles and lines are often affected, leading to outages.
Mondo, which will be responsible for all the operation and maintenance of each stand-alone power system, said the SAPS aim to use solar energy as the primary source of electricity and have been designed with a large amount of battery storage to minimise generator usage and improve users’ energy resilience.
With the installation and commissioning of the first 17 SAPS now complete, Mondo and AusNet will monitor and evaluate the performance of the systems as part of the open-ended trial.
While the key benefit of SAPS is an improvement in resilience and reliability of supply for customers in hard-to-reach areas, AusNet said it expects all customers could enjoy cost savings as a result of it not having to repair and maintain remote parts of the distribution network.
Mondo said the SAPS are already providing benefits to the customers, including the increased uptake of renewables and increased resilience during severe weather events.
“As the trial continues, we are excited to observe and learn from each system and we look forward to leveraging our knowledge to implement more stand-alone power systems across Australia,” the company said.
While the AusNet trial is a first for Victoria, the technology has been widely deployed in Western Australia.
Previous regulations made it extremely difficult to deploy SAPS in the National Electricity Market (NEM) but those regulations have now been amended, paving the way for broader roll out of the technology in the NEM jurisdictions of Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.

The Ulinda Park battery energy storage system is being developed adjacent to the Western Downs Substation at Hopeland near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region.
Melbourne-based Akaysha said the 150 MW battery, which will feature two hours of energy storage capacity, will support the rapid expansion of solar and wind projects leveraging existing transmission infrastructure in the region.
Akaysha said it has already received development approval from the Western Down Council for the project and is currently progressing grid connection as it continues to work towards a final investment decision. The company expects the Ulinda Park battery will commence operations in 2025.
While complete details of the revenue swap agreement struck with Re2 have not been released, Akaysha said the “groundbreaking battery storage financial product” allows “rapid investment/capital deployment and a great risk profile of contracted and unhedged revenue.”
“The revenue swap product that we have developed with Re2 is exactly the sort of innovative offtake product that we need in the market right now to help accelerate the build-out of large-scale battery projects like Ulinda Park,” Akaysha Chief Executive and Managing Director Nick Carter said.
“The 10-year revenue swap provides the right balance of contracted and unhedged revenue, while still allowing us to operate the project and bid into the energy and FCAS markets in the NEM.”
Re2 Chief Executive Officer Richard Oduntan said risk management solutions driven by the private sector will be essential to the build out of energy storage systems at a scale necessary to support the continued growth of variable renewable energy in Australia.
“We are … excited to have had the opportunity to collaborate with Akaysha and BlackRock on this risk transfer transaction,” Oduntan said. “And we look forward to continuing to play a catalysing role in the energy transition.”
The Ulinda Park battery project is one of a portfolio of large-scale battery energy storage projects Akaysha, which was acquired by BlackRock in 2022, is progressing in Queensland, New South Wales (NSW), South Australia and Tasmania.
Akaysha is building the 850 MW/1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery near Doyalson on the NSW Central Coast and has secured development approval for the Orana big battery near Wellington in the state’s central-west which could have between 400 MW to 1,600 MW of capacity and 1,600 MWh of storage.
Other projects in its portfolio include the 200 MW/800 MWh Elaine big battery in Victoria, the Palmerston battery energy storage system in Tasmania, and the 200 MW/800 MWh Mobilong big battery in South Australia.
The company has also announced plans to develop a 300 MW/1,200 MWh battery and 200 MWp solar farm near Brinkworth in South Australia’s mid-north region.
Akaysha said its battery projects will involve a mix of contracted and merchant capacity, involving different revenue streams including energy arbitrage as well as grid services as markets develop for products such as inertia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/10/australian-technology-provides-solar-sharing-first-for-nz/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 10, 2023",Australian technology provides solar sharing first for NZ,"Melbourne-based Allume Energy has installed its SolShare product at a residential complex in Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island with the behind-the-meter solar distribution technology to allow all 20 households to share the benefits of a single rooftop PV system.
The complex, built by government housing agency Kāinga Ora, has been fitted with a 34.425 kWp rooftop PV system featuring 85 REC Alpha Pure solar panels. The system also includes two Fronius inverters and two Allume Solshare units which allow for the consumption and metering of rooftop solar among multiple building tenants.
NZ Housing Minister Megan Woods said the SolShare platform would enable the sharing of rooftop solar amongst multiple dwellings within the same complex for the first time in the country with the installation to provide electricity to all 20 apartments and to the common areas in the building.
To achieve this the SolShare units sit behind the meter, constantly monitoring the energy demands of all energy consumers connected to its system, and proportionally allocates generated energy at any given time.
Woods said the technology is expected to save residents about 50% on their power bills.
“Estimates show that this system will save tenants around $350-$400 each year on their power bill,” she said.
“An advantage of the technology is that it doesn’t restrict the customers’ choice of electricity retailer, and there’s no need to sign up for additional billing services or platforms, so nothing changes for customers other than their power bill.”
The Christchurch project is the latest international installation for Allume which has already had success in the United States and United Kingdom.
For Kāinga Ora’s, this project is part of its broader renewable energy program. The agency is also exploring the benefits of installing solar on stand-alone homes and other apartment complexes across the country.
Key objectives for the trials, funded until mid-2024 through the NZ government’s Māori and Public Housing Renewable Energy Fund, include reducing energy costs and improving knowledge on the costs, benefits, barriers and design options for distributed energy solutions on public housing.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/10/interview-rec-group-ceo-highlights-power-density-sustainability-in-time-of-oversupply/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"JULY 10, 2023","Interview: REC Group CEO highlights power density, sustainability in time of oversupply","Jan Enno Bicker has served as the CEO of REC Group for almost three years and they’ve been anything but boring. In that time, the company has transitioned its Singaporean production lines almost entirely to heterojunction technology and the company has been sold to India’s Reliance New Energy Solar. With the market now entering a period of PV cell and module oversupply, Bicker says he is confident of the REC value proposition.
pv magazine: The REC Alpha Pure-R series is the new module on display here in Munich and we’re getting a first sneak-peak of the Alphas Pure-RX. Both take the split junction box and module concept, pioneered by REC in 2015 with the TwinPeak, to its obvious conclusion; with the module divided in four. What do you believe sets it apart?
Jan Bicker: First of all, it is a heterojunction (HJT) module. We are a very strong believer in HJT technology. We are absolutely convinced this is the future technology and the true innovation in cell technology. We see TOPCon as a simple successor of mono PERC. HJT is for us the real pioneering technology.
You have higher potential advantages on efficiency – TOPCon is going to max out much earlier that HJT will – and you have less manufacturing process steps at lower temperature, around half of the steps. You are more future proofed for tandem technology, because you have perfect passivation.
And we also believe there is an advantage on wafer thickness. We believe we can go much, much thinner because we use low temperature processes – there is no soldering.
The new module is an extension to our Alpha HJT line which we mastered since 2019. It is a beautiful product, very high power, with up to 470 W [for the Alpha Pure-RX]. And we have received a lot of interest. For a residential module, the watt-class, the low degradation, and the very low temperature coefficient really counts.
 pv magazine: What are some of the cell efficiencies that you are achieving on your production lines?
JB: We are getting cell efficiencies of around 25%. We have a clear roadmap to go higher than that and will go higher in the next few months.
pv magazine: What I was referring to with the TwinPeak was when REC pioneered the split junction box, and now there are four!
JB: You have to take into account the size of the wafer, the form factor. It is a G12 wafer that we are using. We are one of the very few manufacturers doing residential on G12 wafers – they are large and you need to account for the form factor so that it matches the residential format.
pv magazine: So, you have changed the orientation [from horizontal to vertical] of the wafer as well…
JB: That is how we make it work.
pv magazine: I think when the split junction box came out in 2015, REC was the only company doing it. Then, four or five years later everyone was doing it. Do you expect that to be the case with this module?
JB: We strongly believe that G12 is the future and the M10 is going to be an “in-between step.” Other manufacturers will face similar form-factor challenges than we did. We think that we’ve found a good solution. Whether other people will copy it, I’m not sure. But they have done it many times in the past.
pv magazine: Turning to the market dynamics, it is a challenging dynamic in 2023 compared to 2022, is that right?
JB: This year the big change is that TOPCon is entering the market, especially here in Europe. Along with that, prices are declining. We have basically moved from an undersupplied market to an oversupplied market. This makes the business environment more difficult.
But as we have done in the past, with a leading technology and by producing a very clean product, it has always worked well for us in the past – so we are optimistic.
pv magazine: Do you feel somewhat insulated because you are in the rooftop segment?
We are a relatively small player. In our space, you go where your advantage is. In our case that is power density. This means that the more restrictive the space, the more value our high-power density, high efficiency products deliver. We are going where our products have the highest added value for the consumer.
pv magazine: You mention a “very clean” product, and the Alpha Pure and Pure-R are lead free. How much more demand are you seeing from buyers for sustainable modules?
JB: A lot of people who are behind solar investments, big pension funds and so on, are making ESG a big and very, very important topic.
The number of ESG requests from customers and potential customers doubled  in a year. And the related volume which is behind these requests grew by a factor of eight. So, you see that these subjects are becoming much more important.
It is coming from distributors, EPCs, project companies, these are the companies we are directly dealing with. But since the distributors are asking about the ESG reporting, the push is also coming from the market – otherwise there would be no reason for them to come to us.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/10/new-app-to-calculate-payback-periods-of-rooftop-pv-systems/,"FINANCE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 10, 2023",New app to calculate payback periods of rooftop PV systems,"Kai Schuhmacher spent years traveling around Germany as a consultant for PV system owners. He said the question that all customers immediately ask is: “When will my photovoltaic system pay off?” The answer depends on many individual factors, with the amortization period generally spanning from eight to 16 years.
Schumacher said many consultants currently still carry out these calculations in Excel spreadsheets that they create themselves, which reportedly is the best way to give their customers the most precise answer possible.
“The online tools that have been available on various websites for years have not really convinced me,” he said.
Schumacher always wanted a uniform and, at the same time, simple calculation method that can be used directly at the customer’s site. He now claims to have developed such a tool himself and called it Amortisator. It is an app that can be bought initially in the Apple Store, and soon in the Google Play Store, and is available in German, English, Spanish, and French.
He said the app is aimed primarily at customer advisors and costs €9.99 ($16.40) per month. It can be cancelled on a monthly basis.
The app offers advisors and customers a quick amortization calculation, which can also be sent to non-users of the app by email. For the calculation, it utilises inputs such as system performance and size, as well as details on rooftops and financing requirements.
Schuhmacher also wants to use the app to give potential PV customers the opportunity to find a customer advisor in their area. In this regard, there is an integrated chat that customers can use to contact them.
Furthermore, the app reportedly helps customers evaluate previous consulting services. All of this is free of charge for those who are potentially interested in photovoltaics, Schumacher said.
