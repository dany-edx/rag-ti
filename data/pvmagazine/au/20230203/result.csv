The completion of the Northam deal will allow IGE to leverage the output of the solar farm to power the company’s green hydrogen MEG HP1 project which is to be developed at the solar farm site, about 100 kilometres east of Perth in Western Australia’s (WA) Wheatbelt region.
Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce up to 4 tonnes of green hydrogen daily. IGE said the scope is there to expand the solar facility to 18 MW, potentially doubling the site’s production capacity to 8 tonnes of green hydrogen daily.
IGE is targeting the domestic heavy transport industry for offtake from the project with the first binding supply agreement signed earlier this week with a WA waste to energy refuge collection company.
The company said it has now commenced a $3 million capital raise to progress the MEG HP1 project. It has reportedly also applied for $5 million in funds from the WA Investment Attraction Fund.
IGE said the capital raising will allow it to progress the Northam project to final investment decision.
IGE founder and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Gauld said the solar farm would immediately generate returns through an existing power purchase agreement (PPA), and he expected more green hydrogen offtake agreements.
“With the security of a PPA in place, our clear path to initial production in 2024 will demonstrate the plant and help to initiate a market for green hydrogen in the commercial mobility sector in Western Australia,” he said. “We have our first contracted customer, and six MOUs from other transport companies in Western Australia.”

The MEG HP1 is the most advanced of IGE’s projects with the company also progressing the Arrowsmith Hydrogen Project, which it says will produce up to 25 tonnes of green hydrogen daily.
IGE first announced plans for the Arrowsmith Hydrogen Project in 2020. To be developed near the town of Dongara, about 320km north of Perth, the first stage of the project woild incorporate 65 MW of solar and 90 MW of wind to produce 25 tonnes of green hydrogen a day.

Solcast uses global weather satellite imagery, machine learning, and historical and live data on solar irradiance to produce more than 600 million new forecasts every hour while providing real-time access via an application programming interface (API). Its forecasting system and data set is used by solar power producers, utilities and grid operators to determine their solar resource availability at any given time.
Solcast founder and Chief Executive Officer James Luffman said DNV’s acquisition of the company, for an unspecified sum, will allow it to improve its forecasting models and unlock additional value for its customers.
“DNV is investing in Solcast and providing expertise and other resources,” he said. “The result is a huge boost to our effectiveness and impact.”
“This partnership will bring the world’s leading solar irradiance and forecasting API to an even larger global audience, whilst maintaining the same level of service that our customers expect.”
Remi Eriksen, DNV group president and chief executive officer said digital products like those provided by Solcast are key to unlocking the potential of solar.
“Solar forecasting will enable the renewable energy market to grow and accelerate the global transformation to a clean energy future,” he said.

DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook (ETO) forecasts that by 2050 global electricity production will more than double and 30% of all electricity will be provided by solar.
“Our ETO forecasts solar PV and wind are already the cheapest forms of electricity in most locations and by 2050 they will grow 20-fold and 10-fold,” Eriksen said. “Digitalisation is an important enabler of the energy industry and a key component to scaling solar to the levels needed for a greener energy future.”
The acquisition will take effect immediately although Solcast, which already has offices in Sydney, Asia, Europe and the Americas, will continue to operate under its current name. The company’s existing management and staff will remain in Australia and there are no immediate changes planned for customers and partners.

The batteries, to be supplied by Queensland-based clean tech startup EcoJoule Energy and Norwegian manufacturer Pixii, will include 30 power pole-mounted and five ground-level systems.
The batteries will soak up the equivalent solar from approximately 600 rooftop PV systems during the day and will deploy that clean electricity during peak periods. It is expected the batteries will have a combined three to four hours of storage capacity.
The state government said the rollout will commence in the Ipswich suburbs of Goodna, Booval and Redbank Plains, with the first of the neighbourhood batteries to be installed in “coming weeks”.
Energex will install, own and maintain the batteries, while they will be operated by Origin in the wholesale energy market.
Origin’s Executive General Manager of Future Energy, Anthony Lucas, said the retailer’s role in the project will be to explore different ways to create and share the benefits of neighbourhood batteries with customers.
“The development of smart, connected, low-carbon solutions like neighbourhood batteries are central to Origin’s ambition to lead the energy transition through cleaner energy and customer solutions,” he said.

The neighbourhood batteries initiative is part of the Queensland government’s Energy and Jobs Plan, which includes $500 million to invest in more large-scale and community batteries.
“This will support deployment of network batteries of different scales to provide additional energy storage to store excess rooftop solar and improve network resilience,” Deputy Premier Steven Miles said.
“This will support deployment of network batteries of different scales to provide additional energy storage to store excess rooftop solar and improve network resilience.”
The government said the neighbourhood batteries will complement the large-scale network-connected community batteries being rolled out across the network in regional Queensland as part of a community battery trial.
The state government has plans to install at least five large-scale, network-connected batteries with a combined capacity of 40 MWh. The batteries are to be installed at substations in Townsville, Yeppoon, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Toowoomba.

Brady pleaded guilty in Moorabbin Justice Centre to five offences of dishonesty under the Commonwealth Criminal Code on Feb. 1, 2023.
Brady, the director of Shine Tech Solar Pty Ltd., a then Clean Energy Council (CEC) accredited solar installer, claimed the installations took place between October 2020 and April 2021.
In a statement, the CER said its investigation found that Brady submitted 11 false Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs), alongside certificates of electrical safety. These forms and their nonexistent solar systems, created 1,390 STCs for which a renewable energy certificate agent paid Brady $50,000.
According to CER, the Magistrate stated the sentencing should “strongly emphasise general deterrence.” Brady was given a two-year Community Correction Order which requires him to complete 300 hours of unpaid community service. Brady was also made to compensate the renewable certificate agent to the tune of $48,528.
“Installers who attempt to benefit from making false statements regarding STC eligibility – whether they haven’t been on site for the installation, or the installation simply doesn’t exist – will get caught,” said Thomas Stoddart, acting general manager of the CER’s Compliance Branch.
“The CER expects information provided to it to be true and correct,” continued Stoddart, “and will take enforcement action where it is warranted under our Compliance Education and Enforcement Policy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/03/solar-may-cover-the-worlds-electricity-demand-with-0-3-of-its-land-area/,"RESEARCH,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"FEBRUARY 3, 2023",Solar may cover the world’s electricity demand with 0.3% of its land area,"From pv magazine Global
Solar energy could theoretically cover the world’s electricity demand by just 0.3% of its land area. This is one of the main conclusions of new research by a group of academic institutions, led by Aarhus University in Denmark. The researchers claim that raw materials and land availability will not present real barriers to PV in its race to dominate the global energy landscape.
The scientists claim that, for an average annual generation for solar of 1,370 kWh/kW, 38 million hectares would be needed. They noted that the world has a total area of 13,003 million hectares.
“Hence, our current electricity consumption could be supplied by solar PV covering 0.3% of the available land,” researcher Marta Victoria told pv magazine.
The researchers said conventional assumptions about global PV deployment for the years to come are generally based on land cover and cost projections that chiefly consider classic, densely packed, utility-scale power plants. They claim such projections ignore the potential of vertical PV, floating installations, agrivoltaics, and building-integrated arrays, as well as other innovative PV system configurations.
“Nevertheless, these embryonic applications show that there is still room for innovation at the system level,” the academics said. “In summary, although available land can limit solar PV at local levels, it will not be a limitation at a larger scale, and therefore, we recommend that models include accurate and up-to-date constraints based on materials and land availability.”
The scientists described their findings in “Solar photovoltaics is ready to power a sustainable future,” which was recently published in Joule. They said the efficiency of solar cell technologies will improve significantly in the future, and that could help to address land-limitation issues in specific locations. They also claimed that raw material availability might only be an issue only for thin-film PV tech, and not for crystalline silicon cells, which currently account for 95% of the global market.
“Thanks to the increase in efficiency and the use of thinner contact fingers, the use of silver per watt has significantly reduced in the last years, and copper or aluminium could be used as a replacement if necessary,” the research group stressed. “The noncell materials in PV (glass, plastic, aluminium, concrete, and steel) are not expected to represent a limit either.”
The researchers also reported that solar maintained a learning rate of 23% since 1976 and that the cost of the PV technology dropped by 23% every time the capacity doubled.
“Given that the learning rate is based on module prices, it also includes the elimination of big parts of the margins in PV manufacturing due to strong competition between suppliers,” the scientists said, noting that the main factors for cost reduction are efficiency increases, economies of scale, and scientific work on silicon materials.
The study also presents some challenges PV should face in the next decade. These include the creation of regulatory frameworks that reduce soft costs, reducing capital expenditure, enabling the electrification of other energy sectors via proper tax schemes, and strengthening research on improving PV efficiency and reliability.
