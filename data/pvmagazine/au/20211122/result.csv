https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/22/we-must-rapidly-decarbonise-road-transport-but-hydrogens-not-the-answer/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 22, 2021",We must rapidly decarbonise road transport – but hydrogen’s not the answer,"Earlier this month the government unveiled its “future fuels” strategy to reduce emissions in the transport sector, committing $250 million for battery electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. And in September, it pledged almost $500 million towards the Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs Program.
Decarbonising transport is crucial in the fight to limit global warming to 1.5℃ this century. We estimate the sector contributes about 20% of global emissions – like burning two Olympic-size swimming pools filled with fossil fuels per minute, every minute of the year.
But as independent researchers in transport emissions and energy, we believe the focus on hydrogen in road transport is misplaced.
Hydrogen is already an important part of the global economy, including for the production of fertilisers and in oil refining. The federal government has identified hydrogen as a priority low emissions technology to develop further, with a focus on hydrogen refuelling infrastructure for major freight routes and passenger road corridors.

Almost all hydrogen today is produced using fossil fuels (natural gas and coal), and this accounts for about 2% of global emissions. Hydrogen is clean and climate friendly only if it’s produced from renewable sources of energy, such as solar, wind and hydro. This process uses electrolysis to convert water into hydrogen, and is aptly called “green hydrogen”.
For more than 20 years, proponents of hydrogen have been promising a future of clean energy. But while the pace of new green hydrogen projects is accelerating, most are still at an early stage of development. Just 14 major projects worldwide started construction in 2020, while 34 are at a study or memorandum of understanding stage.
Developing hydrogen technology is, indeed, important outside of the road transport sector, with promising options such as green steel which will reduce emissions and bring new Australian jobs.
 
Global sales data for cars and light commercial vehicles, along with statements from corporate leaders, suggest many vehicle manufacturers don’t seriously consider hydrogen a viable and lucrative transport fuel.
The Honda Clarity hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, for example, ceased production in August 2021 to “trim underperforming models from its line-up”. Some manufacturers are even lobbying for a faster transition to electric cars.

Hydrogen may play a larger role in the long-haul truck market, as its stated benefits include a long drive range and short refuelling times, which are important for this sector.
But hydrogen competes with a dynamic and fast-moving electric truck market, which shows significant and continuous annual improvements in battery energy density, and prices. What’s more, truck makers – such as Daimler, MAN, Renault, Scania and Volvo – have indicated they see an all-electric future.
The often-stated benefits of hydrogen dissipate when compared with alternative electric truck technology. This includes battery swapping, which allows for short refuelling times, and the development of e-highways (roads that automatically recharge vehicles when they drive along it).
While it’s true these systems are still being tested in, for instance, Europe and the US, they have a promising outlook. For example, in July the UK government announced £2 million (A$3.66 million) to design overhead charging cables that would power electric lorries on a motorway.
Likewise, the battery swapping network in China already dwarfs the hydrogen refuelling network, although the system is still in its infancy.
An overlooked but fundamental issue with using hydrogen in transport is its low energy efficiency. Hydrogen is not an energy source, it is an energy carrier. This means it needs to be generated, compressed or liquefied, transported and converted back into useful energy – and each step of the process incurs a substantial energy loss.
In fact, hydrogen vehicles and vehicles that run on petrol or diesel have a similarly low energy performance: just 15-30% of the available energy in the fuels is used for actual driving. Compare this to battery electric vehicles, which use 70-90% of the available energy.
In other words, the amount of renewable energy required for a green hydrogen vehicle to drive one kilometre is the same as what’s required for three electric vehicles to drive the same distance.
This is a very important issue. The more energy required for transport, the more renewable energy needs to be generated, and the higher the cost and more difficult it becomes to decarbonise the economy rapidly and at scale.

There are three other, perhaps less well known, issues with hydrogen we believe should be seriously considered.
First, the potential for significant leakage of hydrogen during production, transport and use. Hydrogen is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and any loss of hydrogen reduces the overall energy efficiency.
Second, hydrogen emissions from leakage may add to local and regional air pollution, and may even deplete the ozone layer in the stratosphere, but further research is needed in this space.
And finally, hydrogen needs clean fresh water, and lots of it. A single hydrogen fuel cell car requires about 9 litres of clean, demineralized water for every 100km driven. For a large truck, this would be over 50 litres per kilometre.
If sea water and desalination plants were used to produce the water, another energy loss would be added to the production process, penalising overall energy efficiency even further.
Decarbonising road transport needs to be rapid, deployed at scale, and requires a holistic strategy that promotes shifts in everyday travel behaviour. Betting on the future large-scale availability of hydrogen for this sector won’t see this happen fast enough. It also risks locking in fossil-fuel dependency, and its additional greenhouse gas emissions, if upscaling clean hydrogen falls short of expectations.
We need to minimise energy demand and improve energy efficiency in transport as much as possible and as fast as possible. The available evidence suggests battery electric vehicles are the only feasible technology that can achieve this in the near future.
For a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we should electrify transport where we can, and use other options like green hydrogen where we genuinely can’t, such as long-range shipping and aviation. And depending on how truck electrification efforts develop, hydrogen may still have a role in long-haul trucking, but it will use a lot of extra renewable energy.
A logical first step is to convert the current global production of fossil-fuel based hydrogen to green hydrogen. But the focus must be on rolling out electric vehicles across Australia and, indeed, the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/22/shell-teams-with-icg-to-buy-meridians-australian-assets-in-729m-deal/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND,OCEANIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 22, 2021",Shell teams with ICG to buy Meridian’s Australian assets in $729m deal,"Global oil and gas giant Shell announced on Monday it had teamed with Australian investment manager Infrastructure Capital Group (ICG) to take over energy retailer Powershop via a total acquisition of its parent company, Meridian Energy Australia (MEA), a subsidiary of New Zealand-based company Meridian Energy.
When the transaction is completed, the consortium will separate MEA, with Shell taking ownership of the energy retail business Powershop Australia, which currently provides electricity to 185,000 customers across New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, South Australia, and the south-east corner of Queensland.
ICG will become owner of MEA’s portfolio of renewable energy generation assets, including the Burrinjuck and Keepit hydro power stations in NSW, the 131 MW Mount Mercer Wind Farm in Victoria and the 70 MW Mount Millar Wind Farm in South Australia, and development projects including the 20 MW/40 MWh Hume battery energy storage system (BESS) set to be installed alongside the 200 GWh Hume Hydroelectric Power Station in regional NSW.
As part of the transaction, Shell has agreed to acquire all output from the wind and hydro assets under purchase agreements (PPAs).
Shell’s Renewables and Energy Solutions executive vice president Elisabeth Brinton said the acquisition of Powershop is in line with the company’s Powering Progress strategy and will form Shell’s residential power platform in Australia.
“Our aim is to become a leading provider of clean power-as-a-service and this acquisition broadens our customer portfolio in Australia to include households,” she said.
“Shell’s presence across the entirety of our changing energy system means we are well placed to manage complexity for customers so that we deliver simple, cleaner energy solutions.”
Shell said it aims to sell about 560 TWh a year globally by 2030 as part of its integrated power business, twice as much electricity as its businesses sell today, and expects to serve more than 15 million retail and business customers worldwide.
The purchase of Powershop builds on Shell’s portfolio in Australia. The energy giant acquired electricity retailer ERM Power in 2019 and followed that with the purchase of a 49% stake in ESCO Pacific, one of Australia’s biggest utility-scale solar developers before buying Perth-based carbon farming specialist, Select Carbon.
Australia is also the site of the oil major’s first global investment in an industrial-scale solar farm with the 120 MW Gangarri Solar Farm in Queensland’s south west powering up in September.
Shell Australia chairman Tony Nunan said the company is committed to building a cleaner energy system in Australia through a diversified and integrated portfolio that delivers a broad range of decarbonisation solutions and services to business and residential customers.
“This acquisition is another example of how we are continuing to grow our footprint in Australia to meet customers’ evolving needs through the energy transition,” he said.
“Powershop today offers innovative energy packages, and customers will benefit in the future from access to Shell’s broader suite of energy solutions linked to e-mobility and battery storage.”
ICG said the transaction, which will see it acquire MEA’s assets through its Australian Renewables Income Fund (ARIF), will complement its existing portfolio of renewable energy assets.
ICG managing director Tom Laidlaw said the deal will increase the company’s operating renewable energy generation capacity under management to 875 MW and expands the extensive development pipeline of opportunities.

“We are delighted to have partnered with Shell to acquire this high-quality portfolio of renewables assets,” he said. “Not only does this significantly scale our renewables portfolio but the addition of hydro comes at an important stage as we look to diversify with well-established, well-located assets.”
Laidlaw made special mention of the Hume BESS project, the first battery and hydro power co-location in Australia, saying it could form the foundation of other similar projects.
“The proposed Hume hydro BESS presents a unique opportunity to develop what will be a meaningful milestone for renewables in Australia and something we hope to replicate elsewhere,” he said.
ARIF’s existing assets include the 132 MW Hallett 4 and 119 MW Willogoleche wind farms in South Australia, the 55 MW Mumbida Wind Farm in Western Australia and the 107 MW Bald Hills Wind Farm in Victoria. ARIF also holds a 75% interest in the Australian Renewables Energy Trust (ARET) platform with ENGIE ANZ to develop a pipeline of over 2.5 GW of renewable projects.
Meridian said the sale remains subject to regulatory approvals, including Shell receiving foreign investment approval from the Australian government.
The deal is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/22/nsw-gives-3-billion-hydrogen-strategy-the-green-light/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 22, 2021",NSW gives $3 billion hydrogen strategy the green light,"The New South Wales (NSW) Parliament passed the Energy Legislation Amendment Bill on Friday, unlocking up to $3 billion of incentives to commercialise hydrogen supply chains and $70 million in government investment for the development of two new hydrogen hubs in the Illawarra and Hunter regions.
The state government’s Hydrogen Strategy, which establishes goals to cut the cost of renewable hydrogen production by $5.80 per kg over the next decade, will support industry development by waiving government charges on green hydrogen production, including providing a 90% exemption from network charges for producers who connect to parts of the network with spare capacity.
The policies set out in the strategy also aim to provide funding for infrastructure assessments for large-scale green hydrogen production and rolling out a hydrogen refuelling network across the state.
NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said the state is set to establish itself as an energy and economic superpower with the hydrogen industry projected to attract more than $80 billion in private investment and open up new export markets.
“We are leading the nation when it comes to emerging technologies and seizing the opportunity to attract national and global investment in this future industry to grow our economy,” he said.
“Our hydrogen energy industry will allow us to develop new export markets with our core trading partners, including Japan, creating new jobs in the Hunter and Illawarra, while also helping to secure our energy needs into the future.”
The NSW government is aiming to be producing 110,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum from 700 MW of electrolyser capacity for under $2.80 per kg by 2030.

Perrottet said achieving these stretch targets will transform NSW into Australia’s largest consumer of green hydrogen, create up to 10,000 new jobs and position the state to become a hydrogen export superpower.
“Australia has an opportunity to be an energy superpower, NSW will lead the country with this hydrogen strategy,” he said.
“Our major trading partners see hydrogen as part of their energy future, this state has the skills, infrastructure and renewable energy resources to compete globally in this new industry.”
The Federal Government has estimated that the future Australian hydrogen industry will directly support more than 16,000 jobs by 2050, plus an additional 13,000 jobs from the construction of related renewable energy infrastructure. Australian hydrogen production for export and domestic use could also generate more than $50 billion in additional GDP by 2050.
Andrew Horvath, the global chairman of hydrogen technology company Star Scientific, last month described the NSW Hydrogen Srategy as clever in its approach to drawing long-term hydrogen investment into the state.
“What [the NSW government] is doing is allowing the structure for the investment to make sense, and that’s the thing,” he said. “They’re solving all the issues that are normally barriers to investment.”
The state government expects the strategy will not only facilitate the production of green hydrogen but will also drive decarbonisation in the hard-to-abate transport, industrial and energy sectors and help the state halve its emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050.
Energy Minister Matt Kean said the strategy will also allow NSW to capitalise on the growing hydrogen export market, with green hydrogen set to become a leading fuel source in the Asia-Pacific by the end of the decade.

“Our hydrogen strategy is expected to increase the size of our economy by more than $600 million each year, while helping the state to halve emissions by 2030,” he said.
“Hydrogen will help to reduce our carbon emissions in sectors like heavy transport and industry, create jobs and open up new export markets for NSW.”
The Energy Legislation Amendment Bill also includes reforms to allow renewable energy projects to be developed in the state’s softwood pine plantation estates. Any forestry land used for renewable energy projects would need to be replaced on a two-for-one basis to ensure the harvestable forestry estate continues to expand.
“Renewable energy projects will help to create regional jobs, attract investment in the bush and diversify Forestry Corp’s revenue, at the same time as providing sustainable timber supplies for decades to come,” Kean said.
The passing of the legislation comes just days after energy infrastructure company Jemena confirmed it had begun injecting green hydrogen into the state’s gas network for the first time as part of its $15 million Western Sydney Green Hydrogen project.
Jemena said 23,500 residential customers and more than 100 commercial and industrial customers in NSW are now receiving green hydrogen as part of their gas mix following the start of production at the Western Sydney Green Hydrogen Hub.

SUN Energy chief executive officer Philip Lee said the funding will enable the company to develop more solar PV projects and cement its market position in Indonesia and bolster further growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
“The potential for solar energy in Indonesia is prolific and we are excited for our Series A partners to join us on this transformational journey,” he said.
“We will continue to alter the renewable energy landscape in the region with ground-breaking projects and technology innovations.”
The financing round follows SUN Energy’s recent acquisition of the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia’s (WA) Central Wheatbelt region from China-based project developer Risen Energy. The purchase of the solar farm, the largest in WA, marked the company’s first foray into the Australian market.
Established in 2016, SUN Energy has emerged as one of Indonesia’s most prominent solar PV developers with a strong focus on the commercial and industrial sector. The company said it has a portfolio of 40 completed projects and 80 MW under contract.
SUN Energy said it had already secured 50 MWp of solar projects in key markets including Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam and is now actively pursuing regional expansion “through a combination of new project development and selective acquisitions”.
The funding round was led by Indonesian coal miner TBS Energy Utama (TBS), through its subsidiary PT Toba Bara Energi, and PT Delta Dunia Makmur, the holding company of mining contractor BUMA.
TBS vice president Pandu Sjahrir said the investment is part of the company’s growing focus on developing clean and renewable energy as it looks to achieve its net-zero emission target by 2030.
“As part of our commitment to developing clean and renewable energy solutions to empower a sustainable future, solar panel business is one of development focus as well as strategy to reduce our carbon footprint,” Pandu said. “With the capacity of SUN Energy, we believe that our collaboration with SUN Energy will help us to achieve the net-zero emission by 2030 target.”
