The $28 million Project EDGE will deliver a prototype market for DER to be dispatched and traded as part of the NEM. Registered market participants, using customers’ DER, will submit bids to the market platform, and in turn will make these bids visible to distribution networks to increase the reliability and resilience of the whole system.
AEMO  will partner with electricity network provider AusNet and retailer Mondo to design and test the “world-first”, two-way energy system that will allow eligible customers to trade electricity and grid services via an aggregator or Virtual Power Plant (VPP) operator from their DER, similar to large-scale participants in the NEM.
“Project EDGE aims to build understanding of and inform the most efficient and sustainable way to integrate DER into the electricity system and markets, allowing all consumers to benefit from a future with high levels of DER,” AEMO chief markets officer, member services, Violette Mouchaileh, said.
“There is no existing product that meets all high-level requirements for the DER marketplace, so Project EDGE is at the leading edge of product development in this space.”
The DER marketplace solution will be developed in partnership with technology providers PXiSE, which will provide market logic software, and Microsoft which will provide cloud services.

European-based technology provider Energy Web Foundation will deliver the open-source operating system for the marketplace with the decentralised technology designed to allow multiple parties to efficiently exchange and validate data in a secure environment.
Australia leads the world in adoption and deployment of DER with data provided by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) revealing more than 2.89 million, or about 25% of Australian homes have a rooftop solar PV system installed.
Combined with the surge in energy storage, demand-side management, and utility-scale renewable generation, the NEM is rapidly transforming into a decentralized system in which consumer-owned DERs play a pivotal role.
AEMO said this has created challenges for distribution network operators in maintaining a reliable and stable supply of energy.
In response, AEMO has established a DER program in a bid to smooth the transition from one-way energy supply to a system that maximises the value of DER for all consumers through digitisation and integration of DER into Australia’s power systems and markets.
AEMO said Project EDGE will initially involve about 50 residential customers in Victoria’s Hume region, but then scale up to 1000 residential, commercial and industrial customers.
Mouchaileh said the three-year trial will provide AEMO, AusNet and Mondo visibility and active control of the DER, helping to reduce electricity costs for customers and managing challenges associated with a decentralised grid and increasing levels of DER participation.
“The trial forms part of AEMO’s DER program to enable a smooth transition from a one-way energy supply chain, to a world-leading system that maximises the value of DER for all consumers through effectively integrating DER into Australia’s power systems and electricity markets,” she said.

Energy Web chief executive Jesse Morris said Project EDGE could provide lessons for other nations.
“Australia is way ahead of the curve in the deployment of DERs,” he said. “AEMO’s vision and ambition in future-proofing its energy grid can be replicated as other countries pursue similar decarbonisation goals.”
AEMO expects to begin testing Project EDGE in April 2022, with project completion in March 2023.
The project was recently awarded almost $13 million in funding by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said at the time the trial would provide the blueprint for integrating DER into the grid.
“As the uptake of rooftop solar, home batteries, home energy management systems, electric vehicles and smart appliances is expected to grow, it is clear that these technologies are going to transform our electricity system,” he said.
“While these devices and technologies can make our grid more reliable, affordable and lower emission, rapid uptake is already impacting how the grid is managed and highlighting the limitations of our existing market frameworks.
“This trial will help to develop trading mechanisms to maximise the economic benefits to customers and the system and minimise the costs of supply to all energy customers.”

VSUN, a subsidiary of Perth-based mining company Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), has confirmed the first three VRFBs supplied to it by Singaporean partner V-Flow Tech will arrive in Fremantle later this month. VSUN said the vanadium electrolyte required for the 5 kW/30 kWh VRFBs has been sourced and will be installed when the batteries arrive in Australia.
The company said the three batteries have already allocated with one to be coupled with a 26 kW solar system at a caravan park in WA’s wheatbelt region while another will be deployed in an off-grid residential setting where it will be paired with 12 kW of solar and 18 KVa of diesel back-up.
The third 5 kW/30 kWh VRFB, which will have a maximum discharge of 7 kW, will be used in a test project being developed by one of the state’s energy utilities.
VSUN said the test site will enable the company, external engineers and potential clients to observe a local working example of a VRFB, rather than examining installations and data from other countries.
AVL managing director Vincent Algar said this will provide further proof of concept and the learnings required to support decisions on energy storage technology options.
“VSUN Energy and AVL have developed a strong relationship with V-Flow Tech and we are excited to be receiving V-Flow’s first batteries in Australia,” he said.
“The three installations will further increase our experience and provide valuable local operating examples of this Australian-invented storage technology.”

Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the residential market but VRFBs are gaining traction with advocates declaring they are safer, more scalable, longer-lasting and more reliable.
VSUN, whose core objective is the growth of the market for VRFBs in Australia, said vanadium flow batteries don’t degrade with cycling like lithium-ion options and are able to move electricity without generating heat. V-Flow has said its technology can operate between -10°C to +55°C without active cooling. The batteries have a lifespan of 25 years, with a stable performance guarantee.
The rollout of the batteries is the latest step for AVL which was recently awarded a $3.69 million federal government manufacturing grant which will allow it to design, build and operate a $7.4 million commercial vanadium battery electrolyte plant in WA and develop VRFB prototypes for both off-grid and residential settings.
AVL plans to produce high-purity vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) from its mining operation south of Meekatharra and processing plant located east of Geraldton to supply VRFB projects in Australia and the Asia Pacific Region.
“AVL’s manufacturing grant from the Australian government enables us to accelerate the construction of Australia’s first vanadium electrolyte plant, to provide the key supply element to this emerging industry,” Algar said.
“The Australian Vanadium Project is at the forefront of this emerging market and driving its growth.”
AVL has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with V-Flow for vanadium pentoxide offtake, vanadium electrolyte supply, VRFB sales, installation, service and maintenance.
VSUN aims to collaborate with V-Flow to develop the capability to undertake the majority of the manufacture of VRFB systems in Australia, with key elements such as the cell stacks being brought in from Singapore.
V-Flow , a spin-off from Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, has developed three products, including 20-50 kWh batteries for residential settings; 100-250 kWh units for commercial and industrial applications and micro-grids for remote communities; and larger utility-scale deployments.

EGP, a subsidiary of United States-based hedge funds manager Elliott Investment Management, has appointed Perth-based advisory firm Azure Capital and Bank of America to oversee the sale of its solar PV and battery energy storage assets. The price for the portfolio is expected to be about $600 million.
While the company remained tight lipped about the sales process, Fairfax media this week reported Azure and Bank of America have already approached potential buyers, indicating a deal could be signed towards the end of the year.
Included in EGP’s solar PV portfolio are the 56 MW Childers and the 75 MW Susan River solar farm in southeast Queensland. It is also progressing development of 125 MW/250 MWh of battery storage across its Australian solar PV assets.
EGP’s expected exit from the Australian market comes as New Zealand-based energy generator and retailer Meridian continues to explore the possible sale of its Australian operations.

Investment bank Lazard has gone to prospective clients to gauge interest with first-round bids due later this month. Australian oil refiner and petrol-station operator Ampol is said to be among the possible suitors.
Meridian flagged the possible sale of its Australian assets when it released its annual results last month, highlighting headwinds in the market, not helped by Australia’s regulatory and policy environment.
“Whilst our customer growth over recent years has been steady and we now have almost 200,000 customers, the current market conditions are challenging and the business is not achieving the targets we have set,” it said.
Meridian owns and operates 300 MW of renewable energy assets in Australia, including wind farms and hydro assets. Another 108 MW is under development and works are also underway on the 20 MW/40 MWh Hume Battery Storage System near Albury, NSW.
The company also operates the retail brand Powershop in Australia, which supplies 180,000 customers with electricity and gas.
The sales come amid a flurry of activity in the Australian renewable energy market, including electricity network owner Spark Infrastructure accepting a $5.2 billion takeover bid from a North American consortium led by private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

That deal follows New Energy Solar selling its two Australian solar farms to Thailand-based company Banpu Australia for $288.5 million and Powering Australian Renewables Fund’s (PowAR) $2.7 billion purchase of Tilt Renewables.
The United Kingdom-based John Laing has sold its Australian wind farm portfolio and is expected to look to offload its two solar assets – the 175 MW Finley and 225 MW Sunraysia solar farms – next year.
Another portfolio could soon be on the block with U.S. private equity fund Denham Capital looking to offload its Australian solar PV assets.
Denham Capital, which owns 95% of Nexif Energy, has reportedly hired U.S. investment banking giant JPMorgan to oversee the sale of its renewable energy assets in the APAC, among them the soon-to-be-completed 464 MW Lincoln Gap Wind Farm in South Australia.
Saudi-owned renewable energy developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) is also rumoured to be seeking a buyer for a part share in its Australian solar farm portfolio which includes the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm in Victoria.

Following multiple high-profile cases of PV installations damaged by strong winds, hail, and other extreme weather conditions, ensuring the ability to withstand everything the climate at a site will throw at a PV project in its 20-year-plus lifetime is high on the list of priorities for project stakeholders.
And the solar industry is rapidly evolving here. Testing standards are emerging to better simulate the effects of extreme weather, and assessments required by insurance providers and other project stakeholders are becoming more sophisticated. But there is still plenty that we don’t know about climate conditions and their potential effects on solar generation.
A research project led by the US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories aims to fill this gap in knowledge by collecting and analysing field data from operating PV plants, and referencing this with weather data to observe the impact of various weather events. Their latest paper, Evaluation of extreme weather impacts on utility-scale photovoltaic plant performance in the United States, has been published in Applied Energy.
The group analyzed data from more than 800 solar installations located in 24 U.S. states. They used various machine learning methods, details of which are publicly available for other research, to draw conclusions about the most damaging weather conditions.
Analysis of words used in maintenance found that “hurricane” was the most frequently mentioned weather event, followed by snow, storm, lightning and wind. “Some hurricanes damage racking — the structure that holds up the panels — due to the high winds,” said Sandia researcher Nicole Jackson. “The other major issue we’ve seen from the maintenance records and talking with our industry partners is flooding blocking access to the site, which delays the process of turning the plant back on.”
Deeper analysis that also incorporated weather data from project sites found that snowstorms have the highest impact on PV production, a difference in output of 54.5% between “event” and “non-event” days. This also found that older solar projects are more vulnerable to extreme weather, potentially due to already being weakened by wear and tear.
While it offers valuable insight into PV in extreme weather, the group notes that events causing major damage – such as hailstorms – may not be listed in maintenance records, as they would go straight to an insurance claim to document the damage.
The group now plans to extend the scope of its study to include wildfires and prolonged extreme heat, and also to look at impacts on the entire electricity grid, rather than PV installations alone. “This analysis improves our understanding of compound, extreme weather event impacts on photovoltaic systems,” Jackson and co-author Thushara Gunda conclude. “These insights can inform planning activities, especially as renewable energy continues to expand into new geographic and climatic regions around the world.”

Vanadium redox battery provider VRB Energy, which is majority-owned by Canada-based metals exploration company High Power Exploration Inc (HPX), has begun construction on a 100 MW/500 MWh vanadium flow battery in Xiangyang, in China’s Hubei province.
The storage project is being deployed at the Automobile Industrial Park of the Xiangyang high-tech development zone and is expected to come online by the end of next year.
The storage facility will be owned by Hubei Green-Move Zhongvan New Energy Co Ltd (Green Move ZF) which is, in turn, owned 70% by China’s largest energy company, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC); 20% by Hubei Pingfan Ruifeng New Energy Co Ltd; and 10% by Chinese real estate developer Wuhan Yuanxing Real Estate Development Co Ltd.
The project is linked to a 1 GW wind and solar project portfolio, 500 MW of solar distributed generation, and the construction of a gigafactory for vanadium redox flow batteries in China.
“VRB Energy has participated, since 2019, in the construction of the first phase of the 3 MW plus 3 MW/12 MWh vanadium redox flow battery energy storage phase of the 10 MW solar and storage project in Hubei Zaoyang, and the project is working well,” said VRB chief executive, Huang Mianyan. “The operation has fully confirmed the huge application value and market prospects of VRB Energy’s storage technology and will promote the grid connection and on-site consumption of renewable energy.”
In mid-July, China’s National Photovoltaic and Energy Demonstration Experimental Center began testing VRB Energy’s vanadium redox flow batteries at its Daqing facility in northeastern China. VRB Energy claims its vanadium redox flow storage systems rely on low-cost ion-exchange membrane and bipole material, and long-life electrolyte formulation. The standard battery power module is rated at 250 kW for megawatt-class systems.
