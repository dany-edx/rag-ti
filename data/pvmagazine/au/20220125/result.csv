The agreement will see the two companies look into collaborating on a potential “clean hydrogen” hub at Middle Arm, south of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT).
The pair will also look into potential hydrogen hubs elsewhere in Australia, though such plans appear vague.
According to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) announcement Hexegon put out about the news, both it and FRV Australia are already progressing individual hydrogen or renewable energy projects near Middle Arm, Darwin. Both the companies’ projects are fully funded in terms of pre-feasibility studies, though FRV Australia has also secured funding the construction stage of its hydrogen and renewable energy project. That being said, there doesn’t appear to be much information publicly available about this project at all.
In the statement, it is noted that FRV Australia is currently looking into developing the 29 MW Berrimah Solar Farm in the NT where installation of an electrolyser is under assessment. It’s possible this is the project being referred to above, though the connection isn’t clear.

Hexagon’s NT hydrogen plans are, on the other hand, more clear. It is hoping to develop a project formerly called the Pedirka Project, which would produce blue hydrogen to be exported as ammonia, meaning the hydrogen would be made with fossil fuels – specifically in this case gasification – with the emissions “captured” through somewhat questionable Carbon Capture and Storage (CSS) technologies. 
The project is targeting production of up to 1.6 million tonnes per annum of ammonia or 300,000 tonnes of hydrogen equivalent annually. Hexagon is currently in the final stages of a pre-feasibility study on the project, which is scheduled for completion by the end of February 2022.
Hexagon says its collaboration with FRV Australia could provide it with access to FRV Australia’s mix of renewable energy products to supply the power required for its proposed hydrogen/ammonia production plant. “This would see less CO2 generated from Hexagon’s blue hydrogen production facilities, requiring less CCS, therefore lowering overall production costs for Hexagon’s projects,” its statement read. Notably, the company seems to have ruled out moving production from gasification to electrolysis, which would allow the hydrogen produced to be classified as green or renewable.
To date, FRV Australia has developed nine large-scale solar farms in Australia, largely in New South Wales and Queensland, which combined sell around 781 MW of electricity into Australia’s National Electricity Market annually.
FRV Australia is 51% “indirectly owned” by Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), which is itself owned by Saudi Arabia’s Abdul Latif Jameel Energy. The other 49% is owned by Omers, a Canadian pension fund.
In addition to its NT Hydrogen and Western Australian Hydrogen projects (presumably what it is calling the North Western Australian Hydrogen Hub), Hexagon holds “highly prospective assets” including the McIntosh Nickel-Copper, PGE Graphite Project and the Halls Creek Gold and Base Metals Project.

The full report is behind a paywall, though pv magazine Australia has been given permission to publish the top 14 panel brands in the rooftop segment in alphabetical order:
For inverters, the top 10 brands with the largest market shares in the rooftop segment are as follows (again, in alphabetical order):
The final quarter of 2021 saw a shakeup of the panel brand leader board. Jinko dropped its market share significantly in that fourth quarter, while Longi’s most radical descent happened across the second quarter. 
On the other end of the scale, Canadian Solar markedly increased its market share from the second quarter and Hanwha Q Cells rocketed up in the fourth quarter. JA Solar also enjoyed a surge in popularity from the second quarter.
In terms of brand origin, leading Chinese brand continued to account for the greatest portion of the Australian market by a long shot. Their popularity peaked in August, before dropping steadily through to November, with a slight increase in December.
Premium brands, on the other hand, followed a reverse trend with their popularity at low point in August before steadily growing through to November. Premium panel brand’s popularity dropped slightly in December.
Brands which fell into neither of these baskets remained steady from July to November, but grew their market share in December.
Sunwiz
Last year saw record volumes of solar installed, with growth primarily driven by rooftop solar which compensated for the slowing in the utility-scale segment.
In total, 5.2 GW of solar was installed in 2021, putting Australia’s cumulative tally at 26.9 GW. By November, Australia reached a landmark with over three million solar systems installed on rooftops, solidifying the country’s global lead in terms of solar per capita. 
While the popularity of rooftop solar has created economies of scale pushing down the average price for residential solar systems, chaos in the solar supply chain and diminished product output from China led prices to increase in the second half of the year. Prices are likely to remain high in the first half of 2022, and when paired with low electricity prices and feed-in tariffs, this mixture has worsened the economics of solar, SunWiz noted.
Be that as it may, the analysis noted solar remained an “excellent investment”.

Late last week, the two companies expanded and extended their partnership with plans to build Australia’s first fully integrated vanadium electrolyte plant using vanadium from TMT’s Murchison Technology Metals Project (MTMP). 
The updated Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will see an initial feasibility study prepared to gauge whether TMT’s vanadium product and LE Systems’ proprietary vanadium electrolyte technology can be workably produced in Australia. 
According to a statement, the study “will focus on the operating, capital and permitting factors associated with the development of vanadium electrolyte production capacity,” as well as the application of LE System’s technology and suitable locations for multiple vanadium electrolyte plants close to large-scale renewable energy production centres close to Australia’s major populations.

LE System CEO Junichi Sato noted that the market for utility scale storage solutions is expanding rapidly and recognised “the importance of broadening our regional vanadium electrolyte production capacity. We have known TMT for some time and LE System are very pleased to be partnering with such a high quality Australian company to support its downstream processing initiatives.”
TMT managing director Ian Prentice concurred, adding: “We view the downstream processing opportunities for vanadium from the MTMP as important for both the future demand of vanadium but also as key to addressing climate change.” 
“TMT plans to build Australia’s first fully integrated mine to battery vanadium electrolyte plant,” Prentice continued, “working with an exceptional global partner, LE System, a leader in the VRFB industry.” 
Technology Metals Australia’s (TMT) primary exploration focus is a project called the Gabanintha Vanadium Project (GVP), located 40 km south east of Meekatharra in the mid-west region of Western Australia. It seeks to develop a processing technique to produce high purity vanadium pentoxide, with the goal of becoming one of the world’s largest single primary vanadium producers, catering to the rapidly expanding flow battery market as well as steel markets.
In 2019, the company received a $2.7 million grant from the Australian Federal Government’s Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive Scheme which went towards its Gabanintha Project.
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are rechargeable flow batteries which use vanadium in different oxidation states to store energy. Far from a new technology, flow batteries have enjoyed a resurgence of attention as an energy storage solution driven by the fact VRFBs are non-flammable, offer virtually unlimited cycling without degradation and are easily scalable.

WAE is a world-leading technology and engineering building that has been operating at the forefront of motorsport’s most glamorous category. But now, with FFI, the company’s pedigree and proven performance will be used in the green energy space to help Fortescue win the race to net zero.
In particular, WAE will bring its critical battery technology to FFI in order to help realise the opportunity in green hydrogen, green ammonia and green electricity. Specifically, in Fortescue’s 3km long freight trains, 400 tonne haul trucks and industrial heavy mobile equipment. Indeed, WAE already provided one of their battery systems to power one of FFI’s electric mining haul trucks last year.
According to an FFI statement, one of the first projects the WAE team will be working on is a battery electric train concept.
Fortescue founder and chairman Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest declared the race for net zero to be “the race of our lifetimes – the race to save the planet from cooking. The speed at which we move matters. Together FFI and WAE will work to decarbonise Fortescue – with the aim of achieving that faster and more effectively than anyone else in the world.”

This deal is “key to unlocking the formula for removing fossil fuel powered machinery and replacing it with zero carbon emission technology,” continued Forrest, “powered by FFI green electricity, green hydrogen and green ammonia.”
“High performance battery and electrification systems are at the core of what we do at WAE,” said Craig Wilson, WAE CEO, “and this acquisition and investment will enable the company’s further growth to support the delivery of zero emission products and services across existing sectors – such as automotive, motorsport and off-highway – and new sectors too.”
We’re delighted to be joining forces with @fortescuefuture to bring the precision engineering from #Motorsport to the #GreenEnergy space, making #RenewableEnergy available at global scale.

Formula 1 legend Sir Frank Williams passed away last year after a life spent building one of the category’s most successful teams. And much of that success can be put down to Williams’ prioritisation of technological innovation.
Former deputy team principal of the Williams F1 Racing Team, Claire Williams, said she was delighted Fortescue were taking over the mantle of WAE and “I am sure that they will continue to drive considerable success through the business and achieve further results in decarbonising heavy industry and tackling the issue of global warming.”

FFI CEO Julie Shuttleworth said “The Acquisition of WAE adds cutting edge technology, intellectual property and engineering capabilities to support and accelerate FFI’s Green Fleet technology pathway. Joining the Fortescue Family will also allow WAE to invest in new technologies and to further commercialise world leading electrification products in new markets. It is also an opportunity to continue to grow the Williams’ family vision of creating cutting edge technology operating at the forefront of innovation in engineering and business.”

And Victorians also know, like the rest of Australia, that the country is experiencing a surge of new home builds and renovations, up 33% since 2019 (according to Bowens). However, as the construction industry makes up 18.1% of Australia’s carbon footprint, Bowens has committed itself to reduce its carbon footprint through $1.2 million investment in solar and power factor correction units (PFCs)
This investment saw 1,386 Trina solar modules installed by Beon Energy Solutions at Bowens manufacturing subsidiary Timbertruss in Corio, Geelong, which should see Bowens energy reliance reduced by up to a third on current annual use.

Beon Energy Solutions’ business development manager Jeremy Mugavin said the project was well worth celebrating and said Bowens was a “Great example of a progressive business investing in suitable power alternatives to reduce their carbon footprint.” The massive commercial installation project cost almost $1 million, but due to the increasing demand for sustainable building materials, Bowens’ customers will only be too happy for the assurance that what they’re buying is powered in part by solar.
Bowens chief investment officer, Andy Bowen, said “The world around us has seen a heightened focus on the environmental impacts of corporations and governments both big and small. It is our duty as an industry leader to play a positive role in this movement and do what we can – from recycling waste to reducing our power consumption.”
“Sustainability and energy efficiency is at the forefront of senior management’s long term strategic decision making,” continued Bowen. “The business is investing millions of dollars in upgrading our stores and facilities, making sure that we minimise our carbon footprint at every turn.”
Of course, timber is a much more sustainable building material than concrete, because concrete hasn’t yet shown a tendency to grow, but nevertheless Bowen insists business leaders need to play their part.
“Our ongoing commitment to helping Australians build better includes addressing long term challenges that face our industry by investing responsibly in sustainable practices,” concluded Bowen. “We will continue to prioritise sustainable business decisions as we deliver the highest quality building materials for all Australian builders.”
Meanwhile the PFCs were installed by Energy Aware across 16 stores and should contribute to further electricity consumption savings by maintaining reactive power levels.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/25/chinese-solar-industry-may-reach-500-gw-module-capacity-by-year-end/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 25, 2022",Chinese solar industry may reach 500 GW module capacity by year end,"From pv magazine Global
The Chinese photovoltaic industry may reach a total capacity of 550 GW for solar cells and 500 GW for PV modules by the end of this year, according to new figures provided by analyst Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA). In 2021, by contrast, Chinese manufacturers saw capacity expansion for wafers reach a total of only 340 GW.
“To illustrate, just in Q4, more than 80 GW of new wafer production capacities were stated by largely new entrants,” the consultancy explained, adding that there would not be sufficient demand for this additional capacity in the near future. “During the past decade there wasn’t hardly any period where the industry wasn’t facing over-capacities,” it stated. “The latter is rather the norm than the exception.”
Furthermore, AECEA revealed that, at the end of 2021, China’s polysilicon industry reached an aggregate capacity of 530,000 MT, to which another 300,000 MT under construction may be added during the first half of this year. “Polysilicon prices shall stay elevated at around RMB 200/kg till summer and possibly fall to RMB 170/kg by year end. Starting Q1/2023, prices are expected to fall more rapidly and possibly sooner than later, prices again will hit previous historical levels of RMB 56/kg,” the analyst added, noting that solar module prices should reach a price level of up to RMB 1.75 (US$0.28)/W by the second half of the year, which would be slightly down from up to RMB 1.9/W currently.
The analyst also provided some figures outlining the growth of the Chinese PV market in 2021, which showed around 53 GW of new PV systems were connected to the country’s grid. “Knowing 2021 will be the final year able to benefit from central government subsidies, it is not surprising why residential PV systems grew 113% YoY (21,59 GW),” AECEA said. Distributed generation including another 7.5 GW of commercial and industrial PV systems accounted for more than 50% of the market share last year. The country’s cumulative PV capacity reached 306 GW at the end of December, of which 107.5 GW is coming from distributed solar.
“Overall, C&I solar PV systems are expected to benefit most from higher electricity tariffs,” the AECEA further explained. “Whether the same logic applies to ground-mounted, utility-scale projects remains to be seen, given that land use fees in particular have significantly increased in certain provinces by a few hundred percent, thus offsetting potential gains from higher electricity tariffs.”
Looking forward, the consultancy said 2022 showed interesting signs of growth, with an unprecedented number of module procurement tenders being announced in the past weeks.
