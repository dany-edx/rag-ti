The program has additionally reduced the councils’ combined greenhouse emissions by 535,714 tonnes — equivalent to taking 124,585 cars off the road each year, the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils’ (WSROC) annual report said.
“The eight councils have also joined WSROC’s Western Sydney Electric Vehicle (EV) Roadmap, with a focus on assisting councils with EV transition plans, charging for fleet, and advocacy and policy development to support community uptake of EVs,” said WSROC President, Councillor Barry Calvert.
The Western Sydney Energy Program began in February 2019 and is a collaboration between Blacktown City Council, Blue Mountains City Council, Camden Council, Cumberland City Council, Hawkesbury City Council, The Hills Shire Council, Liverpool City Council and the City of Parramatta Council.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/28/study-finds-redesigned-zinc-air-batteries-a-better-alternative-to-lithium/,"ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 28, 2023",Study finds redesigned zinc-air batteries a ‘better alternative’ to lithium,"A team of researchers at Western Australia’s Edith Cowan University (ECU) have redesigned zinc-air batteries in such a way that they claim to have overcome the technology’s notorious power output limitations. 
“The new design has been so efficient it suppressed the internal resistance of batteries, and their voltage was close to the theoretical voltage which resulted in a high peak power density and ultra-long stability,” research lead Dr Muhammad Rizwan Azhar said.
Zinc-air batteries consist of a zinc negative electrode and an air positive electrode, and while the chemistry holds promise and is significantly more sustainable than lithium-based counterparts, the poor performance of air electrodes and short lifespan has limited the technology’s power output and ultimately its reach. 
The ECU team, however, says it has made a breakthrough in the technology which has enabled engineers to use a combination of new materials, such as carbon, cheaper iron and cobalt based minerals, to overcome these issues. 
These redesigned zinc-air batteries emerged as a better alternative to lithium, according to the team’s recent study.
“Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are becoming more appealing because of their low cost, environmental friendliness, high theoretical energy density, and inherent safety,” Dr Azhar said.
Lithium batteries, on the other hand, rely on high-cost and finite resources, and have safety issues.”With the emergence of next-generation long-range vehicles and electric aircraft in the market, there is an increasing need for safer, more cost-effective, and high-performance battery systems that can surpass the capabilities of lithium-ion batteries,” Dr Azhar said.
“By using natural resources, such as zinc from Australia and air, this further enhances the cost-effectiveness and viability of these innovative zinc-air batteries for the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/28/20-iron-flow-batteries-delivered-to-queensland-coal-plant-part-of-new-technology-testing-hub/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 28, 2023","20 iron flow batteries delivered to Queensland coal plant, part of new technology testing hub","The site adjacent to Stanwell Power Station on Queensland’s mid-coast is now home to 10 iron flow batteries, with another 10 to follow suit shortly,* as the state government-owned energy company Stanwell Corporation prepares to transform its soon-to-be retiring coal plant to a $100 million (USD 64 million) hub for renewable commercialisation testing, research, development and training.
The iron flow batteries use the technology of US-based Energy Storage Solutions, better known as ESS. Inc, for which local company Energy Storage Industries owns the Asia-Pacific licence. The pilot batteries are each 12 metres long and have a combined capacity of 1 MW/10 MWh. In its announcement, the Queensland government said the installation marks Australia’s first iron flow battery and the largest such installation in the world.
Energy Storage Industries (ESI) Managing Director, Stuart Parry, told pv magazine Australia the battery project is expected to be operational by September 2024. Once fully commissioned, Stanwell will acquire the flow battery, saying that it is aiming deliver service and maintenance on the pilot.

The iron flow battery deal is just one element of the transformation of Stanwell Power Station into the Stanwell Clean Energy Hub. This will include a $100 million Future Energy and Innovation Training Hub (FEITH), described as a shopping centre sized “sandbox” for new technologies in wind, solar, hydrogen and battery storage.
Stanwell is also partnering with hydrogen electrolyser technology company Hysata, a spinoff from research conducted at the University of Wollongong, which claims to have the world’s most efficient electrolysis cell. Stanwell’s Rockhampton hub will host 5 MW pilot project with Hysata’s electrolyser technology to validate its commercialisation potential and technical performance. To that end, Stanwell will provide $3 million and supply the site and facilities for the field deployment of the electrolyser at the site.
While news of the Stanwell coal plant’s transformation was only made Monday, work seems to have already began in the form of the battery delivery, and the government noted it will establish common infrastructure and civil works “in late 2023.”
The Stanwell hub is to be realised in stages, with the announcement flagging the $100 million investment will be deployed over the next five years.
In early August, the Queensland government committed $24 million to further evaluate and assess the capacity of flow battery technology to help the state meet its renewable energy targets. Of that funding, $12 million went towards an iron flow battery from ESI.

Managing Director Parry clarified this funding is in fact going towards a separate installation in Hervey Bay, Queensland, with Energy Queensland Limited, another state-owned entity. That is, ESI is now installing two iron flow battery in the state, with the slightly smaller 1 MW/5 MWh Energy Queensland project also expected to enter operations in September 2024.
Coming back to the Stanwell pilot, the project is seeking test the viability of iron flow batteries for medium duration energy storage, between 8 to12 hours, and assess how the technology deploys at scale. Unlike the more established vanadium flow battery technology, iron flow batteries use an electrolyte solution that its proponents say is “environmentally friendly” since it is made from an earth abundant material, iron. 
Thanks to its “deep tech partnership” with ESS Inc., Energy Storage Industries Asia Pacific is currently constructing a $70 million manufacturing plant in Maryborough, Queensland, which is expected to be operational in 2024. 
Parry has previously said ESI’s vision is to assemble the iron flow batteries designed by ESS here in Australia sourcing 80% of the components from within Queensland, primarily its regions. Parry has subsequently confirmed the company’s electrolyte solution will be manufactured in Townsville.
Alongside testing innovative new technologies in renewable energy, the government supported Rockhampton hub is also intended to “provide a real-life, hands-on training environment for Queensland energy employees to develop the skills needed to work on renewable energy technologies,” the Queensland government says. Future phases include a skills academy and demonstration centre where the community can come. 
The hub has three main purposes, the government says: 
Commercialisation testing
Research and Development
Training and education
Stanwell and CQUniversity (CQU) have also signed an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and will partner to develop a skills and training program. Stanwell will complement CQU’s research facilities with access to the Rockhampton hub, enabling real-world applications of research and hands-on training, it says.
Part of a much larger trend across Australia, both privately and publicly owned coal power stations are increasingly becoming sites for renewable technologies, most notably energy storage. As Queensland Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni said, this is because these sites are “located in strong parts of the network with strategic advantages like grid connection, [have] a highly skilled workforce, established community relationships, and land.”
The Stanwell Power Station has a capacity of 1.46 GW and is expected to start winding down within the next four years, between 2026 and 2027. As the government noted, the plant is located between the “potential future” Capricorn and Calliope Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) as outlined in Queensland’s Draft REZ Roadmap. Those two zones alone are expected to connect between 1.9 GW and 3.8 GW of new renewable generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/28/driving-down-cost-of-solar-key-to-unlocking-green-hydrogen-future/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"AUGUST 28, 2023",Driving down cost of solar key to unlocking green hydrogen future,"Global additions of renewable power capacity are expected to jump by a third this year, according to the IEA. This is due to a combination of factors including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the war in Ukraine, and the technology adoption cost curve. Yet, we’ve only begun to tap solar’s immense potential. According to Jim Tyler, CEO of solar technology company Erthos, reducing the cost of solar electricity will be the key to unlocking the next chapter of the energy transition: a green hydrogen economy.
In a recent interview, Tyler explained how driving down solar’s levelised cost of energy (LCOE) can accelerate the adoption of solar for green hydrogen production. While the startling drop in solar panel prices (from USD 5/W in 2005 to around USD 0.25/W today) has fueled the industry’s growth, ongoing LCOE reductions remain imperative.
“You have to get to below USD 20 a megawatt hour,” said Tyler of the solar electricity price needed to produce competitive green hydrogen. “There are ways to do that. There are ways to get to below USD 20.” The 2023 LCOE report by Lazard put solar on parity with wind at USD 24/MWh.
Enter Erthos, founded by Tyler in 2019, which slashes costs through a novel “solar skin” design that eliminates racking and piles by placing panels directly on the ground. The technology is being embraced by developers like Industrial Sun, which announced a 100 MW project using Erthos technology in December 2022. This approach reduces steel usage by 35 tons per MW, halves installation time and real estate needs, and lowers O&M costs. The carbon footprint of steel manufacture is 1.4-1.65 tons of CO2e/ton of steel.
The flat-to-ground solar also reduces mechanical stress and microcracking on panels, boosting energy yield and project ROI according to a white paper by Erthos. What about periodic flooding of the solar array that flat-mounted solar might encounter in the field, you ask? Tyler, who was previously VP of EPC for First Solar, points to the intrinsic waterproof design of both solar panels and BOS that can withstand periodic flooding.
By streamlining the system, Erthos delivers an estimated 20% lower LCOE compared to single axis tracker based solar construction. While industry observers initially doubted putting panels on the ground, Erthos has now contracted more than 200 MW of its design.
“It’s just a matter of time until all module providers recognise that and ultimately sign up to this technology,” said Tyler, noting nine leading module manufacturers have already partnered with Erthos.
Others are pushing LCOE lower in different ways, like tracker manufacturer NexTracker introducing systems with fewer parts. But why does shaving cents off the cost of solar matter so much? Because it can make the difference in scaling up green hydrogen to displace fossil fuels.
“I’m a very firm believer that we are not going to electrify our way out of the [climate] problem,” stressed Tyler. “We have to solve the problem another way. We have to find a renewable replacement for fossil fuel.”
That replacement is hydrogen. Clean hydrogen produced by splitting water with renewable electricity offers a sustainable fuel for transportation, industry, and more. But historically high production costs have limited adoption.
“I’m 100% firm believer that hydrogen is that [fossil fuel] replacement. It’s just too expensive. That’s just the bottom line,” acknowledged Tyler.
The newly passed Inflation Reduction Act provides crucial support, including tax credits for clean hydrogen. However, driving down the single biggest cost component—the solar electricity input—is vital to make green hydrogen cost competitive at scale.
In fact, Tyler suggests one solution is taking solar off-grid altogether to avoid the years-long interconnection queues hindering larger grid-tied solar projects today. Ultra-low-cost off-grid solar plants dedicated to hydrogen production could accelerate the technology’s adoption.
“When you disconnect us from the grid [avoiding interconnection costs and delays], solar will grow even faster for several years,” Tyler predicted.
While challenges remain, from supply chain constraints to electrolyser availability, the industry leaders driving solar innovation are confident the path is clear. “There are ways to get to below USD 20,” reiterated Tyler.
With solar progress unlocking the hydrogen opportunity, Tyler sees a bright future. “That’s the industry of the future. And when you do that, solar will grow like you wouldn’t believe.” The race is on to make cheap renewable hydrogen from cheap renewable electricity a reality.
When I first spoke to Tyler he provided additional context on Erthos’ disruptive technology and his storied career pioneering utility-scale solar. He first entered the industry in 2006, working on thin film solar manufacturing equipment. Seeing early solar farms under development, he joined OptiSolar in 2007 as they acquired land and interconnection queue positions to facilitate growth.
After building OptiSolar’s first Canadian project, Tyler moved to First Solar as VP of EPC. There he helped scale their technology as crystalline silicon advanced, before co-founding DEPCOM Power in 2014. DEPCOM grew into a top utility-scale EPC, giving Tyler immense experience with trackers. But after building over 8 GW, he contemplated: what if module prices hit zero?
This sparked the idea for flat to ground mount solar. Tyler determined it made economic sense around 50 cents/W, as modules dropped below USD 0.30/W. After verifying solar panels and BOS can survive on the ground, Tyler founded Erthos in 2019 to pursue this inevitable disruption.
With nine tier-one module partners and over 170 MW contracted, Erthos is crossing the chasm into broader adoption. But Tyler explains the shift hinges on LCOE gains trumping perceived risks, just as trackers prevailed for their 5% yield boost despite concerns. With 20% lower LCOE, Erthos should likewise win out.
Still, the transition takes ardent learners willing to embrace ground-mount solar’s advantages. Tyler compares it to next-gen trackers circa 2010 – early adopters tested the waters as bankers and others gradually recognised their value. Now developers like White Pine Renewables and Industrial Sun prove Erthos’ commercial viability.
Ultimately, Tyler sees electrification as insufficient to meet climate goals. Low-cost solar-powered hydrogen production holds the key through its scalable replacement of fossil fuels. He envisions massive off-grid complexes supplying clean fuel, with Erthos slashing solar input costs to under USD 20/MWh. For Tyler, ushering in this new era through innovation is what drives him.

“We provided large film-based perovskite PV module as experimental materials for demonstrations,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, referring to a project conducted at the Aobadai station in Yokohama that includes analyzing indoor performance.
The latest efficiency result is a large improvement on the 15.1% efficiency that Toshiba achieved for the module in September 2021.
The device is fabricated through a one-step coating method that uses improved ink, film drying processes, and production equipment to form a uniform perovskite layer. The process is said to halve the steps for deposition of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. The coating speed is said to reach six meters per minute on a 5×5 cm2 module, which the company defined as a rate that meets requirements for mass production.
The flexible and lightweight panel is indicated by Toshiba as suitable for locations where it is difficult to install conventional crystalline silicon modules, such as low-load-bearing roofs and office windows.
The company has stated in the past that it plans to commercialize its perovskite technology in 2025.
