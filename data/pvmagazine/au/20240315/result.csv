The proposed “Healthy Homes” retrofit package encompasses a rollout of ceiling fans, fly-screens, curtains, insulation, draught sealing, reverse cycle air conditioners, efficient electric hot water systems and solar panels.
Shelter WA argues that social housing renters could save as much as $50 million off the energy bills of social housing renters every year by making homes more energy efficient. The housing advocacy organisation says a previous analysis commissioned by ACOSS shows the energy efficiency retrofitting of social housing could save tenants between about $780 and $1,500 per year on energy bills.
Shelter WA chief executive Kath Snell said, “From Kununurra to Karratha, Carnarvon to Kalgoorlie, and even in the urban heat islands of Perth’s metropolitan areas, many social housing tenants are sweltering through extreme heats with no air conditioners or ceiling fans and struggling to afford to pay the power bills that they have racked up from using inefficient cooling systems.”
Other independent studies show that energy efficiency in social housing significantly alleviates hospitalization and healthcare costs. Rising heatwaves particularly affect low-income households and vulnerable groups.
A study published in the Australian National Library of Medicine in 2022 indicates such measures would affect not only those in need of social housing but the economy at large. Heatwaves have been conclusively linked to increased levels of health service demand in Australia. The study reviewed health service demand during Australian heatwaves for hospital admissions, emergency department presentations, ambulance call-outs, and risk of mortality. Heatwaves were shown to kill more people than any other natural hazard.
In Victoria, the Department of Health found that not only are heatwaves becoming hotter, longer and more frequent (Bureau of Meteorology, 2018), but that this disproportionately affects people with existing chronic health conditions, low-income households and people who are socially isolated among others (Department of Health and Human Services 2018a). These conditions are costly to the healthcare system and can be alleviated with adequate energy efficiency in social housing.
Snell points out, “In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, the government would get a better return on investment and create a greater legacy if it delivers budget measures that reduce expensive energy bills permanently, more so than through one-off rebates.” She highlights that the Cook Government could build on previous initiatives, including the Smart Energy for Social Housing pilot and the installation of water-wise fixtures in public housing.
The housing advocacy organisation has concrete targets. According to Shelter WA, a statewide “Healthy Homes” energy efficiency retrofit of all social housing in Western Australia would cost $152 million over three years for the first 10,000 public housing properties. Beyond this short term, another $486.4 million would finance the energy efficiency retrofitting of the remaining 32,000 public and community housing dwellings by 2030.

The latest in the strategy is the 480 MW Aldoga Solar Farm in Queensland, which will use Bluescop steel torque tubes, produced in Brisbane.
Nextracker announced the deal at an event in Brisbane on Thursday, March. 15. The event was attended by local politicians, steel industry representatives, and Nextracker management.
The local supply deal involves Nextracker, Orrcon Steel, Bluescope, and Baojia.  It involves “critical steel components” being produced at the BlueScope steel coil at Orrcon Steel’s Salisbury Tube millin Brisbane. The toirque tubes will then be finished by Baojia – which works with Nextracker on a global basis.
The supply deal will underpin a decision to open a new steel manufacturing line. It will be equiped to produce 50,000 tonnes of torque tubes a year – a PV capacity of 2.5 GW.
“This foundation strengthens Nextracker’s commitment to deliver energy security to Australians with a local supply chain and new manufacturing jobs to make clean energy affordable and accessible. We support Queensland’s Energy and Jobs Plan and applaud their ambitions to create jobs for the clean energy economy,” said Peter Wheale, Nextracker GM for Australia, Southeast Asia, and New Zealand.
Thursday’s opening ceremony was attended by the Queensland Minister for Energy Mike de Brenni; Tania Archibald, Chief Executive BlueScope Australian Steel Products; Tony Schreiber, Chair of the Australian Steel Institute and General Manager of Orrcon Steel and Peter Wheale, General Manager of Nextracker Australia, Southeast Asia, New Zealand.
Rival tracker supplier Array Technologies announced in February that it would establish a manufacturing line in Australia. The decision was made on the back of project supply wins, including the 102 MW Glenrowan Solar Farm.
In announcing the supply deal, Nextracker pointed to Rystad Energy research that showed that the US tracker company had supplied 7.45 GW of projects in Australia – of a total fleet of 13.5 GW, making it the market leader. Other major projects Nextracker has supplied in Australia are the New England Solar Farm (521 MWd), Stubbo Solar Farm (520 MWd) and Western Downs (460 MWd).

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/15/survey-finds-after-sale-support-key-to-boosting-off-grid-solar/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",MATTHEW LYNAS,2024-03-15,Survey finds after-sale support key to boosting off-grid solar,"From pv magazine Global
Off-grid solar energy customers are currently facing several challenges, according to the Why Off Grid Energy Matters report released by US-based impact measurement company 60 Decibels.
The report analyses issues such as product affordability, gender inequality, customer support, further investment in minigrids, and over-indebtedness, and proposes a series of recommendations to overcome them. The indebtedness recommendation, in particular, stems from reports from 5% of customers surveyed who said they find payments for their energy product or service to be a significant financial burden.
On customer support, Kat Harrison, director at 60 Decibels, told pv magazine there is room for improvement in the way some off-grid energy companies approach after-sale support. Issues ranging from technical faults, to a lack of customer education covering how to effectively use products, risk reputational damage for businesses and the off-grid technologies they sell.
“Some of these challenges prevent end users from unlocking the full benefits of energy access,” she stated. “So many of these markets rely on word of mouth. If your neighbour or friend is sharing their experience of their new solar product – and it doesn’t work or customer service is bad – then people won’t uptake these technologies.”
Despite these challenges, Harrison was positive about the role PV and other off-grid technologies can play in improving energy access globally. “Off-grid energy offers a real opportunity to get us closer to universal energy access, with benefits at a household level, and also a community and national level. We see real productivity, community, and economic impacts,” she added.
Solar lanterns
The report was compiled using survey data from more than 79,000 respondents in 31 countries. Field workers in each country contacted customers directly based on data supplied by 164 companies.
At a product level, the solar lantern offered the greatest return on investment in terms of quality of life improvement, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 64% of respondents with a solar lantern said it had “very much improved” their quality of life, while 62% of those with a residential PV installation said the same.
Around 88% of survey respondents live in Africa and East Africa was the largest region by number of customers surveyed, accounting for 68% of the total. A further 10% of respondents live in Asia and 1% were in Latin America.
Economic impact
The economic impact of off-grid energy was investigated as part of the survey fieldwork. It revealed that although 26% of off-grid energy customers had increased spending on energy, this was often accompanied by a higher level of service, such as longer-lasting or more reliable electricity access. And while 82% used off-grid energy products at home, 11% said they used off-grid energy in their business or farm, with 7% using energy products in both locations.
Economic gains were reported by those who did use off-grid energy products for business, with 58% stating they had experienced an increase in income due to the energy access.
Financing plays a significant role in off-grid solar deployment, according to the report. Of those surveyed, 74% said they bought energy products using some form of payment plan or loan. That figure rises to 92% when those who installed a PV system at home are considered in isolation.
Economic inclusivity was also examined and minigrids were revealed as the off-grid energy solution with the highest proportion of customers living in poverty. While 41% of all survey respondents were living below global poverty thresholds, 51% of minigrid customers were living in poverty. The survey also found users living in poverty tended to report higher impacts from gaining access to off-grid energy across a range of outcomes.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/15/researchers-link-multiple-microgrids-with-v2g-for-more-flexible-economic-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-03-15,"Researchers link multiple microgrids with V2G for more flexible, economic system","Microgrids, which are originally designed for predefined load demands, face vulnerabilities when accommodating additional demands such as electric vehicles (EVs). Merging renewable energy resources, energy storage, and EVs in a residential setting frequently brings challenges, such as overload or surplus generation, and creates dispersed microgrids, which are vulnerable if operated individually.
A research team with members from the UTS, Deakin and Murdoch universities have studied how microgrids can be linked, combined with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging, making them better able to adjust to flexible loads. The researchers found that there were additional techno-economic benefits for distribution network service providers (DNSPs), such as minimising renewable energy curtailment.
The research focused on interconnecting a group of scattered microgrids to create a multi-microgrid system. By developing an energy management strategy to reconfigure the interconnections among microgrids, the researchers have facilitated the efficient exchange of power among these multi-microgrid systems, addressing the variability in load demands in the face of intermittent generation of renewable generation. To further enhance the flexibility of the model, they have also integrated grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and V2G concepts.
The proposed approach, characterised by its mathematical convexity, allows distributed network service providers (DNSPs) to utilise commercial platforms like CPLEX and GUROBI, which can in turn enable them to find feasible solutions more effectively, with minimal computational burden. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its implementation on a modified 33-bus test system operated as multi-microgrid system.
“The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach as a promising tool for optimizing the operation of reconfigurable multi-microgrid systems in the presence of electric vehicle aggregations (EVAs), leading to operational cost reduction and voltage profile enhancement,” the researchers stated.
Their findings are discussed in the paper “Stochastic scheduling of energy sharing in reconfigurable multi-microgrid systems in the presence of vehicle-to-grid technology,” which was published in the journal Electric Power Systems Research.
