This morning, St George Mining Limited announced it had discovered indications its Mt Alexander project, developed for its nickel deposits, likely also holds lithium.
“The results from our initial field work to scope the lithium potential at Mt Alexander are very encouraging and support a compelling case to accelerate exploration for lithium pegmatite mineralisation,” the company’s Executive Chairman, John Prineas, said. 
“Mt Alexander has never been explored for lithium, providing St George with an outstanding opportunity to make a greenfields discovery in what has become a lithium exploration hotspot.
“The initial results highlight the lithium potential from the extensive pegmatite outcrop at our project,” Prineas added.
The news sits alongside recent developments from a number of other miners operating in the Goldfields region, north east of the state’s capital, Perth.

In late July, Red Dirt Metals announced “excellent lithium intervals… together with the thickest visual pegmatite interval to date” had been drilled at its nearby Mt Ida project.
Also known as hard-rock lithium deposits, Red Dirt is awaiting its “maiden lithium resource” in early Q3, 2022.
St George Mining believes its recent lithium pegmatite discovery “may be part of the same system that hosts the major lithium discovery announced by Red Dirt Metals at its Mt Ida project,” – adding that this would underpin its own lithium prospectivity.
WA battery mineral exploration company Zenith Minerals also recently secured an option to purchase a lithium project in Mt Ida’s north. Again, the company is targeting hard-rock lithium pegmatite.
Finally, in late August companies Legacy Iron Ore, Hawthorn Resources and Hancock Magnetite Holdings announced they had executed a non-binding deed relating to lithium, nickel and copper at the Mt Bevan project – again in the same WA region.

Lithium mining has long been contentious, criticised for its hefty environmental impacts. Given Australia has among the world’s largest lithium deposits, alongside the fact the lithium market is set to grow astronomically in the coming decade, it seems fairly likely lithium mining projects in Australia will grow considerably.

Earlier this year, Iberdrola also set up its networks business in Australia, citing the urgent need for more transmission infrastructure to transition Australia to renewable generators.
Iberdrola cited “initiatives” from the states and new federal government as creating a “climate of confidence for foreign investment.”
The company’s overt push into the Australian market follows another even bigger commitment from another Spanish giant, Acciona.
Back in July, Acciona’s chairman, José Manuel Entrecanales, announced a $26 billion investment in Australia, saying it plans to increase its Australian renewable capacity six fold, targeting 6 GW.
UK headquartered company Octopus Group, through its subsidiary Octopus Investments Australia, also launched two renewable energy investment vehicles for Australian renewables in July, totalling $10 billion.

Coming back to Iberdrola, boss Galán met with the Victorian Premier Dan Andrews and the state’s Minister for Energy, Environment, Climate Action, Lilly D’Ambrosio, to make the announcement.
“The country’s abundant wind and solar resources, as well as the pace of technological development, place this region in a privileged position,” Galán said.
“We will lead and accelerate its transition to an economy with green energy at its epicentre, with the aim of increasing the amount of electricity generated with renewables, which now represents around a third of its generation.”
The company noted Australia’s “huge pipeline of renewable energy and storage projects,” as well as the strong residential demand for solar and batteries.
“In addition, opportunities are emerging for the economy as the country embraces new sectors such as green hydrogen, ammonia and green materials, as well as opportunities for innovation in offshore wind and storage,” the company’s announcement said.

Iberdrola owns the 190 MW Avonlie solar farm in south-west New South Wales, the Flyers Creek wind farm in central New South Wales and the 317 MW Port Augusta renewable energy complex in South Australia, the largest hybrid wind-solar farm in the southern hemisphere.
More recently, it has acquired the rights to the enormous 1 GW Mount James wind farm, and the 360 MW Broadsound solar plant, both in Queensland.
The company also said it is currently building two new facilities with a combined capacity of 391 MW, scheduled for commissioning in 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/07/fortescues-2-gw-electrolyser-factory-is-just-the-beginning/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE",BLAKE MATICH,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",Fortescue’s 2 GW electrolyser factory is just the beginning ,"In a recent interview with Bloomberg, new Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) chief executive officer Mark Hutchinson said the company’s under construction 2 GW electrolyser factory in Gladstone, Queensland, was just the beginning. 
Considering the facility’s 2 GW annual capacity will more than double current global production, this is no small beginning. 
“We’ll announce over the next few months some big investments in some plants,” Hutchinson told Bloomberg, noting that current plans would not be sufficient to meet the rapidly increasing demand for hydrogen. 
The 2 GW facility is “going to be too small because the demand is going to be enormous,” he said. 

FFI, the clean energy arm of Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., aims to be a global exporter of green hydrogen, with a goal to produce 15 million tonnes a year by 2030. 
“When I think about how big this market is,” Hutchinson continued, “it’s as big as replacing the entire fossil fuel market in the world, and it’s real now.”
In March, FFI signed a preliminary deal with E.ON, one of Europe’s largest energy network operators, that will see the company deliver five million tonnes of green hydrogen to Germany, the Netherlands, and other European destinations by 2030.” 
“Once we get going at scale and just looking at the projects we have, it’s enormous,” Hutchinson said, before adding that if FFI met its 2030 output target, it would create an “energy business way bigger than the iron ore business.” 
It is thus no surprise that, according to Bloomberg, Forrest told investors last week that he’d been approached by fund managers over a potential US$20 billion separate listening of FFI. And it is equally unsurprising that Forrest sees better value in retaining FFI. 
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), global demand for hydrogen requires the investment of approximately US$4 trillion by 2050. 
The Gladstone factory is expected to produce its first electrolyser by the end of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/07/rapid-charging-solid-state-battery-moves-toward-commercialisation/,"EV,HIGHLIGHTS,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",Rapid-charging solid-state battery moves toward commercialisation,"From pv magazine Global | via the mobility rEVolution
Harvard University researchers have developed a solid-state lithium-metal battery that can be charged and discharged at least 10,000 times at a high current density – marking a big leap toward commercialisation. The lab-scale coin-cell prototype has achieved lifetime battery charge rates as fast as three minutes with more than 10,000 cycles. The scientists published their results in Nature and other journals last year. Now, Harvard’s Office of Technology Development has granted an exclusive technology license to startup Adden Energy to develop innovative solid-state battery systems for use in future rapid-charging EVs. The company recently closed a US$5.15 million funding round to help it scale Harvard’s lab prototype toward commercial deployment. It aims to develop the battery to a palm-sized pouch cell, and then to a full-scale vehicle battery within the next three to five years. “If you want to electrify vehicles, a solid-state battery is the way to go,” said Xin Li, associate professor of materials science at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and a scientific adviser to Adden Energy. “We don’t see any fundamental limit to scaling up our battery technology. That could be a game changer.”
Prologium has announced its first overseas gigafactory. The Taiwanese solid-state battery cell manufacturer said the facility, which will be built in Europe or the United States, will have an annual capacity of 120 GWh when completed. In Europe, the company has initiated a feasibility study for potential sites in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom. A final decision will be made in the first quarter of 2023. Construction is planned to take place in three phases and investments are expected to reach US$8 billion over the next 10 years. ProLogium estimates that the plant will create more than 6,500 jobs by 2031. Earlier this year, Prologium announced big investments from Mecedes-Benz and Vietnamese EV manufacturer VinFast. The company plans to launch its first 3 GWh production plant in early 2023, with a significant proportion of its production capacity reserved for VinFast.
SVOLT said it is making significant strides in solid-state battery development. It recently produced a first batch of 20 Ah cells with sulfide-based solid electrolyte, which made it the first battery manufacturer in China to demonstrate the production of this type of solid-state cell. The prototype solid-state cells have an energy density of 350 Wh to 400 Wh/kg, promising a range of more than 1,000 kilometres for EVs. SVOLT recently completed abuse tests, such as a 200 C hot box test and a nail puncture test in which its new 20Ah cells survived unscathed. SVOLT’s Wuxi Lithium Battery Innovation Center and the Ningbo China Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences established a joint research centre for solid-state battery technology in April 2021. Since then, it has filed 187 patents. The company plans to further expand its R&D in the field of solid-state batteries, as well as in new process technologies to further develop the technological basis for mass production.
Factorial Energy – a US developer of solid-state battery cells for EVs, backed by Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Hyundai Motor – has begun construction of a new production facility near Boston. It will house Factorial’s pilot production facility, which will manufacture automotive-sized solid-state batteries at pre-production speed and volume. Factorial will invest US$45 million in the facility, which is expected to begin operations in early 2023. Last year, the Massachusetts-based startup announced a major breakthrough when it achieved a capacity retention rate of 97.3% after 675 cycles for its 40 Amp-hour (Ah) solid-state product at room temperature.
Toyota has announced an investment of up to JPY 730 billion (US$5.2 billion) for EV battery production in Japan and the United States. The new facilities, scheduled to start production between 2024 and 2026, will increase Toyota’s battery production capacity by up to 40 GWh. Specifically, the Japanese carmaker will invest around JPY 400 billion in Himeji Prime Planet Energy and Solutions. The battery joint venture between Toyota and Panasonic specialises in prismatic automotive batteries. It will also invest JPY 325 billion in its newest North American facility, Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina.
Honda and LG Energy Solution have announced plans to build a new US$4.4 billion lithium-ion battery plant in the United States to meet demand in the rapidly growing North American EV market. The plant will have an annual production capacity of approximately 40 GWh. The pouch-type batteries produced at the new joint venture plant will be supplied exclusively to Honda facilities in North America and will be used in Honda and Acura electric models. While the location for the joint venture plant is yet to be finalised, the two companies aim to begin construction in early 2023, in order to enable the start of mass production by the end of 2025. In August, Honda’s Acura subsidiary announced its first all-electric model. The Acura ZDX SUV is based on the Ultium platform from General Motors and is scheduled for market launch in 2024.
BMW Group said it is commencing in-house, small-scale production of fuel cells for its iX5 in Munich, Germany. The small series of hydrogen cars will go into service in the next four months for test and demonstration purposes, targeting the premium segment. The fuel cells generate a high continuous output of 125 kW/170 hp, paired with an electric motor featuring fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and a battery that enables the powertrain to deliver 275 kW/374 hp. BMW has collaborated with Toyota Motor on fuel cells since 2013.
Ganfeng Lithium announced plans last week to invest CNY 21.3 billion (US$3.07 billion) in four new production centers. Solar power storage devices will be among the products to be produced at a CNY 6.2 billion fab in Xinyu, Jiangxi province, with an annual production capacity of 10 GWh to be built by October 2023, and at a separate, 6 GWh, CNY 3.5 billion site nearby. A CNY 9.6 billion, 20 GWh facility in Chongqing will make solid-state lithium products for electric vehicles and other transport uses. It is set to have a two-year timetable, with construction to start three months after the land paperwork is signed. A fourth, CNY 2 billion fab will produce 2 billion units per year of small polymer lithium-ion devices for items such as consumer and wearable electronics. Ganfeng Lithium last week posted first-half net profits of CNY 7.35 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/07/zinc8-to-manufacture-its-first-zinc-air-batteries-in-us-market/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2022",Zinc8 to manufacture its first zinc-air batteries in US market,"From pv magazine USA
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has announced that its inaugural commercial production facility will be built in Ulster County, New York. Based upon comprehensive analysis done by the company, the recently announced US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) manufacturing production credits provide distinct and direct benefits to Zinc8, influencing its production plans in the United States.
Zinc8 Energy Solutions has developed a proprietary flow battery technology that it claims is able to deliver power in the range from 20 kW to 50 MW that can store and discharge energy durations from 4 to 100 hours. Scalability and higher capacity is achieved with an increase in the size of storage tanks that hold zinc particles. The modular battery can be configured to support a wide array of long-duration applications for microgrids and utilities, as well as for commercial and industrial projects.
Unlike lithium-ion technology, which requires new stacks to scale, Zinc8 says it has completely decoupled the linkage between energy and power. This means that scaling Zinc8’s technology can be accomplished by simply increasing the size of the fuel tank and quantity of recharged zinc fuel.  According to the manufacturer, the technology promises zero capacity fade over an extensive lifetime, and the batteries are non-flammable, non-toxic and sustainable with stable supply chains for mass production.
The company chose Ulster County in upstate New York after Senator Chuck Schumer personally called the CEO of Zinc8, Ron MacDonald, to urge the company to expand their operations in New York state and particularly to Ulster County.
The Canadian company was enticed to move to the USA as a result of the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit included in the IRA, which provides incentives to battery manufacturers as well as to critical mineral processing companies. Every eligible battery cell will receive a US$35 credit, scaling with the capacity of the battery, with incentives to last at their initial level until 2029, before phasing down from 2030 to a phase out stage beginning in 2032.
There is also US$10 billion support available for construction of clean energy tech factories, or for retrofitting existing factories with tools and production lines to make clean energy equipment and components.  President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes US$6 billion incentives to support R&D and production of batteries in the United States, which bolsters the domestic supply chain.
“This represents some direct and beneficial credit opportunities for Zinc8,” said MacDonald. “It is abundantly clear that with the introduction of the IRA, US policymakers, led by Senator Schumer, are taking real action by introducing incentives that benefit both the climate and the economy. We have received tremendous support both at the federal and state level as we continue to analyse possible sites for our first manufacturing facility.”
Zinc8 signed a letter of intent to move into iPark87, which is the former TechCity campus now being redeveloped as an EPA cleanup site. Schumer said that with Zinc8 as an anchor tenant of iPark87, the Hudson Valley could see up to 500 new, good paying clean energy jobs.
“Zinc8 is the jolt of electricity the Hudson Valley needs, and is proof positive that when you invest in fighting climate change you are investing in creating good-paying jobs, new economic growth, and a brighter future for our communities. As the EPA officially begins cleanup of this once-contaminated asbestos dumping ground, I can think of no better way to usher in a renaissance for Ulster County than by making this the foundation for supercharging the fight against climate change with an investment in clean tech manufacturing,” said Schumer.
In January, Zinc8 said it would install its technology at a New York City housing complex in a trial run by the New York State Energy Research and Development Agency (NYSERDA). The plan is for a 100kW/1.5MWh zinc-air energy storage system (ZESS) to be installed at Fresh Meadows Community Apartments in Queens, New York, to support and enhance the economics of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system currently under construction, along with an existing photovoltaic system.
