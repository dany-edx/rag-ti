The South Australia-based company, which currently operates a 150 MW factory at Mawson Lakes in Adelaide’s northern suburbs, has yet to settle on a location for the new facility but said sites in regional New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria are being considered.
Tindo said the new plant, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2025, will have the capacity to produce 7,000 panels per day, helping meet the estimated 22,000 PV panels which the company predicts will need to be installed each day to meet Australia’s 2030 decarbonisation targets.
“There is a clear need for Australia to build sovereign capability in renewables manufacturing, and to ensure there is more Australian-made content in the vast amount of clean energy infrastructure required as we decarbonise our electricity system,” Tindo Chief Executive Officer Richard Petterson said.
As well as supplying panels across Australia, Tindo said output from the facility would be used to increase its export market, boosting Australia’s presence in the renewables market.
Petterson said the plant has been developed in response to federal and state government calls for more domestic renewables manufacturing and the scale of the proposed facility will help catalyse a domestic upstream supply chain.
“Governments across the country have recognised that now is the time to be putting in place the right mechanisms to make Australia a renewables manufacturing superpower,” he said, adding that government support is needed to help Australian companies to compete with international rivals.
“The United States’ Inflation Reduction Act and China’s ongoing support for its renewables manufacturers show that some level of price support, possibly through a production credit, is critical to help industry scale,” he said.
Petterson said this type of short-term support would unlock huge investment in Australia, create thousands of jobs and ensure the nation shares in more of the benefits of the global energy transition.
“We want Tindo’s gigafactory to be at the heart of this domestic strategy, supplying Australian-made, high-quality solar panels to developers and installers, while sourcing component parts from local suppliers,” he said.
Tindo said it is already in talks with local manufacturers of glass, aluminium and other components that would be needed to support the new gigafactory and has secured Letters of Intent from potential offtakers and has attracted interest from strategic partners.

Brisbane-based Skylab, which also acts as distributor of solar tracking systems, said the proposed Punch’s Creek Renewable Energy Project is being developed near Millmerran, about 70 kilometres southwest of Toowoomba in the heart of the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone.
The project, which has been in development since 2019, is to include more than 1.7 million PV panels spread across a 1,345-hectare site, much of which is currently used for cropping and grazing purposes.
The Toowoomba Regional Council has now launched a “public notification” process, allowing the local community to provide feedback on the proposed development.
Council said the public notification campaign is required as the project is considered “impact-assessable”, meaning the proposed land use is in some way inconsistent with the generally accepted uses under the existing zoning.
Public submissions are being accepted through until 24 February 2024.

Skylab said the solar and battery project is planned to be built in two stages. The first phase of construction, slated to begin later this year, will deliver 400 MW of solar along with the battery and associated infrastructure including a substation. Stage 2 would add a further 400 MW of solar.
The Punch’s Creek Renewable Energy Project will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via Powerlink’s existing 330 kV electricity transmission line that transects the project site.
In its development documents, Skylab said the project will support state and national renewable energy targets and provide essential support as coal-fired generation capacity continues to exit the system.
Skylab’s portfolio also includes the 100 MW Gunsynd Solar Farm being developed near Goondiwindi in south-west Queensland, and the proposed Springvale Renewable Project, a 400 MW / 480 MW solar farm with 100 MWh battery storage and hydrogen production capacity near Townsville in the state’s north.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/08/barriers-and-solutions-to-australias-climate-crisis/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 8, 2024",Barriers and solutions to Australia’s climate crisis,"Yet, while commitment to clean energy and decarbonisation remained strong at COP28 with Australia and 200 other countries agreeing to triple renewable energy capacity and begin reducing the world’s consumption of fossil fuels, the status of Australia’s renewable transition remains in a holding pattern.
If transmission projects and the backlog of renewables waiting to connect to them continue at the rate of deployment without implementing alternative solutions, not only will energy supply and grid reliability suffer, but achieving 82% renewable energy in the next six years will become almost impossible.
We need to dismantle the barriers preventing the realisation of 2030 and 2050 targets, with quick action required to resolve Australia’s climate crisis.
While new transmission lines and leveraging the potential of distributed and consumer energy resources are critical components of Australia’s energy transition, industry experts and policymakers must implement a diversified approach that leaves no potential solution off the table.
As the necessary renewable generation required to achieve transition targets continues to fall further behind schedule, only four Australian renewable projects were approved in the last quarter, network infrastructure availability and accessibility has become the greatest constraint to the clean energy transition.
A combination of solutions is required to surpass these barriers and establish a clear path forward, with the government-backed Capacity Investment Scheme representing an excellent step forward. However, the CIS will only achieve its goals by identifying and enabling diversified network connection opportunities.
The capabilities of the existing grid are one major avenue yet to be fully leveraged, presenting enormous potential for the accelerated connection of renewable energy by removing our single point of reliance on delayed transmission projects.
Advanced new technologies such as digital modelling and AI are uncovering significant latent capacity within the power lines we already have.
This means there is potential to begin safely connecting to more renewable energy, sooner. By harnessing these technologies and the power of our existing infrastructure through minimal manpower and investment, we can fast-track the clean energy transition without reinventing the grid.
A new approach is required to maintain reliability and affordability, including investment in the existing grid to improve the pace of renewable energy connections.
If we’re going to keep 2030 targets within reach, building a modern and digital grid will play a vital role in safeguarding electricity security during the renewable transition.
Money is flowing steadily into renewable projects and transmission lines, but to meet targets and maintain energy reliability for consumers, grid investment and upgrades must gain pace.
As it stands, the grid is one of the most overlooked yet accessible solutions to the renewable energy challenge. With the right investment, latent capacity hiding in plain sight can be sourced and safely accessed.
Traditional line rating methods evaluating capacity are still largely manual, with engineering teams being sent into the field to record, compile, and analyse data from each stretch of the network. This process is both time and labour intensive, costly to undertake, and cannot provide the level of detail or visibility needed to accurately assess true network capacity. These processes and the overall lack of evolution have caused utilities to act with caution to avoid overloading the network with dangerous levels of current. This has contributed to networks not fully maximising the benefits of clean energy generation.
Digitisation of the grid is now critical to leveraging existing infrastructure to its full capacity. Digital modelling, AI and machine learning technologies including LiDAR, geospatial and cloud point data are all tools helping utilities shift beyond manual processes to generate clearer, more accurate network visibility at speed.
Digital line rating work has already surfaced significant potential capacity increases with Essential Energy, which operates one of the largest networks in Australia. In Texas, a study with EMPACT Engineering found that 94.5% of the region’s power lines could safely hold double the existing capacity.
Leveraging technology to supplement existing transition strategies is paramount to navigating barriers preventing the clean energy transition from remaining on track.
A diversified approach will keep Australia moving forward on the path to net zero, we just have to recognise its potential and support government stewardship to enable it.

Perovskites are thin-film semiconductors with well-documented challenges in commercialising and scaling up their production. While high efficiencies have been produced in lab conditions, these have proved difficult to replicate in production.
These easily synthesized materials are considered the future of solar cells, with properties ideal for enabling low-cost, efficient photovoltaics. Perovskites are also predicted to play a role in upcoming electric vehicle batteries, sensors, and lasers, among other things.
The research team has been able to create reproducible perovskite solar cells with power-conversion efficiencies of 16.9%, which is the best-known result manufactured without human intervention.
“A reproducible 16.9% power-conversion efficiency is better than an irreproducible 30%,” explained Dr Nastaran Meftahi, lead author of the study that has just been published in Advanced Energy Materials. “What we have achieved is the development of a method for rapidly and reproducibly making and testing new solar cells, where each generation learns from and improves upon the previous.”
The researchers have shown that the model will be capable of predicting huge volumes of promising chemical recipes for new perovskite solar cells.
Dr Adam Surmiak at Monash University and Professor Udo Bach at the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics and CSIRO will lead a new facility currently under construction to run the new model automated system for solar cell manufacturing.
“Critically, our machine learning model represents the starting point for further optimisation, both in terms of power-conversion efficiency and stability,” Meftahi said, adding that this machine-learning model and automated system has the potential to process data and run tests on other types of solar cells, including those made with silicon or organic materials.
“We are keen to work with partners in industry to further test and prototype our work so that it can be possibly commercialised in a range of applications,” she confirmed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/08/rooftop-solar-delivers-generation-milestone-in-nem/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 8, 2024",Rooftop solar delivers generation milestone in NEM,"Both South Australia and Victoria set new records for low demand for electricity from the grid on the final day of 2023 with mild temperatures and clear skies driving high rooftop solar generation, which contributed more than 100% of South Australia’s total energy needs and accounted for almost two-thirds of Victoria’s energy requirement.
On 31 December 2023, in the 30-minute period starting 12.30pm, rooftop solar provided 65.8% of Victoria’s energy needs, up from the previous high of 61.5% seen on 17 December 2023. In South Australia, rooftop solar provided 101.8% of the state’s total energy requirement on New Year’s Eve, a slight increase on the 101.1% share seen on 23 September 2023.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) – which noted in its recently released draft 2024 Integrated System Plan (ISP) that rooftop solar is now three times more common than backyard pools in Australia – said the South Australian milestone is the first time rooftop solar exceeded total demand in any region of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Both states witnessed their lowest-yet half-hourly operational demand levels with South Australia’s demand dropping to -26 MW in the half hour ending 1.30pm, down from the prior record of 5 MW on 1 October 2023. In Victoria, demand fell to 1,564 MW at 1pm, a decrease from the previous low of 1,915 MW recorded on 29 October 2023.

The high rooftop solar generation saw market prices in both regions drop. Daily wholesale electricity prices averaged -$66.54/MWh in South Australia and -$73.02/MWh in Victoria, nearly $20/MWh below that state’s previous daily low.
Large-scale solar and wind scaled back in response, with some observers noting the event marked a significant shift in Australia’s electricity generation landscape.
While the increase in rooftop solar installations poses a risk for system security, market analysts pointed out that it also presents opportunities, including for increased energy storage capacity – grid-scale storage, home batteries and electric vehicles – to ensure grid stability during times of excess solar rooftop generation.
AEMO has forecast that rooftop solar capacity will triple from just over 20 GW today to 60 GW by 2040.

Solar Philippines, the listed unit of Manila-based PV module manufacturer and project developer SP New Energy Corp. (SPNEC), has started clearing land for what is poised to be the company’s flagship 4 GW Terra Solar development in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan, located in the northern Philippines.
The company claims this is the world’s largest solar project made up of 3.5 GW of solar panels with 4 GWh of battery storage. The project is estimated to cost $5.34 billion (PHP 200 billion) and be completed by early 2026.
“This will be one of the largest solar projects not just in Asia but in the world,” said Manuel Pangilinan, chairman and CEO of the country’s electric power distribution company, Meralco.
Solar Philippines first announced in 2021 it would build a 500 MW solar farm on former ranch land in Peñaranda. In December of that year, SPNEC also made its debut on the Philippine Stock Exchange, setting its initial public offering at PHP 1 per share. In 2022, the company unveiled its plans to add 3.5 GW to the original 500 MW solar farm in Luzon, expanding the project eightfold.
At the time, SPNEC said it was using the proceeds from various capital raises to acquire the land for the 3.5 GW project extension, including a previously announced stock rights offering to raise at least PHP 10 billion ($179 million), as well as planned asset-for-share swap with parent company Solar Philippines, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.
Solar Philippines founder Leandro Leviste said the company had tried to secure land permits with the Department of Energy since 2016 to shore up the project, which will extend 60 kilometers to connect to NGCP’s (National Grid Corp. of the Philippines) substations that supply the Greater Manila Area.
Legal reforms and a liberalised energy market have tapped the Philippines to be “the place” when developing large-scale solar arrays in Southeast Asia, one analyst told pv magazine.
The Philippines aims to install 15 GW of clean energy by 2030, with a possible focus on mini-grids and standalone clean power systems due to the country’s archipelagic nature, according to a 2022 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
