IGO Acting Chief Executive Officer Matt Dusci said Australia is already playing an important role in supplying critical minerals needed for the world’s clean energy transition but needs to increase its involvement further down the battery manufacturing value chain.
Dusci said on Friday Australia’s greatest opportunity lies midway through the battery value chain.
“We need to continue to expand our participation throughout the battery supply chain, beyond just the mining of critical raw minerals, in order to capture a greater share of the value,” he said. “We believe the area where Australia can be most competitive is in mid-stream battery chemical processing.”
Dusci said the Kwinana facility will provide a direct link between WA’s upstream battery mineral assets and downstream customers in the battery supply chain and support the development of sovereign battery chemical processing capabilities in the state.
It will also enable Australia to create greater critical battery metal security and support the building of improved national capability across the battery supply chain.
“We strongly believe that by bringing the right partners together, we will deliver a fully optimised nickel supply chain delivering low-cost, low-carbon, responsibly produced battery chemicals for the global battery and electric vehicle industry, to be delivered through an integrated battery material facility here in Western Australia,” Dusci said.

The proposed integrated battery material facility is to be established on approximately 30 hectares of vacant industrial land leased from the WA government. The site, in the Kwinana industrial precinct south of Perth, is adjacent to the Kwinana Lithium Hydroxide Refinery which IGO runs in a joint venture with China’s Tianqi Lithium Corporation.
Perth-based IGO said in a statement it is, in conjunction with Wyloo, now working towards making a financial investment decision on the project.
That investment decision is unlikely to be made before the end of 2024 at the earliest with IGO and Wyloo, part of the Forrest family’s private investment arm Tattarang, aiming to deliver a feasibility study midway through next year.
Other key workstreams required before a final investment decision can be made include environmental permitting and approvals, the achievement of key commercial outcomes, and engaging a partner with experience in PCAM production.
IGO said it and Wyloo are currently advancing discussions with “a global battery chemical manufacturer” which had expressed “strong interest” in being involved in the project.
Wyloo Chief Executive Officer Luca Giacovazzi said the project will build upon the “immense potential” that exists in WA which is home to some of the world’s highest-grade nickel deposits.
“WA is already a leading supplier of critical minerals, and this is the spark it needs to become a global hub for battery metals,” he said. “There’s a huge opportunity to grow the industry and Western Australian jobs by supporting the world’s transition to electric vehicles.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/14/report-warns-of-risks-for-australia-in-global-green-hydrogen-race/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 14, 2023",Report warns of risks for Australia in global green hydrogen race,"The annual State of Hydrogen report highlights that Australia is well placed to play a significant role in the global green hydrogen industry due to its renewable energy potential but warns there’s an urgent need to speed up priority pilot projects and the establishment of hydrogen hubs if it is to compete internationally.
The 92-page report, prepared by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, covers the development of Australia’s hydrogen industry so far, how it measures up to international growth, and the path ahead for the industry in Australia.
The report indicates that the local industry is advancing broadly, with Australia home to about 40% of all announced global hydrogen projects. More than 100 ‘clean’ hydrogen projects were announced in Australia in 2022 – more than double the projects announced in 2021.
The Australian pipeline of projects is valued at up to $300 billion (USD 203.5 billion) of potential investment but the report highlights that most of the project announcements in this pipeline are yet to reach final investment decisions.
“While Australia has a large pipeline of announced hydrogen projects, it still trails many OECD nations in terms of projects proceeding to deployment,” the report says, warning that Australia now risks falling behind other countries which are implementing market-based policy mechanisms and new economic incentives to propel their hydrogen industries.
“Australia was the third country to announce a national hydrogen strategy. Today, there are 30 national strategies, with a further seven in development,” the report says. “Australia is no longer the global policy leader in developing a new clean hydrogen industry.”

The report suggests that to be a global leader in the hydrogen industry by 2030, Australia will need to accelerate its delivery of the early actions identified in the National Hydrogen Strategy, launched in 2019.
“In particular, the advancement of priority pilot projects, the establishment of hydrogen hubs, and the assessment of supply chains will be essential to achieving the scale necessary to compete internationally,” the report says, adding the government may also need to reconsider the introduction of targets and incentives and other measures to ensure its industry is globally competitive.
The department said the next steps will be critical to keeping Australia on the path to be a global hydrogen leader with success relying on industry, governments, researchers and the community working together.
“If we get this right, we can realise our vision to establish a new hydrogen export industry in Australia, unlocking jobs, assisting the energy transition, reducing emissions and potentially unlocking billions of dollars in GDP by 2050,” the report says.
Energy Minister Chris Bowen estimates that Australia’s hydrogen industry could by 2050 generate $50 billion in additional GDP and create more than 16,000 jobs.
“Australia’s regions have the resources, technical skills and track record with international partners to seize this opportunity and become a global hydrogen powerhouse, we need to make sure we don’t get left behind as the rest of the world moves,” he said.
“We know our trading partners are looking to us to supply Australian hydrogen, and our industrial base requires it. We will keep our foot on the accelerator to achieve the scale of industry development necessary to compete internationally.”

The release of the State of Hydrogen report comes after the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced $50 million for two funding rounds targeting innovation in green hydrogen and low-emissions iron and steel.
ARENA said $25 million will be allocated to each of the funding rounds, with grant funding for successful applicants expected to range between $500,000 and $5 million.
ARENA Acting Chief Executive Officer Chris Faris said the investment rounds will include a laboratory-based research phase, then a commercialisation phase aimed at scaling up, demonstrating and deploying research breakthroughs and technologies in the real world.
“We’re already seeing renewable hydrogen scaling up, but there’s still more to be done to improve efficiency, while storing and transporting the fuel at scale are looming challenges,” he said.
“Iron and steel production represents enormous emissions reduction opportunities for Australia and our trading partners. Globally, these industries make up around 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so the decarbonisation opportunity is huge.”
“As global markets increasingly demand low-carbon products, we need new solutions to bring us closer to net zero. And we need to get that research out of the lab and into industrial applications. This work is about future-proofing our iron and steel industries for a low-carbon value chain.”
Expressions of interest for both the green hydrogen and iron and steel R&D funding rounds are due 1 June 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/14/solcast-sheds-light-on-utility-pv-performances-across-australia/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 14, 2023",Solcast sheds light on utility PV performances across Australia,"Large-scale solar farms in New South Wales (NSW) flooded the utility PV generation rankings last month with international consultancy firm Rystad Energy noting that seven of Australia’s top 10 best-performing assets in March are all located in the eastern state.
Rystad Energy Senior Renewables Analyst David Dixon said SUN Energy’s 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia’s (WA) central Wheatbelt region topped the rankings with an average capacity factor of 34.6% for the month but NSW facilities had dominated the charts, generating a combined 518 GWh over the month.
Canadian clean energy investment firm Amp Energy’s 120 MW Hillston Solar Farm in the Riverina region of southwest NSW was second in the generation performance rankings with a capacity factor of 34% across March while France-headquartered renewable energy developer Neoen’s 36 MW Giffith Solar Farm, also in the Riverina district, was third with a 30.9% capacity factor.
Sydney-based solar data specialist Solcast, which uses weather data and modelling tools to optimise solar PV systems, said the performances coincided with the demise of the La Niña weather pattern which typically brings increased cloud cover and rain to Australia.

Solcast Lead Modeller Harry Jack said the end of the La Niña event meant most of Australia saw an increase in solar irradiance compared to long-term averages.
“Summer monsoon activity was reduced in general and focused primarily over the Gulf of Carpentaria and inland Queensland during March, so this region saw the biggest drop from its usual average irradiance,” he said.
“The remainder of northern Australia was left with less cloud and therefore higher irradiance than normal, following the end of the La Nina event. In particular, the east coast of Queensland saw irradiance up to 20% above average.”
This was reflected in Rystad’s analysis with Dixon saying utility PV saw substantial year-on-year growth in Queensland, with a 33% or 113 GWh increase on 2021 figures.

Jack said the southern parts of WA also saw higher solar irradiance due to less high cloud than usual.
Solcast said Victoria, southeast South Australia and southern NSW saw a 10% reduction in their usual solar levels during March as unseasonal bouts of south-westerly and southerly winds brought moist ocean air from the Southern Ocean, resulting in higher-than-normal cloud cover.
The weather conditions witnessed in NSW meant the state was Australia’s best renewable energy generator for the month, providing 1,010 GWh of clean energy, including 518 GWh from utility PV and 492 GWh from wind.
Sydney-based Solcast, which was earlier this year acquired by Norwegian energy consultancy DNV, said its data-driven approach to monitoring solar helps its customers plan and later dispatch energy on demand, helping them get the most out of their assets.
The company claims it can produce more than 600 million new forecasts every hour in a cloud-based environment, and provide real-time access to forecast data with a five to fifteen-minute resolution via an application programming interface.
Solcast, which also has offices in Asia, Europe and the Americas, said its data is used by more than 300 companies managing over 150 GW of solar assets globally.

One of Australia’s biggest renewable energy transition investors, Quinbrook has invested an estimated $12.2 billion (USD 8.2 billion) in green energy infrastructure assets since the early 1990s, delivering 19.5 GW of power supply capacity but managing partner and co-founder David Scaysbrook said this transaction marks its first foray into biofuels.
“Quinbrook is really excited to be moving into such a high-growth and important sector that desperately needs more sustainable solutions that convert organic food waste into renewable power and biogas,” he said.
“The demand for renewable fuels is exploding and in PurposeEnergy we have found a highly capable technical and operational team that have been in business over a decade, delivering impactful solutions for customers and the environment.”
“Now is the right time for us to scale this business to realise its full potential.”
Quinbrook said the food industry is an attractive sector for investment as it sees enormous growth opportunities. The company said the industry is under growing pressure to enforce more stringent environmental regulations, while there is a critical need for more sustainable solutions for growing food waste and the acute demand for renewable fuels across the board.
Headquartered in New Hampshire, PurposeEnergy uses technologies including its own developed and patented proprietary methods to convert organic waste streams into biogas and renewable natural gas that is sold to customers under long-term contracts.
Founded in 2007, PurposeEnergy has developed, designed and built seven projects that convert organic waste streams to biogas and renewable electricity, providing sustainable energy solutions for the food and beverage companies.
The renewable gas producer, which also works with dairies and depacking operations to convert organic waste streams to energy, has another project currently under construction and expects to start work on two more facilities later this year.
PurposeEnergy Founder and Chief Executive Officer Eric Fitch said Quinbrook’s acquisition of the company will deliver the capital resources and additional strategic relationships needed to support the rapid scale up of the company’s technology, helping it to meet the growing demand for renewable fuels.
“The investment by Quinbrook will greatly expand our ability to identify, finance, build and operate new projects,” he said.

Indonesian state-owned utility PT PLN has started running a new floating PV plant in the Tambak Lorok area in the Indonesian coastal city of Semarang. With a peak capacity of 562 kW, the Tambak Lorok plant is operated by PLN subsidiary PLN Indonesia Power (PLN IP). PLN claims the installation is Indonesia’s largest floating solar array to date.
The floating plant is part of a larger 920 kW PV project under construction at the site of the Gas and Steam Power Generation Complex, which is operated by the company’s PLN IP Semarang Power Generation Unit. Built by PLN IP and its PT Indo Energi Hijau subsidiary, the floating PV plant was constructed over an eight-month period on a pond measuring 1 hectare. The company claims the plant will produce 1.4 million kWh a year, helping to reduce CO2 gas emissions by up to 1,304 tons.
PLN has already undertaken a number of initiatives to achieve that goal, such as the phase-out of coal-fired power plants, said PLN Managing Director Darmawan Prasodjo. Instead, PLN has started building new renewable energy plants. The company’s main strategy is shifting away from fossil-based generators to renewable energy-powered generators, he added.
The floating PV array is also part of the group’s efforts to optimize potential land that can be integrated with renewable energy generation.
PLN IP recently said that it is looking for potential investment partners for its Proyek Hijaunesia 2023 project. The plan includes several large-scale ground-mounted and floating solar plants, as well as wind farms.
