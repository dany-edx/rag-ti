Kesterite is one of the most promising light absorber materials for next generation of thin-film solar cells. However, it has so far found limited applications only at the research level, where efficiencies have languished around the 10% mark.
Kesterites are comprised of abundant elements, most commonly copper, tin, zinc and selenium. Unlike copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) compounds that already represent a small share of PV manufacturing, all of these materials have well-established supply chains that could absorb some extra demand from the solar industry without major issue.
With this in mind, a group of researchers at Fuzhou University in China has developed a flexible bifacial kesterite (CZTSSe) PV device, which it says is suitable for applications in indoor and outer space photovoltaics.
The kesterite cell has a symmetrical configuration, with the same structure and morphology on either side. Both front and back cell stacks are deposited on molybdenum (Mo) foil. Each cell has an active area of 0.21 cm2 and is built with an electrode made of molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), a CZTSSe layer, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, a zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, a transparent conducting coating of indium-tin-oxide (ITO), and silver (Ag).
In order to decrease manufacturing costs, the research group decided to deposit the same layers on two sides of the foil through a cyclic spin-coating method. “The spin-coating and annealing process are repeated nine times by alternating on front and back sides to obtain double-sided prefabricated CZTSSe films,” it explained. The CdS layers were deposited by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The manufacturing process also included a selenisation treatment and vacuum methods for sputtering and evaporation.
The bifacial solar cell achieved an efficiency of 9.3% on the front side, with an open-circuit voltage of 436 mV, a short-circuit current of 33.76 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 63.2%. As for the backside, the cell reached a power conversion efficiency of 9.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 434 mV, a short-circuit current of 33.7 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 61.7%. “Under weak LED light illuminations with 1.5–18.5 mW/cm2 intensities, the devices also show good performance of 6–8.8% efficiency,” the researchers stated.
The unencapsulated cell was put in an ageing box under continuous illumination with a standard “one sun” intensity for several days, and tested once a day. After 14 days of testing, the device showed degradation of less than 5% from its initial performance.
The bifacial PV device, according to its creators, can be bent and stretched without compromising its power conversion efficiency. The two cells are able to independently work at different illuminations and jointly output current by parallel circuit. “The bifacial device could directly utilize all-directional lights and produce periodically variable currents by substrate rotation,” the scientists concluded. “The investigations of bifacial flexible CZTSSe solar cells provide a new prospect for indoor ornament integrated photovoltaics.”
The device was described in the paper Novel symmetrical bifacial flexible CZTSSe thin film solar cells for indoor photovoltaic applications, published in nature communications.

While there are eight major suppliers of solar trackers in Australia, the market is dominated by just two companies, Nextracker and Array Technologies (ATI).
The market’s concentration is largely due to the loyalty of engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors, which typically use just one or two tracking device suppliers, according to analysis from Rystad Energy RenewableCube. “Of the top 15 utility PV EPCs, only two companies (Sterling & Wilson and Biosar) have used more than two tracking manufacturers,” analysts in Rystad’s Australian renewables team, David Dixon, Sushma Jagannath, and Gero Farruggio said in the tracker market review report.
Rystad Energy RenewableCube
“Six EPCs, representing 2.1 GW AC of capacity, have only ever worked with one tracker provider. These include PCL, Beon and Elecnor with Nextracker, Gransolar with PVH, and Risen and Shanghai Electric with Arctech.”
Of the two dominating companies, Nextracker and Array Technologies – both headquartered in the United States – Nextracker has proven to be an enduring frontrunner, controlling the Australian market for the past five years.
Nextracker has either supplied or committed to supply around 4 GW AC of capacity for 79 assets in every Australian states except Tasmania. The company is the only tracking provider to have surpassed 3 GW AC of utility PV projects in Australia.
Rystad Energy RenewableCube
Australia’s second biggest player, Array Technologies, has supplied around 1.9 GWAC of capacity for 27 assets, Rystad found.
Just one Chinese tracker supplier, Arctech, has won utility PV projects in Australia and only a single German supplier, Ideematec, made it into Rystad’s top eight tracker supplier list.
As Australia’s National Electricity Market fills up with solar, Rystad predicts the number of utility-scale assets starting construction will drop in the short term. This will compel suppliers to look to the off grid space in Pilbara, North West Australia. “Fortescue, Rio and BHP are likely to be the largest customers. However, the north west coast of Australia will be challenging for any supplier, given that it is a high speed wind region,” the report noted.
Western Australia, especially the state’s lucrative mining sector, is installing off-grid hybrid solar systems at a cracking pace. Many of Australia’s rural communities and industries still run on diesel generators, but Western Australia has been leading the country in its rollout of renewable hybrid systems to replace these carbon-intensive systems.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/02/how-the-nem-works-and-why-nsws-commission-is-calling-for-reforms/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 2, 2021",How the NEM works and why NSW’s commission is calling for reforms,"After three years of consultations, the Productivity Commissioner, Peter Achterstraat, and NSW Treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, have published the White Paper report, outlining pathways to improve living standards for the state’s citizens and reduce debt without additional taxation.
Energy and water policy were both points of focus in the 371-page report, which lays out the history of Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) and where its framework has failed to serve Australia’s most populace state, New South Wales (NSW).
Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) is a wholesale market covering New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory. When it was established by the states in 1998, they separated electricity conglomerates into individual entities dealing with generation, transmission, distribution, and retailing.
As the NEM was created, so too were the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC), to make rules for the NEM; the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), to operate the NEM; and the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), to enforce the NEM’s rules, including those determining how much revenue transmission and distribution network companies can earn.

In reality, the NEM consists of two markets: a spot market where generators competitively bid to supply power at any point in time, and a contract market in which retailers and generators make deals to supply power over longer periods, around one to three years on average.
“In New South Wales, generation and retail were privatised and the transmission network company TransGrid became the subject of a 99-year lease. The state is a minority shareholder in metropolitan distribution businesses, with only regional distribution assets remaining completely in government hands,” the report, titled ‘Rebooting the economy,’ reads.
“The NEM initially delivered stable retail prices [in NSW]… but unanticipated challenges prompted ad hoc and costly interventions and, from 2007-08, prices started to rise significantly. Other interventions imposed additional costs that pushed retail prices higher still.

“Recently, prices have moderated. But consumers continue to feel the impact of the earlier actions,” the report reads. As of 2021, retail electricity prices in Sydney are 228% higher than when the NEM was established, compared to an increase in Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 74% over the same period.
The White Paper strategically highlights this price hike in the state before turning to the NEM’s generation reliability standards, which were introduced following the 2016 South Australian blackout. This standard, the paper argues, has pushed up prices even further.  “Reliability of electricity is important but this cannot come at a disproportionate cost.”
“Owners of generation, transmission, and distribution assets need to invest to comply with New South Wales and national reliability standards. There are signs that these standards demand more reliability than energy consumers are willing to pay for.”

The report cites research which suggests customers worry more about the price they pay for electricity than about its reliability. “In 2018, about 70 per cent of customers were happy with the reliability of their electricity, but only about 40 per cent were happy with overall value for money.”
Stemming from this, the White Paper recommends NSW policy be developed and implemented within the NEM’s governance structure to ensure there is less duplications of state and national reliability measures. “The NSW Electricity Strategy commits the Government to review the National Electricity Law and Rules to identify national regulatory burdens that can be removed, streamlined, or clarified,” it concludes.
Importantly, Australia’s Energy Security Board, which consists of AEMC and AER chairs, AEMO’s chief executive, together with an independent chair and deputy chair, is in the process of finalising its redesign on Australia’s NEM. Presumably while significant changes in the markets structure unfold on a national level, areas of shortcomings in the states could be addressed more readily.
The White Paper also criticises the Commonwealth or federal government’s lack of interest in imposing a clear 2050 reductions target. “Instead, Australia is now attempting to reach net zero using a series of uncoordinated and inefficient state and territory policies.”
“The most efficient policy to meet the net zero aim would be to put a price on carbon… but the lack of Commonwealth support means that for a national mechanism to be achieved, the states and territories would need to coordinate among themselves.”
The paper recommends, therefore, investigating “new and innovative approaches to improve electricity pricing and achieve the NSW Government’s 2050 target of net zero emissions.”
Among its other energy recommendation, the White Paper, which follows on from the state’s Green Paper published in August 2020, calls for a lift on the ban of  nuclear electricity generation for small modular reactors, improved land use regulation and manage demand for gas and a streamlining of energy subsidies.

The White Paper focuses heavily on water, which is a particularly sensitive issue in NSW which has suffered a series of major droughts in the past decades, with a number of regional towns literally running out of water in 2019.
The Commission recommends the state government, which has been severely criticised over its water management, set a long-term vision and plan for the sector as well as engaging the public on the benefits of purified recycled water for drinking and explore investments that demonstrate and built trust in the recycling process. It also recommends water be managed in ways which “maximises benefits for the community.”
Issues around water and social license have come acutely into focus recently in Australia as the country’s hydrogen plans ramp up. Water is an essential component of hydrogen production. While the amount of water needed for hydrogen production is far less than mine sites use, given the industry’s novelty and the highly politicised nature of renewable energy in the country, many have forecast that issues around water use and social license should be anticipated by the burgeoning green hydrogen industry.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/02/10-million-reasons-why-we-need-to-talk-about-nem-generator-operations/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 2, 2021",10 million reasons why we need to talk about NEM generator operations,"From Watt Clarity 
From January 29th this year the limits on the civil penalty that can apply to generators increased one hundredfold.  The new regime has 3 tiers with the maximum for Tier 1 breaches now raised to $10M or more for large companies or $500,000 for an individual.

There cannot be many industries where the maximum penalties for not following the operating rules increase so dramatically in one step.  It seems an acknowledgment that the previous penalties were not sufficient a deterrent and one might surmise that some generators have not been taking the rules seriously enough to date.  Indeed the AER says it expects the new penalty regime to:
“incentivise energy businesses to devote greater effort to comply with laws…”.
Tier 1 penalties cover four different concepts but one is highly relevant to a registered generator –where they breach a provision that is necessary to ensure ‘supply security and reliability’.  This could include: ‘reliability of the system…AEMO ability to plan and operate the power system…no interruptions…avoidance/prevention of large-scale events, such as black systems and security of electricity supply’.
Note that these phrases relate not to the common woe that is the connection process – which will typically take 1-5 years, but about what happens after connection – which should last 15-25 years i.e. power system and trading operations.
To know how this concept and these penalties affect generators, one can turn to the rules that govern them – the National Electricity Rules or NER.  Helpfully, the clauses in the NER that attract these civil penalties are specifically annotated within the text.
Chapter 3 contains the Market Rules and has over 75 such references and Chapter 4 covers Power System Security – the very concept that Tier 1 ‘supply and security reliability’ points to.  This makes it very easy to draw a clear line from any specific obligation in the NER to a potential and now very high civil penalty.
Before going further it’s worth highlighting that these functions are less about the operation and maintenance that a contractor might do with inverters or turbines.  Whilst there is a link, these rules are more about the effect of that work at an asset level and how that affects the NEM.  You might say this is more about the NEM side of the substation rather than the farm side.
Whilst there are many important NER obligations that come with penalties, key real-time clauses that seem to fall squarely into this $10m Tier 1 penalty category include:
The need to follow dispatch instructions gets more than one mention[2] and it should be easy to understand why breaches of this obligation attract a civil penalty. A dispatch instruction is AEMO telling a generator – every five minutes, what output it should produce after taking into account the generators financial offer, its forecast production and a variety of demand and system strength factors.
The output of all generators must therefore be reasonably predictable for AEMO to keep the power system in balance so any ‘rogue’ generator that is not following its forecast or its instruction – for whatever reason – clearly becomes a risk to supply security and reliability for everyone.
These types of failures also create the public AEMO non-conformance notices that watchers of the NEM may see from time to time.  The rule change of 11 March this year for semi-scheduled generator dispatch obligations was also about the need for predictable output – to quote the AER again, it intended to stop ‘semi scheduled generators turning off without instruction from the market operator.’
So, irrespective of whether previous deviations were deliberate or by accident, the need to follow dispatch instructions just got more important!
Whilst following dispatch instructions will be an automated function for well-designed and maintained equipment, participants must still be contactable 24×7 by AEMO.  All registered participants declared they met this requirement in their registration submission but as people and arrangements change, these new civil penalties make it even more important to keep those personnel details up to date.
Participants should also remember that the people nominated must be skilled and equipped to understand and comply with whatever instruction or query AEMO might have.  The AEMO Registration Guide further states that “only Australian phone numbers are acceptable and all personnel must be based in Australia”.  Clearly access to plant control hardware and regular training on Australian energy market rules needs to be part of making this happen successfully.  As for acting ‘immediately’, we understand that actions should be taken ideally within 10 and at most within 30 minutes of the request.
Perhaps this is the strongest signal yet that handing a mobile phone around inexperienced staff – hoping they’re not in the swimming pool when the call comes (because market events never happen when it’s really hot?) and hoping they always have their laptop to hand, or directing calls to an overseas centre who know nothing about the NER, will clearly not be well regarded by the AER.
A small number of participants new to the power sector may question why a wind or solar farm should be concerned with this kind of obligation – particularly a solar farm at night; don’t these rules apply just to the big thermal generators?  The simple answer is no, the rules make it crystal clear that this obligation is not confined just to the business day.  But why?
Considering the solar farm participant, even in the dead of night the power electronics of the farm can be making an important contribution with their reactive power to keep the voltages of the network correct – in order to (here’s that phrase again) ‘maintain supply security and reliability’.
If AEMO needs to adjust how the solar farm delivers that service they may well need to talk to the solar farm operator – and may well give them a verbal dispatch instruction.  As the reluctant owners of many new syncons have come to appreciate, it’s not just about the megawatts and if it’s not just about the megawatts then it’s not just about when the farm is producing – it’s actually all the time.
Secondly, as penetration of wind and solar increases, as wind and solar generators become larger and when they connect to ever more congested lines on the network, these generators are moving from the periphery of our supply to becoming key contributors to that security and reliability of our system. With increased penetration comes increased responsibility.
Finally, it’s probably important to highlight that most of the functions of Chapters 3 and 4 – monitoring compliance with dispatch targets, addressing deviations, controlling plant, talking to AEMO and the NSPs and so on, aren’t about rebidding and can’t be done by software.
The QED observations about the increasing prevalence of algorithmic bidding software focussed simply on the volume of rebidding.  Rebidding clearly has a valuable role to play in maximising commercial outcomes for a wind or solar plant but, given these massive increases in civil penalties perhaps effort should first be devoted to complying with the operating laws before avoiding a negative price.
For generators who do actively rebid, the NER has some key clauses on the subject and breaching them would also probably attract Tier 1 civil penalties.  If you look at rebid records – and these are publicly available, there are still some solar and wind generators who have yet to actively rebid and some occasional rebids seem unlikely to comply with the NER.  The AER seem to be signalling here that generators who rebid must devote sufficient effort to understand what they are doing – irrespective of whether that is by a human or by software.
The regulator wants participants in the NEM to devote greater effort to their operations; the regulator has sent a signal by massively increasing civil penalties for failing to do so – and told business this is a signal to incentivise them.  It does not get much clearer.
Whilst active bidding for commercial reasons is valuable, it is only one of many elements needed for compliant and successful operations.
It will be interesting to see, when projects update their risk registers, whether increasing the ‘possible impact’ figure for ‘failure to respond to an instruction from AEMO’ from $100k to $10M will have the effect that the AER hopes for.
$10M … who signed that registration form again?

During last week’s Australian Energy Week, the agency’s chief executive, Darren Miller, gave a speech in which he upped the ante in terms of where Australia’s renewable energy generation should be aiming – which he says should be “five to ten times more than is supplied by our electricity system today.”
“This electricity will not only be used to provide zero emissions lighting, heating and cooling to our homes and businesses, but will be used to power our transport and heavy industry — either directly or through the production of hydrogen,” Miller wrote in a LinkedIn post which was adapted from the speech.
“With the right mix of storage and peaking technologies, transmission and interconnection, and demand side flexibility, we can get to a scale that allows Australia to transform our domestic economy and supply clean energy to other countries without the same natural resources.”
His sentiments were similar to those expressed by his colleague Matt Walden, ARENA’s Director of Business Development and Transactions, who spoke at the Australian Hydrogen Conference in Sydney last Wednesday. There Walden described hydrogen as front and centre of the agency’s investments, with both men framing hydrogen as an ideal medium for Australia to export its surplus clean power.

Global Head of Industry and Building Decarbonisation at Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), Kobad Bhavnagri, said at the same conference, however, that the economics of Australia’s hydrogen export market remain “poor” due to the high cost of transport coupled with the costs of processing hydrogen at each end (for example “cracking” ammonia molecules to turn them back into pure hydrogen).
Be that as it may, superpowers like Germany remain undeterred, eager to pursue close alliances with Australia, seeing it as one of the most promising, if not the most promising, hydrogen suppliers globally. In fact, Chief Executive of the German–Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Christoph von Speßhardt, commented on Darren Miller’s ambitious vision saying: “Australia can become the clean energy superpower – and make “shipping the sunshine” a very profitable reality!”

Miller also noted that solar PERC cells, invented by Australian researchers, “are now the dominant PV technology globally with over 90 per cent of global manufacturing having switched to PERC cell technology.” Drawing on this history of leading renewable energy technology, Miller extended it to what’s poised to be the new frontier: green hydrogen.
ARENA’s Director of Business Development, Matt Walden, also drew on this history of innovation at the Hydrogen Conference, saying that he wants to see Australia not only exporting clean energy but also its intellectual property. If we’re able to accelerate research and development into new technologies and processes today, he outlined, we will be at the global forefront when 2040 rolls around.

The round, launched late last year by the developer of the Maverick rapidly deployable modular solar solution, was designed to drive 5B’s global expansion plans. 5B said the round finished in April 2021, “fully funded and over subscribed.” 
The round also saw some bigwigs throw their support behind the company, including Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Smart Energy Council Director, Simon Holmes à Court.

5B said in a statement that existing investors were the dominant form of support however, particularly U.S. utility giant AES Corporation, which contributed $12 million in 5B’s first series of fundraising, as well as alternate investment fund Artesian Venture Capital, and Startmate & Eytan Lenko (Beyond Zero Emissions Chairperson). 
These investors from 5B’s Series A fundraising effort in mid-2020 were no doubt encouraged by the company’s progress, including a 2 MW contribution to AES Panamá’s as part of the Central American subsidiary’s plans for four solar farms with a combined capacity of 40 MW. 5B, which has signed a 100 MW global services and supply agreement with AES, deployed the 2 MW installment in 10 working days. 
Moreover, there is 5B’s first 10 MW+ project which it delivered with Enerven for SA Water, as well as another 12 MW project in Adelaide. And, of course, 5B has long been the preferred technology for Sun Cable’s 10 GW solar project in the Northern Territory. 
5B CEO and Co-founder, Chris McGrath, said in a statement that “We are at the cusp of what will arguably be the next industrial revolution for the world, driven by ultra low-cost, massively abundant clean energy from solar PV. The only remaining question is not, if, but how quickly, we will achieve this.” The support of investors, McGrath continued, enables 5B “to keep running as hard and fast as we all need to be together to realise this future.” 
Noted renewable energy advocate, former Australian Prime Minister, and relatively new Chairman of Australian Fortescue Future Industries, Malcolm Turnbull, said that 5B “is one of the most innovative Australian clean energy companies. Their Maverick technology is the keystone to unlocking the next generation of clean energy at the scale required to urgently address climate change.” 
5B said that the Pre-Series B funding would go toward building its already 100+ strong team, as well as a clean energy campus at its Sydney-headquarters, and to accelerate the release of its next generation of Maverick products. What is more, 5B is keen to accelerate its global expansion too, particularly to the U.S., Chile and India.

Now the program is being expanded to allow for low-income SA households not suitable for solar to participate in the Tesla battery scheme. Of course, SA’s problem is now an oversupply of solar at certain times of the day, so the more batteries in the system, the more that supply can be spread out. 
The ABC reports that SA Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan is trialling this variant scheme in which 20 housing trust homes that were not suitable for solar (perhaps because of tree shading, or a rooftop facing in sub-par direction, or the roof itself being structurally unsuitable for solar), will now be offered a free Tesla battery. 

The ABC spoke to one Munno Para resident who had was not able to participate in the solar VPP but took the offer of the Tesla battery and reckons her participation in the VPP scheme has made a “big change” in her energy bills. 
The existing scheme has also been expanded from the original 3,000 to a total of 4,100, which still leaves a lot to be desired for the original VPP dream of 50,000. 
Minister van Holst Pellekaan wants to stress that even having a battery without solar can contribute savings when participating in the VPP scheme. “We can find that a battery alone, as part of the Tesla VPP, can still deliver 29% savings on electricity prices that other housing trust and public housing homes are receiving,” he told the ABC.

Rainer Sedlmaier from Nauheim near Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was concerned that his son’s rooftop PV system could have been damaged by the presence of pigeons, which sometimes can make their nests right under the modules.
Sedlmaier did not observe any issues with pigeons in his own photovoltaic system or that of his neighbours, as the inclination of the roofs was between 35% and 45%. In the case of his son, however, the roof inclination was only 20%, which means pigeons will have no problems nesting there.
To prevent pigeons from reaching the array, Sedlmaier applied rotating brushes with a diameter of 12 cm to the PV system frames and this solution, according to him, make the pigeons reluctant to approach the installation.
He calculated that for an average rooftop PV system, these brushes may cost a total of between €100 (AU$157) and €200 (AU$315) and recommended installing the brushes when a project is being built, as a retrofit may be more complex.
Brooding pigeons under the modules are particularly problematic because they can contaminate the systems with their aggressive droppings. Once they have nested there, they will be happy to come back, as these birds are loyal to their area. And they come back often because they breed several times a year.

Module manufacturing is expanding rapidly, and manufacturers are looking to quickly adapt to demand for products with higher power ratings, and the switch to larger wafer formats.
While many of these changes promise significant advantages in terms of producing more power at lower cost, the products headed out to the field now are quite different to older modules, and reliability concerns are front and center for buyers, and laboratory testing will be key to spotting any issues.
PV Evolution Labs (PVEL) has put hundreds of modules through their paces in its Product Qualification Program (PQP), a sequence of production monitoring and testing that aims to reveal any weaknesses in a module that could result in failure or performance loss once installed in the field. The results are published in the seventh edition of PVEL’s module reliability scorecard.
The report names 117 products from 26 manufacturers as “top performers” in the various testing categories. However, it also notes an increase in failures – 26% of bills of materials included in this years’ scorecard had at least one failure during the testing sequence, compared with 20% in 2020.
“An unprecedented expansion of PV module manufacturing capacity is underway. New factories and production lines are vital as demand for solar power soars, but buyers must be vigilant to avoid the risks inherent to rapid growth,” commented Jenya Meydbray, PVEL CEO. “The preventable safety failures observed in this year’s Scorecard underscore the complex challenges that manufacturers face as they race to meet demand in a highly dynamic global market.”
PVEL notes that while it has tested more than 450 module bills of material to its PQP standard, only those that achieved ‘top performer’ are named in the report.
Among the reports’ key findings is that one in three manufacturers products saw failures in the junction box – including poor sealing of the lid, leakages in the junction box adhesive and junction box bypass diode failures – and that many of these occurred “out of the box” before PVEL had even begun testing of the modules.
With this in mind, the report notes that junction box quality may be something that’s frequently overlooked during manufacturing. They also note that this is one of the last stages in module production that is still most often carried out manually by factory operators, and has seen significant changes with new module designs. “A possible cause of increased failures is that some junction box production steps are difficult to automate. Junction boxes are usually installed and sealed manually, even in state-of-the-art factories where other processes are automated,” states the report. “Further, before 2018 one junction box per module was typically installed. Most modern modules contain three junction boxes to accommodate the electrical properties of half-cut cells, and precise placement is required so as not to shade cells. Imprecise handiwork in this process can result in defects.“
Aside from junction boxes, PVEL noted that the largest number of failures occurred during its mechanical stress sequences which were newly added to the PQP sequence to simulate extreme weather conditions in the field.
And as far as avoiding failures in the field goes, PVEL advises the industry to keep doing extensive testing, and for buyers to be specific about the bill of materials in a module, and only purchase those that have been tested. “From glass to junction box, PVEL’s latest Scorecard again demonstrates that the quality of a PV module depends in part upon the materials it contains –yet many buyers never request BOM details from suppliers,” said PVEL’s Chief Commercial Officer Tara Doyle. “Between supply chain instability and the ever-present push for lower prices, one cannot assume that every module sold under a given model type uses tested BOM components. Buyers must specify their desired BOM in supply contracts to achieve this.”
