Having already unveiled plans for a microgrid system at almond farm Cadell Orchards in 2022, Australian Farmland Services (AFS) confirmed it will partner with AGL Energy (AGL) on renewable systems at two of its other sites in southwest New South Wales. 
Construction at Cadell Orchards began last week. The 1,690ha almond orchard is currently not connected to the grid, with irrigation from electric pumps powered solely by diesel generators. 
The microgrid system at Cadell will be built, owned and operated by AGL under a 20-year power purchasing agreement. It features a 4.9 MW tracking solar array, a 5.4 MWh battery system and 7km of new underground powerlines.  
In addition to Cadell, AGL will also construct a 6.5 MW solar array and 5.1 MWh storage system will be built at nearby Canally Orchards. Like Cadell, the 2,500ha Canally site also uses 100% diesel to power its irrigation. 
AGL said the microgrid system will cut the two farms’ combined Scope 1 CO2 emissions by 10,900 tonnes over the course of the power purchasing agreement. 
The energy gen-tailer will also explore the possibility of using excess solar from Canally to power trucks and agricultural vehicles transporting produce to nearby processing facilities. 
AFS chief executive officer David Armstrong said the microgrid systems will drastically reduce the two farms’ reliance on diesel. 
“We are working closely with AGL as they design, build and operate the solar-powered microgrid at Cadell Orchards and Canally Orchards and deliver the almond farms an 85 percent reduction in diesel fuel, slashing our emissions and providing substantial cost savings each year,” he said. 
“As one of the largest employers in the region, these renewable energy projects provide our businesses with greater energy price certainty and better energy reliability so we can focus on producing Australian-grown almonds.” 
AGL will conduct a feasibility study at a third site, the Murray Downs Processing Plant, also located in the Riverina region. 
The study will design an onsite microgrid to power the almond processing facility using the “lowest cost” mix of available grid energy, solar and diesel to provide energy stability. 
Results of the study are expected to be complete by the end of the year. 
“AGL has been working with AFS to model energy usage and to design an integrated and innovative renewable energy system to lower their costs and meet their future needs across Cadell Orchards, Canally Orchards and Murray Downs Processing Plant,” said Jo Egan, AGL’s Chief Customer Officer. 
“We are excited to support AFS achieve their sustainability goals and work together to complete three large renewable energy projects in the Riverina community.” 
“Our partnership is testament to the great work we are doing in partnering with businesses to provide tailored energy solutions and support our customers to decarbonise the way they live, move and work.” 
Australia’s almond industry has expanded by more than 200% in the past decade, and the country is now the second-largest almond exporter in the world behind the US. 
With many farms situated in close proximity to the Murray-Darling Basin, the industry has faced scrutiny because of its heavy reliance on water for irrigation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/18/clearvue-releases-results-from-first-long-term-study-of-clear-solar-glass/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",TRISTAN RAYNER,"AUGUST 18, 2023",ClearVue releases results from first long-term study of clear solar glass,"Perth-based ClearVue is claiming a win, with its clear solar windows delivering positive peer-reviewed results following a two-year study. 
The ASX-listed West Australian company notes that its fully transparent solar windows, set up in a BIPV construction for a greenhouse at Murdoch University in Perth, delivered 19 kWh/day, offsetting nearly 40% of energy costs. In addition, the windows performed through all conditions, and occasionally outperformed traditional PV modules during periods f rain, including installation across a range of angles, and in dusty areas. The paper, titled ‘Field Performance Monitoring of Energy-Generating High-Transparency Agrivoltaic Glass Windows’ was published in MDPI’s Technologies journal.
ClearVue specialises in solar windows that allow up to 70% of visible light transmission through optically clear glass, simultaneously harnessing the entire spectrum of light, including UV rays. A noteworthy aspect of these windows involves directing long-wavelength light to the window’s edge, where solar panels capture the energy.
While the paper does not extensively emphasise the overall window efficiency, it highlights that each window, measuring 1.2m by 1.1m, produced a range of 30–33 Wp per square metre. The paper calls for additional research to better ClearVue’s latest iteration boasts improvements such as reduced weight, enhanced thinness, accelerated manufacturing capabilities, and higher efficiency approaching 5% overall.
Now as a proven technology, following decades of attempts to make conforming products over the years, ClearVue has an advantage with a scalable and mass-produced product, sized to industry standards, and has reached a second-generation BIPV glass window product following research and development progress.
This peer-reviewed data substantiates ClearVue’s aspirations. As a publicly listed entity, the company continues to provide investors with quarterly and occasional updates regarding revenue, income, and outflows incurred due to ongoing investments in technology and customer acquisition. The company posted a $2 million loss without revenue in the last reported quarter, with just over $5.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Aside from R&D efforts and revenues from customers, a $2 million grant was awarded in May 2023 for the local manufacturing of its core technology, providing a boost outside of sales.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/18/flexible-indoor-perovskite-solar-cell-achieves-32-5-efficiency/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ITALY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 18, 2023",Flexible indoor perovskite solar cell achieves 32.5% efficiency,"Scientists at the University of Rome Tor Vergata have developed a perovskite solar cell for indoor applications such as autonomous wireless sensors, low-power consumer electronics, smart homes, domotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
“All these elements require efficient and easy-to-integrate energy harvesting devices to power them,” researcher Thomas M. Brown told pv magazine. “Indoor photovoltaic power sources, on ultra-thin bendable substrates, will have the potential to facilitate these technological innovations if they can provide sufficient energy under indoor illumination rather than the sun.”
The research team built the cell with a substrate made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
“Compared to other plastic substrates such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), PET offers greater UV durability and is six times more cost-effective,” Brown explained. “These qualities position it as the transparent polymer substrate of choice for plastic electronics.”
The researchers constructed the cell using a sequence of layers, including a PET substrate, an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL), a perovskite absorber, a tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) layer, a Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer (HTL), and a top electrode made of gold (Au).
The incorporation of TBAB atop the 3D perovskite matrix helped to reduce defect density and enhance the stability of the overall bulk 3D perovskite structure.
“This, in turn, reduces trap-assisted recombination which is critical for efficient carrier collection in indoor low-light conditions since the photogeneration rate of carriers is low,” the researchers said. “The overall result is a considerable enhancement in device performance.”
Tested under standard illumination conditions, the cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 32.5%. It also maintained more than 80% of its initial efficiency after 1,000 bending cycles.
“The resulting PV cell has 1.4 times higher carrier lifetime, one order of magnitude lower leakage currents, and 3 times lower defect densities, suppressing recombination,” the group stated.
The researchers described the solar cell in “Highly Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells on Polyethylene Terephthalate Films via Dual Halide and Low-Dimensional Interface Engineering for Indoor Photovoltaics,” which was recently published in RRL Solar. The research team includes scientists from the University of Guilan in Iran, GreatCell Solar Italia, the Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy (CHOSE), the Institute of Crystallography (IC-CNR), the Institute of Nanotechnology (CNR NANOTEC), and the University of Salento.
