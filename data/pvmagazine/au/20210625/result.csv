In its Quarterly Carbon Market Report for Q1 2021, the CER said small-scale rooftop solar installations in Q1 reached 101,000, up 18,000 on the same time last year while the average system size grew from 7.5 kW to 7.8 kW over the same period.
CER chair David Parker said if the momentum continues, the amount of small-scale rooftop PV installed during 2021 will reach between 3.5 and 4 GW.
This combined with an additional 300 to 325 MW of mid-scale rooftop capacity could take the total capacity of new rooftop solar beyond 4 GW in 2021, a significant increase on the 3 GW forecast at the end of the December quarter.
“Rooftop solar has continued to show strong growth in Quarter 1 2021 with 792 MW installed – a 28% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020,” he said.
“We expect the combined capacity of rooftop solar across small and mid-scale installations could exceed 4 GW capacity in 2021.”
The combined total of rooftop solar, encompassing 1 kW through to 5 MW systems, equalled 13.8 GW of renewable capacity by the end of 2020 and the CER said the mix of available incentives, and low technology costs, suggests the high install rates are likely to continue over the near term, driving Australia’s rooftop solar capacity beyond 30 GW within four years.
“With an upper bound estimate of 4 GW of added capacity for 2021, and no sign of decreasing rooftop solar growth, Australia could add another 20 GW of rooftop solar by 2025,” it says in the report.
The CER said the predicted growth means changes to how the national electricity grid and market operate will be needed to provide grid security.
“In a system rapidly changing with high penetration of renewables, multiple approaches are needed to ensure grid stability,” the report says.

The Australian Energy Market Commission is already exploring various rule changes aimed at supporting stability and more efficient integration of distributed energy resources (DER) in the grid.
These include new minimum technical standards for rooftop solar to help manage voltage disturbance and pricing reforms related to export of electricity to the grid.
The CER said new approaches that recognise and monetise benefits, wherever they appear in the system – at the distribution or transmission network level – are also needed to underpin new investments.
While small-scale solar continued to flourish, a modest 19 MW of large-scale renewable energy projects reached financial close during the quarter.
Despite the slowdown, Parker said the outlook for utility scale generation remains positive and said it was too early to label it an ‘investment stall’ as some are doing.
“While the number of projects reaching financial close this quarter was modest, the pipeline of large-scale projects with a power purchase agreement (PPA), which are a leading indicator, reached a record 3.7 GW over Quarter 1 2021. This suggests that investment in 2021 and beyond should remain strong,” he said.
The CER said a record level of capacity in the PPA category indicates that between 2 and 3 GW of capacity can still reach financial close in 2021.
The CER said 39 power stations, with a cumulative capacity of 165 MW, were accredited in Q1 2021, down on the 698 MW for the same period last year.
The largest of these is Spanish developer Fotowatio Renewable Ventures’ 100 MW Winton Solar Farm near Benalla in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/25/cramming-cities-full-of-electric-vehicles-means-were-still-depending-on-cars-and-thats-a-huge-problem/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 25, 2021",Cramming cities full of electric vehicles means we’re still depending on cars — and that’s a huge problem,"From The Conversation
Given the transport sector is Australia’s second-largest polluter, it’s a good thing Australian governments are starting to plan for a transition to electric vehicles (EVs).
But transitioning from cities full of petrol-guzzling vehicles to cities full of electric ones won’t address all of the environmental and social problems associated with car dependence and mass manufacturing.
So, let’s look at these problems in more detail, and why public transport really is the best way forward.
EVs do have environmental advantages over conventional vehicles. In particular, they generate less carbon emissions during their lifetime. Of course, much of the emissions reductions will depend on how much electricity comes from renewable sources.
But carbon emissions are only one of the many problems associated with the dominance of private cars as a form of mobility in cities.

 
Let’s start with a few of the social issues. This includes the huge amount of space devoted to car driving and parking in our neighbourhoods. This can crowd out other forms of land use, including other more sustainable forms of mobility such as walking and cycling.
There are the financial and mental health costs of congestion, as well, with Australian city workers spending, on average, 66 minutes getting to and from work each day. Injuries and fatalities on roads are also increasing, and inactivity and isolation associated with driving can impact our physical health.
Car-dependent cities also contribute to disadvantage for people who don’t have access to cars, and uneven financial vulnerability associated with the high costs of car ownership and use.
Indeed, some of these problems could be made worse — for instance, subsidies for EVs could end up favouring wealthier people who can afford new cars.
A mass global uptake of EVs will generate major environmental problems, too. Most concerning of these is the use of finite mineral resources required for their construction, and the environmental and labour conditions of their extraction.
This was recently highlighted in a recent report by the International Energy Agency. As the agency’s executive director Fatih Birol said, there’s a
looming mismatch between the world’s strengthened climate ambitions and the availability of critical minerals that are essential to realising those ambitions.
Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper are key ingredients required to make EVs.
As the report noted, EVs use double the amount of copper than conventional vehicles. EVs also require considerable amounts of lithium, cobalt and graphite that are hardly required at all for conventional vehicles. And it expects demand for lithium to grow 40-fold between 2020 and 2040, driven by EV production to meet climate targets.

 
There is considerable discussion of Australia’s natural advantage as a supplier of some of these minerals, as we have large reserves of lithium and rare-earth metals beneath parts of the continent.
But before governments and mining bodies rush to exploit these reserves, they need to ensure much more is done to avoid the injustices perpetrated against Traditional Owners and their lands and heritage. The recent appalling destruction at Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto’s iron ore operation is just one example of this.
Mining also has its own environmental problems, such as land clearing and associated biodiversity loss, the pollution and contaminants it produces, and intensive water use.
The conditions of extracting these critical minerals in other parts of the world are dire. There’s the oppressive working conditions in cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the conflict over Indigenous rights in Chile’s lithium mining areas, and environmental destruction associated with mining rare earth minerals in China.
To focus on these problems is not to suggest the new policies on electric vehicles are unimportant, or that they don’t stand to have some positive environmental impact.
The point is private EVs are not a solution to the combined challenges of reducing our urban environmental footprints and making better cities for all, and they have their own problems.
Instead, we should develop a good mass public transport system with extensive and frequent coverage. Alongside urban development with a more even distribution of jobs, services and opportunities, investing in better public transport could reduce car dependence in our cities.
This would have a range of environmental and social benefits: making more space available for people instead of machines, extending the benefits of mobility to people who can’t or don’t drive, and reducing demand for finite minerals.

Even fossil-fuelled public transport has fewer emissions than conventional car travel. Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows the most fuel-efficient buses and trains generate less than half the carbon emissions per passenger kilometre of fuel-efficient cars. Of course, public transport powered by renewables will be even better.
But as things stand, we are far from having such a city. The benefits of good public transport and public services are unevenly distributed across our cities.
In Sydney, for example, there are significant investments in new public transport infrastructure in some parts of the city, such as Metro West and the recently completed North West Metro. There are welcome commitments to reduce emissions in that sector, too.
But we’re a long way from planning new developments and redevelopments to make public transport a viable alternative to cars. The lack of public transport infrastructure in newly constructed, master-planned estates on Sydney’s urban fringe is the most glaring example.
Ultimately, it’s important that a transition to electric vehicles doesn’t dominate the discussion we need to have about urban transport.
Our challenge is to simultaneously reduce the carbon footprint of different forms of transport, while also thinking much more broadly about the sustainability and justice of the system of mobility that’s so central to daily life in our cities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/25/sa-water-unveils-176-kw-install-as-part-of-300-million-solar-pv-plan/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 25, 2021",SA Water unveils 176 kW install as part of $300 million solar PV plan,"Government-owned utility SA Water has added to its renewable energy portfolio, unveiling two new solar PV arrays in the state’s southeast as it continues to roll out a $300 million renewable energy investment strategy which will see more than 500,000 solar modules and 34 MWh of energy storage installed at more than 30 sites across the state.
SA Water confirmed on Friday that two new arrays, comprising about 470 ground-mounted solar PV modules have been installed at its depot and wastewater pump station in Mount Gambier. The two new solar PV arrays became operational earlier this month and are expected to generate a combined 216 MWh of renewable energy each year.
SA Water’s senior manager of Zero Cost Energy Future Nicola Murphy said the Mt Gambier installations are among more than 30 solar PV arrays being installed at the utility’s wastewater treatment plants, pump stations and depots.
One of the largest renewable energy projects in the Australian water industry, SA Water’s zero cost energy future initiative will generate around 242 GWh of solar energy, along with 34 MWh of battery storage.
Murphy said the SA Water is one of South Australia’s biggest electricity consumers and is determined to cut its carbon emissions and reduce energy costs which reached $86 million in 2019-2020.
“We want to set an example of proactive environmental leadership, focused on sustainability and action on climate change, and these solar panels in the heart of Mount Gambier are terrific examples of how we can make a real difference in reducing carbon emissions to the tune of around 92 tonnes every year,” she said.
“To put this into perspective, this energy generation is the equivalent of powering approximately 36 South Australian homes for one year.”

Murphy said the Mount Gambier arrays are among more than 360,000 solar panels already in the ground at sites across South Australia, with all expected to be energised over the course of the year.
“Our team is busy getting our sites energised and connected to the national electricity grid ahead of the warmer, sunnier months, where the true benefits of this exciting project will come to the front,” she said.
SA Water’s latest installations are part of a flood of renewable energy projects that have been rolled out at water and wastewater facilities across the nation this month.
In New South Wales, state-owned utility Hunter Water confirmed that the installation of 1,200 solar modules at its Morpeth Wastewater Treatment Works had commenced.
The 600 kW system is part of a $15 million initiative to deliver more than 6 MW of solar within the next few years.
The work being done at Morpeth follows the earlier installation of a 252-panel solar array at Branxton Wastewater Treatment Works.
Hunter Water managing director Darren Cleary said the rollout would cut the organisation’s energy costs through onsite renewable generation and support its goal to be carbon neutral by 2030.

“Following the success of the solar pilot project at Branxton WWTW, we are now applying what we learned to roll out other projects across our region’s assets.
“Electricity is one of our major expenses, accounting for up to 10% of our operating costs, and solar is one of a number of opportunities available that can help us reduce both costs and carbon emissions.
“Once completed, we estimate the renewable energy project will deliver a 12% reduction in consumption per year and provide an annual saving of $1.15 million on our electricity costs.”
Victorian water corporation Central Highlands Water is also exploring renewable energy initiatives, announcing plans earlier this month to construct five large-scale solar installations.
In a statement, the utility said the new solar PV arrays will be installed at its Ballarat North and South wastewater treatment plants, Lal Lal and White Swan water treatment plants and the White Swan pump station.
Central Highlands Water said the solar initiative has the potential to deliver up to 40% of the utility’s total electricity load and reduce its overall energy costs by 20%.
In Darwin, the Shoal Bay Waste Management Facility is also looking to solar PV power to help reduce its electricity costs with a new 99 kW system now operational.
Council said the new rooftop solar system, which was switched on earlier this month, will provide a saving of about $34,000 per year, more than 50% of the site’s energy bill.

The motion calls for the ACT government to explore recycling options for a range of electrical appliances including solar PV modules, inverters and large batteries and for a report outlining options and a timeline to be presented to the Assembly by February 2022.
The motion, put forward on Wednesday by Greens MLA Jo Clay, will also seek to confirm which of the products will be covered by a product stewardship scheme to commence within the next 12 months.
Clay said solar PV uptake in the ACT is at an all-time high and a product stewardship scheme would place the onus for end-of-life recycling on the manufacturer or industry.
This is a really good way to recycle, as it means the producers have an incentive to design easy-to-recover material and it also means they include the cost of recycling in the original purchase price, Clay said.
Figures provided by the federal government show that 2,700 tonnes of solar PV waste was generated in Australia in 2018 as the earliest modules reached their end of life. By 2050 it is expected that figure will climb to 1,532,000 tonnes of PV waste annually.
“We need to make it simple to recycle solar panels, large batteries and electrical products,” Clay said.
“The Victorian government banned solar panels and e-waste from landfill in July 2019 and are leading the way on this nationally.
“This motion will pull the ACT in line with community expectations on recycling of electrical products. It is a necessary step in the ACT’s continued journey towards an environmentally sustainable future.”

The ACT government’s announcement came just hours after federal environment minister Sussan Ley informed the solar industry it needs to design and present a finalised industry-led product stewardship scheme by June 2022.
Following her speech in the National Press Club last week during which she said waste from solar systems looms as an environmental disaster, the minister announced on Tuesday the nationwide scheme must be operational by June 2023 and include an approach to deal with legacy panels.
Ley said previous submissions from sections of the industry to set up a scheme have lacked a cohesive, coordinated and sustainable approach that looked beyond initial support from the government.
“Solar panels have languished on the government’s priority list for six years now. It is time for the industry to step up and address the issue of waste either stockpiling or ending up in landfill, and today I have given them a deadline of mid-2022 to do that,” she said.
Ley’s announcement triggered a swift response from the Clean Energy Council (CEC) which said it was “frustrated” with the federal government’s approach to solar module waste.
CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said the peak body has worked to develop a plan to address this issue over the past year but the federal government had walked away from coordinating a national approach to solar PV waste.
Thornton said another proposal put forward by the CEC to establish an industry-led and self-funded product stewardship program was also rejected.
“Industry is prepared to lead and coordinate this initiative, but it also requires coordination and leadership from government given the significant regulatory interactions between the three tiers of government on environment and waste policy,” he said.
“We would welcome a joint approach from the federal government and we remain ready, willing and able to work in partnership with them on this significant issue.”

Industry has already made moves to address the issue as the number of decommissioned modules mounts up with Adelaide-based Reclaim PV Recycling  recently securing approval to establish a second facility in Brisbane.
Reclaim PV, which for the past few years has been processing a test trickle of around 10,000 modules per annum, is looking to work with manufacturers, councils and businesses to establish a national network of drop-off locations for solar modules to be recycled at its plants.
Victorian-based Lotus Energy has also commenced recycling operations at its facility in Melbourne’s north, unveiling its panel-crushing plant earlier this year, declaring it is capable of recycling 100% of end-of-life solar modules, including inverters, cables, optimisers and mounting structures – all without using any chemicals.
Sydney-based PV Industries has also started recycling solar modules and processing material after securing a site in the city’s western suburbs earlier this year.
The New South Wales government has also made moves to address the challenge, allocating  $10 million for a two-stage grant funding scheme aimed at keeping end-of-life solar systems out of landfill.

Having already revealed plans to establish a 2 GW renewable energy portfolio in Australia, Risen Energy announced on Thursday it will now build a new 3 GW manufacturing facility in Kedah, in the Malaysia’s northwest.
Malaysia’s International Trade and Industry Minister, Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, said Risen Energy had secured a manufacturer’s licence under the country’s national economic recovery plan, enabling it to design, develop and manufacture high-efficiency solar PV cells and modules.
“The facility’s construction at the Kulim Hi-Tech Park will be completed by the end of this year, while commercial activities are expected to begin in Q1 2022,” Azmin said.
“This new facility will contribute an annual production capacity of 3 GW for the first five years.”
Risen Energy president Xie Jian said the new manufacturing hub would provide Risen Energy with a strategic location in the core of Southeast Asia.
Risen Energy has plans to establish a significant portfolio in Australia, signing a deal with South Australian-based Green Gold Energy (GGE) earlier this year to jointly develop and construct 16 solar PV projects of approximately 4.95 MW each within the next two years.
Six of projects have already reached settlement phase.The total project capacity will be 80 MW and will help Risen Energy achieve its goal to establish a 2 GW renewable energy portfolio in Australia.
Risen has already taken steps to reach its target, adding the 120 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland and the 132 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia to its portfolio.
Xie said the new manufacturing hub would allow Risen Energy to increase its production capacity while Malaysia’s investment environment offered good economic growth prospects.
“Further, Malaysia has abundant raw materials, high quality of human resources and harmonious ethnic relations whereby people get along well. Most importantly, the strong support and service from the state and local governments,” he said.
Malaysia is already home to production bases for some of the world’s largest PV producers including JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Hanwha Q Cell and First Solar.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/25/low-cost-renewable-hydrogen-may-already-be-in-reach/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,POLICY,MIDDLE EAST",MAX HALL,"JUNE 25, 2021",‘Low-cost renewable hydrogen may already be in reach’,"From pv magazine Global
A report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has suggested affordable green hydrogen could already be obtainable, based on the record-breaking low prices for solar negotiated in the Middle East.
Solar electricity tariffs of US$0.0157, US$0.0135 and US$0.0104 per kilowatt-hour agreed in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, respectively, in the last 18 months, would enable renewables-powered hydrogen to be produced for as little as US$1.62 per kilogram, according to IRENA’s Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2020 report.
The Abu Dhabi-based international body made its calculations – all of which are in U.S. dollars – based on the US$0.0104 solar power tariff agreed in Saudi Arabia in April, with green hydrogen generation being modelled at the Dumat al Jandal site in the kingdom which boasts strong solar and wind power resources. With the site already hosting a wind farm, IRENA modelled a hydrogen plant which would also harness solar and be connected to the grid. The report suggested lack of a grid connection would raise the renewable hydrogen cost to US$1.74/kg, which still compares favourably to the current US$1.45-2.40/kg price of hydrogen production powered by natural gas and equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) tech.
Further extrapolating the costs, the study estimated a fall in hydrogen electrolyser costs, from US$750 per kilowatt of capacity to US$350, would enable renewable hydrogen production for US$1.16/kg. Raising electrolyser efficiency to 72.5% and extending stack lifetime from 15 to 17.5 on top of that, IRENA said, could take green hydrogen below the prized US$1/kg point.
With this year’s renewables price report explaining how the three tariffs secured in the Middle East since January 2020 can be regarded as viable without any hidden caveats or subsidy, the authors of the study stated: “low-cost renewable hydrogen may already be in reach.”
The document fleshed out how up to 800 GW of coal-fired power generation capacity worldwide could already be replaced by newly-built renewable energy facilities as solar and wind prices have dipped under the cost of running legacy fossil fuel plants in many markets. That estimate included a US$5/MWh cost of integrating renewables into the electric grid and IRENA said, with around 40% of that overpriced capacity – and 37% of actual generation – based in Bulgaria, Germany, India and the United States, decommissioning could save around US$32 billion per year in energy costs. Making the switch would also eliminate three gigatonnes of carbon emissions – 20% of what IRENA estimates is needed to keep global heating to a maximum 1.5 degrees Celsius this century.
The latest edition of the report is based on data from around 20,000 renewables generation facilities worldwide which account for 1.9 TW of generation capacity, and on clean energy auction prices and power purchase agreements which add up to 582 GW of capacity. All the figures in the study exclude any form of subsidy and the authors point out, adding CCS to the world’s overpriced coal plants would merely drive up their costs further.
IRENA has estimated all of Bulgaria and Germany‘s coal plants will this year cost electricity bill payers more than new renewables facilities would, based on a European carbon emissions price of €50 per ton. Even without an emissions trading scheme in the U.S. and India, the picture is similar, with 77-91% of American coal plants and 87-91% of Indian facilities also overpriced.
That conclusion is based on an estimated levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for solar power in India this year of US$0.033/kWh, down from US$0.038 last year; and of US$0.031 in the States this year, although the report’s authors note the solar module price has picked up between 1% and 9% in the first quarter of this year, thanks to shortages of raw materials such as polysilicon.
With the global LCOE of solar having fallen 7% from 2019 to last year, from US$0.061 to US$0.057/kWh, India led the world for low-price PV last year, with an average LCOE of US$0.038/kWh for utility scale generation, ahead of China, with US$0.044, and Spain, with US$0.046. The authors noted Turkey also rapidly reduced average solar tariffs, to US$0.052 last year, and Australia posted an average US$0.057.
That translated into average solar project development costs of US$596 per kilowatt installed in India, the world’s lowest figure and down 8% from Indian costs in 2019. Solar projects in Vietnam came in to US$949/kW and were only US$796/kW in Spain last year, the report added. At the other end of the scale, projects in Russia cost US$1,889/kW and, in Japan, US$1,832, with those two countries exceptional among the 19 markets studied as the cost differences between areas from Canada (at US$1,275/kW) down to India, were more evenly distributed.
Auction results posted last year, for projects expected to be commissioned this year and next, prompted IRENA to estimate the global average solar power price will fall to US$0.039/kWh this year before rising slightly to US$0.04 next year, which would still be a 30% fall on this year’s figure and 27% less than the LCOE to be expected from new-build coal plants. With the predictions based on 18.8 GW of renewables capacity expected this year and 26.7 GW due in 2022, the study estimated 74% of the clean energy facilities expected this year and next will be cheaper than new fossil fuel generation sites.
Renewables are already making real headway, of course, with IRENA calculating 45.5 GW of the solar added last year was among the 62% of the 162 GW of clean energy facilities which were installed more cheaply than new-build coal plants.
Digging into the solar statistics, the report said mainstream solar panel costs in December ranged from US$0.19 to US$0.40 per Watt, for an average price of US$0.27, with thin-film products averaging US$0.28/W.
Operations and maintenance costs came in at an average of US$17.80/kW last year in OECD countries and US$9 elsewhere, in a year which also saw non-panel, balance-of-system equipment costs account for 65% of total project expense.
For residential solar arrays, average system prices in the 19 markets studied by IRENA ranged from US$658/kW in India to US$4,236 in California, for LCOE figures from US$0.055/kWh in India to US$0.236 in the U.K. For commercial systems, India was again the cheapest place to invest last year, at an average US$651/kW, but a business in California would have to find US$2,974/kW. Those system costs translated into LCOE numbers ranging between US$0.055 in India and US$0.19 in Massachusetts.

The 2.5 MW/5 MWh QLD hybrid project will be grid connected and supply power to grid service provider Ergon. Gransolar’s hybrid solution is a concerted and tailored approach designed to “provide maximum flexibility with the ability to access the maximum number of market and revenue streams, including arbitrage and FCAS services”, according to a company statement.
With the National Energy Market at the forefront of grid congestion and therefore at the forefront of necessity for grid innovation, companies are now realising that new renewables are perhaps better built already hybridised with battery energy storage.
There is a need, said Carlos López, managing director of Gransolar Group Australia, to “build facilities that already integrate BESS systems; the future of renewables as a source of continuous generation involves hybridisation with storage.”
This is the first hybrid project for Gransolar and the first project in which all four of the group’s member companies are involved. Therefore, not only with Gransolar build the plant and install the energy storage system, it will also do the engineering, supply the solar trackers as well as the integrated monitoring system.
“Our differentiating element is that we are involved in the entire value chain,” said López, “offering solutions that adapt to the needs of each customer and each project. We are working to take on more projects like Dalby’s.”
So if these sorts of hybridised systems are the future of new renewable builds in Australia, will it be that company’s with a footprint across the entire value chain are also the future?
The project is expected to be operational by early 2022 and will generate approximately 50 jobs in the process.

U.S.-based wafer manufacturer 1366 Technologies has confirmed plans for a 2 GW solar wafer and cell production facility in India. The unit is being planned under the Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which aims to drive deployment of every stage of the solar supply chain, from polysilicon to module manufacturing.
A spokesperson for the company told pv magazine it is exploring manufacturing opportunities for its ‘direct wafer’ production process in India and the business said it is also seeking module partners.
“The Indian government has made domestic solar manufacturing a priority and our technology is particularly well suited for the Indian market,” said the 1366 spokesperson. “Direct wafer manufacturing can immediately deliver the lowest cost of electricity in a single-junction device for India’s utility market, and it underpins an economically feasible, high-efficiency, tandem product for global leadership.”
The direct wafer process is a kerfless wafer technique, meaning it does not require silicon ingots to be sawn into wafers, a time-consuming process that wastes material as silicon dust. Instead, 1366’s technology forms wafers directly, using molten silicon. The company claims its direct wafer process offers the world’s lowest wafer production cost, translating into cell and module competitiveness.
The direct wafer approach has long held big hopes for the industry and the company operates a demonstration facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, where most of its technological developments were achieved. One such was a 20.3% cell efficiency level recorded in August 2017 in a Q Cells Q.antum cell which incorporated passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) technology and 1366 wafers. That record, 1366 Tech said at the time, was achieved on a pilot line using standard processes seen in mass production.
