“Victoria has a 10,000 MW target while New South Wales is aiming to bring online 12,000 MW of new renewable energy projects and 2,000 MW of storage by 2030. Queensland’s plan to unlock 3,300 MW looks measly in comparison,” Stephanie Gray, Energy Strategist at Solar Citizens, said.
The majority of the new capacity, 2 GW, will go to the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone (QREZ), which includes Brisbane. The Central QREZ, which includes prospective hydrogen hubs Gladstone and Bundaberg, has been allocated just 800 MW of new capacity, while the Northern QREZ, which includes Townsville, will see an 500 MW upgrade to transmission infrastructure coming in at $40 million.

The Queensland government has said the 3.3 GW allocation simply marks the first stages of its QREZ development. Solar Citizen’s has called on the state to ensure “at least” 2 GW of new renewable energy generation is added to each of the three QREZs by 2025, almost doubling the current plan. The community group fears without matching the vision of other states, Queensland risks investors taking their projects and funding elsewhere.
Queensland’s state government has set a target of reaching 50% renewable energy generation by 2030. It is now calling on stakeholders, including industry and community, to offer feedback on its QREZ model over the next two months.

The company recently released a conference presentation to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) saying its proposed hybrid power station serves “an important strategic purpose” and will be particularly important for the Queensland government which its targeting 50% renewable power generation by 2030.
Alongside the sale of wholesale electricity, the mine’s main product will be torbanite, also known as boghead coal or channel coal, which is a variety of fine-grained black oil shale. Seemingly cognisant of the global loss of appetite for all things coal and oil, Greenvale is putting its colocated hybrid power station front and centre of its “new development strategy”. (Neil Biddle, Greenvale’s managing director, was a founding director of Pilbara Minerals Limited, one of Australia’s major lithium miners, and so is probably well aware of the momentum now behind the clean energy transition.)
Greenvale’s current planning is based on having a 50 MW gas turbine which it says will produce enough waste heat for the retorting process coupled with a 50 MW solar farm, though the company has indicated the solar farm could be swapped for an “alternative renewable energy system”.
Nonetheless, the company says the solar farm projected to offset all carbon emissions over the life of the project, which is set to operate for 10 years as a simple open cut operation extracting torbanite from a depth of five to 50 metres underground. Greenvale estimates the project will cost between $125 million and $200 million, most of which will go towards the hybrid power station infrastructure.
The other major selling point of the proposal is bitumen – as in the road base. Bitumen products typically came from oil refineries, but with those closing, Australia is in need of a new source. 
The feasibility study for Greenvale’s Alpha Torbanite project is set to be released in the first quarter of 2022.

A NSW case study,"At the just-concluded 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference better known as COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the consensus inevitably reached by global leaders to stay within the 1.5 degree warming target will have far-reaching impacts. For nations – such as Australia – that remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels, any meaningful action to achieve this goal would directly translate to an acceleration in our energy transition. Specifically, in the National Electricity Market (NEM), the path is quite clear – coal is exiting, and a significant number of new renewables and storage are needed to replace energy currently supplied by fossil fuels. 
New South Wales (NSW), Australia’s largest energy market, clearly brings into focus the challenge and opportunity ahead for Australia. As shown in Figure 1, NSW’s predominant source of energy has been black coal (>80%), the vast majority of which (~70% of total generation) will retire by 2035. Moreover, given the difference in capacity factors between coal and renewable technologies (two to three times the capacity of coal is needed by renewables to generate the same amount of electricity), these trends present significant investment opportunities in Australia’s energy market. A level of investment which has not been seen at any other period in the market since these huge coal and gas power stations were built in the 70s. A similar story is also playing out in Queensland and Victoria with looming coal capacity exits.
Octopus Investments
From an energy market perspective, multiple factors will determine what mix of technologies will eventually replace these ageing coal assets. Replacing coal with renewables is not as straightforward as replacing capacity on a like-for-like basis, supplemental technologies that enable dispatchability and flexibility are crucial to controlling intermittency of renewables and ensuring consistent supply. Dispatchable assets are loosely defined as any generation technology that is not wind or solar, but that interacts with these generation technologies to ensure energy is “on call” regardless of weather patterns. The most important role dispatchable assets play (in a transitioning to energy grid) is the ability to fill any gap in supply when neither the sun is shining nor the wind blowing – that is, support reliability of the power grid during low renewable output.
For a long time, generation from gas has been touted as the ideal (dispatchable) alternative for when the shift away from coal begins. Energy markets around the world even went as far as rebranding gas as the “transition fuel” which would lead us to a zero-carbon future. However, examining the current evolution of the NEM, is gas the transitional fuel needed or are there other alternatives? How important is dispatchable supply to system reliability, and what does this mean for net-zero in the NEM by 2050?
Ten years ago, ask anyone in the NEM what generation assets they think would come in when coal left, and without a doubt, the answer would have been gas. Gas, as a power generation fuel has a very interesting history in Australia. In fact, for a very long time, the resource was cheap to extract, plentiful and buyers had access to cheap long-term contracts. However, in 2015, with the commencement of three Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) projects in Queensland, coupled with operations in Western and Northern Australia, Australia began its 5-year journey to becoming the largest LNG exporter in the world, with Qatar the only other country with export volumes of a similar scale. This linkage to international markets had major impacts on domestic gas users – including gas-powered generators (GPG) in the NEM – such as:
Octopus Investments
Remarkably, you might expect that the use of gas for electricity generation would move inversely to merchant gas prices, however that hasn’t been the case. As seen in Figure 2, looking at NSW, gas demand for gas-powered generators  has shown no particular economic correlation to gas prices. Whilst the insignificance of the gas merchant market (most transactions settle under a pre-contracted price) is partly to blame, this has been largely been driven by events in the NEM.
Supply availability – particularly coal, hydro, and renewables – is increasingly responsible for how much room there is in the electricity market for gas output especially as renewables continue to grow. In June 2021, gas-powered generator demand rose to its fourth highest month in two years with key outages to coal units accountable for most of this outcome. As seen in Figure 3 below, gas generation in NSW across the day last June was higher than the same period in previous years, with a visibly telling role in the morning and evening peak periods. However, in many months prior to June last financial year (as seen in Figure 2), the role of gas had been depleting in the state as renewables in addition to coal and hydro, continued to squeeze gas out of the supply mix. Perhaps the future role for gas in the electricity market is an opportunistic one? 
Octopus Investments
Curiously, the major outages – such as the explosion at Callide Power Station in Queensland – happened in neighbouring states; underlining the importance of, and reliance on, imports to reliability in NSW. Given NSW itself is facing its own major energy gap as seen in Figure 1, is gas going to, after all be the transition fuel? Or is the transition itself signifying the need for another type of dispatchable capacity – one that brings with it the ability to take advantage of excess supply at other times of the day? Before exploring these questions any further – let’s look at imports, the critical role other states play in supporting energy reliability in NSW, and what these import trends mean for the future of dispatchable supply in NSW.
Interconnection – the ability for states and regions to transfer power between themselves – is one aspect of the market that doesn’t get enough attention. However, the role it plays in supporting reliability is substantial especially as more coal exits the market. Looking specifically at NSW, it is important to highlight the role energy imports – enabled through interconnection with Queensland and Victoria – continue to play in the demand/supply balance in the state.
Octopus Investments
As seen in Figure 4 above, over the last three years NSW has been increasing its reliance on imports into the state (the higher the curve is above the zero line, the higher the imports into the state). In FY21, the state was a net importer of energy about 94% of the time, up from 90% in FY20, and 87% in FY19. In the last financial year, the state also imported over 1GW of energy about 21% of the time – highlighting the extent to which the state relies on neighbouring regions for cost-optimal supply and reliability. Is this a trend likely to continue as more coal retires? To answer this question, we examine what role imports from connecting states currently play during periods of demand/supply tightness in NSW. 
Octopus Investments
In Figure 5, we plot the number of periods – on a time-of-day basis – when NSW has imported over 1GW during periods when the power demand in the state has been greater than the 75th percentile for the year. The total number of these periods in FY21 is 1040 – equivalent to ~6% of all market settlement intervals in the year. At maximum demand during FY21, the state imported 1.6GW (up from 1.3GW in FY20) of energy from (predominantly) Victoria, and Queensland. Interestingly, looking at the middle of the day, NSW has halved the number of large imports on days with high demand since FY19. This is largely due to the growth in renewable supply – particularly solar (rooftop and grid) – in the state. However, the large imports during tight periods in the evening peak have remained strong, in fact, an argument can be made that this is a growing trend. As coal retirements strip NSW of local dispatchable supply in the coming years, more constraints on the interconnectors should be expected during these tight periods. As import limits are reached, other generation resources within NSW would then have to fill this demand/supply gap. However, looking at the growing intra-day spread over the years between when these critical imports are needed, a case can be made for energy storage as the ideal dispatchable technology for filling this energy gap to be left by coal. As seen in Figure 5, in FY21, NSW imported over 1GW of power during tight periods five times more often in the evening peak than it did during the day; however, in FY19, this number was only 2.5. This growing spread in market tightness through the day is a key driver of price arbitrage that energy storage technologies – such as batteries and pumped storage – need to be profitable. 
However, it is worth mentioning that from FY25, a new 800MW interconnector linking NSW to South Australia – Project Energy Connect – is expected to be operational. The extent to which this interconnector would support reliability in NSW during these peak demand periods is one to watch.
Liddell Power Station – a coal-powered thermal generator – located in NSW is the next coal fleet in line for retirement as it reaches the end of its 50-year technical life. With the first unit of Liddell power station scheduled to retire in April 2022, and the remaining three units scheduled to close a year later in April 2023, what impact will the station’s exit will have on intra-day demand/supply balance in the state? As seen in Figure 6, Liddell currently contributes between 10-11% of the entire demand in NSW through the typical day. In other words, NSW would have to replace 10-11% of its current supply source in the next two years.
Octopus Investments
The key to understanding the impact of this exit, however, is in comparing the supply from Liddell with the supply from renewable technologies (wind and solar) in the state. On average, whilst Liddell supplies 30% less than renewables during the day, this situation is reversed in the evenings – when solar is out of the market – with the power station’s output up to 50% higher than the entire renewable generation (wind) in the evening peak. Consequently, it is safe to assume that whatever the price impact from the exit of this power station will be during the day, that impact is expected to be much more pronounced in the evenings – especially during the peak period. From a market planning and investment perspective, this retirement is likely to further drive the spread between peak and off-peak periods – creating even stronger arbitrage signals for energy storage technologies.
Looking beyond Liddell and 2022, the case remains strong for dispatchable storage in NSW well into the future. As seen in Figure 6, the coal fleet scheduled for retirement before 2035 currently supply ~70% of the state’s demand through the typical day. Therefore, as more renewable technologies connect as replacements, the need for energy shifting through storage would get even stronger. In addition, the state government’s roadmap looking to attract $32 billion worth of investments in ~12GW of new renewable energy capacity by 2030 is also likely to accelerate the need for storage in the state.
To date, there has been no grid-connected battery in NSW with only a handful of batteries operating in the rest of the NEM (Victoria and South Australia). This is partly due to the financing mechanism currently used for these assets with most of their bankable revenues driven by subsidies, government and network contracts, as well as grants. As for the operating battery assets in other regions, the ancillary services markets (frequency control and balancing) have also provided a majority of the revenues (70-80%) for the uncontracted capacity in these assets; with energy arbitrage providing about 20%. Whilst this financing mechanism has been acceptable so far, the question of whether these bankability measures remain ideal going forward is one worth asking. With most retail contracts for firming also in the two to four year window (aligned with customer offer periods), investors and the lending community would need to look for innovative ways to bring this technology to market given the role they are poised to play in the very immediate future, as well as the growing market case for this technology. The other piece of the puzzle is the cost of batteries – however these costs are falling fast, and it is only a matter of time before the learning rates seen in wind and solar projects globally become a mainstay in the battery market. 
On the policy side, a new rule change to create a single participant category for hybrid technologies (solar/wind plus storage) will go a long way in clearing up some of the regulatory barriers slowing down the deployment of capital into batteries at scale in the NEM. However, given batteries have the ability to act as load (when charging), the rule maker – the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) – in its draft rule has not exempted battery assets from paying the transmission use of system charges (TUOS). TUOS, is a regulated charge paid by all end-users (customer/load) of the network as a way for transmission network operators to recoup investments made in their networks. However, given batteries only store power to discharge at a later time, a charge such as TUOS levied on batteries increases the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for investors and puts the technology at a disadvantage to other dispatchable technologies such as gas who do not pay this levy. In fact, given the cycling losses batteries currently have to manage between their charge and discharge cycles, an argument can be made that the technology is already at a natural disadvantage to other dispatchable technologies, and an extra punitive charge may only serve to slow down their uptake at a time when they are most needed.
Octopus Investments
Going forward, unlike gas whose role looks to be continually reducing and increasingly opportunistic (see Figure 2 and Figure 3) as the market transitions, storage technologies look to be increasing their presence in the market. As seen in Figure 7, the pumped storage unit run by Snowy in NSW is increasingly dispatching more energy in the peak periods whilst it takes advantage of overnight wind and midday solar to pump. This is a great example of the role storage assets will play in a future decarbonised NEM. As more renewable technologies connect, this market balancing between load (pumping) and generation (discharge) will be critical to not only reliability, but also grid security. For what it’s worth, as shown in Figure7, Snowy’s pumped hydro storage alone, on average, delivered about the same energy during the evening peak period in FY21 as the entire gas fleet in NSW; a staggering outcome, and perhaps a sign of things to come.

The agreement with see the trio form an incorporated joint venture to develop Samalaju Hydrogen Production Plant, which is proposed to be a massive 1.3 GW, capable of producing as much as 170,000 tonnes per year of liquid hydrogen or 970,000 tonnes per year of ammonia for export. 
The plant is proposed for the newly built Samalaju Industrial Park and Port and will produce its green hydrogen via electrolysis powered by hydroelectricity. Sarawak, the state where the facility is to be housed, is home to the majority of Malaysia’s hydro assets, which are currently the country’s main renewable energy source while it seeks to expand its solar assets through its large-scale government-run tender programme. 
According to the companies, Australian-based renewable developer Thales New Energy has already undertaken pre-feasibility studies for the project over the past 12 months. Thales New Energy seems to be a rather new player in the renewable development game, listing a number of hydrogen projects on its website all of which seem to be in early stages. This may have been a driver in its decision to team up with H2X, an Australian hydrogen fuel cell startup. Just a few years old, H2X has hit the ground running, announcing a steady stream of partnerships, projects, and vehicle designs this year.
Going forward, Thales New Energy and H2X will work closely together with Malaysia’s SEDC Energy to “quickly progress”, they say, to detailed feasibility and engineering for the Samalaju Hydrogen Production Plant. The trio expect the project will be able to secure requisite development approvals in 2022. It will then build the project over several phases, with first exports possible from 2024/25.   
The companies have also said they will “look to develop local electrolyser build capabilities in Sarawak,” leaving the door open to a manufacturing component which seems to be a growing focus for H2X. 
The state of Sarawak sits on Borneo island, stretching along its northwest coast. The Malaysia region is reportedly gearing up to become a hub for the emerging ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) hydrogen energy market, planning a range of hydrogen infrastructure projects. The state’s high penetration of hydro assets, as well as its strategic coastal location in the centre of south east Asia clearly adding to its attractiveness for such propositions. 
Earlier this month, Sarawak Economic Development Corporation signed a different MoU with H2X Global to manufacture, assemble and develop H2X’s transport projects. Under that agreement, the pair will form a different joint venture which will see them “immediately begin” the assembly of relevant vehicles, including H2X’s hyped Warrego ute, as well as city buses and H2X hydrogen-powered generators. Presumably this means H2X will not primarily be manufacturing in Australia after all, though exactly what this means for its vision of returning manufacturing to Australian shores is unclear.

Australian energy company Woodside Petroleum has secured land for its proposed H2TAS hydrogen plant in Tasmania. “H2TAS is a phased development with the potential to support up to 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of electrolysis for hydrogen and ammonia production. The initial phase would have capacity of up to 300 megawatts (MW) and target production of 200,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of ammonia, matched to forecast customer demand,” wrote the company on Friday, adding that ammonia would be produced by hydropower and wind power. The main focus is on export, but the company also speaks about domestic use. “H2TAS is already garnering interest from existing and prospective Woodside customers in Asia and Europe,” Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill commented. In May, Woodside teamed up with Japan’s Marubeni and IHI to export ammonia to Japan. Woodside is aiming to take a final investment decision for H2TAS in 2023. Construction and commissioning activities are expected to take around 24 months. In October, Woodside Petroleum unveiled plans to establish an export-oriented hydrogen and ammonia production facility in southern metropolitan Perth.
Energy consultancy Xodus and Perth-based metals manufacturing company Unique Metals announced a memorandum of understanding for the Unique HyMetals hydrogen project in Australia. “Unique HyMetals will enable the company to rebalance and optimise energy from rooftop solar and use it to transform water into hydrogen, which can then be used at times when solar is not feasible or unused. Furthermore, there will be zero waste, as the resulting oxygen, which is often considered a by-product of the process, will be captured and used for manufacturing activities such as laser cutting and oxyacetylene welding,” Xodus wrote on its website. The companies expect to start construction activities for internal usages in 2022 and plan investments in commercial-scale refuelling infrastructure in 2025.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced that the Australian government and Queensland state awarded Korea Zinc AU$21 million (€13.37 million) in funding to start producing green hydrogen for fuel cell trucks at the company’s zinc refinery in Queensland. The project will be located at the Sun Metals zinc refinery in Townsville, which is owned by Ark’s sister company Sun Metals Corporation (SMC). Ark and SMC are subsidiaries of Korea Zinc, the largest zinc, lead, and silver producer in the world. SMC’s zinc refinery is currently the second-largest single-site consumer of electricity in Queensland. After funding directed to light vehicle transport projects, ARENA now wants to focus on ultra-heavy fuel cell electric trucks.
Australia’s focus on heavy-duty vehicles came amidst similar developments in Europe. French oil and gas company TotalEnergies and Germany’s commercial vehicle manufacturer Daimler Truck have signed an agreement to team up in sourcing and logistics, dispensing of hydrogen in service stations, developing hydrogen-based trucks, and establishing a customer base. “The partners will collaborate in the development of ecosystems for heavy-duty trucks running on hydrogen, with the intent to demonstrate the attractiveness and effectiveness of trucking powered by clean hydrogen and the ambition to play a lead role in kickstarting the rollout of hydrogen infrastructure for transportation,” TotalEnergies wrote on Wednesday.
Siemens Gamesa’s Brande Hydrogen pilot project in Denmark produced its first green hydrogen as part of the testing and commissioning phase. “Project partner Everfuel is distributing this to hydrogen stations in Denmark, enabling a growing number of zero emission vehicles, such as fuel cell taxis, to operate on a 100% green fuel supply,” the renewable energy developer wrote earlier this week, calling it the “world’s first project capable of producing green hydrogen directly from wind, in island mode.” The Brande Hydrogen setup couples an existing onshore Siemens Gamesa SWT 3.0-113 DD wind turbine with an electrolyser stack from electrolysis partner Green Hydrogen Systems. Siemens Gamesa is also using the Brande Hydrogen site, which can also operate connected to the grid, to explore the potential of integrating battery technology in the turbine-electrolyser project.
European ports continue to announce investments in hydrogen infrastructures. Energy storage assets startup Global Energy Storage (GES) has announced its first investment at Europoort in the Port of Rotterdam. “It is buying an interest in part of the assets of the Stargate Terminal from Gunvor Group and will develop more than 20 hectares at the heart of the port,” GES wrote on Thursday. “The deal has been formally approved by the Port of Rotterdam Authority. The site includes a significant waterfront with deep water access, brownfield development opportunities and potential greenfield development sites.” Launched in May this year, Guernsey-headquartered GES is backed by Bluewater, a private equity firm focused on the middle-market energy sector. “Alongside a new jetty that we aim to develop and low-carbon commodity infrastructure, we are also looking to become part of the logistics chain needed to import blue and green hydrogen,” commented CEO Peter Vucins.
The Maritime Cluster of Cantabria – MarCA – has presented the consortium that will launch the Green Hydrogen Cantabria renewable energy project, formed by 26 companies and regional institutions. With an estimated budget of between €26.2 and €28.3 million, the creation of the Green Hydrogen Cantabria consortium makes it possible to begin the financing process. “Specifically, the consortium plans to raise national and European funds to promote the development of this pilot project,” MarCa wrote on Wednesday, adding that a change in legal and regulatory framework is needed to facilitate the mass deployment of the technology.
As anticipated, EDP Renewables (EDPR), the renewable energy arm of Portugal’s Energias de Portugal (EDP), whose largest shareholder is state-owned energy company China Three Gorges, pledged to invest in renewable hydrogen projects that will secure an additional 1.5 GW of capacity by 2030. With the announcement, made on Tuesday during the COP26, EDPR joined the H2Zero initiative.
Last week, Solaria Energía and Enagás announced the signing of an agreement to study the potential joint development of a green hydrogen plant. The project envisages up to 200 MWp of solar photovoltaic energy for the production of green hydrogen.
Also last week, Vectalia, Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), Iberdrola, and Aguas de Alicante kicked off the HyVus project consortium, which includes the generation of green hydrogen that will power part of the fleet of Vectalia buses, as well as vehicles of other operators. The plant will be connected directly to a 1.25 MW PEM electrolyser, which should produce around 345 kg/day (15 hours of operation per day). The project will include construction of a refuelling station for heavy hydrogen vehicles at 350 bar pressure. The four companies plan to apply for Next Generation funds.

Analysis considers all options for underperfoming PV modules,"From pv magazine Global
Repairing and reusing a solar module that is not complying with its expected lifetime provides for more environmental benefits than replacing the underperforming unit with a new and more performant PV module. The reuse option, however, still has several challenges to overcome in terms of economic viability, with only a limited number of positive business cases being available under current market conditions. It may become competitive in the future, however, if PV panels achieve higher efficiencies and costs are further reduced.
These are the main conclusions of the report, “Preliminary Environmental and Financial Viability Analysis of Circular Economy Scenarios for Satisfying PV System Service Lifetime,” published by the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power System Programme (IEA-PVPS).
In the paper, the agency’s experts said the main goal of their efforts was to understand to which extent a circular economy approach could be applied to the PV industry. Their analysis was conducted through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and assuming a solar panel has a 30-year lifetime. “The functional unit metric is therefore defined as the total lifecycle environmental impact of the PV system divided by the total amount of electricity produced by the system over 30 years,” they explained. “The lower the metric value is, the more favourable it is for the environment.”
The researchers initially quantified the environmental impact of recycling, repair, and reuse of PV systems under different scenarios and found that the frequent replacement of panels with newer and more performant panels increases the environmental impact. The higher efficiencies provided by the new products do not offset the environmental footprint of additional panel production, they added. “Moreover, our sensitivity assessment shows that, even if maintaining the 30-year service life requires junction box repair and/or transporting the panel for long distances, keeping panels in use is the more environmentally favourable solution,” they emphasised. “In other words, it is better for the environment to keep a panel in use for 30 years instead of replacing it with new, more efficient panels.”
In the second part of the study, the IEA-PVPS group focused on the financial viability of the lifetime of prematurely decommissioned solar panels from a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) perspective and, for rooftop PV, it ascertained that satisfying the 30–year service lifetime of PV panels may be financially competitive with replacing the modules under certain conditions. “This is the case for relatively young panels (up to around 10 years old) with few or no defects,” it explained. “Although we do not account for testing and recertification costs, these costs could be a determining factor for the success of the reuse business case.”
As for utility-scale solar, the repairing or reusing options were not found to be financially viable due to surface–area restrictions, lower remaining power density, and the limited remaining lifetimes of prematurely decommissioned panels. “In addition, our analysis of PV as a utility-scale investment — using net present value as the key performance indicator — suggests that new panels are more attractive than prematurely decommissioned panels in this context as well, without and especially with surface-area limits.”
The experts cautioned that their analysis was limited to polycrystalline panels and that the reusing option should be further assessed under different geographical locations and solar irradiation conditions. “The financial viability of the reuse business case is influenced by additional country- and case-specific parameters, such as the grid tariffs that drive revenue and can fluctuate substantially,” they concluded.
