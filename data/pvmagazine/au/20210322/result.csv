Almost two-thirds (65%) of investors canvassed in MinterEllison’s second annual Renewables Investment Report say they will increase their investment in Australian renewables in the next 12-24 months, and a further 20% said that their current level of investment will remain unchanged.
On the slim down side, 63% of investors continue to cite instability around Australia’s incentives for renewable energy development as the main risk/challenge to investing in the country’s renewable infrastructure.
“This uncertainty does not facilitate smooth planning and diversification for investors,” the Director of Corporate Development and Investments at an Australia-based energy company is quoted as saying.
The head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) at a Netherlands-based energy company adds: “The instability surrounding incentives and the take in different states is not inviting for foreign investors.”
That said, MinterEllison Energy Partner, Joel Reid, extracts from the figures that 87% of respondents predict that Australia will have the most supportive environment for investment in renewables in 12 months’ time, versus 68% who hold that opinion today.
Reid says, “This performance is comparable with the likes of major renewables markets in Europe (Germany) and North America (Canada).
Regulatory complexity, constrained access to the grid and lack of availability of EPC contractors were ranked, in order of mention, as the next greatest challenges to investors.
The report acknowledges that renewables investment over the past two years has shown a significant reduction: from $17.1 billion across 49 transactions in 2018 to $3.8 billion in 20 deals in 2020. It says “grid integration problems and transmission losses may be among the reasons for this declining investment”.
However, the report also suggests that some of the biggest projects proposed over the past two years — such as the 10 GW SunCable Solar and Battery Project in the Northern Territory, the 26 GW solar-wind Asian Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara, and WA’s 1.52 GW Oakajee green hydrogen hub in the midwest of the state — are evidence that the lack of conventional grid access may be spurring innovation.
“What makes projects like these so interesting is that they do not, primarily, depend on existing grids to make money out of renewable energy,” posits the report. It continues: “New subsea cables to Asian markets, hydrogen (liquefied or converted to ammonia) and mass battery storage are key elements in the emerging megaproject story.”
Forty-nine percent of respondents foresee that hydrogen will become more of an investment hotspot in 2021, with 69% saying that developments in Australia’s hydrogen economy will cross an inflection point in the year ahead.
In the meantime, solar PV (chosen by 94% of investors) and offshore wind (83%) have this year ranked as the most attractive prospects with the lowest risks (solar PV is seen as having no risk) for investors.
The report says that “respondent sentiment reveals a significantly greater awareness of the need for firming when compared with our 2019 survey,” and suggests that this finding “underlines the growing maturity of the renewables sector and its willingness to shoulder more responsibility for providing reliable, consistent and resilient power supplies”.
Grid-scale batteries were identified by respondents as the third most likely technology (after standalone solar and wind with firming technology to meet near-future system reliability requirements. And demand management ranked fourth — arguably an even greater sign of maturity in the market.
It’s not clear whether Snowy 2.0 is regarded as “New pumped hydro”, which ranked third-last among the most reliability-boosting technologies — ahead of extending the life of existing thermal generation and new coal-fired power at rock bottom.
Hydrogen is increasingly viewed as an opportunity for investment, after having been ranked as risky in 2019. It’s especially interesting, says the report “for its potentially symbiotic relationship with renewable generation”.
MinterEllison says that deploying renewable generation, electrolysers and fuel cells on the same site therefore has the potential both to minimise curtailment risks and to provide flexible load and frequency services to the grid — in short, “hydrogen could provide a way of getting around grid access issues”. 
The Director of Corporate Development at an Australian energy company is said to represent the views of many respondents in saying, “Hydrogen has more opportunities” for investors, who “can invest in the earlier stages of a project for valuable returns.”
MinterEllison also draws on its recent report, Ahead of the Harvest: 2020-2022, in assessing the prospects for investing in renewables for agriculture, asserting that this primary industry could reach new levels of growth and development with increasing adoption of renewables
The value of agribusiness to the Australian economy is expected to increase from the current $60 billion to $100 billion by 2030. Respondents to MinterEllison’s agriculture report believe that renewable energy has a critical part to play, with 80% saying that renewables would have a positive impact on the industry’s growth and 39% saying that renewables will have a “transformative effect” on agriculture.
Mining, which accounts for a fifth of Australia’s energy consumption, is also identified as a hot prospect for renewable energy investment.
Simon Scott, Energy and Resources Lead at MinterEllison, writes, “Most miners are rethinking their operational processes and existing power supplies to invest in and integrate renewable energy sources. The benefits of investing directly in solar and wind power and smart storage, or otherwise buying green power, are clear: to drive down energy costs, curb emissions, improve safety, and lessen investor scrutiny.”
Scott sees 2020 as the year in which “the scales tipped decisively in favour of clean energy”, the year in which capital markets shifted away from carbon-based investments, and which saw natural disasters and Covid-19 prompt state and territory governments to “roll out ambitions programs to stimulate renewable energy” in tandem with the economy.
“Overall,” writes Scott in his foreword to the report, “international and domestic renewables investors are confident in the market, with positive sentiment pointing to a robust year ahead.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/22/sunwiz-2020-australian-battery-energy-storage-market-round-up-steady-as-she-grows/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 22, 2021",SunWiz 2020 Australian battery-energy-storage market round-up — steady as she grows,"In 2020, battery energy storage systems in Australia found new markets and new applications, the FCAS market for big batteries and VPPs collapsed under the weight of enthusiasm, state governments supported the development of big batteries; and residential battery sales, also to some extent supported by government incentives, grew by 20% on 2019 figures. The outlook for battery activity in 2021 looks similarly buoyant, though not phenomenal, according to exhaustive research conducted and published by SunWiz in its Australian Battery Market Report 2021.
Solar market analyst, SunWiz has been producing battery market reports since 2015, dicing, relating and forensically examining input from battery retailers, manufacturers, state incentive programs, the Clean Energy Regulator, software platforms used by sales teams, the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) new Distributed Energy Resources Register (registration of new grid connected systems was made mandatory in early 2020) and interviews with consumers.
SunWiz  calculates that in 2020, 31,269 new residential batteries were installed, which resulted in a 27% increase in overall residential storage capacity because the average battery size increased to around 10.9 kWh; that’s up from 10.3 kWh in 2019, but still down from the heights of 2018, when the average size was 11.4 kWh.
To understand what triggers homeowners to purchase a battery, SunWiz channels a 2020 survey conducted by Simply Energy, the Australian retail arm of Engie, which has captured 12% of the Australian retail energy market.
Unsurprisingly, the survey identified a desire to reduce electricity bills as the main driver for interest in home batteries; “This is consistent with every other survey we’ve read and has been the significant motivator Y-o-Y,” says SunWiz.
Government subsidies and the ability to store energy for later use were the next most important motivations.

The number of new homes being built with solar systems that include energy storage has also increased, driven by  developer initiatives, such as Stoddart, a supplier of building materials to residential developers, using South Australia’s home battery subsidy to provide new builds with 6.5 kW PV systems and a 11.6 kWh SolaX battery for no extra cost.
Another 2020 example, was battery manufacturer sonnen signing deals with property developers such as Stockland to include batteries on new homes from the get go.
Such deals are often accompanied by sign up to Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), which aim to orchestrate large numbers of household solar-plus-battery systems for the financial benefit of their owners and the stability of the grid. 
Energy retailers such as AGL and Discovery Energy, have negotiated attractive financing or discounts on batteries, which create extra value in VPP solar-plus-battery packages to consumers.
Despite state-based subsidies, and VPP bundles that reduce the cost of battery purchase, SunWiz identifies upfront cost of home energy storage systems as the ongoing principle barrier to more enthusiastic uptake.
With the cost of batteries expected to remain stable, SunWiz predicts the market for residential storage in 2021 is also around 31,000, which will bring the Australian installed base to some 143,000 systems by end December.
The Report says, “Historical forecasts of massive uptake were predicated upon a steep price drop in batteries that hasn’t played out thus far… in the residential segment.
“As residential system prices have been quite steady for three years running, accelerated uptake is unlikely to be fuelled in the near future by falling prices.”
In between residential and very large-scale batteries, some interesting developments have emerged.
For example, Western Australia opened up the opportunity for community batteries, with its rollout of 116 kW/464 kWh batteries to help householders manage their solar energy supplies into the evenings, and help Western Power to manage the grid during the day.
Although still being trialed, in the sense that a viable model for investment and return on the batteries has yet to be arrived at, the idea that householders could share storage at a modest ‘rental’ cost paid to the provider “may capture market share from HESS”, says SunWiz.
Primary producers, such as Riverlands Free Range poultry farm (Australia’s largest supplier of free-range chickens) are also realising the benefits of energy storage. Riverlands last year installed 1.4 MW of solar panels, supported by a 2.28 MWh Tesla lithium-ion battery system that was expected to reduce the farm’s energy consumption from the grid by 70%, allowing it to run on renewable energy 65% of the time.
And electric vehicle charging stations are emerging as battery customers. In 2020, Chargefox, twice chose to install an onsite battery as a cheaper alternative to upgrading power supply to EV charging points; its Goulburn electricity storage system consists of a 250 kW/273 kWh LGChem cells and a Vacon inverter, fed by a 50 kW solar system to reduce the amount of energy purchased from the grid. In May last year Chargefox Head of Charging, Evan Beaver also expected the system to earn its keep by participating in the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) market …

Although energy storage is increasingly providing stabilising services to electricity networks, and allowing the connection of more renewables both at household and large scale, SunWiz says the business model for batteries relying on FCAS revenue has been “thrown into disarray” due to a glut of participants who have seen “incredibly large revenues replaced by incredibly small revenues”.
SunWiz Director, Warwick Johnston, advises that battery operators and developers, and VPP operators need to “adapt their battery capabilities to tap into other sources of the revenue stack”.
He acknowledges that this can be a more difficult pivot for VPP operators that have promised participants an upfront discount or fixed annual revenue.
Over 2020, however, co-location of large-scale batteries with generation assets and at strategic network points matured as a successful approach for managing energy flows while increasing the opportunities for connection of renewables to the grid.
AGL last year announced its target to have 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage integrated into its energy generation portfolio by 2024, and topped the until-that-point pinnacle of deployment — Neoen’s 150 MW Hornsdale Power Reserve — with the announcement of a 250 MW battery project on the site of its retiring gas-fired Torrens Island Power Station in South Australia, and has followed through with news of further mega storage facilities this year.
Fluence last year also introduced Australia to the notion of batteries to be deployed as “virtual transmission” — a flexible approach to relieving transmission congestion issues that knocks the process for upgrading traditional transmission infrastructure out of the ballpark.

State Government support of big batteries grew apace over 2020, and took several forms, including: 
Developers led by Neoen, gen-tailers (AGL), network owners such as Spark Infrastructure, and service providers such as Transgrid also announced new battery projects last year, and SunWiz notes an increase in battery duration, “with a few announcements of four-hour energy storage indicating the focus shifting towards bulk energy storage”.
The Report says a total of 77 MWh of commercial and grid-scale battery storage projects are “known to have been installed in 2020” — around half of the 2019 volume of 141 MWh — but predicts the grid-scale market will next year surpass the growth of the residential market, with 400 MWh planned for installation.
“Combined with the residential market, this would represent 734 MWh — again demonstrating growth in overall market volume,” concludes the SunWiz analysis.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/22/massive-mineral-sands-project-made-more-viable-by-solar-hybrid-energy-supply/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 22, 2021",Massive mineral sands project made more viable by solar-hybrid energy supply,"Strandline Resources, an emerging heavy mineral sands (HMS) developer, has inked a 15-year offtake agreement with Contract Power Australia, for energy from a hybrid gas and solar energy power station to be developed close to its proposed mine and mineral separation plant near Shark Bay in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia.
The Coburn Power Station to be built, owned and operated by Contract Power, will comprise 11 MW of solar generation, 4 MW of instantaneous dynamic battery support and 18 MW of low-emissions natural gas generation; its design is capable of supporting some 10 MW of average consumed power, with a maximum demand of 15 MW.
The now contracted power solution “enables Strandline to capture energy supply cost savings relative to the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)” for the mine, published in June 2020, said an ASX announcement by Strandline released in November 2020.
“We get a fair bit of sun in the Shark Bay region, so we’ve maximised our penetration of solar,” Strandline CEO and Managing Director Luke Graham told pv magazine Australia of the cost-optimised energy supply, which he says also “leverages the relatively low-cost LNG gas supply we have in WA”.

Graham says that over the mine’s expected 40-year life (which includes an initial 22.5 years’ of useable reserve with an extension case of a further 15 to 17 years), both Contract Power and Strandline Resources will be incentivised to further reduce costs by increasing the renewable component of the generation plant with the addition of wind turbines.
“That could take us to about 50% and a maximum of 60% renewable power for our mine site, which is a pretty awesome aspirational target,” says Graham who has been appointed to lead Strandline’s HMS operations in Australia and Tanzania, from exploration to development and production.
Strandline’s Coburn Heavy Mineral Sands Project was last year approved for a loan of up to $150 million by the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, on the basis that it will boost the Federal Government’s critical minerals agenda, and “benefit the local region to the tune of $922 million over 25 years”, the Federal Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia, Keith Pitt, said at the time.
Although Strandline’s main focus is to finalise its investment decision in what is expected to become one of the world’s largest mineral sands projects, being a greenfield project also allows the company to deploy solutions from the outset that “maximise our environmental, corporate and social responsibility”, says Graham.
Large-capacity bulldozers still relying on diesel fuel will be used to extract the ore, which will then be mixed into a slurry and pumped from the mine to processing facilities; once valuable materials have been separated, some 98% of the material will subsequently be pumped back to the mining void preceding progressive rehabilitation of the site.
Pumping accounts for the majority of the mine’s electricity needs, however Graham says almost all other processes in the proposed mine will be automated and electrified; a mining camp for 200 workers will also draw from the power station — Graham anticipates employing an average of 150 direct workers during the mine’s long operational phase.
Strandline already has offtake agreements for its zircon and titanium product, with 20-25% going to China, and 75-80% earmarked for Europe and the US.
Zircon is used in making ceramics, such as tiles, and is applied in foundry work, castings and 3D printing; while titanium is primarily used in production of pigments used in paint, ink, ceramics, plastics, toothpaste and sunscreen, and is also applied as an extremely strong, light metal in aircraft manufacture – contributing to lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft that can take on longer non-stop routes.
In 24-hour operation of the Strandline Coburn Mineral Sands Project, “gas generation will be reduced daily and follow the required load generation that is not provided by solar”, says Mike Hall, Chief Operating Officer of Contract Power Group, a subsidiary of Pacific Energy, which is in turn owned by QIC (formerly Queensland Investment Corp), on behalf of its managed funds (which include the QIC Global Infrastructure Fund) and clients.
Pacific Energy also recently contracted juwi Renewable Energy Pty Ltd to construct a solar-diesel hybrid solution to help power Iluka’s Jacinth Ambrosia project in South Australia, the world’s largest supplier of zircon.

Contract Power has more than 30 years’ experience in tailoring power plants to the needs and available energy resources of mines and offgrid townships.
Hall told pv magazine Australia that “upwards of 90% of tenders currently released to the market have a renewables component” and that the past year or so has also seen “an acceleration of Build, Own and Operate (BOO) hybrid power stations”.
Among the other hybrid-energy-for-mining contracts awarded to or commenced by Contract Power over this period are Abra Power Station (10 MW gas, 6 MW solar and a 1 MW battery), powering a new lead-silver mining operation for Abra Mining; and the Tellus hazardous waste-cleaning operation at Sandy Ridge near Kalgoorlie in WA, where a 1.2 MW solar farm and a 350 kWh battery allow the site to operate on 100% renewable energy during daytime hours, integrating with 2 MW of diesel generation to take over at night.
“A further three existing customers with fossil fuel power stations are looking to introduce and integrate renewables,” says Hall. 
Once Strandline Resources reaches its final investment decision on the Coburn Heavy Mineral Sands Project, the mine will enter its estimated 18-month construction phase; and Contract Power will commence the 13- to 14-month-long construction of the power plant. “They’ll be ready well in advance of us needing power,” confirms Graham.
He adds that he sees the mining sector as being at the forefront of renewables integration: “We’re adopting renewable power solutions across the sector, and with Coburn being a greenfield mine, we can really leverage the latest in technology right from day one.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/22/hydrogen-supply-chain-opportunities-german-australian-smes-meet-today/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 22, 2021",Hydrogen supply-chain opportunities: German & Australian SMEs meet today,"As Australia’s green-hydrogen industry moves purposefully towards viability, and supply-chain and research players collaborate under the auspices of 13 hydrogen clusters managed by the National Energy Resources Australia (NERA), it makes sense that Australian centres of endeavour connect with expertise in target markets, such as Germany — to share ambitions, avoid duplications and start to dovetail supply with demand.
Today’s free virtual hydrogen business conference, organised by the German-Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce aims to further that process and more. It starts at 3.30pm with networking, and is still open for registration.
The fast-paced event is made up of 10-minute presentations, kicking off with Leigh Kennedy, NERA’s National Cluster Development Manager, outlining The role of hydrogen in Australia’s energy infrastructure; and Werner Diwald, Chairman of the German Hydrogen and Fuel-Cell Association outlining the lay of Germany’s hydrogen landscape.
In line with Australian Government policy, NERA is “technology agnostic”, says Kennedy, but he adds that customer markets will dictate how much effort Australian devotes to green hydrogen production, relative to brown hydrogen, which is produced by coal gasification; grey hydrogen produced from natural gas, but resulting in carbon byproducts; or blue hydrogen which aims to capture the carbon thrown off by the grey hydrogen process and store it (carbon capture and storage, or CCS).
Germany is expected to demand clean hydrogen as part of its drive to become carbon neutral by 2050, and has announced a €9 billion hydrogen strategy, with €2 billion designated for hydrogen projects outside the country, mainly in Ukraine and Morocco, on the basis that green hydrogen production may be more cost-efficient outside Europe. 
Kennedy says, “It’s a really exciting proposition, what Australia might do with a portion of that €2 billion, working on joint projects that create win-win solutions across both economies.”
The point is, he says, that Australia doesn’t want to be “just exporting green molecules to Germany”. Rather, “We want to be exporting our technology and services — consulting, engineering, training and education are really important in the hydrogen space because it’s so new,” he says.
Today’s conference aims to build on the “massive opportunity to deepen the bilateral cooperation” between Germany and Australia, through hydrogen; such that Australia not only helps the European industrial giant with its decarbonisation plans, but leverages those partnerships into joint projects in third markets, such as Singapore and Vietnam, says Kennedy.
Conference attendees will hear from Andrew Dickson, Development Manager of Australia’s proposed 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which is mooted to help “address key energy security and emissions reduction challenges facing Australia’s regional neighbours” by producing green hydrogen and green ammonia for export, while also powering new resources ventures in the Pilbara region where the Hub will be built.
Dominik Härle, head of H2-Technologies at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute will no doubt update attendees on the German-Australian Wasserstoffbrucke or “hydrogen bridge” initiative — a joint research venture into how a value chain of green hydrogen between the two nations can be established.
The majority of speakers form a “delegation”, say the conference organisers, of German companies connected to the hydrogen industry that are looking for partners and collaborators in the Australian market. 
Participants include companies such as Siemens and 2G Energy, already active in Australia; and others such as Cryotec Anlagenbau, which specialises in constructing plants for liquefaction and technical gases production designed to operate in extreme climatic conditions; Fichtner, a technical consultancy firm that supports infrastructure and energy projects around the world; Reuther STC, experts in pressure hydrogen storage tanks; and Remote Control Technology (RCT), which specialises in remote-controlled monitoring of liquid and gaseous media in storage tanks.
The conference provides opportunities throughout the afternoon and evening (event closes at 7.45pm) for networking, and Kennedy anticipates, “fantastic relationships will be initiated that will deliver the next generation technology for the production, storage, transportation and utilisation of hydrogen in Australia and Germany”.
