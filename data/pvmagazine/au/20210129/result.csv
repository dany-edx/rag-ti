https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/29/south-australia-leads-way-in-winding-back-of-demand/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 29, 2021",South Australia leads way in winding back of demand,"The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO), in its latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report, confirmed that rooftop and utility scale solar satisfied 100% of South Australia’s electricity demand for more than an hour on October 11.
AEMO said the achievement is a world first for a jurisdiction of that size.
The milestone coincided with a new minimum demand record in the state of 300 MW, 158 MW down on the 2019 low.
South Australia wasn’t the only state to witness reductions in demand with AEMO confirming the average operational demand in the National Electricity Market (NEM) had reduced by 3% compared to Q4 2019, declining to its lowest quarterly average in 20 years.

AEMO’s chief member services officer, Violette Mouchaileh, said the record low operational demand, coupled with high wind and solar output had translated into record low emissions with a 7% decline on Q4 2019 levels.
“Electricity demand continues to reflect changing energy trends with new minimum demand records observed in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia,” she said.
“The downward operational demand trend, coupled with increasing renewable energy, which accounted for 24% of the generation mix in Q4 2020, resulted in significant displacement of thermal generation and the lowest NEM emissions on record.
“Similarly in WA, renewable energy contributed 35% of total generation in Q4 2020, which also led to a decline in average coal-fired generation and gas-powered generation compared to Q4 2019.”
AEMO said approximately 3 GW of distributed solar was installed nationwide in 2020, up about 50% on the previous record in 2019.
The increase drove record high distributed PV output, increasing by an average of 337 MW on 2019 levels. The largest increases in distributed PV output occurred in New South Wales, which saw a 124 MW increase on average, and Queensland (100 MW on average).
There were mixed results for electricity prices, with those in SA and Victoria continuing to fall while prices in Queensland and NSW climbed from Q3 2020 lows.

South Australia became the lowest-priced region for the first time since 2012 as its quarterly average price fell 57% to $29 per MWh, with negative prices accounting for $8.7 MWh of the reduction.
Western Australia also witnessed a price decrease with the quarterly average dropping to $41.66 MWh, a 13% decrease relative to Q3 2020 due largely to increased variable renewable energy (VRE) output in the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM).
NSW’s quarterly average price of $64 MWh was at a significant premium to other regions, something AEMO attributed in part to record low coal-fired generation in the state.
The report confirms that the average black coal-fired generation decreased by 707 MW, reaching its lowest level since Q4 2014. The decline in generation occurred mainly in NSW which fell to its lowest quarterly average on record, a function of increased outages – including for unit upgrades – low operational demand, and displacement by VRE.
Average quarterly VRE output reached a record high of 3.4 GW, surpassing the previous record set in Q3 2020 by 306 MW. VRE accounted for 17% of the supply mix, up from 13.5% in Q4 2019.
Grid solar generation reached a record quarterly high of 1,018 MW on average, mainly due to   new capacity entering the system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/29/global-glass-shortage-sparks-warning-for-australian-solar-industry/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 29, 2021",Global glass shortage sparks warning for Australian solar industry,"After successfully negotiating the economic challenges of COVID-19 in 2020, Australia’s solar industry faces a new threat in 2021 with module manufacturer Sunman warning of an imminent world-wide glass shortage.
Sunman founder Dr Zhengrong Shi said he expects PV glass output to be 20%-30% short of global demand in 2021 and the shortage of supply risks having a knock-on effect in Australia with price increases and reduction of supply very real possibilities.
New figures released this week by solar industry consultancy SunWiz confirm the Australian solar industry enjoyed a record-breaking year in 2020 with 5 GW of solar PV installed, equivalent to almost 15 million average solar modules.
SunWiz managing director Warwick Johnston said every state and territory, except Tasmania, had smashed records for the volume of solar modules and system size installed and Australia led the world in uptake of solar on a per-capita basis.
Johnston said the annual growth rate for rooftop solar has exceeded 33% for the past four years and accelerated in 2020.
“The number of Australians installing rooftop solar systems increased by 40% compared to 2019 levels,” he said.
Shi said that booming demand for modules, which has been mirrored in many other nations, has placed enormous strain on the industry’s supply chain, and glass in particular is in high demand.
Most traditional solar modules utilise glass to protect the solar PV cells from potentially damaging external factors, with the glass accounting for approximately 20% of the cost of manufacture. The associated cost rises accordingly for bifacial modules which are becoming increasingly popular.
China is the world’s biggest manufacturer of PV products, responsible for an estimated 80% of the world’s solar module production capacity. The government however has previously imposed limitations on the production of glass and concerns are growing now that demand is outpacing production capacity.
Major module manufacturers in China, including Risen Energy, Longi, JinkoSolar and Trina Solar late last year issued a joint statement calling on the country’s government to intervene and ease solar-grade glass shortages they described as “out of control”.
The call came after the average selling price (ASP) of solar-grade 3.2mm glass more than doubled since July, caused by a “serious shortage” which has “critically affected” production and delivery of solar PV modules in recent months, the companies said.
In a statement, SunMan said the solar glass manufacturers had since requested permission from the Chinese government to increase production to counter the shortage but it will take some time for them to scale up.
While it is anticipated that new capacity will come online, it is expected there will be a shortage of large panels throughout 2021 as production capacity will not be able to keep up with the increasing demand for modules.

Shi, founder of Suntech Power which grew to be the world’s largest producer of solar modules, said price concerns had already triggered a 40% increase in enquiries for Sunman’s innovative e-Arc modules which use a lightweight polymer composite material in place of glass.
The flexible modules are 70% lighter than a glass panel which allows the modules to be installed across existing rooftops and other structures that are not strong enough to support heavier glass panels.
SunMan has rolled out more than 50 MW of e-ARC modules globally with 3 MW installed in Australia, including a 813-module 235 kW array atop the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney.
“The e-Arc modules are a cost-effective alternative to traditional solar as they are flexible and can be bonded to rooftops or other building surfaces such as facades,” Shi said.
“There is huge potential for commercial and industrial building owners to reduce their costs and lower emissions by investing in e-Arc solar.”
The technology has already attracted the attention of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) which last year poured $7 million into Sunman to further develop the application of its e-ARC modules.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/29/nsw-government-poised-to-energise-australias-biggest-rez/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 29, 2021",NSW government poised to energise Australia’s biggest REZ,"The New South Wales Government has confirmed that expressions of interest for the $79 million, 8 GW New England REZ will be called by the end of March with proponents of proposed, planned or operational renewable energy projects encouraged to register their interest.
Member for Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall said the move is the first step of the long planning process and establishing the REZ is a monumental undertaking and will take several years to plan, design and build and will be delivered in stages.
“The registration of interest process will help the government understand the scale, location and types of projects considering joining the New England renewable energy zone,” he said.
“The information provided will support technical design, planning and further market engagement on the zone.”
The New England REZ is one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW Government’s electricity “road map“, which will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.
The Central-West Orana REZ, which is tipped to deliver 3 GW of renewable energy, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for registrations of interest last year attracting 113 registrations, totalling 27 GW and valued at $38 billion.
Energy Minister Matt Kean said the massive response had triggered an adjustment from the State Government which has committed to investing $78.9 million to support the development of the New England REZ.
“The nine-fold level of interest in the Central-West Orana REZ was astounding, so it makes absolute sense to go even bigger with the New England REZ,” he said.
“The New England REZ will be able to power 3.5 million homes and, when coupled with Central-West Orana REZ, sets the state up to become the number one destination across Australia for renewable energy investment.”

The New England region is already home to a host of large-scale wind and solar projects, generating enough electricity to power more than 250,000 NSW homes.
“With approved projects like the New England Solar Farm at Uralla and Metz Solar Farm at Armidale expected to start construction in the next two years that output is set to explode to well over half a million regular homes,” Marshall said.
“It’s eye watering to think the New England REZ could power a further 3.5 million homes.”
Marshall said the benefits of the New England REZ would extend beyond the renewable energy sector, offering an opportunity for mass investment in things like public roads, telecommunications infrastructure and health services.
“The full development of our region through the zone is expected to be worth around $12.7 billion in private sector investment, 2,000 construction jobs and 1,300 ongoing jobs,” he said.
“I’ve long spoken about renewable energy being the ‘wind-of-change’ for this region and today we can proudly say the hard work put in by the sector’s pioneers has lit the way for a new bright future for our region and beyond.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/29/gms-all-electric-push-is-wake-up-call-for-australia-evc/,"EV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 29, 2021",GM’s all-electric push is wake-up call for Australia: EVC,"Less than a year after pulling out of Australia and killing off the Holden brand, and several years after shutting down its Australian manufacturing operations, GM on Friday shared its vision for an all-electric future and the EVC said the timing is no coincidence.
EVC chief executive Behyad Jafari said GM’s announcement underscored just how out of step Australia currently is with the rest of the world on electric vehicles (EVs).
“It’s no coincidence that GM decided to pull out of Australia shortly before making this announcement,” he said.
“The rational view for GM to form is that Australia is a low-priority nation for its all-electric future.
“Not only are we one of the only countries not to enforce fuel efficiency standards, we are the only nation proposing brand new punitive taxes on electric vehicles instead of incentives.
“The unimaginative and cynical approach our politicians have taken to electric vehicles in recent years means Australia is being left behind as the rest of the auto industry zooms ahead.”
Figures provided by the International Energy Agency show that EV sales have soared since they first entered commercial markets in the first half of the last decade. Only about 17,000 electric cars were on the world’s roads in 2010. By 2019, that number had swelled to 7.2 million.
Globally electric cars accounted for 2.6% of all new car sales in 2019 or about 2.1 million cars. That was much higher in places like China where EVs comprised around 5% of the market, the EU around 3.5%, and Norway, where more than half of all new cars sold were electric.
But Australia is however lagging behind with the lowest uptake of any comparable country. In 2019 electric cars made up just 0.6% of new car sales for a total of just over 6,700 new EVs.
While cost and lack of supporting infrastructure are certainly contributing factors, the EVC has warned plans by some state governments to introduce distance-based EV taxes is threatening the sector.
South Australia and Victoria have outlined plans to introduce a distance-based EV tax from July 2021 while the New South Wales government is also considering the introduction of road-user charges for EVs.
“On current policy settings we are being left behind as the world accelerates toward electric vehicles,” Jafari said.
“GM’s announcement underscores how fallacious the argument is that we can sit on our hands and just let the electric vehicle revolution happen to us. Other nations will jump ahead and capture all the benefits of the electric vehicle revolution and Australia will be left languishing decades behind.
“We need our politicians to wake up now and start investing in stimulating and encouraging the transition to electric vehicles before it’s too late.”

GM is the latest in a long line of manufacturers to enter the EV market. While Tesla has been a fixture in Australia for years now, MG recently launched its first offering here while Toyota, BMW, Nissan, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Hyundai and Mini are among others to have joined the race.
GM chair and CEO Mary Barra said the United States-based automaker has set a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.
GM had already announced it will invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years and will offer 30 all-electric models worldwide by the middle of the decade. The company plans to include crossovers, SUVs, sedans and trucks in its EV line-up.
GM said it will source 100% renewable energy to power its United States sites by 2030 and global sites by 2035.

The $1.7 billion project is being hailed as the nation’s largest geographical expansion of the NEM as it would integrate QLD’s isolated northwest power supply. Moreover, the link would bring enormous tracts of land previously closed to solar and wind development into the fray, along with large deposits of minerals key to the energy transition. 
Indeed, Sydney-based Vast Solar is among those who have already identified QLD’s northwest for investment with plans to develop a $600 million hybrid power plant in Mount Isa. The project will combine solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with a 50 MW solar thermal facility, and help the Queensland Government build out its Northern Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
QLD Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk added that not only will CopperString 2.0 “open up land for the development of more solar and wind generation” but also “support renewable generation capacity for a hydrogen export industry.” 
In November 2020, the newly re-elected Palaszczuk became the first state Premier in Australia to establish a ministry for hydrogen in her government.  
QLD’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles called the project potentially “the most transformative project for the North Queensland economy since the construction of the Great Northern Railway reached Mount Isa in 1929.” 
Critical minerals
The Korea Zinc Company, a world leading mineral processor, is also the parent company of Townsville-based Sun Metals, whose zinc refinery is the second-largest single-site energy consumer in Queensland. Last year Sun Metals pledged to power its entire operations with 100% renewable electricity by 2040, with an interim target of 80% by 2030. Sun Metals also developed its own 125 MW solar farm in 2018 to lower the cost of running its refinery which was then on the verge of expansion.
No doubt Korea Zinc’s investment is a signal of its interest in unlocking QLD’s northwest enormous mineral potential. Resources Minister and Member for Townsville Scott Stewart said the International Energy Agency’s(IEA) latest prediction is that 80% of growth in electricity demand will be in renewables to 2030. “That means more worldwide demand for critical minerals including cobalt, copper and vanadium,” Stewart continued. “Queensland has the metals needed for renewables and computers, tablets and mobile phones that will be in higher demand.”
Korea Zinc’s Vice Chairman, Yun Choi, said he sees great potential for CopperString to strengthen the industrial and clean energy ecosystem across the Townsville to Mount Isa corridor. “This regional economic development opportunity is important to Sun Metals and Korea Zinc, and is a strong element of our interest in supporting the CopperString project,” said Choi. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with the Palaszczuk Government and CopperString in relation to minerals processing, renewable energy and hydrogen development.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/29/australian-green-hydrogen-innovator-set-to-flip-the-philippines-coal-fired-fleet/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,PHILIPPINES",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 29, 2021",Australian green hydrogen innovator set to flip the Philippines’ coal-fired fleet,"In December 2020, S&P Global Platts awarded its Emerging Technology of the Year Award to Australian technology company Star Scientific for its Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser (HERO). Star Scientific’s technology can transition coal-fired electricity plants to green energy, desalinate water in a clean process, use green hydrogen to generate the high heats necessary for industrial processes and, in a similar vein, provide emissions-free warmth to large areas. 
This HERO technology with such varied and timely applications has now also caught the eye of the Philippines Department of Energy which this week announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Star Scientific to help the country’s push toward energy self-sufficiency and development through green hydrogen. 
As an archipelagic nation with large numbers of its people in isolated or remote regions the Philippines is heavily reliant on fossil fuels. It is the hope of the Department of Energy of the Republic of the Philippines (Department of Energy) that Star Scientific’s HERO technology will accelerate the green hydrogen revolution in the country, providing not only clean self-sufficient sources of energy but also water security. 
The MoU set out objectives for Star Scientific to retro-fit existing coal-fired power stations with HERO systems powered by green hydrogen. The two parties will also explore whether the Philippines’ large resources of offshore wind could be utilised toward this green hydrogen end. 
The Department of Energy is keen to utilise every application of the HERO system, including using it to help provide decentralised scalable power and desalination capabilities for all of the country’s inhabited islands. 
Star Scientific Global Group Chairman, Andrew Horvath, said he was proud that an Australian innovation had captured the attention of a national government that wanted to drive its economic development through an environmentally sustainable energy source for power generation and water desalination.

Horvath called the agreement “a significant milestone in the development of the global hydrogen economy.” Adding that this bold and holistic step by the Philippines was a sign that “we can begin to see the reality of whole economies turning over to hydrogen and a rapid acceleration to sustainable energy on a global scale.” 
In an interview with pv magazine in December, Horvath was not shy about the global interest in Star Scientific’s technology and Australia’s potential in developing the global hydrogen economy. “The Norwegians have been all over us” — Horvath said. And Northern Europe has been knocking down the virtual door because “They’re desperate to get off Russian gas.” 
Like many great inventions and advances in science, the HERO technology initially came about by accident. The discovery, which Horvath’s team of scientists and engineers were surprised to find absent from scientific literature and patent history, was of a “weird artefact with extraordinary properties. That artefact is now HERO, a coating which can be applied to a substrate, such as a metal or ceramic, and “when it comes into contact with hydrogen and oxygen, it goes from zero to over 700 degrees Celsius in three minutes.” 
Image: Star Scientific
Such a discovery was quickly realised to have enormous potential, particularly in the use of hydrogen instead of coal to heat steam to generate electricity at power plants.
“Because it’s not burning, it’s a reaction, all that energy is excitement energy and it goes straight through the substrate. So our energy transfer is above 90% into whatever you’re transferring it to, whether it’s water, CO2, whatever medium.”

U.S. manufacturer Boeing-Spectrolab – which works with solar for space exploration – announced it will build six more solar arrays for the International Space Station (ISS) operated by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The six arrays, which will have a total surface of 19x6m and a combined capacity of 120 kW, will provide an increase of up to 30% in installed power for the station, which already relies on eight solar arrays. “The arrays will provide [the] ISS with electricity to sustain its systems and equipment, plus augment the electricity available to continue a wide variety of public and private experiments and research in the station’s unique microgravity environment,” Boeing group said.

In a press release, NASA said that the new solar arrays will bring the total installed PV capacity of the ISS station to 215 kW. “Each new solar array will produce more than 20 kW of electricity, eventually totalling 120 kW (120,000 W) of augmented power during orbital daytime,” the agency specified. “In addition, the remaining uncovered solar array pair and partially uncovered original arrays will continue to generate approximately 95 kW of power for a total of up to 215 kW (215,000 W) of power available to support station operations at completion.”
The solar systems will be brought to the ISS in pairs in the unpressurised trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft during three resupply missions starting this year. “The installation of each solar array will require two spacewalks: one to prepare the worksite with a modification kit and another to install the new solar array,” NASA further explained.
California-based Deployable Space Systems, a provider of deployable structures and deployable solar arrays for satellites and spacecraft, will manufacture the six new PV systems, with Spectrolab supplying its XTJ Prime high-efficiency solar cells for the arrays. “The XTJ Prime space solar cells are much more efficient than any of their predecessors and are fit to support the cutting-edge research being done aboard the International Space Station,” said Spectrolab president Tony Mueller, without disclosing further technical details.

The Indonesian economy has grown impressively over the past two decades and its energy demand has also increased exponentially. Despite a strong need for more power generation capacity, the country’s electricity mix is still dominated by thermal power plants, and new plants from renewable energy sources are coming online at a very slow pace. Solar, for example, reached a cumulative PV capacity of only 181.2 MW at the end of September, according to the report Indonesia Energy Transition Outlook 2021, published by the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR).
This installed power comes from 30.4 MW of rooftop PV, 61 MW of ground-mounted PV plants and 82 MW of off-grid solar power generators. The newly installed solar capacity for the first nine months of 2020 was 28.8 MW, of which 15 MW was for two utility scale projects selected in an auction held in 2018, and 13.7 MW for rooftop installations. For comparison, the country added around 46.2 MW of PV systems in 2019 and only 14 MW in 2018.
The authors of the report stressed that solar is currently the second fastest growing renewable energy source in the country, after hydropower, and that, however, it is lagging far behind the intermediate 800 MW target established by the National Energy General Plan (RUEN) for PV technology by 2020.
The RUEN has also set another 6.5 GW intermediate target for solar by 2025 and an ultimate target of 17.5 GW by 2030. The IESR experts believe the first of the two targets may be eventually achieved if a series of projects and initiatives announced by the Indonesian authorities begin to take shape and materialise.
According to the report, a big contribution for making the ambitious target achievable may come from two gigawatt-sized solar projects that the Indonesian government is hoping to build at two depleted mining sites – a 1.25 GW scheme in the Bangka Belitung islands, off the southeastern coast of Sumatra, and a 1 GW solar park in the West Kutai regency, in the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan. “Nothing concrete has been done for now but the plan has been mentioned several times by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM),” Marlistya Citraningrum, the program manager for sustainable energy access at the IESR, told pv magazine.
Furthermore, according to her, Indonesian utility PT PLN (Persero) has also recently revealed it conducted several studies for deploying PV at mining sites in Kalimantan and Sumatra, and state-owned mining company PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam Tbk (Bukit Asam) has also expressed interest in building solar facilities across several mining sites.
Moreover, the Indonesian government is targeting to install around 857 MW across Java and Sumatra, where several potential sites have already been identified. “In March 2020, [PT] PLN invited pre-selected developers to bid in two separate 50 MW solar projects in Central Java and West Java,” the report notes. “However, according to a source involved in the process, both tenders were postponed until further notice by [PT] PLN due to the [Covid-19] pandemic. There are no other ground-mounted solar project bidding [exercises] this year.”
Despite the lower than expected development, the utility scale segment is already showing interesting prices, including the $0.0581/kWh tariff agreed in a PPA for the 145 MW floating PV plant under construction on a 225ha section of the Cirata Reservoir in West Java. Furthermore, local utility PT Indonesia Power has tendered, last year, two floating PV projects with capacities of 60 MW and 90 MW, respectively, and final prices came in at $0.0374/kWh and $0.0368/kWh, respectively. More details on the two procurement exercises were not disclosed by the report.
Furthermore, the IESR analysts expect more growth will come for rooftop PV from the $1 billion Surya Nusantara program which is expected to be kicked off this year, and from the SOEs Synergy initiative, which is another scheme for rooftop PV currently under development aimed at supporting commercial and industrial projects and to reach 1.4 GW of installed capacity by 2025. According to recent statistics from the government, the country currently has 18.2 MW of PV systems under net metering, with 7.7 MW of the total coming from 16 industrial power consumers. Another 5.1 MW comes from residential consumers while 1.8 MW is run by small-sized businesses. The remaining capacity is owned by public entities.
