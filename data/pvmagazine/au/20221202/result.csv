The 30 MW one-hour duration battery will be co-located at CWP’s 270 MW Sapphire Wind Farm near Glen Innes in the state’s New England region.
CWP Renewables, which has also secured planning approval from the NSW Department of Planning and Environment for a 180 MW solar project to be built alongside the wind farm, said its Sapphire battery is the first big battery to receive approval to connect to an existing generation plant at the same connection point in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
CWP Renewables Chief Executive Jason Willoughby described the approvals process as “technically challenging” but said the connection approval would give the Australian clean energy industry confidence that battery energy storage could be added to existing generation projects.
“We’re proud to be leading the way in obtaining the approval under the current regulatory framework,” he said, adding the project is a critical component of offering firmed renewable electricity.
“The transition to renewable energy requires the likes of firming projects such as Sapphire battery, which can help smooth out the variability of wind and solar generation,” he said. “We have agreements with a large range of corporate customers who want to source firmed renewable energy to match their usage and this project brings us another step closer.”

Richard Lowe, chief executive of Lumea, TransGrid’s commercial arm, said the connection approval for the project is a significant step for the growth of renewables and storage in Australia.
“Energy storage is an important part of laying the foundations to deliver grid stability and connectivity as we transition,” he said. “The Sapphire BESS project exemplifies the collaboration required to move forward at pace.”
Construction of the Sapphire battery is expected to start early next year following financial close, with the facility expected to be operational in 2024.
CWP Renewables said the battery will store excess energy from the wind farm and the grid, with the ability to feed electricity back into the grid during times of low generation or high demand. The battery’s fast response means it will also be able to provide frequency control services, which stabilise the grid and improve power quality.
CWP Renewables, which currently operates and owns 650 MW of renewable energy assets in the NEM and has another 5 GW of wind, storage and firming projects in its near-medium term development portfolio, said the Sapphire BESS is its first battery energy storage project.
It also has approval for a 150 MW battery to be co-located with its 414 MW Uungula Wind Farm in the NSW central west and it expects its future wind farm projects to also include battery storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/02/aemo-rolls-out-roadmap-to-100-renewables/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",AEMO rolls out roadmap to 100% renewables,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has published its latest assessment of what is required to ensure the National Electricity Market (NEM) can securely and reliably operate at 100% instantaneous renewable penetration for the first time by as early as 2025.
The Engineering Roadmap to 100% Renewables report provides an overview of the technical, engineering, and operational challenges and actions needed to enable Australia’s main interconnected power system to operate solely on renewable generation including grid-scale wind and solar, pumped hydro, storage, and rooftop PV.
AEMO said the increasing proportion of renewable energy generation in the NEM, alongside the decommissioning of fossil-fuel generation, is leading to a “once-in-a-lifetime change” in the way the energy system is designed and operated.
AEMO Chief Executive Daniel Westerman said Australia’s NEM will rapidly cross uncharted operational conditions yet to be experienced here or in comparable power systems internationally.
“Operating a gigawatt-scale power system at 100% instantaneous renewable generation is a feat unparalleled worldwide,” he said.
AEMO said to satisfy more regular operation at 100% renewable penetration, the power system will require additional engineering solutions to provide essential system services to maintain a stable electrical voltage and frequency and ensure a secure state of operation. Proven technologies such as synchronous condensers will play a role, alongside newer technologies such as grid-forming inverters.

The Australian government is targeting 82% of energy in the NEM from renewable sources by the end of the decade as part of its legislated target of a 43% reduction in 2005-level emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
Modelling conducted by AEMO indicates Australia’s main grid could reach 100% instantaneous renewables by as early as 2025, initially for a half-hour period but eventually the periods of operating entirely on renewables will become more frequent and longer in duration.
Westerman said it is critical to prepare for the first instance of any new operational condition in advance of that condition arising, and preparing for that first instance often also enables the system to operate under that condition on a regular basis.
“Australia is transitioning from a historic dependency on coal generation to higher levels of renewable energy, supported by firming technologies, like pumped hydro, batteries and gas generation, and transmission developments to share low-cost sources of energy to our towns and cities,” he said. “Complementing these investments is the shared responsibility to also re-engineer the power system to run reliably and securely on higher levels of renewable energy.”
While the report is focused on the NEM, the roadmap is intended to deliver national benefits, with learnings applied to Western Australia’s South West Interconnected System and Wholesale Electricity Market.

The roadmap is divided into three broad technical themes – power system security, system operability and resource adequacy – with associated preconditions and actions to operate the NEM for periods of up to 100% renewable generation.
Westerman said the roadmap provides a clear view of the urgent engineering and operational steps required to be ready to leverage the benefits of high renewable generation levels.
This includes investigating new sources of firming capacity, system restoration, and system strength services, including energy storage.  Initial analysis indicates the equivalent of up to 40 large synchronous condensers may be needed for 100% renewable penetration, potentially provided by a range of technologies.
“Importantly, further work will be needed to ensure that any investment decisions to deliver the engineering requirements are made in the long-term interests of consumers, and underpinned by efficient regulatory and market solutions,” Westerman said.
AEMO will host a webinar on Feb. 3, 2023, providing interested stakeholders with an overview of the Engineering Roadmap to 100% Renewables, along with an opportunity to ask questions of the report’s authors.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/02/nsw-holiday-cottage-home-to-green-hydrogen-saps-trial/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,HYDROGEN,MICROGRID,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",NSW holiday cottage home to green hydrogen SAPS trial,"Electricity infrastructure company Essential Energy has teamed with the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) to trial a standalone power system (SAPS) that will convert electricity from a solar plant to make green hydrogen which will be used to power a holiday cottage on the state’s Mid-North Coast.
The integrated system, installed at the historic Cutlers Cottage located in the New South Wales (NSW) Myall Lakes National Park, includes a 23 kW ground-mounted solar array and a hydrogen electrolyser with accompanying storage system. The green hydrogen will be used to power a fuel cell capable of generating 425 KWh of dispatchable renewable electricity.
The head of NPWS, Atticus Fleming, said the system, which also includes a battery energy storage system and back-up generator, delivers energy like any other rooftop solar system and stores power as hydrogen for conversion into electricity at night or when loads are high. This largely eliminates the need for back-up diesel generators.

Fleming said Essential Energy is funding the 18-month trial to determine if standalone green hydrogen power systems can be rolled out as a reliable and affordable clean energy alternative for customers in remote regional and rural locations.
“The NPWS is uniquely placed to trial innovative renewable energy solutions as … the custodian of visitor facilities in many remote and wilderness locations across NSW,” he said. “A key pillar of our plan is embracing new energy technologies to deliver low-impact visitor experiences and preserve the natural environment.”
Cutlers Cottage is located at the water’s edge of Two Mile Lake north of Hawks Nest in the Myall Lakes National Park.The original cottage was built in 1910 by Maud Cutler. In 2002, the cottage was restored before being made available as holiday accommodation.
Fleming said the trial could potentially provide a future renewable energy solution for remote visitor facilities in national parks across the state.

Essential Energy, whose electricity network covers 737,000 square kilometres, and services regional, rural and remote communities across 95% of NSW and parts of southern Queensland, is investigating the introduction of SAPS as part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen network efficiency and resilience.
The state-owned network service provider has previously said the deployment of SAPS can provide significant benefits for customers, particularly those in regional and remote locations. Transitioning eligible customers to energy supplied by SAPS allows the “poles and wires” of the traditional electricity infrastructure to be removed.
The installation of the integrated solar and green hydrogen SAPS follows the recent commissioning of Australia’s first hybrid solar and renewable hydrogen microgrid.
Western Australia government-owned utility Horizon Power last month commissioned a demonstration plant that will utilise solar and green hydrogen generation and storage to help power the coastal town of Denham.
Once fully operational, the $9.3 million (USD 6.2 million) Denham Hydrogen Demonstration Plant is expected to be able to power about 100 households or 20% of Denham’s residents and businesses and offset about 140,000 litres of diesel a year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/02/woodside-lands-agreement-for-50-mw-solar-project-in-wa/,"INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 2, 2022",Woodside lands agreement for 50 MW solar project in WA,"In January 2022, Australian fossil fuels giant Woodside Energy revealed plans to build a 500 MW solar facility and 400 MWh battery energy storage system near Karratha, in Western Australia’s northwest, to help power its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility. This week, the oil and gas major announced it has secured an agreement with the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation (NAC) for land on which to build the first 50 MW solar project and associated battery system.
Woodside said it has entered into a bilateral Indigenous Land Use Agreement and a modern benefits-sharing and relationship agreement with the NAC. The agreement relates to lands being investigated for the proposed Woodside Power Project to be built at Maitland, about 15 kilometres southwest of Karratha.
The initial project comprises a 50 MW solar energy plant complemented by a battery energy storage system but Woodside said there is potential to expand the power opportunity to a maximum of 500 MW if customer demand warrants it.
The project will supply renewable energy to industrial customers in the region, including its own Pluto LNG export facility.
All transmission of power from the solar facility is to be delivered via the Horizon Power-operated section of the North West Interconnected System (NWIS) to its customers.
Woodside said it has progressed environmental studies for the project and submitted a referral to the Environmental Protection Authority in Nov. 2021. The company said it is continuing to work with preferred developers, Pacific Energy Group and Horizon Power, on development of the solar generation, battery energy storage system and transmission infrastructure required for the project.
Woodside Chief Executive Meg O’Neill said the agreement with the NAC will allow the project to progress.
“We have been engaging with NAC regarding the power opportunity since 2019 and the agreements are a significant milestone to celebrate together,” she said. “We look forward to continuing to work with NAC and Ngarluma people as we progress the power opportunity.”
The agreements set out a framework for the delivery of social and economic benefits to NAC and Ngarluma people in connection with the power opportunity, and outline how Woodside and NAC will work together to develop the power opportunity, including the management of cultural heritage.
The deal comes on the back of Woodside’s successful proposal to deliver a 600 MW green hydrogen megaproject in New Zealand.
Woodside is certainly not alone when it comes to solar uptake in the Pilbara after Rio Tinto announced plans to invest $600 million (USD 402 million) in the construction of two new solar farms and battery energy storage systems as part of its efforts to decarbonise.
