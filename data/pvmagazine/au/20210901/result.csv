The company says the car features a 200 kW motor system, 66 kW and optional 90 kW fuel cell systems and 60-100 kW output energy storage systems between battery and super capacitor units. The Warrego has a 500km driving range and a refuelling time of between three and five minutes.
With its hybrid system, H2X says the vehicle can on pure hydrogen, “drastically” reducing refuelling time while increasing driving range and hydrogen efficiency.

The company described the Warrego as the first in a “range of uniquely designed and developed fuel cell electric vehicles” it plans to release over the next 24 months.
In November 2020, the H2X Marine, the boat building arm of fledgling automotive manufacturer, announced a partnership with Queensland-based ship building specialist WildCat Marine to manufacture a range hydrogen-fuelled passenger ferries for industrial and commercial uses.
Fuel cell vehicles are predicted to face an uphill battle competing with more mature electric vehicle technologies for light vehicles and passenger cars, but there is much interest in using hydrogen to transport heavy trucks, ferries, ships and planes.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/01/solar-carpark-now-powering-wollongongs-council/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2021",Solar carpark now powering Wollongong’s council,"Wollongong, which sits south of Sydney on the New South Wales coast, has become the latest city to embrace solar carparks. On Tuesday, the Wollongong City Council announced the installation of 549 panels atop its multi-storey Stewart Street carpark was complete.
The system, which peaks at 219.6 kW, is expected to generate about 316 MWh annually – enough to power about a quarter of the council Administration Building’s operational electricity needs. The council’s target is to reach net zero emissions for its operations by 2030.
The solar system is supported by steel frames under which cars can park, an increasingly popular solution for commercial systems in Australia, especially at shopping centres.

“The installation of these panels is a step in the right direction for all of Wollongong by helping reduce emissions and reliance on grid derived power. We hope projects like these inspire our community to consider renewable energy options for their own homes and businesses,” Wollongong City Lord Mayor Councillor Gordon Bradbery said.
Wollongong Council Administration Building already has a 6 Green Star rating, which is the highest rating from the Green Building Council of Australia. According to Wollongong City Council’s Director of Infrastructure and Works, Andrew Carfield, this is an impressive achievement as it is the oldest building with this rating to join a select group of commercially operated buildings rated at that standard.
More broadly, the Wollongong Council is targeting zero emissions by 2050 for its entire local government area, which has a population of over 200,000. Moreover, the city is home to Bluescope’s Port Kembla steelworks, with industry accounting for the vast majority of the area’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Port Kembla is slated to become one of the state’s first hydrogen hubs, and with Swedish steelmaker SSAB delivering its first “green steel” made from hydrogen just last week, the hub could be a game changer for the area’s transition.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/01/spinning-against-a-wall-aussie-athletes-scold-government-inaction-as-enduring-country-myth-disproven/,"HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2021",Spinning against a wall: Aussie athletes scold government inaction as enduring country myth disproven,"Cracks are becoming chasms as a number of the accepted truths politicians lean on, like sport being an apolitical unifier and country Australia not caring about climate change, are shredded. 
This week, 370 elite Australian athletes from over 35 sports joined a campaign led by former Wallabies captain, David Pocock, calling on Australian leaders to take serious and science-based steps to address the climate crisis. The initiative, named The Cool Down, included an open letter in which the sportspeople said the climate crisis and resulting increase in extreme weather was “threatening the sports and country we love.”

Signatories includes a range of household names like Pat Cummins, Lance Franklin, Liz Ellis, Cate and Bronte Campbell, Mick Fanning, Craig Foster, Nat Fyfe, Daisy Pearce, Ian Chappell, Mark Webber, and hundreds more.
The initiative was launched on the same day the results of Australia’s most expansive climate survey were released, commissioned by the Australian Conservation Fund (ACF). Contrary to federal government’s rhetoric that climate action is championed only by latte-sipping inner-city ‘wokes’, the poll found one in four rural voters say climate change is the single most important issue for them in the next election, with half of Coalition voters wanting greater climate action.

In fact, the survey found the majority of voters in traditional ‘coal seats’ across New South Wales and Queensland do not support new coal and gas plants, revealing a shift even among the communities who stand to gain in the short-term from the government’s continued fossil fuel support.
“This polling shatters the myth there’s one view in the bush about climate change and another in the city,” ACF Chief Executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said.
Australian Conservation Fund (ACF)
The majority of voters in every one of the nation’s 151 federal electorates believes the Morrison government should be doing more to tackle climate change, the survey discovered.
The federal government yesterday released the national greenhouse gas emission data in the period to March 2021, spinning the 5% decrease since March 2019 as a success. Few seem to have bought the slant, with analysts saying the decrease reveals little other than the pandemic’s effect of grinding transport and mining to a halt.
In terms of trends, emissions actually increased by 0.3% from the December to the March quarter,  coinciding with Covid-19 rebounds. Angus Taylor, the federal government’s Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, nonetheless touted the results as “meeting and beating” our Paris targets, which committed the country to a modest 26-28% cut in emissions from 2005 levels – a target now understood to be painfully insufficient and globally irrelevant.
Australian government
Even in meeting the unambitious goal, senior researcher with the Climate Council, Tim Baxer, says the federal government are not to thank. Rather, he told The Guardian, the emissions cuts since 2005 were overwhelmingly the result of states reducing land-clearing and deforestation, which is made evident by toggling through the different sector emissions data on the government’s interactive graph. With land use and forestry excluded, emissions fell just 2.9% between 2005 and 2021.
With just 61 days before the Glasgow climate summit (Cop26), the government is expected to release its long-term climate plan before the meeting. The climate plan was rather conveniently delayed last year due to the pandemic, but will be expected among the global community which has already singled out Australia as a climate laggard.
Australian Conservation Fund (ACF)
Hopes for a late pivot seem somewhat unlikely though with Australian Industry Group, the country’s largest employer group, revealing in August that it hasn’t been consulted on any plans to date. Nonetheless, the federal government has come under increasing pressure to join the hundreds of countries which have set net zero targets for 2050 or earlier.
Perhaps now, having lost its imagined base and its sports stars, the Morrison government is indeed rethinking its strategy.

Researchers from the Fraunhofer Society (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft) in Germany are currently cooperating to improve production processes for electrolysers and reduce their production costs.
The four-year project is aimed at virtually reproducing the best and most economical processes as so-called digital twins and transferring them to a technology kit so that industrial companies can check the production costs they can expect for certain types of electrolysers before planning production. The goal is to reduce the cost of producing electrolysers for green hydrogen by more than a quarter. The federal government is funding the research project with €22 million through the H2Giga hydrogen project.
“We are building a digital library of future-proof electrolyser manufacturing processes with which the investment costs and even the return on investment can be determined in advance depending on the planned production volume, vertical range of manufacture and manufacturing variants,” said Ulrike Beyer, head of the hydrogen task force at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU. The resulting technology kit will give the electrolyser industry a real boost and an enormous innovation impact, she added.
The researchers pointed out that there are currently only a few electrolyser manufacturers on the market and that these tend to serve niche markets with small volumes.
In addition to the Fraunhofer IWU, four other institutes of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft are contributing with their expertise: The Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology IPT in Aachen; the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA in Stuttgart; the Fraunhofer Institute for Electronic Nano Systems ENAS in Chemnitz; and the Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of Materials and Systems IMWS in Halle (Saale). The Fraunhofer IWU is contributing a new multi-pass rolling process for bipolar plates (BPP), which implements the channel geometries in the anodes and cathodes. Quality control will also be further developed. The contribution of the Fraunhofer IPT includes the research of new production technology solutions for the manufacture of the catalyst coated membrane (CCM), the porous transport layer (PTL) and the bipolar plates.
The Fraunhofer IPA will map the individual production modules of a reference factory, which will be set up at the participating institutes. The Fraunhofer ENAS will deal with the qualification of the digital inkjet printing process as a manufacturing process for the CCM, which is a central component of electrolysers. The Fraunhofer IMWS is focusing on the characterisation of electrolyser components and systems, which enable the early identification of possible weak points and defects in industrial use.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/01/new-alkali-metal-chlorine-battery-promises-6x-energy-density/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,TAIWAN,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2021",New alkali metal-chlorine battery promises 6x energy density,"From pv magazine Global
For scientists working on improving today’s energy storage technologies, energy density is among the key factors – increasing this could allow for batteries that store more in energy in less space, and run for longer in between charges.
A group of scientists led by Stanford University has demonstrated a new battery chemistry that reached 1,200 milliamp-hours per gram of positive electrode material – around six times higher than today’s commercially available lithium-ion batteries. With further work to scale up the batteries and improve on cycle life, the group is convinced that the new sodium or lithium chloride batteries could be used to power sensors and satellites, and in other situations where regular charging is not practical.
The group was actually working on thionyl-chloride, commonly used for single-use batteries, when it first made the discovery of a reversible reaction involving chlorine and sodium chloride. They have since spent several years experimenting with different materials to improve the efficiency of this reaction, and have now seen encouraging results thanks to an electrode made of a porous carbon material, developed at the National Chung Cheng University of Taiwan.
The battery is described in the paper Rechargeable Na/Cl2 and Li/Cl2 batteries, published in Nature. The group worked with an aluminium chloride electrolyte with fluoride additives, and either sodium or lithium as the negative electrode. The battery works via redox reactions at either side. “The chlorine molecule is being trapped and protected in the tiny pores of the carbon nanospheres when the battery is charged,” explained Stanford scientist Guanzhou Zhu. “Then, when the battery needs to be drained or discharged, we can discharge the battery and convert chlorine to make NaCl – table salt – and repeat this process over many cycles. We can cycle up to 200 times currently and there’s still room for improvement.”
The group says that the prototype developed for the paper might already be suitable for use in small devices such as hearing aids, and that they envision the battery one day being used to power sensors or satellites – applications where frequent recharging is impossible or impractical.
They acknowledge, however, that turning the promising discovery of a reversible reaction for chemical energy storage into an actual practical battery will be a lengthy and challenging process. “For consumer electronics or electrical vehicles, much more work remains to engineer the battery structure, increase the energy density, scale up the batteries and increase the number of cycles,” they conclude.
