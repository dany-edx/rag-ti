The offtake gives AGL Energy the ability to hedge its customer load by virtually charging and discharging a battery of 70 MW at any time over 5 minutes trading intervals. 
Neoen plans to leverage its 100 MW Capital Battery in Canberra to provide the offering, saying the Capital Battery will retain its ability to deliver network services. Construction on Neoen’s 100 MW / 200 MWh Capital Battery began in December 2021 and the battery expected to start operating in the first half of 2023.
Neoen said the ‘virtual battery’ solution is “ideally suited” to managing the increasing challenges of the solar “duck curve” which sees oversupply in daylight hours followed by demand peaks in the evenings which challenge energy companies.
“This innovative and flexible offtake is extremely useful for a large electricity user or retailer by conceptually ‘charging’ the battery during low demand periods and ‘discharging’ it during high demand periods,” Neoen said. “This can be scaled to precisely accommodate the size that the customer needs,” it added.

The virtual battery capacity will be made available in the NSW region of Australia’s National Electricity Market.
“The virtual battery is an ideal firming tool which will become a core Neoen product and a key element in the success of our expanding range of client offerings,” Neoen Australia’s Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said.
“With the Capital Battery currently under construction, we will soon be operating grid-scale batteries in three of the five states of the National Electricity Market and have multiple storage projects in development across Australia.”

The Australian Vanadium Project, as it’s called, has a pre-tax net present value of A$833 million with an equity internal rate of return of over 20%, based on a vanadium pentoxide price of US$10.50/lb (equal to 0.45kg), the company said. 
Managing Director Vincent Algar described the study’s findings “significant milestone” for AVL. “The company is now in a position to progress through funding, final engineering, procurement, construction and into production,” he said.
Last month, the federal government awarded the project a grant of $49 million to support its progression, part of a push to end Australia’s reliance on China and cement its place in the rapidly growing critical minerals markets for electric vehicles and batteries.
There are currently just a handful of vanadium mines operating in the world, with Australia home to some of the world’s biggest untapped deposits. To this end, Algar told pv magazine Australia last July that Western Australia could “easily dominate the battery supply chain for vanadium inside and outside Australia.”

The project’s technical studies have now been completed, including three years of extensive piloting test work, which the company says supports robust processing flowsheets.
The Australian Vanadium Project mine is the first in a two pronged approach from the company which will see it turn the mined product into commercial vanadium battery electrolyte within Western Australia. 
The company is pursuing these two avenues, mining and manufacturing, as part of its vision of vertically integrate the business and “value add” – moving from Australia’s traditional role of simply extracting and exporting raw minerals to instead creating products from those materials onshore, which typically has far higher profit margins. 
Transported from the mine, the vanadium will be processed in Tenindewa, near Geraldton, closer to workforces as well as a port. 
The mine has an anticipated initial life of 25 years with the company saying its approvals are “well advanced.” The company confirmed its application with the Environmental Protection Agency had been successful lodged early last year, with its application for the Tenindewa processing plant concurrently being examined.
A financial investment decision is anticipated for the mining project by fourth quarter of 2022, with construction to commence in the fourth quarter of 2023, dependent on approvals and financing.

Wood Australia, an engineering firm with experience in vanadium and similar mineral processing, has undertaken the engineering and design, providing an overall accuracy for the capital and operating cost estimates of ±15%, AVL said.
The company estimates the project payback period will be 7.3 years after first production. Its total gross revenues before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is $4.4 billion, according to AVL.
“The positive economic results of the study have occurred in an environment of global inflationary pressure, COVID-19 related impacts and geopolitical instability,” Algar said in the company’s statement. “We have attempted to accommodate potential areas of challenge by building them into our assumptions and remaining agile when efficiency opportunities present.”
“The award of the $49m[illion] grant provides further vindication of the importance and relevance of the Australian Vanadium Project and we acknowledge the responsibility placed upon us, as all Australians are now stakeholders in our work.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/14/infinite-blue-energy-partners-with-indigenous-owned-boya-energy-for-wa-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 14, 2022",Infinite Blue Energy partners with Indigenous-owned Boya Energy for WA green hydrogen project,"Last month, Western Australian company Infinite Blue Energy (IBE) announced it will purchase the 11 MW Northam solar farm, situated an hour east of Perth, as the company looks to accelerate its green hydrogen project. This week, in collaboration with Stockhead, IBE announced it had reached an agreement with Indigenous-owned Boya Energy to build and develop its planned MEG HP1 green hydrogen plant. 
IBE intends to produce up to four tonnes of green hydrogen per day from the site, which will be partially consumed by WA-based waste management companies. 
The agreement sees Boya Energy take a 10% stake in the green hydrogen plant. Boya founder Gerry Matera said participation in this project aligns strongly with the values and vision of Boya Energy. 
“We are committed to fast-tracking the energy transition,” said Matera, “creating opportunities for Aboriginal people and businesses while preserving country. Production of green hydrogen is a key component in that story.” 
IBE CEO Stephen Gauld described Boya Energy as an “established business focused on providing a range of renewable energy solutions for business.” 
“We are thrilled to be partnering with Boya Energy,” Gauld continued, “as we look to develop this project on the Traditional Country of the Noongar People. This partnership highlights IBE’s commitment not just to fight climate change, but also to see Indigenous people and businesses benefit from green energy production on Traditional Country.” 
Considering IBE purchased the solar farm from Bookitja and Indigenous Business Australia, this is an interesting development. 
IBE is aiming to produce up to 4.4 tonnes of renewable hydrogen daily, which equates to roughly 1,600 tonnes annually. The plan is for the project to produce as early as 2023. It is targeting the domestic heavy transport industry for offtake.
MEG HP1 appears to be a warm-up of sorts, with Infinite Blue Energy more prominently showcasing its Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant, which it says will produce up to 25 tonnes of green hydrogen daily. Arrowsmith sits a fair way north of Perth, on the state’s coast. Infinite says this project will incorporate 65MW of solar and 90MW of wind in stage one, though timeframes for the project have not been given.
Back in the near term, the MEG HP1 project has won the support of the Western Australian Hydrogen Industry Minister, Alannah MacTiernan. “We see enormous potential for locally-generated renewable hydrogen to replace diesel in our heavy transport sector, helping to reduce carbon emissions and improving our fuel security,” she said.
“Indeed transport fuel probably offers one of the earliest opportunities for the emerging renewable hydrogen industry. Infinite Blue Energy’s MEG HP1 project is yet another positive step forward for renewable hydrogen in WA, and will play an important role in helping to stimulate early demand for hydrogen.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/14/queensland-coal-trips-boosting-solars-sunset-revenue/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 14, 2022",Queensland coal trips boosting solar’s sunset revenue ,"In recent months energy market analysts Cornwall Insight Australia (CIA) have been following a “substantial number of high price intervals in Queensland” caused by tripping fossil fuel plants. 
Looking at the month of March, increased market demand on March 9 and the concurrent tripping of Gladstone units 3 and 4 on March 31 saw energy prices spoke to $8,800/MWh and $15,100/MWh, respectively. According to CIA these price spikes occurred between 5pm and 7pm when solar generation’s share in output was approximately 4%. 
CIA is quick to point out these spikes only occur for a small portion of time “and it is not necessarily a daily pattern that solar operators can take advantage of regularly; however, the ability of solar to capture at least some portion of evening peak pricing will be key to its continued long term profitability.” 

The above graph shows how extreme price events (>$10,000/MWh) between the hours of 5pm and 7pm did push up solar revenues. What is more interesting however is that 60 of those five minute intervals when prices spiked to extreme levels between 5pm and 8pm ensured the last few hours before sunset were the most valuable (assuming the solar farm was not constrained at the time). 
According to CIA, “market players with flexible portfolios (solar and co-located battery storage) will have more options to capture price spikes through energy shifting or FCAS markets. 
Those also set to profit are the solar farms farther west (such as South Australia), whose extra solar hours during peak time on the east coast ensure they’re better positioned. 
WattClarity’s Paul McCardle has been following the coal and gas outages across the National Electricity Market (NEM), noting four units offline in Queensland last week, including one of Gladstone’s six units and three at Callide, including Callide C4, which is expected to be out of business for a year. 
There are also gas unit outages to be noticed, including Swanbank E, which is expected to be offline for a number of months, and outages at Darling Downs CCGT. 
In a Smart Energy Council webinar “The Energy Transition: Grappling with the Challenges”, McCardle noted the rise in baseload prices, led by Queensland, can at least be partially put down to the continual generator outages. But McCardle also noted: “Because of what is happening in Europe, any power station that is supplied by coal on a rail line with a connected export port (so, think Newcastle and Gladstone), potentially could be exposed to global coal prices which have gone through the roof.”
Nevertheless, according to a report from Canberra-based think-tank The Australia Institute’s Gas & Coal Watch, Queensland’s Kogan Creek Power Station is the single most unreliable generating unit on the NEM, breaking down 13 times over a two-year survey period. 
In all, the report recovered 93 breakdowns at Queensland gas and coal-power stations in that period. Dan Cass, energy policy and regulatory lead at The Australia Institute, told pv magazine that “Australia is on a steep learning curve keeping up with rapid and disorderly coal retirements. The most important insurance policy is to build more big batteries like Hornsdale Power Reserve.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/14/uk-government-warns-of-global-warming-risks-related-to-hydrogen-leaks/,"HYDROGEN,SUSTAINABILITY,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 14, 2022",UK government warns of global warming risks related to hydrogen leaks,"From pv magazine Global
The UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has published a report describing the possible impacts of an emerging international hydrogen economy on the global climate.
Scientists from the University of Cambridge and the University of Reading explored the atmospheric impacts caused by hydrogen leakage. They calculated the radiative forcing resulting from hydrogen emissions and the global warming potential of hydrogen.
“Any leakage of hydrogen will affect atmospheric composition (with implications for air quality) and have an indirect warming effect on climate, partially offsetting some of the climate benefits of the reduction in carbon dioxide,” the scientists warned, noting that hydrogen leakage also reduces the tropospheric concentration of hydroxyl radicals. “Increases in tropospheric ozone, water vapour and methane, consequent on increases in atmospheric hydrogen, would all tend to increase radiative forcing, partially offsetting the climate benefits of a switch to hydrogen.”
Radiative forcing is a parameter defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that measures influence a given climatic factor has on the amount of downward-directed radiant energy impinging upon Earth’s surface.
The British scientists developed a new way to calculate Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for gases whose emissions result in indirect radiative forcings. It considers the lifetime of a gas in addition to the lifetimes of the radiatively active gases causing the indirect forcing.
“This allows GWPs arising from indirect forcings to be calculated for gases with intermediate and longer lifetimes, such as hydrogen,” the scientists said. Several scenarios describing the atmospheric response to changes in the emissions of hydrogen were modelled and hydrogen leakage was found to affect the concentration of methane, ozone and water vapour in the atmosphere. 
“The changes in radiative forcing, like the changes in atmospheric composition, indicate that, to maximise the climate and air quality benefit of a transition to a hydrogen-powered economy, minimisation of both hydrogen leakage and a reduction of the ancillary emissions of, for example, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and volatile organic compounds is required,” the scientists concluded.
