The EnergyConnect project, a joint venture between Transgrid and SA’s transmission network owner ElectraNet, will link Wagga Wagga in NSW to Robertstown in South Australia, via Buronga with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs, in Victoria.
The submission of the EIS comes just weeks after the South Australian component of the project was granted environmental approval by that state government while the NSW government provided approval for the western section of the route, from Buronga to the NSW/SA border, in September.
The eastern section of the 900km high-voltage electricity transmission line encompasses the link from Buronga to Wagga Wagga.
The EIS for the eastern section includes a key link between Dinawan and Wagga Wagga, which will be upgraded to facilitate additional capacity for the Victoria NSW Interconnector (VNI) West and the planned South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
This upgrade will avoid upgrading the same part of the network when the VNI West interconnector is built between NSW and Victoria.

Transgrid executive manager of delivery Craig Stallan said the network operator and its construction partner SecureEnergy have already commenced early works on the EnergyConnect project and are mobilised in anticipation of a busy year in the state’s west.
“Construction is due to start by June this year on the NSW section of the 900km electricity transmission interconnector linking Robertstown in South Australia to Wagga Wagga and Red Cliffs in Victoria,” he said.
“We are excited to get shovels in the ground and build this critical infrastructure which will prove a game changer for electricity customers and the National Electricity Market (NEM).”
The EnergyConnect project shapes as the missing link in the NEM with proponents claiming it will enhance power system security and allow for the further development and integration of renewable generation into the nation’s main grid.
Transgrid will deliver the bulk of the interconnector, approximately 700km of transmission assets from the NSW/SA border to Wagga Wagga.

The network operator confirmed in mid-2021 it would invest $1.834 billion in the project, predicting it will save NSW customers $180 million per year, create up to 1,500 jobs and contribute a further $4 billion in economic activity for the state.
“The NSW government declared the NSW section as Critical State Significant Infrastructure in 2019,” Stallan said.
“We believe this project will change the energy landscape for the eastern seaboard states and enable the energy transition, bringing a reduction in carbon emissions and helping the nation meet its climate change targets.”
ElectraNet will contribute $457.4 million  to build the transmission line on the SA side of the border.
Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) will also spend almost $300 million on the project, which was given the green light by the Australian Energy Regulator on May 31.
The NSW Minister for Planning and Public Spaces will decide on the EIS for the Eastern section, following the completion of a review by the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/27/ugl-secures-solar-projects-as-part-of-296-million-works-package/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 27, 2022",UGL secures solar projects as part of $296 million works package,"UGL, part of the Sydney-headquartered Cimic Group, has been awarded the design and works contract for the 88 MW Mica Creek Solar Farm project being developed near Mount Isa in regional Queensland after Australian natural gas and electricity company APA Group’s recent decision to push ahead with stage two of the renewable energy project.
UGL has been appointed to perform design and construction works at the $150 million project which comprises the solar farm, substation and transmission line.
The company’s engagement at the Mica Creek Solar Farm will coincide with works stage two of the Tailem Bend Solar Farm in South Australia after UGL secured the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the project.
Singapore-based developer Vena Energy awarded UGL the EPC contract for the 87 MW second stage of the Tailem Bend Solar Farm and associated substation upgrade works.
The $200 million project, to be constructed adjacent to the operational 95 MW Tailem Bend Solar Farm about 100km north of Adelaide, also includes provisions for a 40 MW Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).

UGL managing director Doug Moss said the company, which recently completed work on the Victorian Big Battery project in Victoria and the Wallgrove Grid Battery project in New South Wales (NSW), is a market leader in Australian renewables projects, and in the design and construction of high-voltage transmission lines.
“The Mica Creek project will be UGL’s third solar project for APA Group and the Tailem Bend 2 project is a continuation of the work we performed with Vena Energy on the adjacent site,” he said.
The Tailem Bend and Mica Creek works contracts are among a package of recently awarded design and EPC contracts in the renewables and utilities sectors that will deliver UGL a combined revenue of more than $296 million.
The firm has also been awarded the design and construction contract for two 330 kV switching stations and the construction of approximately 65km of double circuit transmission line for the MacIntyre Wind Farm Precinct connection project for Powerlink in southwest Queensland.
Work on the $150 million Mica Creek Solar Farm is set to commence this year after Australian energy infrastructure company APA Group recently confirmed it had secured a 15-year offtake agreement to supply energy from the second stage of the 88 MW project to Mount Isa Mines (MIM).
APA, which operates a $22 billion portfolio of gas and electricity assets across the country, announced late last month it had reached a Final Investment Decision (FID) to build stage two of the Mica Creek Solar Farm.

That announcement came just one month after APA gave the go-ahead to build the first 44 MW stage of the solar farm after entering a 15-year offtake agreement with zinc miner MMG Dugald River (MMG).
APA CEO and managing director Rob Wheals said the company is already investigating a potential expansion for a third stage of the solar farm, which will be located near the existing gas-fired Diamantina Power Station Complex.
“We now have two major APA customers supporting both stages of the 88 MW Mica Creek Solar Farm with agreements to supply renewable electricity to their Mount Isa operations, demonstrating the enthusiasm of customers in the region for integrated energy solutions that can both meet their energy needs and help reduce their operational emissions,” he said.
“With supply of renewable energy for the two initial stages now under contract, APA is investigating a potential expansion for a third stage, following strong interest from customers.”
The APA contract with UGL is expected to be completed in 2023, with both stages of the Mica Creek Solar Farm expected to be operational by mid-2023.
The contract for the Tailem Bend Solar farm is also expected to be completed in 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/27/australia-must-spark-a-new-road-to-sustainability/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Australia must spark a new road to sustainability,"Australia’s commitment to delivering net zero emissions by 2050 must shape the way we get back on our roads post COVID-19.
With the nation currently re-emerging from lockdowns against the backdrop of COP26, it’s the perfect time to implement a new approach to urban transport. In particular, a plan to address Australia’s car dependency and a clear timeline to phase out fossil fuels on our roads are needed.
Pre-COVID, transport was Australia’s third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions (96MtCO2e per year). Today that figure is down 13.2%.
If we are to play our part in the crucial global energy transition, we must adopt electric mass transport such as e-buses to help mitigate an anticipated 60% rise in CO2 emissions from transportation by 2050.
The benefits of e-bus adoption are significant, accounting for a 60-tonne CO2 saving per year by just one e-bus running 200 kilometres per day.
Additionally, there are benefits to public health with cancer, asthma and other health problems caused by car pollution killing about 6,503 people in NSW alone each year. These emissions would be removed altogether in cities with electric vehicles.
There are certain key areas across government, industry, and public spheres that can ensure the quickest possible delivery of an end-to-end, sustainable public transport system in our cities.
Firstly, it is imperative that we all start, together, now. The process of decommissioning existing infrastructure and installing new electrical options may take up to 20-30 years to implement.

This starts with federal and state governments leading the way to give confidence to the market to invest in these technologies. Mandating e-buses nationally ahead of 2030 is a must and is already progressing at state level in NSW.
Secondly, ability to finance these initiatives plays an important role in timely implementation. Providers and governments should work together to ensure investment cycles line up with key development milestones. It is essential to evolve current capex and opex business models to place greater focus on sustainability.
Thirdly, the economics of the transition away from a reliance on fossil fuel industries must extend to the local workforce through job creation at every step along the way. Rather than sourcing technology from overseas, the renewable energy sector must create new job opportunities in Australia including manufacturing equipment and components locally. To be truly effective, this end-to-end approach must also be delivered without environmental harm, from sourcing materials to production and transportation methods.
Finally, we must create a long-term plan for decommissioning current infrastructure, in favour of recycling and reusing as much material as possible to avoid landfill.
On the consumer side, there is an increasing public interest in making greener personal choices. This should be facilitated by providing more opportunities, starting with greater access to mass transport. Ensuring reliability is essential and decisions need to be made regarding electricity supply for e-bus fleets. A mix of charging stations and EV technology at bus depots for longer journeys and just-in-time charging will help manage electrical needs and efficiencies.

To understand and predict consumer behaviour, data and analytics must have a far more prominent role in enterprise operations, allowing for more streamlined services to be provided and maintained with interruption. Improved transport services, delivered by both public and private enterprise, will encourage people to avoid travelling by car by making it easier to plan trips and use mass transport systems.
For private transport, the longer-term opportunity for big data is to not only allow drivers to better understand and plan around road conditions, but to also help the traffic system manage itself with smart traffic lights directing flow in line with needs to avoid congestion.
In addition to big data, micro-grids will decentralise power distribution. So rather than everyone being connected to one grid, or supply of electricity, we have lots of smaller sources, or microgrids. This means that if one part of the system goes down, the rest remain operational.
To contribute to a more sustainable future effectively, we must take more action from now, with governments, businesses, and industry acting collectively and transitioning the workforce to support e-mobility and the public ditching their cars for greener options.
It’s a long road that will take decades to traverse and it starts with us all boarding the e-bus to a more sustainable future today.

The Perth-based company’s 75%-owned subsidiary, Altech Industries Germany (AIG) earlier this month exercised its option to purchase a 14-hectare industrial site in Spreetal, about 120 kilometres southeast of Berlin, with Altech intending to build a 10,000 tonnes per annum high purity alumina (HPA) battery materials coating plant.
The plant would produce alumina coated silicon/graphite anode materials using Altech’s HPA and proprietary coating technology.
Altech said the site is strategically located to supply the European lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle (EV) markets with the area home to existing production sites for Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Daimler and Tesla.
There are also a number of “key resource and technology players” within the lithium-ion battery chain in the area which is “well serviced” by existing infrastructure.
Altech said it has already secured memorandum of understanding (MoU) agreements with two suppliers, which will provide uncoated graphite anode material and silicon anode material for the plant.
HPA will be produced at Altech’s proposed plant in Malaysia, which is expected to produce about 4,500 tonnes per annum of high purity alumina.
Feedstock for the plant will be sourced from Altech’s kaolin deposit at Meckering, in WA, and shipped to Malaysia.
The proposed plant is the subject of a preliminary feasibility study that is being finalised by AIG.
Meanwhile, Sydney-based graphite miner Magnis Energy has announced that its New York lithium-ion battery plant has begun semi-automated production of full-sized cells with full automation expected towards the end of the first half of 2022.

Magnis, a major shareholder in the iM3NY battery plant which is expected to scale up to 1.8 GWh, announced that at the end of December, the New York plant was 51% complete.
Magnis, one of the companies behind plans to develop an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery factory in northern Queensland, said semi-automated production had commenced in December with a batch of full-sized cells produced.
“This is an important phase where batches of cells are being produced for both marketing and due diligence purposes,” the company said in a statement.
IM3NY chief executive Chaitanya Sharma said a batch of more than 1,000 cells would be produced in the next fortnight and volumes will continue to increase all the way up to fully automated production by the middle of the year.
“Semi-automated production was a huge achievement, and the team will make sure that our target of fully automated production is achieved during 1H 2022,” he said.
“Starting this month, some major items will be completed and it is expected that the overall completion number will jump significantly.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/27/aussie-analysis-of-the-fine-art-of-gettering/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Aussie analysis of the fine art of gettering,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU) have conducted a review of all gettering technologies used in solar wafer manufacturing and offered a comprehensive analysis of the possible gettering sinks and routes for different solar cell architectures.
This technique involves three steps and is utilised during crystal growth to remove containments and other forms of defects in wafers. Through this process, the impurities are initially released into a solid solution and then undergo diffusion through the silicon. Finally, they are trapped in an area away from the active circuit regions of the wafer.
“Gettering is already embedded in most of the current solar cells, through phosphorus diffusion in PERC or PERx devices, as well as in Al-BSF cells,” the research’s corresponding author, Anyao Liu, told pv magazine. “Gettering is also embedded in TOPCon solar cells, although its effectiveness varies a lot, and in silicon heterojunction cells it can be used as a pre-treatment to improve the quality of silicon substrates.
According to her, gettering can be seen as an additional benefit of certain process steps in current industrial cell processing. “However, as cell efficiency increases and becomes increasingly sensitive to traces of metallic impurities, gettering will become an important consideration in cell processing and process parameters of diffusion and polysilicon/oxide fabrication,” she also explained.
In the paper “Gettering in silicon photovoltaics: A review,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, Liu and her colleagues presented all the nomenclatures used in gettering and summarised recent updates to the solubility and diffusivity data of the 3d transition metals used in the process, the so-called getters.
“Many of the gettering techniques in microelectronics are not applicable or effective in silicon PV,” they warned, noting that external gettering is generally more effective in silicon cells, as the silicon wafer bulk represents an important part of the active device region. “The external gettering routes that are most relevant for the state-of-the-art solar cells in mass production are phosphorus diffusion, to a lesser degree boron diffusion, and the emerging P or B-doped poly-Si/SiOx structures,” they also stated.
Phosphorus diffusion is, to date, the most utilised and investigated gettering technique in the solar industry however, its underlying
mechanisms are still controversial and unresolved, according to the research group. Boron diffusion is described as very effective only under unconventional process conditions and is recommended for doped-poly-Si/SiOx structures, which provides a route to simultaneously achieve p+ doping and a strong gettering effect.
“The heavily doped c-Si surfaces and/or heavily doped poly-Si/SiOx structures are incorporated in almost all of the high-temperature cell
architectures,” the scientists further explained. “As the two are effective gettering sinks and their under–pinning gettering mechanisms are likely the same, a better understanding and identification of the key mechanisms will help to further exploit the benefits of gettering in silicon PV.”
The paper also analysed other capture approaches such as selective doping via ion implantation, state-of-the-art polycrystalline-
silicon/oxide passivating contact structures, dielectric films, aluminium alloying, the use of surface-damaged regions including black silicon, and internal gettering in cast-grown silicon using existing crystallographic defects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/27/quantum-dot-layer-pushes-perovskite-solar-cell-efficiency-up-to-25-7/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWITZERLAND",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JANUARY 27, 2022",Quantum dot layer pushes perovskite solar cell efficiency up to 25.7%,"From pv magazine Germany
A group of scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) claims to have made a leap forward to improve the scalability of perovskite solar cells, by replacing their electron-transport layers with a thin layer of quantum dots.
So far, perovskite solar cells have proven to be extremely unstable when scaled up to mass production and the high efficiencies achieved in laboratories cannot be easily reproduced when transferred to production lines, the researchers said. This is partly due to the cell’s electron transport layer, which ensures that the electrons generated when the cell absorbs light are efficiently transferred to the device’s electrode.
In conventional perovskite solar cells, the electron transport layer (ETL) consists of mesoporous titanium dioxide, which has low electron mobility and is also susceptible to negative photocatalytic events under ultraviolet light.
The EPFL replaced the ETL with a thin layer of tin(IV) oxide quantum dots stabilised with polyacrylic acid. This improved the light-trapping capacity of the cells while suppressing non-radiative recombination.
With the thin layer of quantum dots, higher efficiencies can also be transferred to larger cell formats. According to the researchers, they achieved a record efficiency of 25.7% on a perovskite solar cell with an area of 0.08cm2. At the same time, high operational stability was demonstrated, which resulted in efficiencies of 23.3%, 21.7% and 20.6% when the surface of the solar cells was increased to 1cm2, 20cm2, and 64cm2.
Quantum dots are nanometer-sized particles that act as semiconductors and emit light of specific wavelengths when illuminated. Because of their unique optical properties, quantum dots are ideal for use in a variety of optical applications, including photovoltaics.
Colloidal quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) have caught the eye of PV researchers of late thanks to their potential for high conversion efficiency and low-cost processing. However, the technology is still a long way from leaving the lab. Beyond efficiency there are a host of other conditions that need to be met before commercial production can be considered.
