The state-owned Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), which has been appointed as the infrastructure planner for the Central-West Orana REZ and will coordinate the transmission, generation, firming and storage projects, said the initial network capacity of the transmission infrastructure is expected to be 4.5 GW.
“This will support the REZ to generate additional renewable energy in the future, which analysis indicates may be required in the late 2030s,” EnergyCo said.
The change will not alter the geographical size of the REZ, which encompasses an area of about 20,000 square kilometres centred around the inland town of Dubbo and extends west to Narromine and east beyond Mudgee and takes in Wellington to the south and Gilgrandra to the north.
The boost in capacity comes on the same day that the government entered a commitment deed with a consortium comprised of Spanish renewables major Acciona, NSW-based network operator Endeavour Energy and United Kingdom-headquartered solar installer Cobra Energy, as preferred network operator for the REZ.

Subject to regulatory and planning approvals, ACEREZ will design, build, finance, operate and maintain the Central-West Orana REZ transmission network for the next 35 years. This includes new high-capacity transmission lines, energy hubs and related infrastructure.
“The new transmission infrastructure will enable generators such as solar and wind farms and energy storage providers in the REZ to connect to the electricity grid at a scale never seen before,” the government said.
“This will provide a reliable supply of clean, affordable electricity for households and businesses across NSW while helping to meet the state’s newly legislated net zero targets.”
This is the first time the NSW government has competitively procured a new transmission network, adding that delay and cost overrun risks will be substantially borne by the network operator.

NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the latest announcements are a significant milestone for the Central-West Orana REZ which is expected to generate up to $10 billion (USD 6.76 billion) in private investment in the region by 2030 and at its peak support about 5,000 construction jobs.
“These milestones are an important step forward in the development of the Central-West Orana REZ, taking it from vision to reality,” she said.
“It brings us closer to delivering clean, affordable and reliable energy to households and businesses across NSW for decades to come, helping to meet newly legislated net zero targets in NSW.”
Sharpe said the next step for the Central-West Orana REZ is to complete regulatory and planning approvals, expected in mid-2024, ahead of the final contract with the network operator being awarded and financial close, scheduled for the second half of 2024.
If approved, construction is expected to start in early 2025, and initial operation in 2027-2028.
The Central-West Orana REZ is one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the NSW government’s electricity roadmap, which will support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the New England, South-West, Hunter-Central Coast and Illawarra regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online ahead of the planned retirement of the state’s aging thermal-generation fleet.

The project, to be built on a site owned by Unitywater, next to its Brendale sewage works and the South Pine substation, the central node of Queensland’s electricity grid.
Construction of the Brendale battery, which will feature Tesla Megapack technology, is expected to start in March 2024 with balance of plant and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) to be delivered by Consolidated Power Projects. It is anticipated the first tranche of batteries will be due for energisation in July 2025.
Akaysha said the Brendale battery will provide ancillary services, such as energy arbitrage, contingency and regulation frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), to support the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Akaysha Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Nick Carter said the Brendale project is an important element of the company’s portfolio in not only Queensland but the NEM more broadly.
“This is a really key and important asset in the Akaysha Energy Queensland battery portfolio and general Australian portfolio,” he said.
“It’s been a massive lift from the Akaysha Energy team across all pillars to get this project across the line, including legal/commercial, engineering, and energy markets, asset management, finance, investment, and development and delivery.”
The progress on the Brendale project comes amid a flurry of activity for Akaysha in the battery energy storage sector.
Akaysha, which was acquired by BlackRock in 2022, has nine battery energy storage projects across the NEM, including the 850 MW/ 1,680 MWh Waratah Super Battery that is now being constructed in the New South Wales (NSW) Upper Hunter region.
In November, the company was awarded a long-term energy service agreement (LTESA) to support financial close and continue the construction and commissioning of the 415 MW/ 1,660 MWh Orana Battery Energy Storage System in central-west NSW.
In the same month it reached FID on the 150 MW / 300 MWh Ulinda Park big battery planned for Queensland’s Western Downs region Ulinda, and received development approval for the 311 MW / 1244 MWh Elaine battery being developed in Victoria.
Other projects include the 100 MW / 200 MWh Palmerston battery project in Tasmania and a 400 MW/ 1,600 MWh big battery at Wurdong Heights near Gladstone in Queensland.
In South Australia, Akaysha is developing the 200 MW / 800 MWh Mobilong battery near Murray Bridge and the Brinkworth battery energy storage system and solar farm. The Brinkworth project, being developed near Clare in the state’s mid-north, will include a 300 MW / 1,200 MWh battery with up to four hours of energy storage, and a 200 MWp solar farm.

Under the agreement, the Melbourne-headquartered OX2 will develop the PV plant in the Riverina district of New South Wales (NSW). AirTrunk will procure the renewable energy and associated time-based energy certificates generated by the solar farm on behalf of Google, helping to advance the internet giant’s 2030 goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where it operates.
The solar plant is expected to generate power from 2025.
Google Australia Managing Director Mel Silva the project will support local infrastructure to tackle big challenges like climate change and support a sustainable digital economy.
“Industry collaboration and innovation are crucial to achieving our ambitious sustainability objectives, including our efforts to drive a substantial increase in carbon-free energy capacity across the Asia Pacific region,” she said.
OX2 Australia Country Manager Rachel Watson said the tech companies’ commitment to buying carbon-free energy is helping to “accelerate the energy transition and get more renewable energy into the system.”
OX2 announced its entry into the Australian market earlier this year with the acquisition of Esco Pacific, one of the country’s biggest utility-scale solar developers.
It now has an 825 MW pipeline of solar projects in development. In NSW, these include the 100 MW Sandigo Solar Farm located near Narrandera in the Riverina region and the nearby 80 MW Mulwala Solar Farm.
It is also developing the 90 MW Summerville Solar Farm project and associated 90 MW, four-hour battery near Rapville in the state’s north, and is teaming with Idemitsu Australia to develop the 135 MW Muswellbrook Solar Farm in the Upper Hunter region. This project includes a 135 MW two-hour battery.

The battery project, which will use lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology, will have a power capacity of 275 MW and an energy storage capacity of up to 2,200-MWh over eight hours. With existing and planned projects globally, this constitutes the largest eight-hour lithium-ion battery project in the world to date.
Behind the large-scale project, Korea Zinc is already working on other energy storage mechanisms closer to its Townsville base, from where it supplies much of Asia with non-ferrous metals. The Richmond Valley project is being developed by Ark Energy which has a mandate to provide Korea Zinc with enough renewable energy for the production of green zinc.
The Richmond Valley battery project is one of five energy infrastructure projects representing 750 MW of renewable energy generation and 524 MW/4,192 MWh of long-duration storage that have been successful to the New South Wales (NSW) government’s latest tender round as it prepares for the exit of coal-fired power generation from the state’s electricity grid.
“NSW is now almost halfway there on our 2030 renewable generation target, and over a quarter of the way there on our long-duration storage target,” NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said.

The five successful projects represent $4.2 billion (USD 2.84 billion) in private sector investment in NSW’s renewable energy infrastructure. The energy storage projects are expected to be operational by 2028 and are expected to contribute an estimated 1,000 jobs, $2 billion in local supply chain benefits and $40 million towards First Nations initiatives.
With an energy storage capacity of up to 2.2 GWh over eight hours, the Richmond Valley durational battery storage project exceeds other big batteries planned for Australia and globally including Akaysha’s Waratah Super Battery which has a capacity of 850 MW/1,680 MWh and the Orana battery in NSW that clocks in 415 MW / 1,660 MWh. It is also larger than Synergy’s 500 MW / 2,000 MWh Collie battery in WA and has six hours more capacity than Equis’ 1,200 MW / 2.4 GWh (two hours) Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub battery project.
The Richmond Valley battery project will be built alongside the proposed Richmond Valley Solar Farm being developed near Casino in northern NSW. The project includes the construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the solar farm with a capacity of 500 MW. The project includes the installation of approximately one million PV panels on a mounted tracking system and will connect to the grid via the Coffs Harbour to Lismore 330 kV powerline that transects the site.
Australia’s leadership in renewable durational battery storage lies in its ideal circumstances for large-scale solar. The combination of available land, high solar coverage, a comparatively high level of technological infrastructure and functional governance are all elements that make Australia an ideal breeding ground for renewable energy projects such as the Richmond Valley battery.
Australian conditions make it ideal for industrial giants such as Korea Zinc, the world’s largest producer of zinc, lead and silver, and its subsidiaries.
Korea Zinc is currently trying to organise its supply chains so it can avoid exclusion from battery production in the US with the new FEOC regulations (‘foreign entities of concern’) – basically trying to reduce the total dependence on China for all things battery-related.
The company is also ramping up its renewable energy production – with Ark Energy, among others – as well as ramping up its recycling activities to keep critical raw materials in production loops. According to US stipulations, if battery materials were originally produced in China but recycled outside of FEOC, these materials regain eligibility for US subsidies.
The clean production of energy and short transport distances mark two important issues in compliance with standards for government investments in important industries. Refining zinc takes a lot of energy. If battery materials are not produced and transported with the lowest possible carbon footprint, they face exclusion from many governmental support schemes globally as countries try to decarbonise their industries.
Ark Energy is tasked with decarbonising the Korea Zinc subsidiary Sun Metal’s Townsville zinc refinery. The plant is currently Queensland’s second biggest electricity user and chews up between $50 – $80 million in energy costs each year.
Korea Zinc has recognised Australia’s combination of assets, making it one of the world’s ideal locations for industrial activity, with production on-site reducing excessive transportation costs of renewable energy – particularly from neighbouring regions with high energy needs.
In terms of durational storage, lithium battery projects are said to be limited to eight hours of storage potential. The use of lithium for durational storage pits it in competition with transportation needs as the world’s transport industries transition off fossil fuels. Vehicle batteries have higher demands of battery performance and are, therefore, not as flexible as the frameworks applying to stationary storage in terms of alternative methods.
Lithium battery storage systems typically last four to eight hours. As renewable energy generation becomes a higher share of the grid, it will require longer durations and technologies with different characteristics to simulate a “base load” generation mix.
Besides lithium battery storage systems, “mid- to long-term” storage technologies such as iron air or zinc-based battery storage systems (which still have other drawbacks) boast the use of significantly more abundant materials. Renewable energy stored in green hydrogen can make electricity available months later. Gravitational storage provides a duration of 4-24 hours and has a lifespan of up to 35 years.
Korea Zinc is covering all options. Last month, Ark Energy broke ground on its SunHQ green hydrogen hub. The industrial group is also getting primed to export energy to those places less well-endowed with the combination of sun and space – such as most of densely populated Asia – by means of a renewable energy hub in Queensland.
In terms of durational energy storage potential, publications in China point to gravity energy being one of the most tenable energy storage mechanisms for durational storage, also mentioning Vault Energy as an industry leader in this regard. Compared to other methods, gravity-based storage does not need to rely on research years or decades in the future, has a low environmental footprint, no supply chain issues, and is flexible and scalable, making it versatile for both small- and large-scale energy storage.
In 2022, Korea Zinc signed a partnership with Energy Vault. The Swiss company’s gravitational EVx storage system works like pumped hydro. It uses power when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-tonne blocks made of soil and waste materials, rather than water, up to a height. When energy is needed – irrespective of whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing – the blocks are lowered, which releases their potential energy to generate electricity.
Pumped storage has been around for a long time, but utilising moving mass is relatively new, and Energy Vault is considered a leader in this area. Energy Vault says the technology is not dependent on specific terrain, lasts 4-24 hours, and has a lifespan of up to 35 years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/20/researchers-claim-record-breaking-14-46-efficiency-for-organic-pv-module/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Researchers claim record-breaking 14.46% efficiency for organic PV module,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in Germany claim to have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 14.46% for an organic PV module.
“The size of the new record OPV module is 204 cm². The number of cells connected in series is 38,” Andreas Distler, Group Leader OPV Modules at FAU, told pv magazine, adding that he expects the results to appear soon in the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) champion PV module efficiency chart.
The new result is a jump up from the current record of 13.1 % recorded for a 57-cell encapsulated module by Taiwan-based OPV specialist, Ways Technical Corporation (Waystech) and Nanobit.
In a press release, the team noted that the module is a solution-processed OPV, attributing the efficiency improvement to three aspects of the research project: the active materials used; the laser processing, which reduced inactive areas on the surface, and improved interconnects; and third, the use of simulations to establish a more homogeneous coating, which was done in partnership with a team from Georg Simon Ohm University of Applied Sciences in Nuremberg.
The research team included researchers from Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nürnberg for Renewable Energy (HI ERN), which is part of Forschungszentrum Jülich. “We are currently preparing a paper on the development of this new record module, which will disclose all the technical details,” Distler said.
In 2020, the same FAU team achieved 12.6% efficiency record on a module area of 26 cm2 and 11.7% on a module area of 204 cm2.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/20/master-slave-technique-for-deploying-parallel-inverters-in-pv-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,CZECHIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 20, 2023",Master-slave technique for deploying parallel inverters in PV systems,"From pv magazine Global
A group of scientists from the University of Hradec Kralove in Czechia has developed a master-slave control system for controlling parallel inverters connected to a PV system.
The research group explained that using parallel inverters in PV systems is a strategy to optimize power generation while maintaining system efficiency and reliability, noting that master-slave architectures, which is a well-known concept for controlling and regulating shared resources, are commonly used in off-grid PV systems linked to storage.
In master-slave systems, a master entity receives one or more inputs and then creates slave entities to execute them. The master also controls the number of slaves and what each slave does.
“Auto-master-slave control is implemented to achieve rapid dynamic response and precise distribution of load power,” the academics said, noting that the main challenge of this configuration, however, is minimizing the circulating current between parallel units.
They also explained that previous approaches on parallel inverters had prioritized stabilization issues. “This master-slave structure allows photovoltaics to supply maximum energy to the microgrid,” they added. “Storage provides system voltage and frequency support by acting as master voltage sources.”
The team said that the proposed control technique relies on four pillars: effective circulating current reduction; accurate MPPT combining the perturb and observe (P&O) method with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm; rapid response to load and radiation changes in under 50 milliseconds; and a payback period of 3.6 years.
The scientists utilised, in particular, a d-q-0 axes PID controller, a master unit based on a voltage loop PID control, and slave units using dual-loop PID current control. “The slave units’ outer loop is responsible for tracking the PV units’ maximum power, while the inner loop is responsible for sharing the desired amount of power with a current that is in phase with the load current,” they explained.
Through a series of simulations, the scientists found that the master inverter connected to the batteries was able to maintain constant system voltage and compensate for deficits in PV generation. The proposed approach was also found to effectively restrict circulating currents between inverters.
Furthermore, they observed that the MPPT operates all solar panels at their exact MPPs with 100% efficiency and negligible fluctuations, regardless of the load and radiation conditions. The control system responds to any changes in load or radiation in less than 50 milliseconds, ensuring fast and efficient operation of the system, they concluded.
The novel control strategy was presented in the paper “Maximizing photovoltaic system power output with a master-slave strategy for parallel inverters,” published in Energy Reports.
