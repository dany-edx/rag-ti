One of the first demonstrations of utility-scale DC-coupled storage in Australia, the newly operational Berri Energy Project is located on the northern bank of the Murray River northeast of Adelaide. It consists of a 5.8 MW solar farm coupled with a 6.7 MWh battery and uses SMA inverters, CATL battery, and Canadian Solar panels which are all integrated into Flow Power’s proprietary kWatch Controller – an energy monitoring and control box and software system.

Flow Power chose to go down the more novel DC-coupled route as this technology is now becoming more accessible in Australia, COO Byron Serjeanston told pv magazine Australia. Working with Germany’s SMA, which recently introduced more DC-coupled tech to Australia, the route emerged as a more efficient solution both in terms of actual power and overall infrastructure, Serjeanston said.
In DC-coupled projects, the solar system and battery share the same inverter, meaning there is less power converting and just less stuff overall – making projects leaner and cheaper – though this means the battery is also restricted to acting just as a solar shifting device.
DC-coupling also offered advantages in project planning, Serjeanston said, as once Flow Power settled on the project’s inverter, it was able to start moving forward with the approvals process – finalising the storage design concurrently rather than beforehand. Since the project uses a single inverter, communicating with and responding to the network itself becomes easier, Serjeanston added.

This network responsiveness, however, largely comes through the kWatch Controller system – which essentially responds to market price signals and automates management of the system. The proprietary system was developed by Flow from a grant provided by the Australia Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in 2017.
Flow Power has installed its kWatch systems at all its own project sites, hundreds of customer sites, as well as at projects from which it offtake renewable energy. For customers, the system provides live data which can then be used to control any flexible demand loads, Serjeanston said. Currently, Flow Power has around 130 MW in this demand response portfolio.
In Australia, “mid-scale” projects between 1 MW to 5 MW are becoming increasingly popular as the smaller scale means developers can avoid Australia’s protracted and precarious grid connection processes, and planning approvals go through local rather than state governments . All of this means projects can be realised much faster. It is worth noting while the upper threshold is 5 MW for AC-coupled projects, this figure pushes up to 5.8 MW for DC-coupled projects, allowing the Berry Energy Project to fit into the fold. 
Like a number of other developers in Australia, Flow Power is looking to fit its projects into this niche and aims to build around 50 MW of renewable capacity using this strategy – around 10 projects. So far, the company has five operational solar projects and a sixth in construction in Victoria – the Newstead community hybrid project. Newstead will be the company’s second storage project, after Berri. These projects are intended to supplement the nearly 450 MW renewable portfolio Flow Power has contracted.

Sun Cable, which entered voluntary administration in January following an “absence of alignment” among the shareholders, is aiming to develop one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy generation, storage and transmission projects that includes the supply of up to 800 MW of renewable electricity to Darwin.
The Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) project proposal comprises building up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in the NT’s Barkley region along with a 5,000-kilometre transmission network to supply Darwin, Singapore and Asian markets with renewable electricity.
While the future of the AAPowerLink project has been clouded since Sun Cable abruptly entered administration, Perth-based Tivan said its one-year deal with the developer will see it progress commercial and technical discussions towards the potential offtake of up to 300 MW of renewable electricity from the project.
The solar-generated electricity will be used to power a facility to be built at the Middle Arm sustainable development precinct for processing minerals from Tivan’s flagship vanadium, titanium and iron ore project at Mount Peake, being developed about 235 kilometres northwest of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory (NT).

Sun Cable founder and Chief Executive Officer David Griffin said the deal is an important milestone for Sun Cable, Tivan and the Territory.
“The provision of 24/7 dispatchable, renewable electricity can underpin industrial processes, enabling a new wave of green industrial development,” he said.
“Sun Cable is delighted to be establishing a relationship with Tivan and supporting their vision to ensure sustainable development of critical mineral projects in the Northern Territory.”
Under the terms of the deal, Tivan and Sun Cable will work together to develop an indicative renewable energy supply and commercial strategy for the facility. The parties will collaborate to optimise the design, delivery and utilisation of supply and purchase arrangements from AAPowerLink to the processing facility.
The supply of energy is subject to the parties subsequently agreeing and executing a formal power purchase agreement.
Tivan Executive Chairman Grant Wilson said the collaboration with Sun Cable would help put the Territory at the “global forefront of critical minerals processing and the energy transition.”
“As the first-moving public proponent at Middle Arm, we have an important interest in how it is shaped and by partnering with Sun Cable, we are endorsing and facilitating the provision of large-scale renewable energy to the precinct,” he said.
“I am confident that this will enable and inspire like-minded industry proponents to pursue similar sustainable development pathways.”
Meanwhile, Sun Cable administrator FTI Consulting is confident it will complete the sale of the venture by the end of May after multiple investors submitted initial bids for the renewable energy developer which is largely owned by mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s private firm Squadron Energy and technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’ private investment company Grok Ventures.
Both Squadron and Grok are believed to be among those that have submitted initial bids to take control of Sun Cable but FTI said there had been “strong” interest in the venture.
Other potential parties that insiders have suggested might be interested in the asset include Spain’s Iberdrola, Macquarie’s infrastructure arm, Canadian giant Brookfield, and Singapore’s GIC, as well as Australian infrastructure player Quinbrook.
FTI said that it and Moelis, the investment bank running the sale process, were now seeking “to progress a shortlist of bidders through to the submission of binding proposals by end of April 2023” with a view to completing a sale at the end of May.

The charger includes anti-tripping functionality through an optional peak controller ensuring homeowners can operate multiple devices on the home power system, such as dishwashers, aircon, and pool pumps, while charging the car at the same time, all without fear of a power supply failure.
The launch of the charger, which is the latest addition to Schneider’s EVlink range, comes as the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in Australia increased by 65% in 2022 compared to the previous year.
Chris Kerr, vice president of  Schneider Electric’s Home and Distribution business and Clipsal brand in Australia, said as more Australians switch to EVs in an effort to reduce their carbon emissions, demand will continue to grow for state-of-the-art, affordable devices that can be used from home.
“We’re confident this market will continue to grow, but as more Australians go electric it’s important that they have access to cost-effective and sustainable charging solutions,” he said.
“The EVlink Home has been built with an easy-install process, safety systems, and cost-effective charging solution, which means that electricians will be able to support even more homeowners, giving Aussies greater access to sustainable solutions.”
Schneider said the charger, which is available for homeowners to purchase now, also features integrated RDC-DD protection, meaning it requires only a Type A circuit protection in the distribution board, a safer and more affordable alternative to Type B protection.

Sentenal Technologies was also fined $2,000 without conviction for failing to comply with a notice under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The company was also ordered to pay an additional $7,890 in costs.
Geelong Magistrates Court heard five of the company’s workers were observed in September 2021 removing solar panels from the roof of the warehouse in the Geelong suburb of Corio, the tallest part of which was seven metres high.
Worksafe Victoria said none of the workers were wearing available harnesses and there was no edge protection because, although guard rail footings had been installed, no railings were present.
The industry watchdog said an investigation revealed Worksafe inspectors had previously discussed fall risks with Sentenal Technologies on nine occasions and issued improvement or prohibition notices on five of those.
The court also heard that despite the work constituting high risk construction work due to the risk of a fall from a height greater than two metres, the workers indicated a SWMS had not been prepared due to difficulties with an online application.
Worksafe said Sentenal Technologies also failed to comply with an order to produce all SWMS regarding the company’s work at the Corio warehouse.
WorkSafe Director of Health and Safety Narelle Beer said the risks and too often deadly consequences of falls from height were notorious.
“It beggars belief that safety measures such as harnesses and guard rails were available to these workers but were not being used at the time,” she said.
“WorkSafe will continue to take strong action against any duty holder who fails to control the very real risk of serious injury or death from working at height on construction sites.”

The increase in extreme weather and power outages also continue to contribute to growing demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS). As a result, there are many questions about sizing and optimising BESS to provide either energy, grid ancillary services, and/or site backup and blackstart capability. Before beginning BESS design, it’s important to understand auxiliary power design, site layout, cable sizing, grounding system and site communications design.
Auxiliary power is electric power that is needed for HVAC for the battery stacks as well as control and communications. This sounds deceptively simple for equipment that has no moving parts, yet it is often a moving target, as BESS vendors continue to morph their designs after an order is placed. Therefore, when it comes to auxiliary design, you must be able to answer the following questions:
These are just a few examples of the many questions that must be answered prior to embarking on the auxiliary design.
BESS site layout can be easy or complicated, depending on the site location, the site owner’s preferences or requirements, and the BESS itself. Some of the main questions to consider for the site layout are:
BESS systems usually involve short, high ampacity underground runs from the battery rack containers to the inverters or DC/DC converters. In order to avoid excessive cable derates and resulting in larger cables and costs for short underground runs, you will need to consider:
Many BESS sites are relatively small, and substation grounding design methods don’t really apply. So you need to ask, what is the design goal? Depending on how the design is approached, a site can either end up with an expensive mesh grid or a reasonable design to connect all of the equipment, and both will be equally safe.
Additionally, are you concerned about possible Radio Frequency Interference being generated by the BESS? Some vendors require additional methods, such as six additional grounding connections per inverter. Is the BESS located at a 911 Call Center or in a remote area? Answering questions like this will help your design and installation process go as smoothly as possible.
Communications are an integral part of BESS design, as it allows for remote data monitoring and/or management, and for the BESS system to communicate with the power grid as well as connect to peripheral components. The following site communications design questions should be answered in order to properly design this aspect of a BESS:

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/06/final-panel-installed-as-australias-largest-solar-farm-nears-full-capacity/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 6, 2023",Final panel installed as Australia’s largest solar farm nears full capacity,"Australia’s largest solar farm is close to achieving full capacity with renewables developer Neoen announcing that the last of the more than one million solar panels has now been installed at its $600 million (USD 403 million) Western Downs solar farm being developed near Chinchilla in Queensland’s southwest.
The 400 MW Western Downs solar farm is the biggest yet constructed in Australia. It encompasses 1,500 hectares and is expected to generate 1,080 GWh of clean power annually, enough to power 235,000 homes. Construction of the project has also delivered a huge boost to Queensland’s regional economies, with the state government saying it has generated an estimated $800 million in economic activity.
The mega project is part of the Western Downs Green Power Hub that will also include a 200 MW/400 MWh big battery with Neoen having last month begun construction on the energy storage system.
The solar farm has already commenced production with Neoen confirming it has reached a peak capacity of 350 MW as it works through the various hold points required by the market operator. The developer said the completion of panel installation means the project can now progress through the final testing and commissioning phase as it moves to full capacity.
Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said the company and its construction partners had to overcome significant Covid-related challenges, including border closures, the inability to travel, and supply chain disruption to bring the project to completion.
“We are delighted to have completed the panel installation of the largest solar farm in Australia at Western Downs, and we’re excited about the strong contribution that this asset will make to Queensland’s rapidly accelerating energy transition,” he said.
“It’s a massive solar farm, one of the most competitive assets that we have worldwide.”
While it is the largest solar farm yet constructed in Australia, the Western Downs facility will soon be joined by the 400 MW New England Solar Farm being built in New South Wales by Acen Renewables.
Acen announced only last month that the 400 MW first stage of the planned 720 MW New England Solar Farm is now progressing through the commissioning process.

The Western Downs solar farm is underpinned by a 10-year power purchase agreement with state government-owned renewable energy operator CleanCo which has agreed to purchase 80% of the project’s capacity.
CleanCo Chief Executive Officer Tom Metcalfe said the energy will be delivered to some of the utility’s largest commercial and industrial customers and will contribute to the energy needed for CleanCo to meet its target of bringing 1.4 GW of new renewable energy into the market by 2025.
“The renewable energy generated by the Western Downs Green Power Hub will supply some of CleanCo’s biggest customers including Coles and BHP,” he said.
Metcalfe said the solar energy generated by the facility will also contribute to the long-term sustainability of Queensland industries and communities, “helping them to thrive in a net-zero future.”
The Queensland government last year unveiled a $62 billion, 10-year energy and jobs plan, which included new renewable energy targets of 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who joined de Sambucy at the project site on Wednesday to mark the million-panel milestone, said the solar farm is another major investment towards achieving those renewable energy targets.
“Our government has made it clear that Queensland homes will be powered by renewable energy from solar farms just like this one,” she said.
“We’re going to be seeing more and more of these solar farms across Queensland because that’s what we need to transition to our renewable future.”

Rystad Energy said hydrogen pipeline projects could expand by as much as 700% over the next 12 years. It said that more than 4,300 km of pipelines already transport hydrogen, with more than 90% of them in Europe and North America. It estimates that there are about 91 planned pipeline projects throughout the world, with 30,300 kilometres set to go online by around 2035. “Spain, France, and Germany are among the countries committed or considering cross-border pipelines to facilitate energy flows, while the UK with its extensive gas grid finds itself in a fantastic position to switch from natural gas to hydrogen,” it noted.
Dominion Energy Utah (DEU) has launched hydrogen blending in Delta, Utah, as part of an ongoing project. It said it tested a 5% hydrogen blend for almost a year and found “that hydrogen was safe, compatible with current residential appliances and helpful in reducing emissions from appliances using already clean-burning natural gas.” The second phase consists of a blend of up to 5%. It will be introduced to the city and several surrounding towns, serving about 1,800 customers in total.
Ingeteam has developed a new rectifier to power electrolysers based on insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) technology. The new product is designed for large-scale green hydrogen production plants. The company said it will supply the first units in September for projects in Germany and Spain.
H-TEC Systems has developed a modular hydrogen electrolyser for large-scale projects above 10 MW in size. The German company said it can combine 10 MW blocks of the modular hydrogen platform into systems with an electrolysis performance of 100 MW and above. The overall system efficiency of 77%, along with high system availability, results in low hydrogen costs, it claimed. The blocks are based on S450 stack technology and the systems are designed for indoor installation.
Toyota and the Japan Fine Ceramic Center have developed a new observation technique in which test samples are placed in an exact simulation of a fuel cell stack, in order to observe the coarsening process at all stages during electricity generation. “The focus of its research is the way in which platinum in the fuel cell stack catalyst ‘coarsens’ over time,” said Toyota. “These changes at particle level have an impact on the metal’s performance supporting the chemical reaction between hydrogen fuel and airborne oxygen to create the electricity that powers the vehicle engine.” Coarsening is the process through which particles of different sizes transform into fewer particles with larger average sizes.
Nigerian researchers have shown that energy systems combining diesel generators, solar, wind, hydrogen, and batteries could reach “renewable fractions” of between 98% and 100% in the city of Abuja and the town of Anyigba. “Like the battery bank, the operational analysis of the hydrogen system shows that it can mitigate intermittency of solar PV panels and wind resources,” the team said in “An energy balance and multicriterial approach for the sizing of a hybrid renewable energy system with hydrogen storage,” which was recently published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. “This present study elucidates the prospects and benefits of adopting hydrogen energy storage.”
The European Commission has approved a €450 million ($737 million) scheme in Italy to support the production of renewable hydrogen. The public support will take the form of direct grants to cover investment costs, with a maximum amount of €20 million ($32 million) per project.

The power arm of Philippines-based conglomerate San Miguel Corp. has unveiled a 50 MW BESS in Limay, Philippines, as part of its nationwide 1 GW/1 GWh rollout. The facility is one of 32 battery sites the group is building across the islands of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. It expects to deliver all of the projects by the end of the year, according to a press release by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the president of the Philippines.
“BESS technology will support our goal of generating 35% of our total energy requirements from renewables by 2030,” Marcos said at an inauguration ceremony last week.
San Miguel’s battery storage portfolio started to take shape back in 2018, when it acquired the country’s first BESS project – the 10 MW Masinloc Power Plant. In January 2022, the conglomerate said it was ready to start operating an initial 690 MW of battery storage facilities, as part of a plan to deliver a 1 GW BESS fleet by the year’s end.
The Philippine Star quoted San Miguel CEO Ramon S. Ang as saying that the company had already delivered 640 MW of projects, with the balance expected to be finished by December of this year.
“Government is working to avert a power crisis,” Ang said. “But we know it takes time to complete new power facilities. The BESS network is here already and it can provide immediate mitigation to the power crisis.”
San Miguel partnered with ABB Philippines, Fluence, and Wartsila and their engineering, procurement and construction contractors on the project. This week, Fluence confirmed that it has completed 570 MW of BESS projects for San Miguel. These projects provide critical grid-stability services throughout the national transmission network in the Philippines, including frequency response, reserve power, and voltage regulation.
“Over the next couple of years, we estimate the integration of up to 5000 MW of renewable power into the grid due largely to our BESS facilities,” said Ang.
At the inauguration ceremony, President Marcos vowed to extend substantial support to investors in the renewable energy space and streamline regulations at the national and local levels.
“We will improve the policy and regulatory framework for the renewable energy industry, especially for the ESS technology, to encourage the further development of our fledgling renewables industry,” he said.
Marcos added that his administration will continue working with San Miguel. He noted that the company has “other BESS projects in the pipeline, accounting for 95% of BOI-approved projects, with 2,000 MW total capacity distributed across the country…  I and the rest of the Filipino people look forward to the rollout of these projects in the near future.”
