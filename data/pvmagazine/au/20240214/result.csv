His government’s latest move has been to legislate the government’s emissions reduction target.
Energy and Clean Economy Jobs minister Mick de Brenni announced the introduction of the legislation to parliament via LinkedIn today. In the announcement he said that the Clean Economy Jobs Bill 2024 would legislate an emissions reduction target of 75% by 2035.
The energy minister continued that the legislation would create 100,000 new “clean energy economy” jobs, while “protecting existing jobs by keeping Queensland competitive and safeguarding our natural environment.”
The Clean Energy Council has welcomed the move saying that “the Sunshine State can live up to its name.” It said that the legislation would accelerate renewable energy rollout while cutting pollution.
“Queenslanders will benefit from the bright, clean energy future that this law enables with rapidly growing industries that are creating regional jobs for generations to come,” said the Climate Council’s head of advocacy Jennifer Rayner. She said that codifying the emissions reduction target in law will provide investor confidence, particularly in regional areas.
It was not all bouquets, however. The Clean Energy Council noted that the Queensland state government had continued to approve coal mines – in a trend that is common to Labor-lead governments around Australia.
“Approving new, highly-polluting projects like the Winchester South coal mine undermines the state’s positive momentum, and will pile more climate risks and costs onto communities who are still reeling from flooding rains, deadly bushfires and destructive storms,” said Rayner.
The framing of climate legislation as an economic measure, creating jobs, is shaping as a powerful political strategy. The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, is a massive piece of emissions-reduction law that has proven resilient to attracts due to its job creation benefits.
“The Miles Government’s commitment to protecting and creating well-paid clean economy jobs as well as tackling climate change,” said energy minister de Brenni in his statement today.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/14/adopting-decarbonisation-levers-to-achieve-net-zero/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,2024-02-14,Adopting decarbonisation levers to achieve net zero,"To achieve our target of restricting global warming to 1.5C, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must reach their highest point by 2025, drop by 43% by 2030, and ultimately hit net zero by 2050.  However, despite advancements in decarbonisation efforts, our present plan indicates a shortfall in meeting these benchmarks. Restoring our trajectory has been the primary focus of discussions at COP28.
The fundamental role business has to play
Data from the latest Accenture report, Destination Net Zero, states that 37% of G2000 companies have made a commitment to achieve net zero, marking a 3-percentage-point increase since 2022. However, our findings indicate that only one-fifth (18%) of these companies are currently on track to cut their emissions to net zero by 2050, while over half have not yet begun any initiatives to reduce emissions.

The report also incorporated data from 28 of Australia’s top revenue-generating companies. Initial observations are promising: 96% of the Australian companies surveyed have established net zero objectives, contrasting with 55% of their counterparts in other regions. Moreover, 75% have disclosed net zero objectives in all areas, in contrast to 57% in the EU and 26% in the US. Despite the small sample size, the commitment is significant, given the understanding that companies setting targets tend to reduce emissions more rapidly than those that do not. However, substantial action is yet to follow suit.
The report also found that Australia faces significant challenges in achieving substantial decarbonisation as companies are over-reliant on carbon offsetting due to Australia’s heavy dependence on fossil fuels, which sees higher offsets to meet climate goals.  The disparity is over double the global figure of 27%, with 64% of Australian businesses utilising carbon offsets to meet their emission targets. Yet only 11% were actively looking to adapt their business models to achieve lower carbon emissions. Given this, what is the next step for Australia? How do we speed up efforts for substantial results?
Expanding decarbonisation adoption
Boosting the use of decarbonisation methods in businesses is crucial for faster emission reduction. Our research indicates that adopting 10 or more methods leads to significant emission decreases, while using fewer may result in continued emission growth.
Businesses should combine multiple decarbonisation measures, a practice known as “stacking” levers. The levers include renewable energy adoption, process optimisation, sustainable sourcing as well as more complex actions such as upgrading to “green” technology and reinventing business models.  When combined, each lever strengthen the impact of the others, establishing a more resilient and adaptable framework for sustainable business practices.
Out of the levers, G2000 companies are predominantly implementing energy efficiency (82%), reducing waste (80%), switching to renewables (79%), and adopting circular principles (68%); the commonality of these levers signifying a ‘starting point’ for companies on their decarbonisation journeys. While the relatively uncommon choices are concentrated in certain sectors, reflecting their specific needs and priorities. Greener IT infrastructure, for example, is being consolidated within companies likely to contribute to a greater share of these emissions.
Energy-intensive industry transitions
Industries like steel, metals, mining, cement, chemicals, freight and logistics jointly account for nearly half (40%) of worldwide CO2 emissions. The industry’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions also extend to become their customers’ Scope 3 emissions, making the sustainable transformation of these sectors pivotal for effective climate mitigation efforts.
Yet, expecting companies within this sector to bear the entire responsibility of the energy transition without assistance is counterproductive. Ultimately, decarbonisation hinges on cost factors as environmentally friendly alternatives to high-carbon products and services are more costly and less accessible. To achieve net zero emissions, there is a pressing need to increase the speed at which we reduce these costs.
Promoting investment in advanced technologies, such as green hydrogen production, renewable energy and AI-driven sustainable mining, has the potential to significantly decrease carbon footprints in these industries and lower emissions throughout the supply chain. Establishing new industrial clusters, comparable to the Kwinana cluster in Western Australia, holds potential for sustainable transformation of the secondary industry.
Clean energy alignment
Without a developed clean energy sector, Australia’s decarbonisation goals remain unattainable, impacting both domestic energy security and the potential for a thriving clean energy export market to replace fossil fuel exports.
Results from Accenture research states that clean energy exports could generate annual revenues worth $314 billion for the nation by 2040. Given policy backing, this could position Australia as a primary global player in clean exports by 2040, contributing greater value and employment opportunities to the Australian economy.
The time to seize this opportunity is quickly diminishing as other countries heavily invest in their own capabilities. Australia urgently requires a robust and targeted clean energy policy to attract and leverage private investment.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/14/study-models-increased-efficiencies-using-ev-charging-facilities/,"EV,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,2024-02-14,Study models increased efficiencies using EV charging facilities,"Engineering researchers based at the University of South Australia (UniSA) Mawson Lakes campus say that using renewable energy to power EV day charging is key to lowering electricity grid demand in the evening and helping to support Australia’s net zero emission targets by 2050.
UniSA’s Mahfuz Aziz, Mohammed Haque and UniSA PhD researcher Yan Wu published their peer-reviewed findings in the Renewable Energy journal, in December last year.
The EV charging facility model addresses South Australia’s very high rate of PV penetration, driving high solar generation during the day, leading to substantial decrease in grid power demand around midday and a dramatic increase in grid demand during the evening when solar generation falls.
“This causes significant operational challenges as excess power generated by rooftop solar and exported to the grid creates major grid issues as dispatchable power must be ramped up suddenly to replace dwindling solar power later in the day, causing a so-called duck curve,” Aziz said.
“Workplace charging of EVs helps address this challenge by using excess renewable generation during the day. Prioritising daytime workplace charging reduces pressure on the grid during the evening peak hours by decreasing the demand for home charging of EVs,” Aziz said.
The study anticipates a dramatic increase in EV vehicles requiring charge stations in Australia by 2050, which according to the 2021 EV Opportunity Assessment Report and the Australian Electric Vehicle Market Study, will increase from the 25% target by 2030 to more than 80%, with the ACT planning to ban the sale of new fossil fuel-based cars by 2035.
Haque said Australia would use solar more efficiently if it established comparable EV charging infrastructure proposed by the study, in private and public facilities.
“This initiative not only helps in achieving a more balanced grid demand profile, but also promotes a greener environment,” Haque said.
Yan Wu explained the research looked at different models to determine the most efficient way to support electric vehicle charging, while decreasing the campus’s net annual energy costs. The researchers found that at 25% EV penetration, the UniSA Mawson Lakes campus could reduce its annual electricity costs by more than 9% by upgrading its existing solar systems to optimum capacity, supporting free EV charging during the day, and helping to lower peak power demand by at least 12%.
“By optimising the PV system, more energy would be exported to the grid, which does not attract any revenue. However, providing EV charging services at a nominal fee using the excess PV generation is a sensible solution,” Yan Wu said.
“By doing so, the campus can potentially support 800 EV cars, the maximum number of parking spaces at Mawson Lakes, while incurring almost the same annual energy costs as that for 25% penetration with free charging.”
The researchers used data from the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) to obtain average daily travel distances and campus arrival/departure times. The modelling based on this data was further validated using actual parking data from Monash University’s Clayton campus.
The campus currently has rooftop solar systems on 18 buildings, supplemented by ground-mounted solar installed in 2019 based on energy needs at that time, but prior to the rapid uptake of electric vehicles.
According to the Global EV Outlook 2023, worldwide sales of electric vehicles almost doubled in 2022 compared to 2021, with more than 26 million EVs sold representing a 60% increase on 2021 and more than 500% higher than in 2018.

Solar power will play a crucial role in the planned tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030, delivering an unprecedented fivefold generation capacity increase by the end of 2030, to 5.4 TW – and some forecasts are even more optimistic. Despite the competitiveness of renewables, led by solar, challenges persist and require urgent policy action on financial flows, permitting, electricity grids, and supply chains.
The first step to delivering the renewable energy capacity the planet requires is to align global policy around a renewables transition. The GRA launched the #3xRenewables campaign in September 2023 with the aim of focusing attention on this urgent objective, in order to deliver rapid progress.
Just five months after that launch, some 300 organizations have signed an open letter calling for #3xRenewables and 198 countries and regional blocs agreed to the target at COP28, with 130 of them also committing to a global renewables and energy efficiency pledge. In order to deliver on that global commitment, governments must focus on four core actions, outlined below.
The flow of funds – including export finance and climate finance, as well as public and private capital – must be redirected from fossil fuel energy to the build-out of renewables and grids. In a policy report developed by the GRA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, and the COP28 presidency, we found that a USD10 trillion ($15.4 trillion) investment in renewable energy deployment between 2023 and 2030 will be key to align with a global net-zero trajectory by 2050. While this may be a staggering number, USD7 trillion is currently paid in fossil fuel subsidies annually and an additional USD1 trillion was invested into fossil fuels in 2023. There is a need for a long-term sustainability perspective, rather than more capital.
To achieve our global target, we must also prioritize low-cost and long-term financing in the least developed economies and off-grid communities for a “just energy transition.”
Strengthening supply chains is crucial to avoid vulnerability and ensure all benefits from the opportunities offered by the energy transition. Investing in local supply chains promotes job creation, economic growth, and stable renewable energy expansion. Governments should prioritize transparent supply chains and should incentivize adherence to high environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards to bolster investor confidence and eliminate market barriers to pave the way to achieving solar targets. ESG standards such as the “do no significant harm” principle, as well as best practice initiatives such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative, will also be critical for ecologically and socio-economically sustainable development.
Grid upgrades and development are a critical factor in the growth of renewables. Beyond accommodating the variability of renewable energy, the focus of grid upgrades should prioritize bolstering resilience, flexibility, and accessibility to smart grids. Solar power can be a cornerstone of energy security, through decentralized energy generation systems ranging from utility-scale sites to individual homes – offering unique opportunities for the least developed countries to expand energy access. Achieving this means tackling both transmission and distribution grid issues to deliver cost-competitive solar energy globally.
Solar’s decentralized potential enhances resilience against grid failures and other crises, powering essential services such as fridges for food and vaccines, light for construction, and mobile phone charging points. Policymakers must integrate decentralized solar design into national planning for a secure and just future.
With lengthy timelines and overlapping responsibilities among government entities, permitting processes can represent a significant roadblock for the rapid expansion of solar, both large and small scale.
To overcome this obstacle, permitting procedures for solar projects should adopt a standardized and clearly defined process proportionate to the size of installation and incorporating a “one-stop shop” approach. Considering the relatively small impact of rooftop solar, permitting processes for small-scale projects should be much more streamlined, compared to utility-scale developments. In some countries, the permitting burden has even been removed entirely for residential and commercial rooftops for installations with a generation capacity of up to 5 MW.
As we look ahead, the renewables sector is optimistic but realistic. The technology is at our disposal, renewables are cost-competitive and will create millions of jobs, and the benefits of a green grid are undeniable. Realizing this vision, however, demands policies which align to remove barriers and direct finance where it will have the most significant impact. This is where organizations such as the Global Solar Council (GSC) are critical – uniting the world’s solar industry. By bringing together expertise and stakeholders from regions across the world, the GSC, in strong collaboration with other renewable energy sectors, through the GRA, can drive the way to shaping our sustainable energy landscape.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/14/nsw-council-reduces-grid-electricity-consumption-costs-with-solar-energy-efficiency/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,NEW SOUTH WALES",EV FOLEY,2024-02-14,"NSW council reduces grid electricity consumption, costs with solar, energy efficiency","Bordering Queensland, the NSW Northern Rivers region Tweed Shire Council has managed to significantly reduce its electricity consumption from the grid, for its water and wastewater pumps and treatment. And a new solar system is playing a major role in the change.
Operational since August 2023, Tweed Shire’s 604 kW solar array powers one of the council’s most power-hungry facilities, the Banora Point Wastewater Treatment Plant. The council says the results of the project in grid power consumption is representative of ongoing efforts formalised in its Renewable Energy Action Plan.
Tweed Council’s Environmental Sustainability Performance Report for the 2022/2023 financial years, showed a total greenhouse gas emissions of 17,873 tonnes, down 4,188 tonnes and representing a 19% year on year decrease, and grid electricity consumption also down 11%.
Mayor of Tweed Shire Chris Cherry said since setting a target in 2016/17 to halve electricity-use emissions by 2025 – the council has achieved a 30% decrease to date.
“By July 2023, Council had installed more than 725 kW of solar arrays at 20 Council facilities and we’re really starting to see the positive impacts. That solar has saved Council nearly 2,500 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually – equivalent to the emissions of nearly 140 average households,” Cherry said.
“The great news is that all of these sustainability wins not only help the planet but also save our ratepayers money in the long term, so it’s a win-win.”
Tweed is one of just 11 councils in Australia to achieve full compliance in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy program (GCoM) for its work in 2021.
Tweed Shire Council is one of 122 cities globally to secure a top score on climate action from the Climate Disclosure Platform (CDP) and one of 11 councils in Australia to achieve full compliance in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy program (GCoM), for its work in 2021.
Mayor Cherry was the recipient of the 2023 Climate Ambassador in the Cities Power Partnership Awards, highlighting Council’s commitment to climate mitigation across the scheme’s 38 action pledge items.
The Cities Power Partnership (CPP) is the largest local government climate program, with 175 councils, more than 500 cities and towns, which represent almost 70 per cent of the population.
Tweed Shire Council has been a CPP member since 2018 and serves a population of 99,480 people.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/14/downed-vic-power-lines-spark-debate/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,VICTORIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-14,Downed Vic power lines spark debate,"Extreme weather is being blamed for the downing of six electricity transmission towers near Geelong and the resulting power outages. At its worst, more than 600,000 homes and businesses were left without power.
In a knock-on effect of the towers’ collapse, a major coal generator was disconnected from the state’s power system, leading to spiraling wholesale power prices and load shedding.
Victoria’s Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Change confirmed the series of events in a post on social media site X – formerly Twitter.
The ABC reports that all four units at AGL’s Loy Yang A power station in the Latrobe Valley were shut down around 2pm on Feb. 13. It was planned that three of the generation units be restarted overnight.
As of 8:30pm last night, the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) reported that almost half-a-million Victorian electricity customers remained without power. It said that it may day “days if not weeks to restore electricity” to everyone impacted. Details of the outages, as reported by AEMO, are below.
AEMO noted that “strong winds and fallen trees” had damaged “hundreds of powerlines and power poles.”
The shutdown of such a large generator such as Loy Yang A had a major impact on wholesale electricity prices. The generator, operated by AGL, has a generating capacity of 2.2 GW – when fully operational.
The ABC reports that wholesale power prices in Victoria surged as a result yesterday. “Victorian wholesale power prices increased to $16,600 per megawatt hour this afternoon, compared to $29.61 in Queensland and $286.97 in NSW.”
Speaking to the ABC, Bruce Mountain noted that as Loy Yang A returned to full generation prices would stabilize. But he said that locally produced energy could assist to reduce the vulnerability of the electricity system.
“We are very exposed through long distance transmission lines to winds and storms and I think that may well be the root of the problem here,” Mountain said. “We can produce electricity cheaply locally.” Mountain is director of Victoria University’s Energy Policy Centre.
While a full picture of how yesterday’s power outages and extreme price events could be avoided in the future will take some time to become clear, as Mountain noted. However, a call was made for more wind and solar generation, “firmed” by batteries to help strengthen the power system.
Tim Buckley, the director of Climate Energy Finance in Sydney described yesterday’s events as a “debacle” and called for a rapid rollout of wind, solar, and battery energy storage.
“The result is electricity prices spiking to the maximum $16,600/MWh – meaning all electricity producers are absolutely cashing in big time, profits for generators, a nightmare for Victorian energy users. Time to break the fossil fuel cartel gouging Australians and accelerate the deployment of firmed renewable energy as fast as possible,” wrote Buckley in a post on LinkedIn.
Buckley called for annual installations of 3 GW of wind, 5-15 GW of solar, and 2-3 GW of battery energy storage to address the current situation.
In the aftermath of the outage, investigations will no doubt look at the causes, handling by regulators, along with ways the system can be strengthened in the future. AGL, the operator of Loy Yang A, has already indicated that it will cooperate with AEMO on an investigation – as reported by The Guardian Australia.
The team at WattClarifty reported on the outage and market developments as news became available. The site pointed to the work of meteorologist Ben Domensino from Weatherzone, who noted that roughly 544,000 lightning strikes had hit Victoria between 9am and 9pm yesterday. Winds up to 130 km/h were recorded in the west of the state.
Yesterday’s events in Victoria are reminiscent of the statewide power outage that befell South Australia in 2016. That event was very quickly and vociferously politicized by renewable energy opponents.
The SA outage in 2016 also resulted in a series of innovative energy underakings, including the establishment of the initial stage of the Hornsdale Power Reserve and the establishment of a then world-leading VPP in Adelaide.
