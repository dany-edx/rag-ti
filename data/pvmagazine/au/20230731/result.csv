The batteries will be coordinated with each ‘hive’ comprising 10 individual energy storage systems, providing a combined capacity of up to 49.9 MW/200 MWh. The first of the battery hives is expected to be commissioned in early 2024 with CETF to operate the assets on a merchant basis in the wholesale power market.
CETF said the batteries will be sourced from Chinese solar and storage technology manufacturer Sungrow and will be connected through technology delivered by Brisbane-based infrastructure management service provider Tukio Intelligent Infrastructure.
Rob Ashdown, co-founder and managing director of both CETF and Tukio, said the focus on sub 5 MW batteries meant the planning and regulatory processes are more streamlined, allowing the company to rapidly deploy a network of renewable energy storage systems.
“Large grid-scale batteries have long lead times, require massive capital investment, and are competing for funding in an increasingly competitive environment,” he said.
“Project Hive is a smarter way to help Australia’s energy networks evolve. Our innovative hive concept allows us to rapidly and efficiently deploy coordinated and cost-effective energy storage solutions, which could play a major role in Australia’s renewable energy transition.”
Ashdown said the first two battery hives will be located on privately-owned rural properties close to network operator Ausgrid’s existing substations in the Hunter Valley, including Seaham, Polkobin, Rothbury, Denman, Aberdeen and Scone in the Muswellbrook region.
Ashdown said he has been “blown away” by the response from local landowners willing to rent out a small corner of their property to host a battery with the company now looking to extend its strategy throughout NSW, with other states to follow.
“The positive response from landowners, network operators and regulators, means we will now move into other parts of NSW, while also planning for expansion into Victoria and Queensland and later into Western Australia,” he said.
CETF said the hive batteries will be operated on a merchant basis, buying and selling direct into the National Electricity Market, while also providing key firming and grid services such as frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) when requested.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/31/provaris-plans-2-6-gw-solar-farm-for-nt-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 31, 2023",Provaris plans 2.6 GW solar farm for NT green hydrogen project,"Provaris Energy said the Tiwi H2 green hydrogen project is on track to commence operations in 2027 with a report by engineering consultancy CE Partners progressing the concept design of the solar farm and transmission system to a 30% level, which provides the basis for optioneering and design optimisation.
Perth-based Provaris said the report’s key findings show that the proposed 2,640-hectare solar precinct area on the Tiwi Islands off the coast of the Northern Territory (NT) has the capacity to support 2.6 GWp of solar.
It is expected the solar farm, featuring a single-axis tracking system, would be capable of generating more than 5,000 GWh of clean energy each year, which would be delivered via a proposed four-circuit, 275 kV transmission line stretching 30 kilometres from the solar farm to the hydrogen production and export precincts.
Based on the generation forecasts, Provaris has revised the expected peak green hydrogen production and export volume for the Tiwi H2 project to 90,000 tonnes per annum (tpa). The report includes a provisional allowance of about 10,000 tpa for planned optimisation processes, with the company to explore ways to reduce power losses and further evaluate equipment design and selection.
Provaris Executive Director and Chief Development Officer Garry Triglavcanin said the company is pleased with the work undertaken to date and said securing land agreements with the relevant key Tiwi Island stakeholders will be a key next step.
“Once a satisfactory outcome has been achieved, FEED and further engineering studies are planned to drive the project toward financial close, targeted for the end of 2024,” he said.
“With the support of key stakeholders, the project development program still allows for Provaris’ targeted first hydrogen production and export in late 2027.”

Provaris said the environmental impact statement is now being prepared with submission planned for early 2024 while draft project and land agreements have already been submitted to the Tiwi Land Council.
The company said it has already commenced discussions with potential joint venture partners for project development through to front-end engineering design (FEED) and a future final investment decision.
Green hydrogen produced at the Tiwi H2 Project facility is expected to be exported to the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China.
The progress on the Tiwi H2 project follows the announcement earlier this month that Provaris will team with Norwegian company Prodtex to construct and test a prototype tank for the transport and storage of hydrogen.
Provaris said it had awarded a contract to Prodtex to test a prototype tank for its proprietary compressed gas hydrogen carrier, H2NEO, and the floating storage solution, H2Leo.
The two parties have also entered into an agreement to jointly develop a fully automated production and fabrication facility in Norway for the construction of compressed hydrogen tanks. The tank production facility aims to start operations mid-2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/31/council-calls-for-regulatory-reform-as-electric-car-sales-accelerate/,"EV,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 31, 2023",Council calls for regulatory reform as electric car sales accelerate,"The Electric Vehicle Council’s (EVC) latest State of Electric Vehicles report shows a significant surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales with EVs representing 8.4% of all new cars sold in Australia in the first half of 2023, up from 3.8% for the same period last year. The new high is a 120.5% increase compared to 2022.
Sales of electric cars in Australia in the first six months of the year eclipsed the total for all of 2022 with 46,624 EVs sold in the light vehicle market as of the end of June, a 269% increase on the same period in 2022.
The ECV said the sales figures are a move in the right direction but cautioned that Australia still has a long way to go to catch up to international standards and it is well behind what is required to achieve the nation’s emissions targets.
“While these most recent sales figures are encouraging, in order for Australia to achieve its climate targets, it is expected that more than 50% of all new cars sold in 2030 will need to be EVs,” the council says in the report. “This means Australia will need to aim for around 1 million EVs on our roads by the end of 2027.”

The ECV called for the introduction of a globally competitive new vehicle efficiency standard to bring Australia into line with comparable overseas markets, like the U.S., European Union and New Zealand before 2030.
The report shows that the vast majority of EV sales in the first six months of 2023 is made up of only three models. The Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3, and BYD Atto 3 represent more than 68% of all EV new car sales during the period.
“While there are now 91 electric car, van and ute models available in Australia, most of these are only being supplied in small volumes,” the ECV said. “This is a consequence of Australia not having a new vehicle efficiency standard to ensure car manufacturers increase the supply of EVs to our country.”
The ECV said the lack of regulatory reform by government vehicles is also hindering the adoption of heavy EVs, including buses and trucks.
“While there is strong interest from industry to make the switch to electric heavy vehicles, this transition is being held back by a lack of suitable vehicles,” it said.
The ECV estimates that there are now approximately 130,000 EVs on Australia’s roads, made up of about 109,000 battery electric vehicles and 21,000 plug-in hybrid EVs. The council estimates that If EV sales continue at the same rate for the remainder of 2023, the fleet should reach close to 180,000 by year’s end.
Drivers in the Australian Capital Territory lead the country on EV sales as a proportion of new vehicle sales) at 21.8%, followed by Tasmania (9.0%), New South Wales (9.0%), Victoria (8.5%), Queensland (7.7%), Western Australia (7.5%), South Australia (6.5%), and the Northern Territory (2.4%)

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/31/topcon-pv-modules-outperform-perc-by-more-than-5-in-energy-yield-tests/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MALAYSIA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"JULY 31, 2023",TOPCon PV modules outperform PERC by more than 5% in energy yield tests,"Most PV manufacturers are now well underway with the switch to n-type technologies and we are beginning to see these modules, primarily based on n-type TOPCon technology, rolling out to mainstream installations.
As they made the switch, manufacturers promised more electricity and longer lifetimes from the new products. And as they make their way into more projects, we can see how these claims play out in the field under various climate conditions. Many studies have been carried out already, and the signs so far are good for n-type.
One such study confirms a 5.69% gain in normalised energy yield (energy generated per unit of capacity) over a three-month period. German company TÜV Nord carried out the study at a test installation in Selangor, Malaysia.
Three module types were installed at the site: A 545 W n-type TOPCon module and a 540 W p-type PERC module, both using 182 mm half cells and both manufactured by JinkoSolar. A third module, also bifacial PERC, with 210 mm cells and a 645 W power rating and from an unnamed manufacturer, was also included in the test. The test installation comprised two modules of each type, installed on fixed tilt racking one metre above the ground and connected via micro inverters.
Performance of each module was carefully measured over the first three months of 2023. During the period, Jinko’s TOPCon module generated 205.32 kWh, while its PERC counterpart reached 192.42 kWh, and the PERC module based on 210mm cells generated 227.89 kWh.
Thanks to its higher power rating and larger size, the 210mm module generated the most energy during the three-month period. However, when normalised based on each module power rating, the n-type module achieved a yield 5.69% higher than the 182 mm PERC module used as a baseline, while the larger module was 0.97% behind.

Jinko’s n-type module also achieved the highest performance ratio of the three. Performance ratio compares the actual energy yield to a calculation based on the power rating and weather conditions. TÜV Nord measured a 96.03% performance ratio for the n-type module, with the other two trailing slightly behind.
Separately, TÜV Nord also compared JinkoSolar’s TOPCon module with a conventional PERC product in accelerated reliability testing: two modules were subject a series of laboratory tests, going beyond the standards outlined by the IEC. Modules were subject to thermal cycling, extended damp heat, mechanical load, humidity freeze and ultraviolet light.
Additional test stages designed to detect susceptibility to light induced degradation (LID) Light-elevated temperature induced degradation (LETID), and potential-induced degradation. In all of these test stages, the n-type module showed significantly better performance.
In LID testing the n-type module lost 0.26% of its initial performance, compared to 1.92% for the PERC module. LETID testing told a similar story, with a 0.09% loss for the n-type module, and 1.17 for PERC. And in UV testing, which has emerged as an area of concern for some TOPCon modules, JinkoSolar’s n-type product lost only 0.60% performance, compared with 2.21% for the PERC product.
