Unlike fossil fuel power stations, solar farms need a lot of room to generate enough electricity to keep up with demand. Most solar farms are composed of ground-mounted panels that take up land that could be used to grow food or provide habitat for wildlife.
Although electricity and water don’t usually mix, a growing number of floating solar farms are being deployed worldwide. Floating solar panels on a lake or reservoir might sound like an accident waiting to happen, but recent studies have shown the technology generates more electricity compared with rooftop or ground-mounted solar installations. This is thanks to the cooling effect of the water beneath the panels, which can boost how efficiently these systems generate electricity by as much as 12.5%.
That said, lakes and reservoirs are already very important for people and the planet. While these freshwater bodies cover less than 1% of Earth’s surface, they nurture almost 6% of its biodiversity and provide drinking water and crop irrigation that’s vital to billions of people. Worryingly, climate change has raised the surface temperatures of lakes globally by an average of 0.34°C per decade since 1985, encouraging toxic algal blooms, lowering water levels and preventing water mixing between the distinct layers which naturally form in larger and deeper lakes, starving the depths of oxygen.
In the rush to decarbonise energy in order to slow global warming, might turning to floating solar farms simply add to the strain on the world’s precious freshwater reserves? Remarkably, in new research, we found that carefully designed floating solar farms could actually reduce the threats posed by climate change to lakes and reservoirs.
Along with colleagues, I used a computer model to simulate how floating solar farms are likely to affect lake water temperatures. Our simulations are based on Windermere, the largest lake in England and one of the most well-studied lakes in the world.
Floating solar farms reduce how much wind and sunlight reaches the lake’s surface, changing many of the processes that occur within. As each floating solar farm has a different design, we ran simulations to see how lake temperatures changed with over 10,000 unique combinations of wind speed and solar radiation.
Our results suggest that the changes to water temperatures caused by floating solar farms could be as big as climate change itself, only in the opposite direction.
A floating solar farm that reduces wind speed and solar radiation by 10% across the entire lake could offset a decade of warming from climate change. Designs that shaded the lake more than sheltered it, by reducing sunlight more than wind, had the greatest cooling effect. Evaporation fell and the lake was mixed more frequently, which helps oxygenate the deeper water.
These effects might vary depending on a lake’s depth, surface area and location. But ecological processes in lakes are most affected by wind speed and sunlight, which is what our simulations focused on.
While most of our simulations indicated a win-win for lakes and floating solar farms, some suggested undesirable side effects. In a small number of simulations, we found that floating solar farms that reduced wind speed at the lake’s surface more than they reduced sunlight might actually mimic or amplify the effects of climate change, increasing how long deeper lakes remain stratified. Thankfully, we think the careful design of floating solar farms should reduce these risks.
Floating solar power has grown more than a hundredfold in the past five years, reaching 2.6 gigawatts of installed capacity across 35 countries. If just 1% of the surface area of all human-made water bodies (which are easier to access and typically less ecologically sensitive than natural lakes) was covered by floating solar panels, it could generate 400 gigawatts – enough electricity to power 44 billion LED light bulbs for a year.
Floating solar is likely to make an important contribution to the decarbonisation of the world’s energy supplies. In a stroke of serendipity, our research suggests this could have the added benefit of offsetting part of the damage to lakes caused by rising temperatures.
Still, our simulations only covered the physical effects of floating solar, while other questions remain unresolved. How would floating solar farms interact with other lake uses, such as sport or aquaculture? How would the wildlife sharing the lake fare? And which lakes are best suited to hosting a floating solar farm? The work to fully understand the potential of this technology is only just beginning.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/16/retail-property-major-makes-solar-pv-move/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 16, 2021",Retail property major makes solar PV move,"The owner of Australia’s largest neighbourhood and convenience-based shopping centre portfolio, SCA Property Group has announced financial approval for an initial $12 million investment into onsite solar PV which will see 7.5 MW of solar installed across six of the group’s 91 shopping centres.
The initial focus will be on Western Australia with solar modules to be installed at the Currambine, Kalamunda, Kwinana, Stirling, Treendale and Warnbro shopping centres. The solar PV will be integrated with existing embedded networks on-site.
The group’s national sustainability manager, Tim Weale, told pv magazine the opportunity afforded by SCA’s $3.5 billion property portfolio, which comprises 91 assets spread across all the six Australian states and the Northern Territory, was too good to ignore.
“We are Australia’s largest owner of neighbourhood and convenience-based shopping centres and with that comes great opportunities considering the available roof space we have,” he said.
“We’re not the first property group to deploy solar across the portfolio but given we have over 90 shopping centres, we could become one of the biggest generators in the retail property space of renewable energy.
“We have aspirations to grow our renewable energy portfolio over the next five years. We’re not the first but we could be the biggest.”
The sector has seen a flurry of activity in recent years with Frasers Property Group stating on its website it has already installed 13.69 MW of solar PV across its portfolio while fellow Australian retail property major Vicinity Centres has also been active in the space.
Frasers Property Industrial
Weale said SCA would look to make the most of the lessons learnt in recent years by others in both the property and solar industries.
“There have been real advancements in exploration, technology, panels, so we see that as a real bonus which will enable us to accelerate our program,” he said.
“There are so many design and delivery partners out there who have quite sophisticated capabilities now, we see that as a real advantage.
“While we may not be the first in the space, we get the benefit of all those lessons learnt.”
Weale said the group already has “a number” of power purchase agreements (PPAs) and embedded networks in place at some sites and the new solar PV installations will “build on top of that”.
The rollout of solar PV across the SCA portfolio is expected to form part of the group’s soon-to-be-released environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy which Weale said will bring it into line with the commitments made by its major retail partners.
“As the market moves toward a carbon zero economy, this is just the beginning of a number of important operational and strategic investments that SCA will make in the coming years,” he said, adding the group will announce its new ESG Strategy in August.

“Coles and Woolworths are our largest retail partners throughout our assets and they have both made their own commitments for net zero carbon targets by 2025 so as part of what our strategy we will be making our own announcement for our own targets for 2025 and 2030.
“We want to align with those from the majors, absolutely. They are right on board and very engaged in the renewable energy sector so we’re aligning ourselves with our major partners.
While SCA was unable to provide a firm date for commencement of the initial 7.5 MW solar rollout, Weale said the group is looking to move ahead as soon as possible.
“Once we’ve completed the design and have all the approvals in place we’ll look to commence on the ground as soon as practical,” he said.
“Ideally we would like to get in before the Western Australian summer.”

APA will also back up the solar and gas hybrid microgrid with a 4.4 MW/4.4 MWh battery energy storage system which will provide reliable electricity for the mine, a 50/50 joint venture between Gold Road Resources and the global miner Gold Fields Limited.
“We look forward to assisting APA and the mine owners … to help reduce the overall carbon intensity and cost of power supply to the Gruyere gold mine,” Juwi’s global hybrid director Dave Manning said.
The solar farm is expected to be operational later this year and the hybrid facility is expected to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 16,000 tonnes per annum.
The project is the latest in a string of deals juwi has announced in recent months, including plans to construct a solar farm as part of global energy producer Energy Developments Limited’s solar-diesel hybrid power station at Jabiru in the Northern Territory.
Juwi announced in February it will construct a 3.9 MW solar farm which will be coupled with a 3 MW/5 MWh battery and 4.5 MW diesel power plant to deliver at least 50% renewable energy to the township.

Only last month Juwi announced it will construct a 3.4 MW solar farm which is to be coupled with an existing 12 MW diesel-powered station at Iluka’s Jacinth-Ambrosia mine in South Australia.
The project developer has also signed a deal with Pacific Energy’s subsidiary Contract Power to build a hybrid renewable energy project which will power the town of Esperance. The project will feature a 4 MW solar farm alongside two 4.5 MW wind turbines integrated with a lithium-ion battery system and gas generators.
The latest projects build on juwi’s early successes with three hybrid projects already completed, including the DeGrussa project, a 10.6 MW solar array, plus 6 MWh battery, integrated with existing diesel generation to supply Sandfire’s copper and gold mine site in WA.
The facility became fully operational in 2016 and at the time was the world’s largest diesel-solar hybrid system, and the largest off-grid PV system in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/16/australian-pv-glass-developer-sets-sights-on-japanese-market/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 16, 2021",Australian PV glass developer sets sights on Japanese market,"ClearVue Technologies has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Tomita Technologies for the sale and marketing of the Perth-based company’s smart solar PV glass products for use in greenhouses and protected cropping agriculture in Japan.
ClearVue is pursuing BIPV technology designed to preserve glass transparency while generating electricity with solar PV cells incorporated around the edges of an insulated glass unit (IGU).
The IGUs are currently being trialled on site at Perth’s Murdoch University where they have been installed in a commercial-scale greenhouse. Data supplied by the company indicates the technology delivers a minimum of 30 W per sqm while maintaining 70% transparency. ClearVue has said previously that in a greenhouse setting its technology delivers a temperature range of +/-2° from the optimum, providing an increased growth rate of up to 20-30%.
The greenhouse trial project, which is partially funded by a $1.6 million Cooperative Research Centres Projects (CRC-P) grant, is expected to be officially opened later this month.
The five-year distribution agreement announced this week provides Tomita with an exclusive licence for the distribution, marketing and sales of ClearVue’s products for greenhouse and protected cropping agriculture applications in Japan.
Tomita is however excluded from selling or marketing the PV glazing products to the general construction market in Japan, including high-rise construction which ClearVue has previously identified as a key focus of its business model.
“The distribution agreement with Tomita Technologies follows ClearVue’s work on establishing greenhousing and protected cropping agriculture as a key application for ClearVue’s world leading solar PV glazing solution,” ClearVue executive chairman Victor Rosenberg said.
“Tomita originally reached out to ClearVue in 2020 following our announcement of the work we had started on the CRC-P partially funded greenhouse that the company has just recently finished building at Murdoch University in Western Australia.”

The Japanese deal will focus on greenhouse and protected cropping agriculture applications with Tomita one of the country’s leading suppliers to the sector. Established in 1947, the Yokahama-based company was responsible for the installation of more than 250,000 square metres of greenhousing in the past 15 years alone.
ClearVue said Tomika also provides agribusiness consulting services for growers and plant factory management advice, including those growers who are deploying technology to upgrade existing greenhouse facilities.
“Tomita Technologies is the Japanese leader in horticulture and greenhouse solutions,” company president Hiraaki Tomita said.
“To maintain our place as the leader in this space we are always on the lookout for world-leading products and solutions that we can implement into our client projects and for our own greenhousing projects.

“We are confident that the use and integration of the ClearVue PV solar glazing into our sales offering – with its ability to maintain a highly controlled microclimate within a greenhouse whilst at the same time generating electricity for use in reducing costs of greenhouse operation – will be a fantastic proposition for our customer project deployments, whether for new projects, or for greenhouse upgrade and renewal projects and will help us to maintain our place as the Japanese leader in the greenhousing industry.”
The Tomita distribution agreement is ClearVue’s second foray into the Japanese market after high-profile Fujisan Winery placed an order in November for approximately 30sqm of the company’s PV glazing product for use in a greenhouse to be built at the winery at the base of Mount Fuji.
That deal came after ClearVue announced it October it had secured its first South American order with AMB Brazil placing an order for 500 sqm of solar glass. AMB Brazil will use the IGUs in large-scale commercial projects, including a new office tower and at the company’s own offices in Sao Paulo.
ClearVue has also entered the China market, announcing in September that a demonstration villa had been constructed in Beijing in conjunction with Jinmao Green Building which is trialling the PV IGU technology with a view towards distribution.

The two nations shook hands on an agreement for a joint feasibility study into green hydrogen production and trade back in September 2020, a consortium study known as HySupply, led by the University of New South Wales (UNSW) to test the viability of a renewable energy-based hydrogen supply chain between the countries. 
Today it can be seen that HySupply is not wasting any time either, after RWE Supply & Trading and Australian hydrogen project developer The Hydrogen Utility (H2U), have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) toward the aim of transporting green hydrogen as ammonia from H2U’s Eyre Peninsula Gateway Project in South Australia, to Germany’s LNG Terminal in Brunsbüttel, where RWE intends to book capacity. 
H2U is looking to build a 75 MW electrolysis plant at the South Australian location, a plant big enough to supply 40,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually. According to H2U this is only an initial stage however, with plans to expand the plant’s capacity to 1.5 GW of electrolysis. 
“H2 is the perfect long-term solution to decarbonise industry, aviation and the transport of heavy goods,” says Javier Moret, global head of LNG at RWE Supply & Trading, “Australia is one of the countries that has excellent conditions to produce green hydrogen – low cost of production and a stable framework. As a globally active trader of commodities, we have a lot of experience with shipping energy carriers – including Australian LNG – around the globe and see ourselves as a facilitator for global hydrogen trading.”
H2U CEO Attilio Pigneri, said the possibilities for the partnership are no less than Germany’s and Europe’s future. “We see the trading of green hydrogen to Europe being fully decarbonised using green ammonia as the shipping fuel of the future,” Pigneri said. 
Neither party is a stranger to big projects or big investments. RWE’s renewables outfit is behind the 220 MW Limondale Solar Farm in south-west NSW. And H2U has already attracted investment from Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan being another key offtaker market for Australia’s future green hydrogen exports.  
Of course, South Australia is not the only Australian state in the race to export green hydrogen to Germany. Back in December 2020, Western Australia hosted an inaugural roundtable with some of the two nations’ biggest industry hitters in an effort to further discuss opportunities for collaboration.

Bouygues Construction Australia, the company managing the site, has reportedly failed to take worker complaints to SafeWork NSW. Among the workers’ core complaints are vermin in eating areas, shoddy toilet and fridge conditions, a lack of women’s hygiene facilities and a lack of access to fresh drinking water in hot conditions (though the pictures provided do show large water bottles). 
On top of that, video has emerged showing a crane dangling a shipping container precariously over a staff lunchroom.

Allen Hicks, deputy secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, NSW and ACT Branch, described the conditions as “disgraceful” and “endangering the lives of our members.” Hicks called on NSW Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean to take urgent action to make sure basic safety standards are being enforced.

Hicks went so far as to describe the event as “clean energy’s dirty secret”, but of course, this is no more clean energy’s secret than the secret of construction in general. 
Craig Bearsley, energy director at global infrastructure firm Aecom, recently told pv magazine that the labour resources required to build solar farms are not easy to find in Australia, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“We don’t have the supply of backpackers that we had to build solar farms two years ago, they’ve gone,” said Bearsley. “And you don’t find a hell of a lot of Australians that want to go out and screw in bolts on solar panels all day in the sun.” 
Various branches of the Electrical Trades Union have taken aim at construction companies involved in solar park construction. The union, which historically wielded considerable power through their strong membership base at coal and gas-fired power plants, has been active in highlighting work practice and safety concerns at solar construction sites in the past.
In mid-2019, construction of over 3 GW of utility scale solar was disrupted in Queensland, when the state government introduced a requirement that solar module installation only be carried out by licensed electricians. The move, thrown out by the courts, was seen by some as behind-the-scenes efforts by unions to expand their influence to solar farm construction.

Canada-based high-purity metals and compounds provider 5N Plus has agreed to acquire Germany’s Azur Space Solar Power GmbH, a manufacturer of multi‐junction solar cells for space and terrestrial concentrated photovoltaic applications.
The Montreal-based company will buy all the issued and outstanding shares of Azur for a sum between €73 million and €79 million. “This acquisition is the foundation of a strategic transformation that will unlock notable market potential,” said 5N Plus CEO, Arjang Roshan. “Azur and 5N Plus complement each other and our integration will culminate in a sustainable supply chain which will ensure the competitiveness and security of supply for our customers and government agencies.”
Founded in 1964, Azur Space is headquartered in Heilbronn, in southwest Germany, and has 250 employees. It produces highly expensive triple-junction space solar cells with an average efficiency of up to 30% and is planning to develop ultra-thin solar cells with up to 35%.
5N Plus operates in Europe, North America, and Asia and is one of the world’s largest raw material suppliers for the thin-film solar module manufacturing industry, to which it provides purified metals such as bismuth, gallium, germanium, indium, selenium and tellurium, and related II-VI semiconducting compounds such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium sulphide (CdS) and indium antimonide (InSb).
U.S. manufacturer First Solar has been among its clients since 2007. In the latest supply deal, announced in November, the panel maker agreed to buy semiconductor materials for the manufacture of CdTe panels.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/16/pv-module-price-index-new-dimensions-new-problems/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"APRIL 16, 2021","PV module price index: New dimensions, new problems","From pv magazine 04/2021
In recent weeks, module prices have stabilised at a high level across most technologies, but availability to fill short-term demand remains poor. At present, almost no modules are available for below $0.20/W, even for larger projects. New deliveries of significant quantities from Asia are expected in the April-June timeframe, but even those are likely to be in the high-efficiency sector and thus the high-end price range. So far, no manufacturers have signalled that prices will come down significantly in the second half of the year.
The high cost of raw materials continues to put pressure on module prices. Many prefer not to commit to any more binding prices to avoid another train wreck like at the beginning of this year, when they could only honour agreed contract prices by foregoing any profit. Delivery volumes to Europe were quickly capped as the focus shifted to more lucrative markets. Now, some are waiting to see how demand in China shapes up before writing delivery schedules and price lists.
In Europe, it will be interesting to see whether the current high demand for modules, driven by the German market with up to 500 MW per month, will slow after the latest FIT deadline. The transition period runs until March 31, by which time rooftop systems up to 750 kW must be operational to qualify for the full FIT. Demand from April onwards will largely depend on how quickly the players adapt to new conditions and whether the small-scale sector in Germany, which is already booming, can compensate for the loss of volume in the medium-scale segment.
Over the past 12 months, PV panels have become larger and heavier thanks to larger wafer dimensions. In my view, there is one main reason driving this: to make production more efficient, and thus less expensive. Especially in times of scarce resources and high raw material prices, this seems the only way for manufacturers to make a profit without their cell and module prices rising excessively. But for planners, installers, and dealers, this creates new, sometimes intractable challenges.
A larger cell area also invariably entails a higher output amperage. Although cells are first cut in half or even smaller, operating currents of 12, 13 or even 18 amps are no longer a rarity. This poses a challenge in finding a way to connect strings that are compatible with the intended inverter. Often, new modules have such a high max current that two parallel strings can no longer be connected to a single input, which makes efficient utilisation of the inverter difficult.
Neither their size nor weight of modules larger than 2m² allows single-person handling adhering to occupational health and safety measures. Products for ground mount applications, which recently have reached power ratings north of 550 W, leave mechanical handling as the only option. These products can only be safely installed with a suction lifter and robotic arm – provided there is no strong wind.
Packing density and pallet weight is another topic that has received far too little attention. Increasing the glass area invariably increases the unit weight, especially in the case of glass-glass modules. At the same time, however, the frames are thinner – in the worst case, at the expense of stability. A pallet containing 31 modules at 32 kg weighs in at more than 1,000 kg. Freight forwarders like to apply surcharges to such loads, which makes transport even more expensive. Usually module crates are stacked two high in the truck or container, and then have to be unloaded and moved to a temporary storage facility – or worse, to a construction site. This is no longer possible with a pallet truck, hydraulic lift or other light equipment; heavy equipment must be available.
For rooftop modules, further optimisation is needed to ensure trouble-free installation, ideally by a single person. A module area of 2m² should be the upper limit in any case, which is true with the current cell efficiencies for module types up to 400 W. If we move from the flat roof to the pitched roof segment, especially for small systems, aspects such as aesthetics and service life come into play. Black framed, or even glass-glass modules are a good choice. Since an individual weight of 25 kg should not be exceeded, the modules should have an output of up to 350 W. For smaller roofs on detached or terraced housing, panels in the classic 48- or 54-cell format – for example, measuring 1.5 x 1 meters at 300 W – are an option. This is because, as modules get larger, limited clamping area makes it increasingly difficult to design a sound substructure.
The ideal ground-mount module may be somewhat larger. For ease of processing, however, 2.5 m² and 30 kg should be the upper limit – a format of 2.3 x 1.1 meters and 550 W, for instance – at least for a mostly manual installation. On the shipping side, packing densities of 24 to 26 modules per pallet have a long and proven track record. Modules can also be transported upright – on a euro pallet or an industrial pallet, for instance. This enables efficient loading, but the individual weight should be kept below 900 kg. An option to remove individual modules without the package collapsing rounds off my wish list.
I reach these recommendations on the basis of the above mentioned criteria, all of which seem important to me. In the hopes of stimulating a long overdue discussion on these issues, I welcome other opinions.
