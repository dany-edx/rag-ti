SunWiz said residential volumes were down 2% on November in which a record 329 MW of new rooftop solar was installed across the nation.
Sunwiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston described the 321 MW December 2023 total as a “let-down” yet it is the second-best month on record and is above the volumes seen in the same month in 2020, 2021 and 2022.
The December tally took the annual total to about 3.17 GW of new rooftop solar capacity, a 14% increase on 2022 and behind only the 2021 record for annual installations of just over 3.23 GW.
While residential volumes were down on the previous month, SunWiz said the commercial market, comprising 15-100 kW systems, improved considerably over December 2023 and shows no sign of tapering off.

SunWiz said the residential contraction occurred in most states, with South Australia the only jurisdiction to grow, where it climbed by 2%. In New South Wales and Queensland residential installations were down by 1%, with Victoria and Western Australia down 6% and 4% respectively.
The decline in the residential segments and surge in commercial installations saw average system sizes reach a new high. The average system size for December 2023 grew to 10.47 kW, courtesy of that commercial growth.
The fall in cost of new panels also meant the payback period for new systems dropped below five years for residential users. SunWiz said most rooftop PV systems are paying for themselves in less than five years, while in some states, like Queensland, households are better off financially in as little as three years.
For commercial users, panels will pay off their costs in about 5.3 years as of the end or 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/10/worker-injured-after-fire-at-south-australian-solar-farm/,"INSURANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 10, 2024",Worker injured in fire at South Australian solar farm,"The South Australia Country Fire Service (CFS) has confirmed that a contractor was taken to hospital for treatment of burns after an inverter in a shipping container ignited at Epic Energy’s Mannum solar farm, causing an estimated $250,000 damage bill.
The CFS said 10 firefighters responded on Tuesday morning after an emergency call about an inverter in “bursting into flames” at the solar farm site. The facility, being developed adjacent to Epic’s initial 5 MW Mannum Solar Farm, about 85 kilometres east of Adelaide, is currently undergoing commissioning following the completion of construction last year.
“CFS crews managed to keep the fire contained to the shipping container and stop it spreading to nearby solar panels,” CFS said in a statement.
“A contractor on site has been taken to hospital for treatment and SAPOL (South Australian Police) investigators have attended the site to conduct a workplace safety report.”
In a statement shared with pv magazine, Epic Chief Executive Officer Clive D’Cruz said the company’s principal contractor is “working with SafeWork SA to investigate the incident.”
“We are offering our support to our principal contractor and wish the injured personnel a full and speedy recovery,” he said. “The safety of our staff and contractors is Epic Energy’s highest priority.”
D’Cruz said repairs will be “undertaken as quickly and safely as possible’ as the commissioning process continues.
The stage two expansion of the solar farm is located adjacent to the Mannum 33/132 kV substation and will operate independently from the initial 5 MW stage, which has been operating since 2019, as it has an independent connection to the SA Power Networks distribution grid.
The incident follows Epic’s announcement this week that it will build a 100 MW / 200 MWh standalone battery energy storage system alongside its solar farms at Mannum. Construction of the battery is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2024, with completion scheduled for the second half of 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/10/epic-adds-big-battery-to-complement-south-australian-solar/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 10, 2024",Epic adds big battery to complement South Australian solar,"South Australian energy infrastructure company Epic Energy has announced plans to build a 200 MWh standalone battery energy storage system alongside its existing 35 MW of solar generation capacity at Mannum in the state’s Riverland region after acquiring the project from Canadian Solar subsidiary Recurrent Energy.
Epic said the estimated $130 million (USD 87 million) big battery will complement the original 5 MW Mannum Solar Farm, that has been operating since 2019, and the 30 MW stage two expansion that is progressing through the commissioning process, serving as a vital energy reservoir to enhance grid stability in the region.
Epic Chief Executive Officer Clive D’Cruz said the Mannum battery project will create much-needed energy storage to facilitate the integration of new renewable generation sources and support the state’s ongoing energy security and energy transition.
“The battery will further support the South Australian electricity market and ongoing energy security by absorbing excess energy during the day and storing it for use during the evening peak,” he said.
Construction of the standalone battery is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2024, with completion scheduled for the second half of 2025.
The project will utilise lithium-iron phosphate battery technology provided by Canadian Solar subsidiary e-Storage.
It is anticipated e-Storage will employ the latest iteration of its SolBank utility-scale battery energy storage system for the project. The company said the recently launched SolBank 3.0 offers up to 45% more capacity and a 40% decrease in commissioning time compared to the previous 2.0 iteration.
The Mannum battery energy storage project is the latest addition to Epic’s expanding renewable energy portfolio in Australia.  The company, which owns and operates a gas pipeline network spanning 1,200 kilometres across South Australia, has in recent years branched out into renewable energy generation. Its portfolio of renewable infrastructure includes the IKEA Adelaide solar and battery microgrid, and the Timboon West and Yawong wind farms in Victoria’s northwest.
It has also been selected by the Office of Hydrogen Power South Australia to progress the early contractor involvement phase of the state’s Hydrogen Jobs Plan project with a focus on the development of a dual-purpose renewable hydrogen storage and transmission pipeline.
“We are committed to leveraging our expertise to embrace new energy directions that support Australia’s energy transition,” D’Cruz said.

Italy-based Fly Solartech Solutions Srl has developed new plug-and-play TOPCon solar modules for deployment on balconies and terraces.
“The module can be installed in less than 10 minutes,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. “The 350 W panel is made up of 60 high-efficiency full-black M6 TOPCon cells and is produced at our factory in Tolmezzo, in the northern Italian province of Udine.”
The iCarus modules measure 165 mm x 197 mm x 31 mm and weigh 7.6 kg. They don’t use glass on both sides and they are covered by an anti-reflective and anti-scratch composite material.
The panels have a power conversion efficiency power of 17.87% and a temperature coefficient of -0.27% per degree Celsius. The open-circuit voltage is 38.93 V and the short-circuit current is 10.96 A.
The new products feature IP68 junction boxes and come with a 25-year performance warranty and a five-year product warranty. They are sold with a 2.35 kg, 300 W CEI-021 certified microinverter with a peak efficiency of 96.5% and an IP67 enclosure.
“The remaining KIT is composed of an inclined aluminum fixing structure and a structure for vertical fixing on the railing,” the spokesperson said. “It also includes a 220V extension cable. Additionally, our user-friendly app allows you to monitor daily production and track your savings.”
Fly Solartech Solutions Srl is based in San Daniele del Friuli, Italy. It currently owns and operates a 40 MW factory in Tolmezzo. It also offers lightweight cylindrical solar panels that can be integrated into PV-powered street lighting lamp posts of different sizes.
