The key question on the minds of progressive MPs and senators should be: how do we get the best climate outcome from this government’s term in office?
Labor has pledged to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. But there’s been very little media or political discussion of what Australia should be aiming for in 2035. This is baffling.
Pressuring Labor to adopt a higher 2035 target could have the same effect as increasing the 2030 target, without engaging in the frustrating wedge politics that has bedevilled climate action in Australia.

The teal independents, Greens and other crossbenchers are this week examining a draft of the climate legislation Labor will introduce when parliament resumes.
The Coalition looks set to oppose the climate bill. So Labor needs the Greens and another independent, probably the progressive senator David Pocock, to ease the policy through the Senate.
The Greens have called for emissions reductions of 75% by 2030 and many teal candidates want at least a 60% cut. In recent days, Greens leader Adam Bandt declared the Greens would push Labor to improve the bill, saying it: allows future climate-wrecking governments to announce lower targets, doesn’t seem to require the government to actually do anything to cut pollution and allows more coal and gas projects, which will put even this weak target out of reach.
But Bowen says Labor “will not be walking away” from the 43% pledge it took to the election. High in Bowen’s mind, no doubt, is the Gillard Labor government’s experience in minority government in 2010.
As part of negotiations with the Greens to form government, Labor agreed to introduce a carbon price – a move some interpreted as a broken election promise.
The Abbott Coalition relentlessly pursued Labor over the policy all the way to the 2013 election, when it knocked Labor out of office.

Now back in power, Labor wants only to deliver on its climate pledge, and no more. The party must also appease its traditional voter base in coal-reliant seats in New South Wales and Queensland.
Similarly, the Greens were painted as wreckers on climate action after the party blocked the Rudd government’s proposed carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2009, saying it lacked ambition.
The Greens are presumably keen to avoid the label again. But they also have to deliver for their voters, as do the teals.
The Greens say they’re willing to negotiate with Labor over the bill, although the Greens’ call for a ban on new coal projects is a likely sticking point.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the 43% emission target is “a floor, not a ceiling”. Pocock has indicated he may support Labor’s proposal if that’s the case.
Adding the words “at least” to the figure of 43%, which is currently missing, would ensure the target was indeed a floor, not a ceiling. It would also mean any government of the day would not have to return to parliament to increase the target at a later date.
After this should come a second step. The Greens and teals should demand that the legislation includes a strong interim target: at least 60% emissions reduction by 2035.

Australia is scheduled to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But as it stands, Labor’s bill provides very little indication of the path to get there.
This leaves a policy gap the progressives should seek to fill. Australia needs an ambitious target for 2030, but we shouldn’t fixate on this date alone.
Interim emissions reduction targets are key to nations meeting their obligations under the Paris Agreement – and Australia needs such targets at regular intervals between now and 2050 to ensure long term and sustainable climate action.
One of Europe’s most progressive pieces of climate legislation, in Denmark, requires interim targets be set every five years, a decade in advance, to drive change.
Similarly in Australia at the state level, Victoria has a legislated requirement to set new interim targets every five years and has asked an expert panel to advise on an interim 2035 goal.
Think tanks in Australia have also been active on the target. Both the Climate Council and the Climateworks Centre have called on Australia to achieve net-zero by 2035.
And last year, a report by the expert Climate Targets Panel found Australia should reduce emissions by 67% by 2035, to do its fair share of limiting global warming below 2℃.
However, 2035 targets have been largely absent from national political discussion. The Greens want Australia to reach net-zero in that timeframe, but haven’t advertised it widely.
A strong 2035 emissions target would enable Labor to deliver on its election promise. The teals and Greens could also argue they’d significantly improved Labor’s climate policy.
And the target would would shift the dial on political discourse over emissions reduction. In turn, corporate strategies, state government plans and investment momentum would shift to reflect the new ambition.

With a new Labor government, the crossbench must use this pivotal moment to shift the goalposts towards stronger climate action.
The teals and the Greens should accept Labor’s proposed 43% emission reduction target for 2030, while ensuring that the legislation includes a target of at least 60% in 2035.
The next political fight will be how Australia reaches the new target – and how fast we move away from coal and gas.
But as the new Labor government finds its feet, it’s crucial the crossbench seizes this opportunity to enshrine more ambitious emissions targets in law, to address the threats of a warming planet.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/18/uq-targets-testing-platform-to-fast-track-large-scale-grid-connections/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 18, 2022",UQ targets testing platform to fast-track large-scale grid connections,"The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) funding will help facilitate the development of a new testing platform designed to aleviate grid connection problems which remain a major issue across the National Electricity Market (NEM) and have affected multiple wind and solar and battery projects.
Large-scale generators looking to connect to Australia’s main grid are required to negotiate and comply with a set of performance standards. Currently, compliance with these Generator Performance Standards (GPS) is demonstrated by extensive power system modelling that must then be validated during onsite commissioning. This process can be challenging and often causes lengthy delays to connect the renewable power projects to the grid.
Researchers from the University of Queensland (UQ) have teamed with Brisbane-based electrical engineering contractor EPEC Group to develop a new platform which is designed to allow common commissioning issues to be identified and resolved in a custom-designed testing environment, prior to installation on site.
UQ lead researcher Dr Richard Yan said the platform, being designed as part of a $1.46 million study being conducted in the university’s solar renewable energy laboratory, could help to facilitate faster commissioning of renewable energy projects by allowing them to resolve any issues with the modelling before commissioning.
EPEC said connecting to the electricity network represents the single largest barrier to most renewable energy projects with the company’s own research revealing that many large-scale solar and battery projects have experienced connection delays, which substantially affect investor confidence and increase costs of new renewable generation projects.
Yan said the off-site testing approach could become standard practice for renewable generators and help to accelerate and de-risk new generation connecting to the grid, adding faster and lower-risk commissioning will result in lower-cost renewable energy projects and reduced barriers for hybrid projects.
‘’The new testing platform will be a market-leading development to support the growing number of renewable energy projects in Australia,” he said.
If the testing platform is successful, UQ and EPEC aim to commercialise the technology and apply it to future renewable energy projects across the NEM.
ARENA acting chief executive officer Chris Faris said the testing platform could help accelerate Australia’s transition to renewable electricity.
“To meet our national 2030 and 2050 emissions reductions goals, we must accelerate the pace of commissioning, installing and connecting renewable energy projects,” he said. “If we can streamline the commissioning process through smart application of technology like this project, we can reduce the costs and risks associated with bringing new generators online.
“This project has the potential to significantly speed up the process for bringing new solar, wind and battery projects online, so we’re excited to see what the University of Queensland team delivers.”

ACT minister for energy and emissions reduction Shane Rattenbury said the phase out will initially apply to new light vehicles, including passenger cars, motorcycles, and small trucks. It will also be backed up by an EV sales target, with between 80 to 90% of new vehicle sales in 2030 to be zero-emission models.
“This target is all about light vehicles,” he said. “Our intent is that from 2035, you will not be able to put a new (petrol light vehicle) on the road. There are electric models available right now that you can replace them with. And we expect more models to become available in the coming years.”
The ACT Zero Emissions Vehicles Strategy 2022-2030 is expected be released in full on Wednesday. It is anticipated the strategy will address what the government has identified as the four key barriers to EV take-up: affordability, infrastructure/range anxiety, availability and supportive government processes.
The policy is expected to include new financial incentives and other programs to encourage people to trade in their ICE vehicles for zero-emission models.

Already, the ACT has a number of incentives in place to drive the uptake of EVs, including two years’ free registration for new fully-electric vehicles and fuel-cell EVs and 20% off registration fees for older eligible EVs. It also offers a stamp duty waiver, and access to up to $15,000 towards the cost of an EV up to a cap of $77,565 under the Sustainable Household Scheme zero interest loans.
Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior campaigner Lindsay Soutar said the ACT’s plan to phase out the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles paves the road for other states and territories to follow and brings Australia more into line with where the rest of the world is heading, noting several global car manufacturers have already announced their intention to stop producing petrol cars.
“The UK has already committed to phase out internal combustion engine cars by 2030 and Europe recently committed to a phase out by 2035,” she said. “Other Australian states and territories must now follow the lead of the ACT and other jurisdictions around the world.”
Soutar said the move also lays down a marker for the Federal government to address the crucial issue of supply.
“The demand for EVs is clear and the Albanese Government must act to unlock supply by introducing a strong Fuel Efficiency Standard, which would heavily incentivise supply of clean cars, and put Australia on the superhighway to clean transport,” she said.
The ACT’s announcement coincides with the Queensland government confirming plans to extend its EV charging network to a distance of 5,400km – linking up another 10,000 drivers around the state.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said phase three of the Queensland Electric Super Highway rollout will see 24 EV charging sites open in regional and rural locations. This includes further connections along the Queensland/New South Wales border with two charging station locations planned at Goondiwindi and Stanthorpe.
Once complete, it is anticipated phase 3 will enable Queenslanders and tourists to travel across the state and use any of the 55 fast-charging sites along the way.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/18/viva-strikes-deal-for-2-5-mw-electrolyser-as-states-pursue-green-hydrogen-highway/,"HYDROGEN,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 18, 2022",Viva strikes deal for 2.5 MW electrolyser as states pursue green hydrogen highway,"Viva Energy has entered into an agreement with Nel Hydrogen, a subsidiary of Oslo-based Nel ASA, to supply a containerised electrolyser which will produce green hydrogen for use in the Australian company’s $43.3 million New Energies Service Station project being developed adjacent to its Geelong refinery.
Viva, which supplies approximately 25% of Australia’s liquid fuel requirements, said the electrolyser will be the “largest in Australia by a considerable margin”, capable of producing more than 1,000 kilograms of green hydrogen per day.
“This equipment will be the first of its kind in the Australian market,” Viva said in a statement. “Once installed, it will be at least twice the size of any other electrolyser producing green hydrogen in the country.”
The MC500 containerised proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser will have a production capacity of up to 1,063kg per day, and will supply fuel cell grade hydrogen produced on site to the dedicated fuelling station. The electrolyser, which is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2023, will be powered by renewable electricity with Viva planning to deploy an up to 20 MW solar array as part of its Geelong Energy Hub.
Viva has also placed an order with French gas company Air Liquide for the provision of a ‘fast fill’ hydrogen refuelling package designed to refuel at least 10 trucks or buses consecutively.
The system will be capable of dispensing 300kg of hydrogen in under two hours. Viva said this will provide hydrogen customers with a similar refuelling experience to today’s traditional service station.

Viva said the purchase orders are critical first steps in the company’s vision to establish “Australia’s most ambitious hydrogen mobility project”, which is expected to be the catalyst for a network of hydrogen refuelling stations located on key transport routes up Australia’s east coast, connecting Geelong and Melbourne to Sydney and Brisbane.
Viva, which supplies a service station network of about 1,350 Shell and Liberty service stations across Australia, said the New Energies Service Station is expected to commence operations in late 2023. The company said as well as offering commercial hydrogen refuelling facilities, it will also offer electric vehicle (EV) recharging.
The confirmation of the electrolyser purchase comes with the New South Wales (NSW) and Victorian governments announcing plans to work together to deliver Australia’s first renewable hydrogen highway.
The NSW and Victorian governments said on Monday they have each invested $10 million in grant funding for the Hume Hydrogen Highway, a joint grant initiative to support the development of at least four refuelling stations along the highway and approximately 25 hydrogen-powered trucks.
NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said applications are now open for $20 million in grant funding to support the design and delivery of renewable hydrogen trucking along Australia’s busiest freight corridor.
“This initiative aims to show the potential of renewable hydrogen for heavy vehicles with the goal of transitioning the freight sector to zero emissions energy sources,” he said, adding the project is “expected to drive uptake of renewable hydrogen in the heavy transport sector”.

Victoria’s Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said transport accounts for 25% of Victoria’s total carbon footprint and the green hydrogen highway would help drive down emissions.
“Australia’s busiest corridor is the perfect place to kickstart the transition to a zero-emission freight sector,” she said. “The renewable hydrogen highway will create new jobs, drive investment across the east coast and is a landmark step towards meeting Victoria’s target to halve emissions by 2030 as we work towards net-zero by 2050.”
Kean said the Hume Hydrogen Highway is the first initiative of a statewide hydrogen refuelling network.
“What we’re looking for is strong industry collaboration between refuelling station operators, fleet operators, truck manufacturers, major freight customers, and other entities which will be vital to the success of the initiative,” he said.
The Victorian, NSW and Queensland governments will collaborate on the development of the renewable hydrogen highway by 2026, focusing on the Hume Highway, the Pacific Highway and the Newell Highway.
Grant applications close 21 October 2022. The successful applicant must enter into a joint funding agreement with both governments.
Queensland is also looking to establish a hydrogen refuelling network with bp Australia recently announcing it has teamed with gas and engineering company BOC to build a green hydrogen refuelling facility at its Port of Brisbane service station in Queensland.
The refuelling facility will dispense green hydrogen produced by BOC at its nearby Bulwer Island production site. The green hydrogen will be produced by a 220 kW electrolyser powered by a 100 kW solar installation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/18/victorian-opposition-unveils-residential-solar-and-storage-strategy/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 18, 2022",Victorian Opposition unveils residential solar and storage strategy,"In a major election pitch, Opposition Leader Matthew Guy has unveiled the Coalition’s “Power to the People” policy which would make up to $4,400 available for both solar PV and battery energy storage system to be installed in at least one million Victorian homes.
Under the plan announced at the weekend, Victorian owner-occupiers could earn rebates of up to $1,400 for solar panels and $3,000 for a residential battery energy storage system.
The plan, which would come into play if the Coalition is successful at the 26 November state election, also includes a doubling of the same rebate to about $8,800 for rental properties so that landlords can install the renewable energy technologies on at least 100,000 properties.
Guy said the plan would lower bills and emissions while providing more control over the energy system.
“Our Power to the People plan is a game changer,” he said. “We are going to turbo-charge solar, we are going to turbo-charge batteries. One million Victorian households will be supported to install solar and batteries by 2035.
“We’re going to subsidise the rental market as well. The plan is to ensure Victorian householders and renters will benefit from cheaper energy bills and lower emissions.
“By backing up solar with batteries, (we) will put the power back in households’ hands and make Victoria the heart of renewable energy in Australia.”

Guy said the Power to the People plan will improve the state government’s existing $1.3 billion Solar Homes program by allowing Victorians to claim rebates for both solar PV and batteries, adding that just 33% of rooftop solar systems in the state have included a battery when installed and that these are vital to the state’s energy future.
“Currently, households are forced to choose between support for either solar panels or a battery, not both,” he said. “Our plan gives households control over their power bills and will mean a more stable, lower-emissions grid for the wider community.”
Environment Victoria chief executive officer Jono La Nauze welcomed the announcement, saying installing solar and batteries at the same time makes sense with storage critical for maintaining a reliable energy grid as the nation transitions to renewables.
“The massive boost in support for batteries is a breakthrough that will benefit not just the individual household concerned but the whole energy grid,” he said.
“As ageing coal power stations retire, they need to be replaced by a combination of both renewable generation and storage.”
The Victorian opposition is also promising to legislate an emissions reduction target of 50% by 2030 if it wins the November state election.
The state government has already committed to reduce emissions 50% by the end of the decade but has not legislated the interim target.
Guy said writing the target into law would help drive investment in renewables and provide certainty on the state’s energy future.
“Our country is clearly moving towards emissions reduction targets,” he said.
“We believe that it is time to legislate these targets so that the next phase of the discussion as a state is around implementation, so that the politics is out of this debate once and for all. Then we can move on.”
Under the coalition’s plan to reach the 2030 target, it has pledged to establish a $1 billion hydrogen strategy to support the research, development and adoption of clean hydrogen strategies, upgrade transmission infrastructure in western Victoria to unlock an estimated 1.8 GW of renewables, and set up a taskforce to “fix” the state’s energy grid.
It will also legislate a local gas supply guarantee which would ensure that residents were offered on-shore gas extracted from Victoria first.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/18/new-method-to-evaluate-performance-lcoe-of-elevated-agrivoltaics/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,BELGIUM,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 18, 2022","New method to evaluate performance, LCOE of elevated agrivoltaics","From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Electrical Energy Systems and Applications (ELECTA) division of KU Leuven in Belgium have developed a geospatial methodology to estimate the optimal ground coverage ratio (GCR) of elevated agrivoltaic systems on arable land in the European Union.
The GCR describes the ratio of the PV system area to the overall area of the array and arable land. This currently stands at around 28% of Europe, and is defined as all land in which there are temporary field crops and pastures.
The proposed method involves four different steps. First, it uses environmental, climate and agricultural parameters to segment a given area into small sections and then it defines the PV system and crop type. In the third step, it provides the dimensioning of the PV system based on the local climatic parameters and desired crop light level. Lastly, it estimates key performance indicators such as energy yield, levelised cost of energy (LCOE), and the benefits in comparison with separated production.
The scientists applied this methodology to three different crop types – shade-tolerant crops like potatoes and sugar beets and shade-intolerant crops like maize.
“The GCR significantly changes related to the chosen shade tolerance of the crop,” the scientists explained, noting that a higher shade tolerance and higher GCR results in a higher energy production rate per unit of land. “Consequently, caution should be taken in the field crop rotation system: a fixed agrivoltaic system (with fixed GCR) will need every year a crop with similar light requirements.”
The researchers said low light requirements and high PV density will result in a higher LCOE.
“Agrivoltaic installations are financially more attractive and competitive for shade-loving crops (like leafy vegetables), leading to a risk that farmers will shift their production system and less shade-intolerant crops will be cultivated,” they explained.
The scientists singled out potato cultivation, which currently covers around 1% of Europe’s available agricultural area, mostly in countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland and Romania. They said potatoes could be a potential driver for agrivoltaic growth, with the potential for around 1,290 GW of PV capacity. They said that elevated systems with larger coverage ratios may be more suitable for southern European countries, due to high solar radiation levels.
The also warned policymakers to establish guidelines on the maximum PV ground coverage ratio before implementing agrivoltaic support schemes.
“The absolute technical potential (MWp) is many times higher and mainly impacted by the existing cultivated area of a specific crop type where permanent grassland and cereals have the largest share,” they said. “Nevertheless, important challenges remain to be addressed in terms of research on crop growth (modelling) and clear policy implementation guidelines.”
The researchers described their geospatial methodology in “Geospatial assessment of elevated agrivoltaics on arable land in Europe to highlight the implications on design, land use and economic level” which was recently published in Energy Reports.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/18/india-may-miss-2030-renewables-target-by-over-104-gw/,"MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 18, 2022",India may miss 2030 renewables target by over 104 GW,"From pv magazine India
India will likely fall over 104 GW short of the 2030 renewables target under its current market scenario and growth trend. The nation will need to add over 38 GW of renewable capacity annually during the nine years from 2022 to 2030 to achieve its target, says a new report by GlobalData.
India aims to increase non-fossil power capacity to 500 GW and meet 50% of the country’s electricity needs through renewables by 2030. It also targets net-zero emissions by 2070. India mainly plans to achieve these long-term climate goals through capacity additions in solar and exploring offshore wind potential.
However, after including large hydro under the definition of renewables, the report stated that the country is likely to achieve its 2022 target but may miss out on the solar-specific target and fall short of the 2030 target.

Attaurrahman Ojindaram Saibasan, a power analyst at GlobalData, said, “India is already focusing on rooftop solar installations along with large ground-mounted solar PV projects. As part of the plan, India approved 45 solar parks with a total capacity of 37 GW under its solar park scheme in September 2021.
“India is situated in a solar belt and gets a significant amount of solar diffused horizontal irradiance and global horizontal irradiance. The top solar power-rich states are Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. Regulatory bodies in India have drafted attractive policies and schemes to boost the renewable energy sector. For instance, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) provides custom and excise duty benefits to the solar rooftop sector to propel growth.”
Additionally, a new hydropower policy for 2018-28 has been drafted for the growth of hydro projects in the country. To increase hydropower generation, the government has granted renewable energy status for large hydro.
The government has also been promoting wind power projects by providing various fiscal and promotional incentives. Some of the most important support schemes include accelerated depreciation, excise duty exemptions to manufacturers, concessional import duties on certain components of wind electricity generators, and a tax holiday on income generated from wind power projects. These are expected to encourage the private sector participation in renewable power projects.
Saibasan emphasised easing approval processes, pre-identifying land spaces for the development of renewable power, enhancing the grid to connect renewable power plants seamlessly, and investing in battery storage and micro-grids in remote areas to drive capacity additions in the future. He also recommended renewable auctions without delays, strongly enforcing the RPS mechanism, and educating the end-consumers on adopting small-scale systems such as rooftop solar PV.
