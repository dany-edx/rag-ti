Debelle, formerly FFI’s chief financial officer and now serving as a director of mining giant Fortescue’s green energy branch, said Australia is well positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for the zero-emissions fuel but needs to act fast or risk being left behind in the race to grab a share of the global green hydrogen market.
Speaking at the recent Australian Hydrogen Conference in Brisbane, Debelle said Australia’s renewable energy advantages make it an ideal location to generate green hydrogen. He also highlighted that Australia has a long history as a reliable energy exporter to nations such as Japan and South Korea but said the enormity of the IRA threatens to snap up those markets.
“I think it’s a material threat to us in terms of those export markets,” Debelle said. “There’s a real risk that with the U.S. getting their headstart on us through the Inflation Reduction Act they are going to lock up a fair chunk of the Japanese and Korean markets.”
“We have great potential here in Australia and we have great comparative advantage but … if you throw upwards of a trillion dollars at something, that tends to buy a comparative advantage.”
“I think it’s a really serious risk that by the time we get our act together, that market won’t be there for us.”
The Australian government has been overt in its ambitions to establish a green hydrogen sector with Energy Minister Chris Bowen describing it as “the heart” of the government’s vision for the country as a renewable energy superpower.
Bowen’s ideal is backed by the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water which in the latest annual State of Hydrogen report, says Australia has the foundations to become a global leader in green hydrogen.
Australia’s announced pipeline of major announced green hydrogen projects totals more than 100 projects worth an estimated $230-$300 billion of potential investment. This represents close to 40% of all global clean hydrogen project announcements.
The department does however caution that most of the announcements in this pipeline are yet to reach final investment decisions and Australia already lags other key global players in the number of large projects that have moved from planning to implementation.
Debelle said that bottleneck must be addressed quickly or Australia risks getting left further behind green hydrogen, to take full effect in the coming months.
“The Inflation Reduction Act got legislated last August, the details are going to be put in place this August,” he said. “Once that’s there, then you’re going to see projects hitting the ground in the U.S. pretty much straight away. Those projects are happening and they’re starting this year, not next year, this year.  We need to start soon.”
Debelle said the federal government’s budget announcement of a $2 billion program to scale up development is “a good start” but said it must rolled out quickly and be accompanied by a clear strategy for it to have any chance of success.
“What we’ve got to realize here is that we were starting a long way behind,” he said. “We’ve got to be careful that we don’t sort of take too long to follow through on the announcements. The sooner we can see the details of the Headstart program and move forward with them the better.”
The Hydrogen Headstart program will provide revenue support for investment in renewable hydrogen production through competitive production contracts.
The federal government said the funding would “help bridge the commercial gap for early projects” and put the country on track to develop a gigawatt of electrolyser capacity by 2030 via two to three “flagship projects”. Those supported projects are expected to become operational by 2026-27.
“We can’t match the IRA across the board but I think a more targeted response to it … is achievable particularly if we think about it as an investment in the future,” Debelle said. “It’s not just money out the door, it’s investment.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/08/japanese-gas-giant-to-lead-darwin-clean-hydrogen-study/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 8, 2023",Japanese gas giant to lead Darwin ‘clean’ hydrogen study,"Inpex and its partners, Australian oil and gas major Santos, Scotland-headquartered energy consultancy Xodus Group, and Australia’s national science agency CSIRO, has been awarded $1 million in funding for a feasibility study into the market potential of clean hydrogen produced from both renewables and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage in Darwin.
The Darwin Clean Hydrogen Hub joint study will look at opportunities to supply hydrogen solutions to domestic and international customers.
Over 18 months, the joint study will examine market demand for hydrogen and its derivatives including methanol and ammonia, renewable energy sites and infrastructure needed to produce and deliver hydrogen, and domestic and international hydrogen supply chains.
Japan’s Inpex, which operates the Ichthys LNG plant near Middle Arm Point, said the study will also explore the demand for hydrogen production from natural gas and carbon capture and storage capacity requirements.
Inpex Australia President Director Tetsu Murayama said the study has the potential to inform investment decisions with the company planning to commercialise three or more hydrogen projects globally by about 2030 with the aim of producing 100,000 tonnes or more of hydrogen/ammonia per year.
“This Inpex-led study has the potential to support Darwin’s cleaner energy future by identifying new market opportunities in hydrogen,” Murayama said. “(It) has the potential to inform future investment decisions contributing to northern Australia’s hydrogen value chain development.”
The announcement of Inpex’s involvement in the joint study comes just days after the Japanese government adopted a revision to the country’s plans to use more hydrogen in its shift towards a low carbon economy.
Under the revised Basic Hydrogen Strategy, Japan plans to increase the annual supply of hydrogen to 12 million tons by 2040, six times the current level. Japan also plans to generate $160 billion (15 trillion yen) in public- and private-sector investment to build up hydrogen-related supply chains over the next 15 years.
“Hydrogen is an industrial sector that can make a triple achievement of decarbonisation, stable energy supply and economic growth in one shot,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. “We will promote (hydrogen) on a large scale, both demand and supply.”
Northern Territory Deputy Chief Minister Nicole Manison said the creation of a hydrogen industry in Darwin will not only provide cleaner energy to the region but will also generate jobs.
“This study is an investment in our future technology, which will enable more development in the energy industry, resulting in more jobs and better outcomes for Territorians,” she said. “Not only will Darwin become a significant hydrogen hub for the nation, this will also strengthen the relationship between the Territory and our trade partners.”
The joint study is intended to complement the NT government’s work being conducted with the CSIRO, Inpex, Santos, Xodus, Woodside Energy and Eni to establish a carbon capture and storage common-user hub at Middle Arm.
The funding for the Darwin Clean Hydrogen Hub joint study was supplied under the Australian government’s Regional Hydrogen Hubs: Development and Design Grants program.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/08/novonix-does-45-million-deal-with-lg-energy-solution/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,EV,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH KOREA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 8, 2023",Novonix does $45 million deal with LG Energy Solution,"Novonix announced it has signed an agreement with LG Energy Solution (LGES) for the joint research and development of artificial graphite material. In a separate investment agreement, LGES will buy USD 30 million worth of unsecured convertible notes to be issued by Novonix, which will allow the battery maker to own shares in the Australian company.
Novonix, which has an artificial graphite production plant in Tennessee in the United States, making it eligible for U.S. government incentives via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidy program, said the LGES financing will allow for continued development of battery anode materials, operational needs, and general corporate purposes.
The joint development project aims to develop active battery anode material that meets LGES’s product specifications and reduces its reliance upon Chinese suppliers. Upon successful development of the product, Novonix and LGES will enter into a separate purchase agreement with the South Korean battery manufacturer to purchase up to 50,000 tons of artificial graphite anode material over a 10-year period from the start of mass production.
Novonix Chief Executive Officer Chris Burns said the company was excited to formalise its work with LGES and establish the path to become a supplier for its artificial graphite anode material in the U.S.
“This agreement demonstrates our leading position to establish a supply chain for high-performance artificial graphite for the battery industry in North America,” he said.
Burns said the material will be developed at Novonix’s current Tennessee facilities with mass production expected to commence in 2026.
The company is targeting an initial 30,000 tons per annum (tpa) of production capacity of active anode material at its Tennessee facility but that is expected to ramp up with Novonix having previously outlined plans to increase capacity to 150,000 tpa by 2030.
Novonix also has plans to establish a second manufacturing facility having last year received a USD 150 million grant for the U.S. Department of Energy to support the construction of a second 30,000 tpa production plant.
“While the LG agreement has proposed 50,000 tonnes over a 10-year period, LG’s requirements are significantly more than that for their facilities here in North America,” Burns told Finance News Network. “So, there’s upside in our ability to potentially scale more volume for LG, but also focus on completing the work around other tier ones and bring more allocation and supply contract allocation into these facilities that we’re looking to build.”
LGES is among the world’s largest battery manufacturers and has two standalone and five joint venture plants currently operating or being constructed in the U.S.
The company said the partnership with Novonix will allow it to expand its local supply chain for battery components and maximise the benefits from the U.S. IRA that provides subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) made with components sourced from the region.
“Our partnership with Novonix once again demonstrates LG Energy Solution’s determination to establish a solid battery supply chain in the U.S., complementing our local manufacturing network to meet our customer’s needs for lRA-compliant batteries,” LGES senior vice president of procurement centre Dongsoo Kim said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/08/cambodia-to-scrap-rooftop-pv-capacity-charge-introduce-new-tariffs/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,CAMBODIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 8, 2023","Cambodia to scrap rooftop PV capacity charge, introduce new tariffs","From pv magazine Global
Rooftop PV installations are heavily penalised in Cambodia, with solar arrays capped at 50% of the contracted load and charged a monthly capacity fee. At the end of April, the nation’s Ministry of Mines and Energy published a document, “Principles for permitting the use of rooftop solar power in Cambodia” that outlines new principles to streamline the permitting process of rooftop PV. It proposes the replacement of actual capacity charges with new tariffs and quotas for installations.
The changes are a response to the garment industry’s wish to install more rooftop solar to “reduce the carbon footprint of goods and products,” as required by international buyers, according to the document. The brief repeatedly emphasises the government’s belief that utility-scale solar is the best way to reduce electricity prices for all consumers and minimise grid instability issues. It thus introduces a “compensation tariff of variable energy from rooftop solar” under the principle of “fairness in electricity price among all parties.”
The new tariff is calculated according to a formula with three parts. The first is the price of exporting electricity from the national grid, payable to the electricity distributor. The second is the price equivalent to grid losses, payable to the state-owned utility Electricite du Cambodge (EDC). The third is a tariff based on the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for each installation.
Asked whether the new tariff is a positive development for solar in Cambodia, Natharoun Ngo Son, country director at Energy Lab, gave pv magazine an ambivalent answer.
“Yes and no. Yes, it is better, because with the capacity charges, first there is a 50% cap, and then the capacity charge applies whether you use your system or not,” said Ngo Son. “Now, the tariff is paid on a usage base, which is better. Moreover, before injecting excess electricity into the grid wasn’t allowed and now it is.”
However, PV system owners injecting power into the grid would do it for free, as net metering and net billing are not allowed in Cambodia. Ngo Son argued that grid constraints, among other issues, mean it is unlikely that public utilities will implement such regulatory accelerators soon.
Ngo Son expressed concerns about the other side of the new tariff, stating that “no, it is not necessarily better. The big question we all have is: We have a formula, but what does it mean? What is the real cost the private sector will end up paying? No business today understands what the new regulations mean in terms of cents per kWh and therefore in terms of payback period. Some solar PV actors noted that it has slowed down their current operations and created uncertainty.”
Although the policy document was signed and published on April 25, 2023, its official status is currently unclear, as it has not been published on the Ministry of Mines and Energy website. Ngo Son said it is expected to be published in the coming weeks after an official consultation with the private sector takes place probably next week. He noted that an implementation schedule has not been made public yet.
The document also introduced quotas for rooftop PV installations, allocated on a first-come-first-served basis per province, provincial capitals, and zones. However, it does not specify how many quotas there are, how these are defined, or what the status of existing PV systems is within the quota scheme.
“Upon receiving a permit from Electricity Authority Cambodia, the Applicant shall commence [installing] the rooftop solar power within three months from the date of notification,” the document reads.
Despite leaving many questions unanswered, Ngo Son sees the new policy as a positive development for solar in Cambodia. This April, the Cambodian government approved five renewable energy projects totalling 520 MW. Of these, four are PV projects, comprising a 150 MW project in Pursat province, an 80 MW project in Prey Veng province, a 60 MW project in Kampong Chhnang province, and a 60 MW project in Svay Rieng province.
Cambodia published its “Power Development Plan 2022-2024” (PDP) in December 2022, setting a solar additions target of 3,155 MW by 2040. According to the latest statistics of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Southeast Asian country had 456 MW of installed solar capacity at the end of 2022.
