https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/14/state-government-gives-2-3-billion-transmission-link-tick-of-approval/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 14, 2022",State government gives $2.3 billion transmission link tick of approval,"Project EnergyConnect, which is expected to unlock more than $20 billion in new renewable projects in South Australia (SA) and New South Wales (NSW), is a step closer to fruition with construction set to begin early this year after the South Australian component of the project was granted environmental approval by the state government.
A joint venture between SA’s high-voltage transmission network owner ElectraNet and NSW network operator Transgrid, the SA component of the high-voltage electricity interconnector between the two states secured the environmental tick of approval late last month, three years after the assessment process began.
ElectraNet chief executive Steve Masters said the SA Government decision was a major milestone, with only Federal Government approval of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) required to complete the assessment process.
Masters said if the Federal Government ticks off on the project, construction could commence early this year with commissioning of the new line expected to be underway in 2023.
“We started the assessment process in 2018, undertaking extensive consultation with the many stakeholders interested in our project and (this) marks another important milestone for the project,” he said.
“Through the EIS process, detailed environmental, cultural, social and engineering studies were undertaken to select a proposed route, collect baseline data and understand stakeholder perspectives.
“Our final, approved route takes into account environmentally sensitive areas and we’ve engaged with all affected communities to minimise project impacts.”

The 900-kilometre high-voltage transmission interconnector will stretch from Robertstown, in SA’s mid-north, to Wagga Wagga, in NSW, via Buronga with an additional line between Buronga and Red Cliffs, in Victoria.
It has been forecast the 330 kV interconnector, which has been identified as a priority project in both AEMO’s Integrated System Plan and the NSW Government’s Transmission Infrastructure Strategy, will enhance power system security and unlock up to 30 new wind and solar projects totalling nearly 5.3 GW.
ElectraNet confirmed in June that it had reached a final investment decision to go ahead with the SA section of the interconnector from Robertstown to the NSW border, at an estimated cost of $457 million.
Transgrid secured government approval for the first stage of the much longer section of the 900km connector on the NSW side in September. Transgrid’s share of the deal is costed at $1.8 billion.
Transgrid has said the project will be the “critical missing link in the National Electricity Market (NEM), connecting more renewable generation and reinforcing connectivity between the state grids of NSW, SA and Victoria.”
The approval of the EIS for the SA component of the electricity interconnector comes after ElectraNet awarded the transmission and substation contracts for its part of the project.
Downer Utilities Australia secured the transmission lines contract with works to include approximately 200km of 330 kV new transmission line between the SA and NSW border and the new Bundey Substation near Robertstown, and approximately 10 km of new transmission line between the Robertstown and Bundey substations.
Substation works, including the construction of the new Bundey facility and augmentation works at the existing Robertstown and Tungkillo substations, have been awarded to Consolidated Power Projects Australia, specialists in high-voltage infrastructure.
“Both contractors have already been engaging extensively with the market and this will continue over the coming months,” Masters said.
With the contractors now appointed, ElectraNet has also set up a page for sub-contractors to register their interest through the Industry Capability Network with the information to be shared with the project’s successful contractors.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/14/five-things-every-solar-expert-should-know-about-ev-charging/,"EV,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 14, 2022",Five things every solar expert should know about EV charging,"With residential solar photovoltaic (PV) outpacing commercial and industrial capacity for the first time globally, electric vehicle (EV) sales setting a new monthly record of more than 721,000 and countries like Norway announcing that more than 65% of its citizens now drive electric, it’s clear that the world is electrifying at an unprecedented pace. The sustainability industry is moving beyond innovators to early adopters, this transition presents an amazing opportunity for industry collaboration – to build complete and connected systems focused on improving the lives of the world’s inhabitants. 
After spending more than a decade in Australia’s solar industry, and now recently joining Tritium, a global developer and manufacturer of direct current (DC) fast charging technology for EVs, I’ve gained a unique perspective on both the solar and EV charging industries. While PV and EV charging are both revolutionary technologies that are typically grid connected, based on power conversions between DC and alternating current (AC), and power batteries, it’s the differences between the two technologies I’ve found most interesting. 
Tritium
Here are the five things I didn’t know about EV charging before I joined Tritium.
Solar inverters are typically transformerless and complete a single power conversion from DC to grid AC. By comparison, Tritium’s DC fast chargers perform three power conversions:
Undertaking three power conversion stages produces heat, so the cooling system of the DC fast charger becomes very important. Tritium has approached this problem by using liquid cooling systems in the company’s IP65 rated charging stations.
EVs today commonly support both AC and DC charging. The AC support allows customers to charge at home using relatively cheap, but slow, AC charging units. That’s because with AC charging the power conversion steps mentioned above must be built into the vehicle, which means that every EV is obliged to allocate space, weight and cost to an onboard charger. Vehicle manufacturers understandably look to keep the space, weight and cost of the onboard charger as low as possible and this has resulted in the supported AC charging rates being relatively slow – usually just 7kW to 11kW.
By comparison, DC fast chargers directly supply the variable DC voltage and current required by the EVs battery while charging. And it’s not just the three power conversion stages that DC fast chargers are taking responsibility for, it’s also the heat rejection from the multiple power conversions. This allows the charging rates to be significantly higher than AC units. For example, Tritium’s range spans from 50kW to 350kW.
It’s a testament to the comprehensive nature of international standards that DC fast chargers can enable any EV owner to safely use and manipulate a charging cable that could be carrying voltages up to 920V or current up to 500A. In fact, most EV charging cables that are rated at 400A or higher utilise liquid cooling directly inside the cable to keep the cable manageable and not prohibitively heavy. Tritium uses this approach to delivery continuous 500A output on the company’s 350kW rated chargers.
When it comes managing a solar power system, it’s largely set and forget. Of course it’s recommended to check the system on a regular basis, but we all know that most solar customers only think about their system when the power bill turns up. By comparison, DC fast chargers are often installed in public locations and need to manage payments. And when you start dealing with money, set and forget may not cut it!
EV chargers are at their best when actively managed by a Charge Point Operator (CPO), a company that runs a charging network for public use. CPOs usually manage their network remotely through backend management software, which dispatches commands to the charger via an industry standard called Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP). This standard allows the CPO to authenticate customers, start and stop charging sessions, apply active load management profiles and track simple parameters like power, voltage and current. 
The key system management and charging cable communication standards already support advanced technologies like ISO 15118 Plug and Charge, where the vehicle authenticates directly with the DC fast charger without any further interaction from the driver, which is a great solution for fleets and ride share services. These standards are currently being reviewed and extended further to support future technologies like vehicle-to-grid and other grid support services.
Related to the need for active management via OCPP is the possibility that DC fast chargers may be installed in an unattended location. In fact, this is the great benefit of powering vehicles with electricity – we already have a grid that extends far and wide, so DC fast chargers can be installed just about anywhere with three phase power, and even in some locations that don’t. This is distinctly different to petrol stations, which nearly always have dedicated locations and staff available to assist with the equipment or payment, if required. Tritium chargers can be optioned with an integrated credit card reader to allow for ad-hoc payment without needing to be signed up to a membership program.
DC fast charging systems so far have been relatively insular – once installed they perform their function without consideration of external factors beyond OCPP commands and payments. Moving forward, I expect to see fast charging to be increasingly integrated with onsite solar and energy storage systems, onsite energy management and demand response systems, and scheduling systems for fleet applications. 
Onsite energy storage is of particular interest as many suitable DC fast charging sites have grid constraints that restrict the size or number of charging stations that can be installed without grid augmentation. Another less capital-intensive approach is to “over-subscribe” the onsite rectification to effectively deliver a higher number of kW of DC power delivery than offered by the rectification. Tritium’s recently launched PKM150 system is the first in the market to implement this strategy.

ASX-listed Decmil said in a statement that regulatory testing of the Sunraysia project has been successfully completed, and it is progressing well with the performance testing required to obtain substantial completion.
As a result, the Sunraysia Solar Farm has been approved for “unconstrained operations”, with a number of minor conditions to be addressed within the first three months of operation.
Decmil said the formal process for obtaining substantial completion under the contract has also commenced and is expected to be achieved on or before 31 January 2022.
“This will then enable conclusion of the EPC contract and a transition into the operation and maintenance contract,” the company said.
“The achievement of this milestone means the technical obligations of regulatory compliance of Sunraysia Solar Farm have been demonstrated and achieved.”
Majority owned by UK-headquartered infrastructure investor John Laing (90.1%), with Australia-based renewables developer Maoneng holding the rest, Sunraysia has been dogged by delays since it was first announced in 2017.

Construction of the solar farm near Balranald in the state’s south-west began in early 2019 and it was expected Sunraysia would begin production later that year but it has been repeatedly delayed by technical and transmission issues.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) finally approved the solar plant’s registration in November 2020 but the delays in the formal commissioning of the project continued. Those delays have sparked a court dispute between Sunraysia and Decmil centred around the contracted date for substantial completion.
The Sunraysia Solar Farm comprises more than 750,000 solar modules spread over an 800-hectare site. The facility is expected to generate approximately 529 GWh of energy per year when commissioned, which is the equivalent to powering up to 50,000 households.
The solar plant is supported by power purchase agreements (PPA) with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and AGL Energy, both of which cover a 15-year term.

The three-year trial project, which is supported by Japan’s ministry of the environment, will assess the potential of green hydrogen for power generation and to fuel marine vessels to reduce the archipelago’s reliance on carbon-intensive diesel.
Palau comprises more than 200 islands in the western Pacific Ocean and the residents depend heavily on diesel for power generation and transport fuels, but the nation aims to shift 45% of its electricity generation to renewables by 2025.
At present, more than 1,000 gasoline-fuelled small vessels are used for tourism, fishing and other daily activities and the project will explore the potential of converting those craft to hydrogen-fuelled vessels.
Sojitz said demonstrations with hydrogen-fuelled vessels will first be conducted off the Queensland coast.
Sojitz said in a statement CS Energy will generate and supply the renewable hydrogen, while Nippon Engineering Consultants will study the feasibility of supplying green hydrogen from Australia for use by other Pacific Island countries.
It will also investigate hydrogen applications and forecast hydrogen demand based on the needs of Palau and those other Pacific Island countries and will look to identify the optimal maritime route and best options for transporting hydrogen.

Sojitz said at the conclusion of the project, it and its partners will “seek to achieve early commercialisation of an economically efficient hydrogen supply chain that will extend to include neighbouring Pacific Island countries”.
CS Energy said while the project will initially target Palau and other Pacific Island nations, it could also deliver benefits for island communities closer to home.
“We are delighted to welcome Sojitz Corporation as the first offtaker for our Kogan Renewable Hydrogen Project,” the company said.
“We are excited to collaborate with Sojitz as they seek to find creative solutions to the energy challenges faced by our Pacific near neighbours and which have potential for application to island communities in Queensland.”
CS Energy’s Kogan Hydrogen Demonstration Plant, given the go ahead after a successful feasibility study with Japanese industrial giant IHI Corporation Japan, will be capable of producing an estimated 50,000 kilograms of solar-powered green hydrogen each year.
CS Energy chief executive Andrew Bills said the facility will focus on the hydrogen electrolyser being powered exclusively by behind-the-meter solar energy, making it one of the few truly ‘green hydrogen’ projects in Australia.
To be built beside the existing coal-fired Kogan Creek Power Station, the facility will include a 600-700 kW hydrogen electrolyser, a 2 MW solar farm, a 2 MW/4 MWh battery energy storage system and a hydrogen fuel cell of up to 50 kW.
Construction on the facility is expected to commence this year with commissioning scheduled in early 2023. The export of green hydrogen to Palau is expected to begin in the same year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/14/worlds-largest-coal-port-flicks-switch-to-100-renewable-energy/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 14, 2022",World’s largest coal port flicks switch to 100% renewable energy,"In a town famous for coal, the Port of Newcastle has positioned itself as a leader in the transition to renewable energy, announcing its operations are now powered entirely by green energy.
The Port of Newcastle has signed a deal with Iberdrola for a retail power purchase agreement (PPA) that provides the port with large scale generation certificates (LGCs) linked to the 113 MW Bodangora wind farm near Dubbo in regional New South Wales (NSW).
Port of Newcastle chief executive Craig Carmody said the move is part of a plan to decarbonise the business by 2040 and delivers upon sustainability commitments set in 2020.
“In achieving 100% renewable energy at Port of Newcastle we are showing tangible evidence of just how committed we are to driving sustainability in every aspect of our business,” he said.
“Port of Newcastle’s 100% renewable power deal directly supports the development of renewable infrastructure and will deliver significant environmental improvements at the port.”
The largest port on Australia’s east coast with approximately 4,400 ship movements annually, the Port of Newcastle is rated the largest coal port in the world, exporting an average of 165 megatonne of coal a year.
Carmody said by switching to being powered by 100% renewables, the port has reduced carbon emissions by almost 5,000 cubic tonnes, equivalent to taking 1,000 cars off the road or planting 80,000 trees each year.
The renewables achievement comes after the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced a $3 million feasibility study would be conducted into the development of a 40 MW green hydrogen hub at the Port of Newcastle
The study, partially funded through $1.5 million from ARENA and to be led by the Port of Newcastle and Macquarie’s Green Investment Group, will determine if the project is deemed to have sufficient potential.

The study will also investigate the potential to scale up green hydrogen production for export, leveraging the port’s existing domestic and international supply chain links. While stage one of the project is underpinned by a 40 MW electrolyser, the study will also consider the future staged scale up of an electrolyser to around 1 GW with the ability to produce up to 150,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year for domestic and export use.
“Port of Newcastle is working to realise projects now that will drive the diversification of our business and the Hunter Region over the next 10, 20, 50 years and beyond,” Carmody said.
“We are committed to continuous improvement in line with our Environment Social and Governance (ESG) Strategy and carbon emission reduction targets and look forward to what we can achieve in 2022.”
Iberdrola’s renewable power deal with the Port of Newcastle is the second PPA it has secured for the Bodangora Wind Farm. The company said a PPA for electricity and LGCs for 60% of the facility’s electricity generation is already in place with Energy Australia until 31 December 2030.
The transaction affirms Iberdrola’s position as a major player in Australia’s renewable energy market. With more than 800 MW operating capacity, 453 MW under construction and a development pipeline of over 1 GW, much of its focus has been on wind energy, with seven operational wind farms totalling over 670 MW, but Iberdrola, which acquired Infigen Energy in 2020, has in recent times turned its attention toward solar and energy storage.
In September it purchased the 190 MW Avonlie Solar Farm project near Narrandera, in southern NSW, and is developing the 320 MW Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park (PAREP) in South Australia. The $500 million project will combine 210 MW of wind with 107 MW of solar to generate an estimated 900 GWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power about 180,000 Australian households each year.
Iberdrola also operates the 25 MW / 52 MWh Lake Bonney battery energy storage system in SA and has entered into a user agreement with transmission network operator TransGrid in relation to the 50 MW/75 MWh Wallgrove Grid Battery in NSW.
