The Queensland government last year announced its Energy and Jobs Plan which includes renewable energy targets of 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035. The coordinated development of clean energy infrastructure in zones is seen as critical for the delivery of the large-scale wind, solar, pumped hydro and green hydrogen projects required to meet those clean energy targets.
“By coordinating the connection of new wind and solar, REZs can leverage economies of scale to efficiently connect more affordable renewable energy into our grid,” the state said. “This will help deliver the right mix of energy technologies, in the right locations at the right time.”
The 12 proposed renewable energy zones – a major increase on the initial three REZs announced by the state government in 2020 – are split into three regions with five in southern Queensland, four in central Queensland and three in the state’s north.

Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said concentrating the renewable energy rollout to 12 areas would help secure community and industry support for “the biggest economic transition project that Queensland has ever embarked upon.”
“It’s big in concept and shows how to deliver big when it comes to building a new energy infrastructure for the whole state and is also a signal to industry and private investors that we’re serious about renewable energy and partnerships with communities and project developers,” he said.

The indicative locations of the potential REZs, identified in consultation with state-owned network company Powerlink, have been selected based on network capacity, project pipeline and land use analysis.
The Queensland government said the preliminary locations “represent the REZ connection to the shared network, and as each specific REZ is declared for consultation and development, the locations will be further defined and shaped.”

The state said at least $6 million has been immediately allocated to undertake a strategic assessment of the three regions with the information to inform planning for individual REZ declarations.
De Brenni said new legislation would be introduced to establish the framework for declaring and developing the targeted REZs.
The draft 2023 Queensland Renewable Energy Zone Roadmap closes for public consultation on 22 September 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/11/aldi-to-install-34-mw-of-rooftop-solar-across-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 11, 2023",Aldi to install 34 MW of rooftop solar across Australia,"Aldi is officially Australia’s first grocery retailer to have its operations powered by renewable energy alone with its 100% renewable electricity commitment independently verified by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) in its latest Corporate Emissions Reduction Transparency (CERT) report.
The CERT 2023 report, the second to be published by the regulator, shows the progress toward net zero emissions, 100% renewable electricity use and other climate-related commitments of 25 Australian companies that volunteered to participate.
The report provides verification that Aldi has achieved its target to transition its Australian operations to 100% renewable electricity, making it the first Australian supermarket to have all its offices, stores and warehouses powered by renewable energy alone.
Aldi Australia Sustainability Director Daniel Baker said the report validates the retailer’s commitment to use renewable energy across its operations as part of its broader sustainability targets.
“Sustainability is placed firmly at the core of Aldi’s values and operations,” he said. “We are proud the report has recognised these efforts as Aldi continues to lead the way as one of only a handful of companies featured in the report to have fully transitioned its operations to 100% renewable electricity sources.”
At the centre of Aldi’s shift to 100% renewable electricity are the power purchase agreements it holds with three Australian wind farms, the acquisition and voluntary surrender of market renewable energy certificates, and on-site solar generation.
The release of the report coincides with Aldi revealing it plans to expand its solar panel network, deploying another 34 MWp of PV across 25 freestanding stores throughout Australia before the end of 2024.
The installation will add to the more than 105,000 solar panels already fitted across 270 Aldi stores and six of the company’s distribution centres in Australia. In 2022, its solar panels generated more than 40,813 MWh of renewable electricity.
Baker said the company’s commitment to renewable electricity, and the continuing rollout of rooftop solar, not only supports its sustainability targets but also “makes great business sense.”
“Not only are we reducing our impact on the planet, we’re also bringing down our operational costs,” he said.
While Aldi has already achieved its 100% renewables goal, the CER report shows that supermarket rivals Woolworths and Coles, which have both pledged to be fully powered by renewables by 2025, are making steady progress towards achieving their goals.
The report reveals that renewables currently provide just 16.6% of Woolworths’ total electricity usage while Coles is marginally better at 19.6%.
The supermarket giants were among 25 large companies from the energy, manufacturing, mining, retail, financial, transport, construction and research sectors that participated in the CERT 2023 report. Together, the companies represent 21% of the scope 1 emissions reported to the CER in 2021-22.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/11/rooftop-solar-underpins-free-electricity-offer-in-wa/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 11, 2023",Rooftop solar underpins free electricity offer in WA,"Excess energy from Western Australia’s booming rooftop solar sector will be used to help households struggling with cost-of-living increases with the state government unveiling a new Community Energy program that will provide free electricity to Synergy customers during off-peak times.
The Western Australian (WA) government said the new scheme announced on Monday will provide free electricity between 9am and 3pm to Synergy customers who are experiencing ongoing financial hardship and are being case managed by the state-owned utility.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the Community Energy program will provide eligible households with 10 units of free electricity – which is about 75% of an average household’s daily usage – in the off-peak periods.
Johnston said the electricity will come from excess power generated by rooftop solar systems connected to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), the state’s main grid.
More than 400,000 WA homes and businesses, about 36% of customers, now have PV systems connected to the SWIS and collectively rooftop solar is the largest generator in the state.
Johnston said the new scheme would help address the new generation dynamic and stabilise the grid by incentivising customers to shift their electricity consumption away from evening peak demand periods to the middle of the day when solar generation is high and household usage is traditionally low.
“The Community Energy product, introduced by Synergy, offers 10 units of electricity at no cost during the day to those on the case management program,” he said. “This will bring the cost of electricity down for those experiencing financial hardship while also making use of the energy being generated by solar panels during the day.”
Johnston said the new program also provides households doing it tough with an alternative to installing solar panels, giving more Western Australians access to the benefits of cheaper electricity during the day.
To be eligible for the program, financial hardship customers must have an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) meter and not have solar panels installed on their property. It is estimated about 9,100 Synergy customers are currently eligible.
The state government has forecast the scheme will save participants between $200 to $500 on their electricity bills a year.
It comes as the WA government released the first of two instalments of a promised electricity credit, with a minimum of $400 to be provided to every household across the state. It is being delivered in two lots of at least $200 with the second credit to be supplied in the November to December billing period.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/11/study-shows-potential-for-floating-solar-in-southeast-asia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE PV,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 11, 2023",Study shows potential for floating solar in Southeast Asia,"Floating photovoltaics (FPV) is a form of renewable energy being evaluated worldwide as a potential solution to the land-use issue in electricity generation. For countries limited in land availability, like many island nations in Southeast Asia, FPV may represent a path forward to an emissions-free economy. 
The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) partnered with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission for Asia to evaluate the technical potential for FPV for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has set a target of 35% renewable energy installed capacity by 2025. 
The NREL report estimated technical potential for 10 ASEAN countries and is coupled with a data set available through a solar data explorer tool. 
“FPV arrays are situated on water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs, or water treatment ponds, where they can be installed alone or in combination with hydropower dams,” NREL said.  
The agency said FPV is particularly attractive in locations where hydropower infrastructure is planned or already in place and increased frequency or severity of drought may raise pose reliability concerns for hydropower production. Southeast Asia is particularly exposed to this hydropower underproduction risk as it has a strong network of established facilities.
“Additionally, much of the region is covered by rainforest ecosystems,” said Evan Rosenlieb, a geospatial data scientist at NREL. “Siting PV on water can be a way to increase renewable energy generation without deforestation.”

Southeast Asia is also a hotbed for the growing practice of aquaculture, or raising fish, crustaceans, and aquatic plants in a controlled water body. These sites are targeted as another potential match for floating PV. 
“This emerging combination of aquaculture and photovoltaics, commonly referred to as AquaPV, can allow countries to co-locate energy and food production on existing natural or artificially created water bodies while minimizing the overall environmental impact of both sectors,” said Prateek Joshi, NREL energy engineer.
Joshi and the NREL team said aquaculture and solar may help boost food security in the region, offering dedicated, resilient energy production to critical food sources.
The data accompanying the report are publicly available as a resource for developers interested in learning more about the technical and economic potential of FPV in the region.
“This data will lead to more discussions and can inform decisions on the potential role of FPV in the region. It wouldn’t have been possible without all the existing work of previous FPV studies and previous RE Data Explorer tool development,” Sika Gadzanku, the NREL energy technology and policy researcher.
