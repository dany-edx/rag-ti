AGL, which operates the coal-fired Liddell and Bayswater power stations in New South Wales’ Upper Hunter Valley and the Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, has again ranked as Australia’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, reporting emissions of 42.2 million tonnes in the 2019-20 financial year.
Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior coal campaigner Glenn Walker said the figures were not only a blight on AGL, which has publicly stated it is aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but the industry as a whole.
“Australians are on the frontline of the climate crisis which is primarily driven by the mining and burning of coal, and now AGL has emerged as the biggest climate polluter in the country,” he said.
“Australians who get their energy from AGL have done so in good faith, trusting that AGL is living up to the marketing reputation it has created, but this data reveals that behind the sleek, modern veneer AGL is still using dirty and dated methods to provide Australians with electricity.”

The NGER data reveals AGL, which earlier this month revealed a stunning $2.69 billion write-down to its asset value, is responsible for 24.6% of electricity sector emissions and 8% of Australia’s total emissions and its total emissions is more than double the next highest emitter.
EnergyAustralia, which owns the Yallourn power station in Victoria and the Mt Piper power station in NSW, is second on the list of Australia’s 10 largest emitters with 17.9 million tonnes of carbon emissions in the past year.
Stanwell Corporation, which operates the Stanwell and Tarong North power stations in Queensland was ranked third with 17.1 million tonnes while Origin Energy, which operates the Eraring power station in NSW, the nation’s largest coal-fired power station, was fourth with 16.0 million tonnes.
While the electricity generation sector remained the largest emitting industry in Australia, accounting for 47.9% of all emissions reported, 2019–20 was the second consecutive year that emissions from the sector were less than 50% of the 327 million tonnes of scope 1 emissions reported.
The CER said emissions in the electricity generation sector have decreased over the past four years. There were notable reductions of 4.8 million tonnes (2.9%) of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018–19 and 7.5 million tonnes (4.6%) of CO2-e in 2019–20 on the previous reporting year. The CER said this reduction is largely due to the increased penetration of renewable energy, including solar, and the decreased use of black coal.
The total reported scope 1 emissions declined by 3% or 10.1 million tonnes in 2019-2020, a decline largely attributed to decreases in emissions from electricity generation and oil and gas production but Walker said AGL still had a long way to go to achieve its Climate Statement.
Data provided by AGL confirms that 85% of energy generated by the gentailer comes from its three large coal-burning power stations. Liddell is set to close fully by 2023, but Bayswater is not set to close until 2035 and Loy Yang A is set to close by 2048.
“Two out of three of AGL’s coal-burning power stations are set to close well beyond what scientists are calling for in order to prevent further catastrophic climate change,” Walker said.
“In order to protect Australians from the worsening impacts of climate change, all of AGL’s coal-burning power stations need to close by 2030 at the latest and be replaced by clean and safe renewable energy.”
In a statement provided to pv magazine, AGL acknowledged the report and said it “understands its responsibility as Australia’s largest energy generator and retailer to drive the transition to a cleaner energy future, while maintaining reliable and affordable energy for our customers”.
“Last year, we released our Climate Statement comprising five key commitments and our target of net zero emissions by 2050. Our statement provides an important framework that will guide our future actions and growth, recognising that customer demand, community expectations and technological advancements are the core drivers of Australia’s energy transition,” the company wrote.
“AGL’s coal fired-power stations play an important role in an orderly and responsible transition to a cleaner energy future.
“AGL has published dates for the closure of our coal-fired power stations. We remain committed to these and the transition plans while progressing investments for projects that transition our portfolio.”
Mining was the second largest emitting sector with 29.4% of all emissions while manufacturing produced 15.0% of all emissions for 2019-2020.
Emissions from the agricultural, forestry, private vehicle transport and residential sectors are not collected under the NGER scheme and were not included in the data.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/25/renewable-energy-tidal-wave-tipped-to-wipe-out-coal-fired-power-stations/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Renewable energy ‘tidal wave’ tipped to wipe out coal-fired power stations,"An analysis of Australia’s energy market has found the rapid influx of renewables means several of the nation’s 16 coal-fired power stations could be financially unviable by 2025 and at least one may be forced to close several years earlier than planned.
The joint report by United States-based think tank the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and advisory firm Green Energy Markets has highlighted the mounting pressure on coal-fired power stations as a flood of renewable energy hits the grid.
Tracking the announcements of proposed wind and solar projects in Australia, authors Tristan Edis and Johanna Bowyer found previous estimates of future power supply from renewables in the NEM to be understated.
The report forecasts an additional 28 GW or 70,000 GWh (annualised) of renewables is expected to be installed in the NEM in the seven-year period from 2018.
According to the report by 2025 the installed renewables capacity will be 8 GW of utility scale solar, 12 GW of wind and 22 GW of rooftop solar. Renewables are forecast to provide 40-50% of NEM 2025 demand.
“The market is facing a tidal wave of new supply, much greater than anything government authorities or market analysts forecast or even contemplated just two years ago,” Edis said.
“The supply added from 2018 to 2025 equates to over a third of the entire demand in the NEM, and more than eight times the annual generation of the Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW.”
Edis, Green Energy Markets’ analysis and advisory director said the additional renewable energy generation coming online from 2018 to 2025 will be enough to supply 99.9% of the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) expected demand growth and 98% of the gap expected to be left following the planned retirement of AGL’s Liddell coal-fired power station in 2023.
Even after filling the demand growth and Liddell gap the report forecasts there will be surplus renewable generation of approximately 57,000 GWh. As a result, coal and gas generators will be displaced in the wholesale market, due to the merit order effect.
Bowyer said this extra supply will lead to a collapse in output from many of the existing fossil fuel generators.
“They will be displaced because wind and solar have no fuel cost and typically bid into the market with prices close to zero,” she said.
“We predict that gas power station output will fall by 78% and coal output by 28% by 2025 compared to 2018 levels.
“The extra competition from wind and solar plants will also have a deflationary impact on wholesale electricity prices, as more expensive gas and coal generators will be needed far less.
“While prices will be more volatile, on average they are likely to return back to the kinds of levels that prevailed in 2015. This is because the extra supply from renewables is several times greater than that lost from the closure of Hazelwood, Northern and Liddell Power Stations.”
The combination of renewable supply displacing output from coal and gas plants, as well as reducing prices, is expected to lead to a huge reduction in revenue for these generators.

Even with the Liddell power station closing in 2023, the analysis shows individual coal plants are likely to experience wholesale spot market revenue reductions of 44% – 67% between 2018 to 2025. This will drive EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) reductions for individual coal plants of up to 119% meaning they will lose money.
“Three to five of the remaining 15 coal power stations in the NEM will be under financial stress by 2025 according to our analysis,” Bowyer said.
“In addition to Liddell’s 2023 closure, at least one coal power station exit is likely to occur far sooner than authorities are planning for.”
The report listed the Eraring, Vales Point and Mt Piper coal-fired power stations in New South Wales and Yallourn in Victoria as most vulnerable.
The report comes less than one week after Origin Energy CEO Frank Calabria revealed the Earing power station, the country’s largest coal-fired power plant, was already struggling due to low wholesale prices.
“I would go as far to say that wholesale prices are unsustainable, there will be a supply response — it’s just whether it’s planned or unplanned. And that’s really where the market is at today,” he said, while delivering Origin’s mid-year results.
“I think it’s actually going to be a pretty messy period of time, and I think you will see us running our generation less at Earing. That’s what you’re seeing now.”
Origin is one of several energy market corporations which have this year substantially written down the value of their generation assets or cancelled upgrade plans.
AGL has written down more than $2.7 billion of value, due to reduced wholesale power prices and more than $1 billion has been wiped off the value of Queensland government-owned fossil fuel generators as falling wholesale electricity prices.
While a sudden and unplanned exit of coal power plants is highly problematic, Edis cautioned against knee-jerk reactions from governments in response.
“The fundamental problem for coal is that solar and wind is here to stay, and coal plants just aren’t flexible enough to manage around them,” he said.
“Efforts to keep inflexible coal plants afloat, let alone build new coal power plants, are likely to be counter-productive.
“Rather than propping up these plants which are getting very old, we need new government policies that supports private-sector investment in dispatchable power plants that will be viable over the long term.”
The authors pointed to the NSW Government’s Infrastructure Roadmap as an example of how to plan for the future, saying it provides a well-structured and competitive process for underwriting new capacity that can replace coal power plants in advance of their closure.
“With the right policies in place allowing the market to operate and renewable energy supply taking a dominant position, the NEM’s average wholesale power prices are likely to continue to fall – a significant thumbs up for electricity consumers everywhere,” Bowyer said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/25/neoen-completes-financing-for-300-mw-victorian-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Neoen completes financing for 300 MW Victorian Big Battery,"Neoen has confirmed it has reached financial close on its Victorian Big Battery (VBB) after the Australian Government-owned CEFC provided a senior debt facility to finance the design, construction and operation of the battery, which will be one of the largest energy storage facilities in the world.
“We are delighted to announce that the Victorian Big Battery has reached this important financial milestone,” Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy said in a statement on Thursday.
“I would like to thank the CEFC for their renewed trust and commitment towards supporting innovative storage solutions. We are on track to deliver this project before the next Australian summer and are looking forward to playing our part in helping Victoria reach its ambitious target of 50% renewable energy by 2030.”
Financing of the VBB was completed just three months after Neoen secured a grid services contract with AEMO.
The System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) contract will run until 2032, unlocking up to 250 MW of additional peak capacity on the existing Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) over the next decade.  Under the contract, the battery will provide an automatic response in the event of an unexpected network outage, providing AEMO with an additional resource to ensure grid stability.
CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said the VBB, to be built next to Moorabool Terminal Station in Geelong, would provide a critical boost to the state’s grid security and support a higher penetration of renewable energy.
“The battery will provide grid support services when it is under pressure, allowing authorities to increase the capacity of the VNI by up to 250 MW,” he said.
“With more power flowing between the states, including during the peak summer season, the battery will contribute to grid reliability and security.”
To be entirely owned and operated by Neoen, the project will be delivered in collaboration with Tesla, using its Megapack technology, and network partner AusNet Services.
The VBB is among a suite of projects being pursued in Australia by Neoen which earlier this month announced its interests here had helped deliver an 18% increase in revenue for 2020.
Among the company’s 2020 highlights was the signing of a power purchase agreement (PPA)  with CleanCo Queensland for 110 MW of wind energy which will allow for the construction of the 157 MW Kaban wind farm near Cairns, in Queensland.
That followed reaching financial close on the 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub as well as securing a 14-year contract with the Australian Capital Territory. Neoen has also filed planning documents for a 500 MW / 1000 MWh big battery to be built west of Sydney and continues to operate the recently expanded 150 MW Hornsdale Big Battery in South Australia.
“We are thrilled to be building our second big battery in Australia. The Victorian Big Battery once again demonstrates the value of innovative solutions that Neoen is proud to be pioneering,” Neoen chairman and CEO Xavier Barbaro said.
“At 300 MW, it will be one of the largest batteries in the world, taking our total capacity in operation or under construction in Australia to over 1.8 GW, and bringing us one step closer to our global target of 5 GW by the end of 2021.”

Victoria’s Minister for Energy Lily D’Ambrosio said the VBB will contribute to the dispatchable resources needed to underpin the increasing share of renewable energy that will make up Australia’s future energy mix.
“The Victorian Big Battery is an important part of the largest modernisation of the grid in our state’s history, ” she said.
“It will create jobs and drive down energy prices, while supporting our transition to renewable energy.”
Energy storage is rated a priority technology under the Australian Federal Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap, as an enabler of cost effective and reliable low emission electricity.
The AEMO Integrated System Plan indicates distributed energy will provide as much as 22% of the nation’s underlying annual energy consumption by 2040, with more than 26 GW of additional renewable energy required to replace coal-fired generation. This will require up to an additional 19 GW of new dispatchable resources, including utility scale battery storage.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/25/aemc-announces-new-standards-for-rooftop-solar/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",AEMC announces new standards for rooftop solar,"The AEMC announced on Thursday compulsory new standards for new and upgraded solar PV systems connecting to the National Electricity Market (NEM) will take effect from December to help the network better handle increasing amounts of rooftop solar without risking system security.
“These new minimum technical standards are part of a raft of changes we are looking at to future-proof the power system so it can confidently handle more solar,” AEMC chief executive Benn Barr said.
 “The rapid uptake of solar means we must act now to make sure this technology and the system it uses work hand in hand.
 “We need to keep pace with the change underway – nearly three million households and small businesses have taken up solar, and the demand for household batteries and electric vehicles will increase over time.
 “These new standards allow us to do two important things at once – welcome more new technologies into the power system and at the same time help protect grid stability. The more we keep the system stable, the more solar we can connect up and the faster we can decarbonise.”
The standards dictate that new and upgraded solar PV systems connected to the grid must be compliant with the distributed energy resources (DER) Technical Standards, including using a compliant inverter with low voltage ride-through (LVRT) capabilities to ensure that residential systems won’t ‘trip’ or disconnect when there are voltage disturbances on the network.
The new standards, which are to come into effect on December 18, 2021, will apply to all jurisdictions in the NEM – Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Tasmania – and comes after similar changes were introduced in South Australia in late 2020.
Energy Networks Australia (ENA) chief executive Andrew Dillon welcomed the new standards and said it was particularly positive that the AEMC had worked within the existing framework rather than create new rules.
“It is important that regulatory bodies support the most efficient pathways to enable new technologies and integrate distributed energy resources like solar and batteries into the grid,” he said.
“These new standards will help networks ensure the growing amounts of rooftop solar can operate efficiently and safely and more customers can connect their devices to grid.”
The new standards are among a raft of changes being considered by the AEMC as it looks to embed solar and other DER into the network.
With rooftop solar penetration expected to reach 14.64 GW total – an amount that could meet upwards of 40% of underlying demand by 2025 – other changes being considered include how to change the pricing structure to give incentives to owners of DER to export power when it is of most value to the system.
The Energy Security Board is also considering the issue of integrating DER, with recommendations for public consultation due next month.
 “It’s imperative that we make sure the right structures are put in place to support a whole new energy mix and a very different looking power grid than the one we’ve relied on in the past,” Barr said.
 “But we need to do this in a way that helps more people to connect, protects those that don’t, and helps the system run smoothly overall. This means restructuring the system, including the market incentives and rules.”
The ENA said other changes being considered by the AEMC, such as incentivising customers to export power during times of high demand, would be crucial to support the rapidly transforming energy system but cautioned the changes need to cater for multiple scenarios.
“With ever-growing new connections of solar and batteries, it’s important we deliver solutions that can work in all the vastly different system conditions right across the country,” Dillon said.
“Uniform standards make sense, but a centralise-everything policy approach to integrating new technologies will be costly for customers and cause problems in many regions.”
The standards announced on Thursday follow a rule change request from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) seeking to set up a framework for AEMO to set minimal technical standards.
 The AEMC said the December launch date will give manufacturers time to prepare for the change.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/25/interview-inverter-smarts-to-tackle-integration-issues/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Interview: Inverter smarts to tackle integration issues,"pv magazine Australia: In September last year, the solar industry in South Australia faced a significant challenge, when the government introduced new regulations for distributed solar – looking to maintain system strength. Among the Finer network, how big a disruption did it cause?
Photo: Fimer
Warren Merritt (WM): The new requirements to meet the South Australian regulations didn’t pose a major disruption to us. Our inverters met the LVRT [Low Voltage Ride Through] requirement and can be remotely disconnected or reconnected when required.
Jason Venning (JV): The most challenging part for us, was to form relationships with relevant agents quickly to ensure we were able to continue operating in the SA market.
What do you think you learned from the situation?
JV: The rushed implementation of these new regulations could have caused significant problems for the industry. With the short timeframes provided, Fimer was fortunate that we did not need to make any changes to our products, so we were able to submit our certifications and be approved relatively quickly.
In future, a national approach to the introduction of new regulations would be preferable as managing different regulations across states will increase the cost of compliance.
There are already inverter capacity limitations in parts of the NEM. Do you see export limitations becoming more common?
WM: Of course, with the increase of DER [Distributed Energy Resources] on the network, it has to be managed to maintain grid stability. It’s my feeling we’ll see not only see export limitations become more common but also see the need for flexible exports and an increase in customers moving towards increasing their solar self-consumption – with battery storage a pretty obvious option.
The ability to remotely control distributed PV systems and for them to communicate with network operators appears to be increasingly important. How is Fimer addressing this with its current inverter range?
WM: Fimer has several tools to achieve this, including hardwired functions and Internet and cloud-based options. We are also working with several partners on other remote control solutions. It all involves working with our production team in Italy to incorporate more functionality in future inverter models and this is exactly what we’re doing.
The new Fimer inverter range, the PVS-10/33 TL, is said to have an “innovative control algorithm”. Can you explain to me how that works?
WM: The communications capabilities of the PVS-10/33 string inverters mean that they can share data directly without the need for any external controllers, allowing higher energy yields and increased self-consumption in compliance with any limits set for exported power, at either low or medium voltage connection points.
And this involves integrated communications, right? Not third party…
WM: Yeah, that’s it. The new PVS inverter range has all the communications you would expect from a modern smart solar inverter. The range has built-in Wi-Fi, capability for Mobus RTU RS485 ports and Modbus TCP ethernet ports, enabling remote monitoring, remote control and connection of metering devices.
What is the advantage of having these integrated rather than utilise third-party devices?
WM: The advantage of having these communication devices built-in makes for a more simplified, reliable and cost-effective installation and only having to use one manufacturer opposed to many.
There’s also software aiming at boosting power output I understand. What can you tell me about that?
JV: Fimer inverters incorporate our PowerGain algorithm, ensuring that the inverter always achieves the maximum power point even when there is intermittent shading. Our technology reduces the need for expensive accessories such as panel optimisers. Others promote this feature as something new, but we’ve had this incorporated into all our products for many years.

Let’s talk a bit more about the market. Beyond residential rooftops, larger C&I arrays appears to be building momentum. What is Fimer seeing in terms of demand from this segment?
JV: We are seeing a more significant trend in small business installing solar to reduce costs for their business, and are generally installing in the 20-30 kW range for system size. FIMER has a strong background in supporting the C&I space and which is why we have introduced the new PVS-10/33-TL range to provide a more flexible solution.
I’ve read that one of the advantages of the new range is the current monitoring. Why is this important?
WM: Built-in string current monitoring with FIMER’s free Aurora Vision monitoring gives the customer remote visualisation of their whole system. By monitoring string current allows the PV owner to detect issues and where they are in the array to keep the system operating at peak performance. Without this technology, PV owners may see a drop in a performance at some stage but not know where or how or long the issue has been going on, costing more money in lost production and cost of repair.
Bifacial modules have become more widely accepted by the market. Are the gains claimed by manufacturers living up the hype?
WM: Bifacial modules are certainly becoming more popular, with bifacial module manufacturers claiming up to 25% more production but in reality, we are seeing production gains of between 10-15% depending on the material used under the array.
And what challenges are there on a power electronics level?
WM: Because of higher string currents, not all inverters can support bifacial modules. Our new  PVS-20/30/33-TL range can support bifacial; however, this functionality will be available later in the year for the Australian and New Zealand market.
With ever increasing penetration rates of rooftop solar right around Australia, how significant a threat to the distributed market segment do you believe grid constraints and network operator concerns will be going forward?
JV: As long as all states and territories can develop a harmonised set of regulations regarding the management of rooftop PV generation, there should be no constraints to developing the DER market segment. Increased support for the installation of residential or community battery storage will further contribute to realising the full potential of DER.
What role do you think battery storage will play in addressing this challenge in 2021 and going forward?
JV: I believe battery storage has a significant role to play. Governments should be encouraging the uptake of residential battery systems to help manage grid stability and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuel generation.

Chinese module manufacturer Trina Solar has set up Trina Storage, a new unit specialising in storage and smart energy solutions.
The new unit will operate to act and develop innovative solutions for various areas of application, for example for residential batteries, grid services, large scale storage and microgrids.
The company wants to provide flexible and scalable solutions that meet the requirements in terms of cost, quality, security and efficiency, and meet specific customer needs. The new storage solution proposed by Trina Storage should include hardware, software and services that should make it possible to use storage quickly and inexpensively.
The company will combine lithium-iron-phosphate batteries and power conversion systems in a containerised solution with smart energy management and control systems as well as services such as monitoring and support, using only tier-one components.
The new division is expected to benefit from Trina’s many years of experience in the solar industry and the collaboration with independent power producers, project developers and EPCs.
“Our solutions are ideal for various application scenarios, such as solar and storage solutions or standalone battery systems, to improve grid stability,” said Terry Chen, head of overseas storage business at Trina Solar. The company expects exponential growth in the renewable energy market in the coming years as energy demand continues to rise and storage is the only technology that can effectively support this development. “We are ready to drive the renewable energy revolution and become a global leader in smart energy,” said Chen.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/25/vehicle-integrated-pv-reduces-ev-charging-time-in-sunny-regions-by-40/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 25, 2021",Vehicle-integrated PV reduces EV charging time in sunny regions by 40%,"From pv magazine Global. 
Electric cars incorporating PV panels on their bodywork or roof have the potential of reaching more than 10,000 km per year of pure solar-powered driving and the modules could have a payback time of only three or four years.
This is one of the main preliminary findings of a research program for vehicle-integrated PV that is being run by Bonna Newman, program manager for PV and Mobility, Module Technologies at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). “We have developed a model to quantify all the benefits that are generated by installing solar panels on electric vehicles,” she told pv magazine. “We want to look at how much PV power can really be expected to be generated in different situations.”
The program includes exploring crystalline silicon, thin-film and perovskite technologies. “We are testing different technologies and we are seeking to make them effective for on-board PV generation for all kinds of electric vehicles, including buses and trucks,” she further explained.
Benefits
The 10,000 km range, however, is still difficult to reach for most electric cars that are currently on the market due to their current vehicle energy efficiency. “But electric car models are improving dramatically,” Newman stated. “The Tesla Model 3, for example, is much more efficient than the previous versions.”
According to Newman’s estimations, the benefits of vehicle-integrated PV are proportional to the solar radiation levels of a given area, its demand for electric vehicles, and its power prices. “If we replace the grid electricity with the power generated by the solar panels in a place like the Netherlands, where there is not too much sun, but electricity prices are close €0.20 euro per kWh, we may have as much as between €150 and €200 in direct electricity savings each year,” she emphasised. “If the panels that you put on your car cost approximately €1,000 or €1 per watt, compared to conventional solar, you can consider a three-to-four-year payback time and there is a reasonable benefit here.”
The CO2 savings are estimated at 250 kg per year compared to electric cars relying exclusively on grid electricity. “This is clearly a benefit in terms of the energy transition, but it depends on the location and what kind of grid you have there,” she said. “In a place like France, where most of the grid electricity comes from nuclear power, you can also have zero emissions and, in this case, you don’t have much of a C02 benefit there.”
The estimations also include embedded CO2 in PV panels based on conventional module manufacturing methods. “We found that in almost all situations the CO2 benefits brought by vehicle-integrated PV are more than with electric vehicles only,” Newman added.
Convenience
Another important factor, which for the Dutch research group is still difficult to quantify, is what it calls the “convenience factor”, which is expressed in terms of solar kilometers and the numbers of times you have to plug your car into the grid. “Through our most detailed model, we assessed a Tesla-like car in the Netherlands, for which average driving reaches around 13,000 kilometers per year,” she stated. “What we found is that you could expect to drive more than 3,000 km on solar and to charge about 25% fewer times when PV panels are installed on the vehicle. And this is annually, but in the summertime, you may even drive for three months without recharging the vehicle  a single time.”
In sunny places like Spain and Italy or countries with similar solar radiation levels, the charging time may be reduced by about 40% annually. “And this may be achieved with today’s PV and EV technologies,” Newmann affirmed. “Even in the event of running out of energy, on a sunny day, the panels would have enough power to partially recharge the vehicle and bring it to the closest recharging station, without the need of external help.”
Module integration
When asked if module integration is preferable when made by the car manufacturer or an external body, Newman said that, in the long-term, a better design can be achieved if the solar modules are integrated in the car factory. “The most practical and the most cost-effective solution is the PV system integration within the automotive industry, by the car OEM which is responsible for the car roof or parts of the bodywork,” she said. “After-market solutions, however, may currently be a better way to prove and popularise vehicle-integrated PV in a faster way.” Currently, all the vehicle-integrated PV products that are available on the market are done by car manufacturers.
As for the after-market solution, the integration of PV into the vehicle system will be slightly different on each vehicle. Therefore, the system integration will need to be improved or adapted for different vehicles for optimal performance.
For the integration of the panels in the car’s body component, the TNO scientists want to use modules that are as similar as possible to conventional products used in the solar industry. In this way, they can take advantage of a large-scale supply chain, which provides improvements and efficiencies and costs. “We can afford higher costs than conventional PV, but if we stay close to what the PV industry is doing in terms of manufacturing, we can translate that better value for the solar mobility industry,” Newmann emphasised.
Crystalline silicon
The prevailing PV technology in this market segment remains crystalline silicon PV, as it provides the largest yield. “At this time, we need more energy production density than CIGS can typically provide,” Newman specified. “We are working on CIGS in terms of integration because it has obvious advantages for being lightweight and flexible.”
Crystalline silicon, however, has a much better supply chain from a cost perspective, she notes. “It is possible to curve crystalline silicon panels to the shapes that are needed. Most of the areas of the vehicle are flat enough for crystalline silicon and, for this reason, we consider it the most promising technology for the near future.”
Crystalline solar cells are also easier to connect on the roof, at least with the current state-of-the-art technologies. Crystalline silicon also reacts better to dynamic shading events, as shading can cross a vehicle many different times in different ways and in a very unpredictable manner. “In the future, we can hopefully come up with a solution for thin films that can perform better during these events, eventually adding perovskite or CIGS layers,” Newmann explained.
Safety
The Dutch research team is also working on reliability and safety issues. Crash and splintering tests are performed to understand what happens in the case of an accident, in which the solar panels on the roof or other surfaces of a car may also be broken.
“For example, the voltages from one corner of the roof to the other corner which people would not be able to touch normally, would not be an issue,” Newmann said. “In an accident, however, these pieces of the roof could be much closer together and then potentially endanger rescue workers and the risk of an electroshock cannot be excluded.” The program is intended to ensure that these panels are at the safety levels of a consumer product.
Another important factor is considering what could happen if a car with solar panels on the front side hit a pedestrian, Newmann added. “We have to see how the glass shatters in the event of a collision with a person’s head, for example. We have to see in which way this impact injures the head of a pedestrian compared to a car without panels and we have to be sure that the solar panels will not increase any risk .”
It is very important to avoid these kinds of issues arising in the early stages of this market segment, she stressed. “Even if the technology has clear benefits, we have to make sure it is introduced in a safe way.”
Market size
There are no major hurdles for introducing 21%-efficient panels on the body of an electric car within the next five years and have tens of thousands of cars produced, from a technology perspective. Many people may decide to buy an electric car with integrated PV because of the convenience factor. “By 2030, I could imagine that EVs with solar panels may represent 10% of the EV market,” Newman forecast. “It will be a pretty big market and this percentage is not even that extreme in my mind, if you consider that the payback time is between three and four years.”
Looking forward, Newman said that it would probably be difficult to see electric cars powered exclusively by solar panels. “It will be difficult to get rid of a cable completely,” she concluded. “But there is a good chance that, if you live in a sunny place, you can drive for weeks during summertime without the need for recharging.”
