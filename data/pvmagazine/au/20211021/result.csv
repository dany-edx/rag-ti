The investment is a combination of cash and “in kind” in investment.
The cathode is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, allowing the high powered charging and discharging of lithium ion batteries. It can be one of the most costly battery components and its quality crucial for battery performance and safety. A Canadian study, from McGill University, found that the cathode can account for up to 40% of lithium-ion battery cell production costs.
WA is hoping to establish processing facilities for key cathode materials under the Cathode Precursor Production project. The WA government is contributing $900,000 to the project. The funding is part of a $13.2 million the WA government is investing in cathode manufacturing projects.
“Western Australia already exports all the minerals needed to make a battery but now we have the exciting opportunity to move into the next step of manufacturing these materials,” said Bill Johnston, the WA Minister for Mines and Petroleum. Johnston is also responsible for the WA energy portfolio.
Once the manufacturing facility is completed, an 18 month trial will be carried out to assess its feasibility and competitiveness. A 2020 report found that WA has a “once in a generation opportunity” to develop cathode material production capabilities.
The cathode precursor project compliments miner BHP’s Nickel West facility that will produce nickel sulphate in Kwinana, south of Perth. The refinery was opened this month.
Lithium hydroxide plants are also under construction in the state, which the state government says indicates activity “along the battery value chain.”
Vanadium electrolyte manufacturing is also being pursued in WA, to support the production of vanadium redox flow batteries.
“Diversifying our economy and increasing our activity in mineral processing and advanced manufacturing are key objectives,“ added Johnston.
A report published earlier this month made the case for Australia to leverage its mineral wealth by creating battery manufacturing “hubs”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/21/aemc-reveals-final-rule-to-shore-up-system-strength/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",AEMC reveals final rule to shore up system strength,"With the entry of record levels of renewable energy into Australia’s energy market needing to be coordinated with the exit of ageing fossil-fuelled generation, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has released a final rule on system strength, a smooth and predictable voltage waveform critical for the maintaining of a stable and reliable power system.
Australia’s generation mix is changing rapidly with new energy resources including solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen entering the system, pushing out coal and even gas-fired generation.
The Energy Security Board (ESB) has estimated that over the next 20 years, between 26 GW and 50 GW of large-scale renewable energy is expected to come online in Australia, along with between 13 GW to 24 GW of distributed solar. This predicted influx is in addition to existing and committed projects.
At the same time Australia’s traditional generation plants are exiting the market, with two-thirds of the existing fossil-fuel facilities set to be shuttered by 2040.
The AEMC said the scale of incoming renewable energy is leading to higher demand for essential system services, such as system strength, which have traditionally been provided by the large synchronous generators.
The Commission said the existing ways of providing system strength services are no longer fit for purpose, leading to delays in generators connecting to the grid while the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has been required to intervene in the market when there is inadequate system strength, including by potentially constraining renewable power.

AEMC chair Anna Collyer said the final rule was an important response to the transformation in the electricity system as it moves to a low-carbon future.
“We expect that batteries, renewable generators and big loads like hydrogen will find it simpler, faster and more predictable to connect to the grid as a result of this decision,” she said.
“Our approach to this rule change is a practical one, incorporating significant stakeholder input and analysis, that seeks to mitigate the consequences of inefficient market outcomes due to a lack of system strength.
“This should translate into more energy producers entering Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), which is a win for competition and a win for consumers.”
The AEMC said the new rule creates a three-pronged framework to create a more forward-looking regime so system strength is supplied where and when it is needed.
Transmission networks will be obliged to provide sufficient levels of system strength, reducing the costs and delays of connections to the grid. The AEMC expects this will keep the system secure while avoiding costly interventions and constraints that are otherwise paid for by generators connecting to the grid and customers.
New access standards will apply for large loads like hydrogen and generators including utility-scale solar and batteries that connect to the grid via inverters. The AMEC said by setting certain levels of technical performance, these standards will reduce the demand for system strength, helping to reduce the costs of supplying energy.

A system strength mitigation requirement will also be introduced to ensure a clearer and more predictable way for new energy resources such as batteries to connect to the grid. Essentially, large loads and generators will either pay a charge for system strength or do their own remediation to provide their own system strength.
The Commission said this will replace and evolve the current ‘do no harm’ obligation on new connections.
Collyer said taken together, the changes are a landmark new approach to support the transitioning power system.
“Today’s rule should result in greater system security, fewer costly interventions by AEMO and a system that allows easier and quicker connections of new energy resources to the grid, helping to lower costs for consumers,” she said.
Collyer also suggested the reforms would provide more certainty for renewable energy investors.
“These new measures will allow investors to avoid a long, complex and potentially costly process when a new resource is connecting to the grid,” she said.
“Investors will also be in a better position to clearly gauge investments by reducing the need for costly and market-distorting interventions.”
The AEMC said the rule change dovetails with the final advice recently provided to Energy Ministers by the ESB on a fit-for-purpose market design post 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/21/providence-to-trial-hydrogen-lithium-battery-at-solar-farms/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Providence to trial hydrogen-lithium battery at solar farms,"Sydney-headquartered Providence Asset Group announced it will install hydrogen-lithium battery energy storage technology developed by green hydrogen storage specialist LAVO at its 10 solar farms in regional Victoria after finalising a $33 million project financing agreement with the Commonwealth Bank (CBA).
Providence said the community-based solar projects, including ~5 MW solar farms in Katamatite, Numurkah, Echuca West, Echuca and Stanhope are already operational and cumulatively produce 100% renewable energy to power approximately 20,000 households each year.
The Victorian solar farms form part of Providence’s master plan with the company also extending its footprint into regional New South Wales (NSW) where it intends to develop another 29 community solar projects, including projects at Manilla, South Tamworth, Guyra and Gunnedah, increasing its total portfolio to almost 40 ~5 MW solar farms across both states.
“Providence Asset Group recognises the enormous opportunities that exist in our regions and we’re excited to be partnering with regional communities to deliver more affordable and sustainable energy solutions,” Providence Asset Group co-founder and chief investment officer Alan Yu said.
As part of the infrastructure rollout, Providence plans to deploy advanced hybrid storage technology – including hydrogen storage and traditional lithium-ion batteries – at its regional solar farm locations.
Each solar farm is to be fitted with Sydney-based LAVO’s HEOS renewable hydrogen energy storage system.

Developed in partnership with the University of NSW’s Hydrogen Energy Research Centre, with the seed investment from Providence Asset Group, LAVO’s HEOS hydrogen energy storage system uses patented metal hybrid technology to store hydrogen equivalent to up to 60 kWh which will produce 40 kWh of useable electricity.
At installation, the energy storage system is connected to a solar PV array via a hybrid inverter, and to water via a purification system, to enable internal electrolysers to convert excess energy into hydrogen, which it stores in four canisters.
When stored energy is needed, the HEOS activates a fuel cell to deliver electricity. An integrated 5 kWh lithium battery provides a buffer that can provide instantaneous response to power shortage or outage.
Yu, who is also CEO and executive director of LAVO, said the development of low-cost hydrogen storage is creating a new and exciting opportunity for Australian residences and businesses.
“Providence Asset Group is proud to be at the forefront of the energy transition in Australia, applying the innovative storage technology of the LAVO HEOS with our existing and planned portfolio of regional solar farms,” he said.
Providence plans to first trial the LAVO hydrogen energy storage system at its Stanhope solar farm in Victoria with installation expected in the fourth quarter of 2021 and aims to progressively deploy the technology across the rest of its portfolio during 2023-2024.

CBA natural resources and energy executive director Neil Fraser welcomed the rollout of the battery technology, saying the bank is committed to supporting Australia’s renewable energy technology innovation and helping build the nation’s future infrastructure.
“We’re excited about the work Providence Asset Group is undertaking in the development of renewable energy technology, in particular the piloting of the LAVO HEOS hydrogen battery technology across its portfolio,” he said.
“This is a pioneering Australian technology which has the potential to be an important part of the future energy mix required to meet the needs of a net-zero economy.”
Providence has already secured an offtake agreement for its solar farm portfolio, signing a  multi-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) earlier this year with SmartestEnergy Australia, a subsidiary of Japanese investment giant Marubeni Corporation.
Under the terms of the agreement, SmartestEnergy will purchase the renewable generation output of the solar farms for an initial 30-month period, with both parties planning for a 10-year extension on the firming PPA at the end of the initial period.
Providence said when all the solar farms are operating, the combined generation output will be around 500 GWh per annum.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/21/5b-backs-bigger-is-better-with-new-generation-of-modular-solar-solution/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",5B backs bigger is better with new generation of modular solar solution,"Australian solar start-up 5B has launched a new, more powerful version of its pre-assembled and relocatable modular Maverick solar solution as it seeks to accelerate the deployment of solar PV and smooth the way for manufacturing and deployment partners to join its “platform ecosystem”.
5B chief technology officer Simeon Baker-Finch said the new generation Maverick features a higher capacity 48-50 kW DC solar array and “plug-and-play” wiring designed for faster, easier and safer on-site deployment ideally suited for mining, commercial and industrial, and large-scale solar power generation.
“It’s 30% more powerful than the last generation. It’s plug and play pre-wired, easier to manufacture, and safer and faster to deploy,” he said.
“It is compatible with and optimised for the new 540-550 W module class which is fast becoming the preference for our customers in the utility scale solar industry.
“We’re now deploying 5B Mavericks all around the world so we needed to streamline the components, optimise the structure and accept that larger module class.”
Baker-Finch said the new generation Maverick is compatible with all Super League and Tier 1 silicon modules and each array comprises 90 pre-installed modules with preconfigured electricals for rapid connection of return cables to inverter onsite. Each of the nine A-frame beams comprises two rows of five in-portrait modules, connected via a hinge and anchored by a ballast. Each array weighs less than 6000 kilograms and when deployed measures six meters wide and 45 meters long.

The new Maverick features a new concrete-steel composite beam design which the company said enhances stability in high-wind environments, making it suitable for deployment to sites with 48 m/s wind speed. 5B said the system can be deployed on sites with wind speeds as high as 75 m/s with minor upgrades to configuration.
5B said the increased power capacity of the new Maverick delivers improved shipping density with four arrays able to fit compactly into a standard 40-foot shipping container while the design enables arrays to be positioned more closely onsite, improving land utilisation.
Baker-Finch said the design changes would make it easier for manufacturing and deployment partners to become a member of the 5B “platform ecosystem”, helping accelerate the global deployment of solar.
“That is key,” he said. “We don’t need to just get faster in terms of how fast we can deploy a solar array, the reality is that we need to get faster in how quickly we can scale this industry.
“We needed to create a win-win solution where the end customer sees the benefit of the Maverick when it’s deployed on the ground but also that all of our partners, those being the folks that assemble the Mavericks in factories and those that deploy the Maverick on the ground, are able to do so in the most efficient way possible.
“The strategy is to design one and build many. That is what we’re trying to get at with this new generation.
“We have optimised a design that is easier to manufacture so it is much easier to scale up.”
Since the launch of 5B in 2017, the company has completed 52 solar PV projects worldwide totalling more than 32 MWp capacity.

5B’s Maverick arrays have proven popular with remote mining operations.Included in that portfolio is a 12 MW system which it delivered with Enerven for SA Water and a 4.3 MW project it delivered with independent power provider Nomadic Energy Australia for miner Northern Star Resources in Western Australia.
5B’s Maverick system is also the preferred technology for Sun Cable’s massive 17-20 GW solar farm being developed in the Northern Territory with the intent to export solar power to Singapore via a subsea transmission cable.
Baker-Finch said the new generation Maverick would allow the company to “shift the dial so we could get to the next level of volume”.
“We’ve booked more than 100 MW of sales of this new product across four countries (Australia, the United States, Latin America and India) already,” he said.
5B, which has its own manufacturing facility in Sydney, has already teamed with manufacturing partners in Adelaide and Vietnam.
The consortium behind the Sun Cable project is also looking to establish a solar module manufacturing facility in the Northern Territory to feed the $30 billion-plus project. Sun Cable earlier this year lodged a development application for the first phase of a manufacturing and assembly facility to be constructed in Darwin as it continues to progress plans for the world’s biggest solar+storage project.

Mining giant Rio Tinto has used its investor day to try and revive the company’s declining reputation, stock price and executive workforce. The big news was the company’s raised ambitions in emissions reduction. It unveiled a new target to reduce its Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, an apparent tripling of its previous target.
To achieve this new target, the miner is now targeting a 15% emissions reduction by 2025 (from a 2018 baseline of 32.6 Mt [CO2 equivalent – equity basis]), and will directly invest approximately $7.5 billion toward its emissions reduction between 2022-2030. 
We’re also setting new targets. We will bring forward our 2030 target of reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15% to 2025. We are also more than tripling our 2030 target, increasing it to a 50% reduction in our scope 1 and 2 emissions.
— Rio Tinto (@RioTinto) October 20, 2021

This investment will partially go to the continued development of carbon-free aluminium technology Elysis and “pathways to produce green steel” which mean “a focus on renewable power for iron ore in the Pilbara and for the Australian aluminium smelters, including $0.5 billion per year from 2022 to 2024.”  
Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm, who has been in the top job since January in the wake of outcry in response to the company’s destruction of two 46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous sites in Western Australia last year, said “Rio Tinto is taking action to strengthen our business and improve our performance by unleashing the full potential of our people and assets, working in partnership with a broad range of stakeholders.”
Stausholm said that all of Rio Tinto’s commodities are “vital for the energy transition and continue to benefit from ongoing urbanisation.” We have a clear pathway to decarbonise our business and are actively developing technologies that will enable our customers and our customers’ customers to decarbonise.” 
However, this strategic ‘pathway’ might not be as clear as Stausholm makes out. According to the Financial Times, Rio Tinto’s head of strategy and development resigned yesterday, on the eve of the company’s investor day. Peter Toth is the second senior executive to leave the mining giant since Jakob Stausholm was appointed chief executive in January. According to a company statement Toth “has accepted a new position outside of Rio Tinto.” 
An Australian parliamentary report was published this week in response to the Juukan Gorge site destruction which called for an overhaul of the nation’s cultural heritage laws which could allow indigenous groups to launch legal action against mining companies. In a statement, Rio Tinto welcomed the final report of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia following its inquiry into the destruction of rock shelters at Juukan Gorge on the land of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikiura people (PKKP) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
“We have been working hard to rebuild trust and meaningful relationships with the PKKP people and other Traditional Owners,” said Stausholm. “Rio Tinto is absolutely committed to listening, learning and showing greater care, and this remains a top priority.” Of course, Traditional Owners need a lot more than just words from mining corporations like Rio Tinto, and meaningful change is still yet to materialise.
The above mentioned renewables uptake at Rio Tinto’s Pilbara sites is expected to include “the rapid deployment of 1 GW of wind and solar power.” This would replace the natural gas power plant currently in use and see the electrification of mining equipment while abating “around 1 million tons of CO2“.
However, the company said the full electrification of its Pilbara system, “including all trucks, mobile equipment and rail operations, will require further gigawatt-scale renewable deployment and advances in fleet technologies.” 
The miner also says it is investigating whether there are biomass and hydrogen pathways to green its steelmaking. 
However, the big renewables news from the investor day was from Rio Tinto’s aluminium business, which will switch the Boyne Island and Tomago smelters (in Gladstone, Queensland, and the NSW Hunter Valley respectively), to solar and wind energy. Rio Tinto is estimating the job to transition the smelters will require around 5 GW of renewables.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/21/big-modules-head-for-standardisation/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",MARK HUTCHINS,"OCTOBER 21, 2021",Big modules head for standardisation,"From pv magazine Global. 
According to an announcement from module manufacturer Trina Solar, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) is poised to announce a set of standard dimensions for large format modules relying on the 210mm wafer launched by Zhonghuan Semiconductor back in 2019.
The standard, according to Trina, will be set out for different cell layouts as in the table below. Having a standard set of dimensions should make thing simpler, and therefore cheaper, for project developers and component suppliers, all of whom have to deal with significant uncertainty over module sizes and electrical characteristics since the switch to larger wafer formats began to play out.
The process began in May, when the CPIA brought together industry experts and representatives from across the supply chain to agree on a set of standards for products incorporating the 210mm wafer. Cell & module manufacturers including Trina Solar, Risen Energy, Canadian Solar and Tongwei – all of which have chosen to work with the 210mm wafer rather than then smaller 182mm product being promoted by Longi and others – took part in the CPIA event and agreed to standardise various technical details of the modules including module dimensions, size & positioning of mounting system attachment holes and other details including cell spacing. Modules will also be designed to meet the latest international standards including IEC 61730, published by the Switzerland-based International Electrotechnical Commission.
“This means 210mm module manufacturers, end users and system solution providers have achieved uniformity in technical issues,” said Trina Solar in a statement. “Standardisation of modules will greatly reduce BOS costs and LCOE, and deliver the convenience and maximum value of ultra-high power modules and solutions to solar applications.”
Trina says it expects the move for standardisation to directly result in cost reductions for balance of systems components, and a more efficient supply chain. On top this, it expects the manufacturing industry to be able to innovate and bring new processes to scale more quickly, and to bring down manufacturing costs as well.
