“As solar panels heat up beyond 25℃, their efficiency decreases markedly,” the researchers said. “Green roofs moderate rooftop temperatures so we wanted to find out could green roofs help with the problem of heat reducing the output of solar panels.”
The research team, which also included academics from the University of Canberra and Charles Sturt University, compared a conventional rooftop PV system with a combined solar and integrated green roof system over an eight-month period that spanned summer and winter.
The two buildings used in the study are the same height, size and shape and located next to each other in Sydney’s central business district. Both rooftops encompass about 1,860 square metres, with about one third covered by solar panels. Vegetation covered about 78% of the green roof and the solar panels covered 40% of this planted area.
Both the green and conventional rooftop systems employed four SolarEdge three phase inverters rated to operate at a 98 % efficiency. The green roof comprised 335 SunPower Maxeon 395 W panels, with a total system size of 132.33 kWp. The conventional roof used 346 LG 320 W panels with a peak nominal power of 110.72 kWp.
“We measured the impacts on biodiversity and solar output, as well as how the plants coped with having panels installed above them,” the researchers said, noting that the green roof had reduced surface temperatures by up to 9.63℃ for the solar panels and 6.93℃ for the roof surfaces.

The research team said the reduction in temperature had delivered significant improvements in solar panel efficiency which led to increased solar generation and overall energy production.
“This lowering of temperatures increased the maximum output of the solar panels by 21-107%, depending on the month,” they said. “Performance modelling indicates an extensive green roof in central Sydney can, on average, produce 4.5% more electricity at any given light level.”
The researchers said the benefits of combing solar panels with a living roof extended beyond increased energy production with the vegetation on the biosolar roof flourishing in the areas directly below and surrounding the solar panels.
“This was surprising,” they said. “It was not expected the plants would prefer the shaded areas under the panels to the open areas. This shows that shading by solar panels will not prevent the growth of full and healthy roof gardens.”
The green roof had also supported more species of birds and insects than the conventional roof, decreased stormwater runoff, and insulated the building from extremes of temperature.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/21/cefc-warns-more-needed-after-record-investment-in-renewables/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 21, 2023",CEFC warns more needed after record investment in renewables,"In its latest investment update, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) shows it committed $1.9 billion in new investments in the 2022-23 financial year, including a record $1.2 billion in renewable energy and grid-related projects.
CEFC Chief Executive Officer Ian Learmonth said the government-funded corporation had worked with investors and project developers to bring forward 14 large-scale solar, wind and storage projects in the 12 months to 30 June 2023 with a total transaction value of $5.7 billion.
“Investment of this scale is critical to our national goal of reaching 82% renewables by 2030,” he said. “We had a strong year last year, but a lot more needs to be done.”
Learmonth estimates that for Australia to achieve its renewables target, about 3.6 GW of large-scale renewable energy needs to be brought online each year.
“It is a big challenge,” he said. “Last year we installed about 2.5 GW of utility scale wind and solar.”
Learmonth said developers and investors had faced numerous challenges in the past year including inflationary issues, supply chain shortages and grid constraints, noting that the CEFC is using its capital to help “deal with some of these issues and stimulate investment in renewables.”
“This has included responding to market headwinds in capex, interest rates and foreign exchange, with our capital accelerating project delivery and underpinning offtake agreements to aid proponents in navigating challenging market conditions,” he said. “Our finance is also backing larger projects, in terms of capital and generation capacity, a positive signal of investor and developer appetite in the required large-scale investments.”
In the 2022-23 financial year the CEFC committed $1.9 billion to transactions with a total value of $11.7 billion. The CEFC said each $1 of capital had attracted an additional $5.02 in private sector capital.
The CEFC also commenced early work on the $19 billion Rewiring the Nation program which is designed to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy.
Learmonth said he expects to announce the first Rewiring the Nation investment transactions within the next year.
The $19 billion initiative forms part of an additional $20.5 billion capital allocation approved by the federal government in 2022-23, the first increase since the CEFC was established in 2012.
Since its inception, the CEFC has invested $12.7 billion, taking lifetime total transaction value to $48.8 billion. The CEFC said its investments in large-scale renewables and transmission-related projects have contributed to transactions with a total value of $18.8 billion.
Capital returned to the CEFC in 2022-23 was $1.2 billion, taking lifetime repayments and returns to more than $4.5 billion.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/21/cimic-subsidiary-snaps-up-250-mw-queensland-solar-project/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 21, 2023",Cimic subsidiary snaps up 250 MW Queensland solar project,"Pacific Partnerships, a subsidiary of the Sydney-headquartered construction and engineering firm Cimic Group, has acquired the 250 MW (300 MWdc) Hopeland Solar Farm being developed near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region.
The project, which is now likely to include a 175 MW/350 MWh battery energy storage system, is the second large-scale solar project to be owned and developed by Pacific Partnerships.
Pacific Partnerships, through its energy business Pacific Partnerships Energy, is also developing the 102 MW Glenrowan Solar Farm in northeast Victoria.
Cimic Executive Chairman Juan Santamaria said the purchase of the Hopeland project from Brisbane-based Renewable Energy Partners forms part of the group’s broader plan to establish a portfolio of large-scale renewable generation assets in Australia with Queensland a key focal point.
“Queensland is a strategic focus as we expand our diversified national portfolio of energy and utilities assets and contribute to the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan for 70% of electricity consumption to be sourced from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035,” Santamaria said.
“Cimic is committed to supporting Queensland’s energy transition and developing the large-scale renewable generation assets and infrastructure required to support it.”
The Hopeland Solar Farm is being developed adjacent to Powerlink’s Western Downs 275 kV substation within the Southern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone. The region has close to 2.2 GW of committed renewable energy projects in the pipeline while a further 11 GW of renewable energy has been targeted.
Pacific Partnerships Managing Director Simon Nicholls said the project location lends itself to the addition of battery energy storage.
“The solar farm will have the potential to generate enough independent electricity to power approximately 100,000 average-sized homes in Queensland,” he said. “And its strategic location close to Western Downs substation makes it ideal for co-location of a potential 175 MW/350 MWh battery energy storage system.”
Pacific Partnerships, which will develop and manage the Hopeland facility, said it has already commenced early works on the project and is teaming with fellow Cimic offshoot UGL to support this phase.
It is anticipated the Hopeland Solar Farm will commence operations in 2026.

The state planning agency said that China would have a “basically mature” full-process recycling system for wind turbines and solar panels by the end of the decade.
China’s new energy sector, which covers wind, solar, battery, and other emerging energy technologies, will face a problem of “mass decommissioning of equipment” as industry upgrades accelerate, the state agencies said. The country is set to retire about 250 GW of solar panels and 280 GW of wind turbines by 2040, according to Greenpeace.
Wind and solar manufacturers should design equipment that is lightweight and easy to disassemble and recycle, according to the NDRC’s guidelines. Renewable energy generators will also be responsible for decommissioning end-of-life equipment and will not be allowed to discard or bury the waste in landfill sites, it added.
