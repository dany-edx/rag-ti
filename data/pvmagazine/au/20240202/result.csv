Fluence President and Chief Executive Officer Julian Nebreda said energy storage technology providers and developers in Australia have navigated significant challenges, including increasingly complex grid connection requirements, to kick start a new industry.
Having played a key role in that development, Fluence is now looking beyond hardware, offering renewable energy and storage asset owners optimisation software that maximises asset performance and servicing.
“We are continuously scouting for innovations that can create value for our existing customers and open up new segments for energy storage,” he said, adding that “customers are exploring new revenue streams like network support contracts, creative offtake structures, and cycling strategies, as well as performance guarantees to support these.”
Nebreda said tools like the Mosaic automated bidding software and the cloud-based Nispera asset performance management software platform are helping asset owners improve bidding strategies and operations.
“These solutions drive value and allow owners and operators to maximise revenue,” he said.

Fluence has an extensive track record and robust pipeline in Australia. The company deployed its first asset here, a 30 MW / 30 MWh system near Ballarat in Victoria, in 2018. It now has 1,030 MW / 1,830 MWh of projects operating or under construction in Australia. The most recent is the 300 MW / 650 MWh Mortlake Power Station Battery being developed by Origin Energy in Victoria.
Nebreda said Australia remains one of the key markets for Fluence globally, noting that while it is “challenging and fast-moving”, the market fundamentals for battery-based energy storage are increasingly strong.
“Australia is experiencing one of the most rapid shifts towards clean energy worldwide, especially due to the need to replace its aging fleet of coal-fired power plants and its privileged abundant renewable resources,” he said.
“With one of the longest and stringiest grids, addressing major stability issues is crucial. Large-scale energy storage deployment helps make this energy transition smoother, more cost-efficient, and reliable.”
Utility-scale energy storage has emerged as a linchpin of a modern, sustainable, and resilient power grid and Nebreda said it will be “absolutely critical” following the agreement reached at the recent COP28 meeting to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030.
“The only proven and economic way to incorporate that level of intermittent energy is to utilise utility-scale energy storage systems to enable this large percentage of renewable energy to be integrated onto the power grid,” he said.
Lithium-ion technology currently dominates the utility-scale storage industry and Nebreda expects that to continue but said the company remains open to new technologies and developments.
“These innovations can take many forms, such as extensions to existing lithium-ion batteries, the connected ‘digital battery,’ and even novel non-lithium-based battery chemistries, such as sodium-ion,” he said.
Nebreda said battery technology will continue to improve, including in performance, costs, ease of deployment, and potentially new architectures but he expects the main advancements will come via improvements in lithium-ion based systems.
“This will allow for greater flexibility in how the batteries are operated to maximise the benefit for the grid, such as degradation curves based on the actual operation of the battery system,” he said, noting that the technology is currently the most cost-effective solution that provides the most value to its customers.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/02/commissioning-process-spoils-improvements-in-solar-project-timelines/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,POLICY,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,2024-02-02,Commissioning process spoils improvements in solar project timelines,"New research published by the Western Sydney University (WSU) shows that there has been a decrease in lead times for solar projects in Australia but the time taken for the commissioning process has increased from three months to six months.
The study, published in Energy Economics, investigated the lead times for 170 onshore wind and solar projects completed in Australia between 2000 and 2023. The researchers focused on the pre-construction and approvals stage (including site selection, feasibility assessments, planning approvals, and environmental approvals), and then the construction and commissioning stages.
The study found that there has been a notable improvement in overall lead times with solar projects that commenced before 2010 requiring an average of 83 months from ideation to commissioning. This decreased to 41 months for those projects that commenced after 2016.
While the overall time required to deliver a project decreased – which implies that the approval process improved – the study found that there was an increase in building and commissioning lead times from 14 to 21 months, due mainly to longer commissioning periods.
“There is evidence of increased lead times for existing projects that are nearing completion, especially for solar projects where this step used to take about three months but has increased to six months or more,” Report co-author Thomas Longden said.
“A couple of recent solar projects have taken more than a year for this final step.”
Longden, a Senior Research Fellow at WSU’s Urban Transformations Research Centre, said one issue that has increased lead times in Australia was the 2017 change to how renewables projects are tested, introduced as a response to the South Australia statewide blackout of 2016.
On average, commissioning took up to seven months longer after the changes were implemented.

With only 71 months until 2030, Longden warned that any delays in project development means Australia is at risk of missing its end-of-decade goals, notably an 82% use of renewable energy across the power system.
“These lead times indicate that the window for meeting our 2030 renewable energy targets is closing,” he said. “With 40-to-50-month lead times, most of the required projects would need to start being planned in the next couple of years.”
It is estimated that 10,000 kilometres of new transmission, 44 GW of new renewables and 15 GW of firming capacity needs to be delivered this decade to meet the target.
The report suggests that one way to expedite the delivery of renewables projects would be for all states to adopt a ‘one-stop shop’ approach for applications.
“This should include maximum response times for authorities to assess each step of the process,” Longden said. “Allowing suitable projects to be treated as expansions of existing sites could also improve administrative procedures.”
Some recent projects had lower lead times as they were built in multiple stages using the same or a similar set of approvals. This approach of modifying a previous approval has already been used when approving grid-scale batteries as a co-located asset.
A similar study of 48 countries was completed by Swiss scientists, which found average commissioning times have increased over the past two decades for all clean energy technologies, concluding although PV required the least time to commission, deployment of utility scale solar plants increased between 2015 to 2022.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/02/eastern-australia-gas-demand-fell-in-2023-q4-more-declines-to-come/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,2024-02-02,"Eastern Australia gas demand fell in 2023 Q4, more declines to come","The trend of falling gas demand is one that we at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) expect to continue as more of the energy system electrifies, and as batteries provide more competition to gas-fired power plants for providing firming power to the increasing share of renewable energy providing electricity.
Yet the long-held dominant narrative is that eastern Australia is facing gas shortages and that we need new gas supply. This was perpetuated over the years by the gas industry body Australian Energy Producers AEP and the regular reports from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). Although no gas shortage has eventuated.
However, the market sentiment may be changing. The last two ACCC reports through its long-running gas inquiry have concluded that there will be a gas surplus in eastern Australia this calendar year. The latest gas data from AEMO’s Quarterly Energy Dynamics Q4 2023 report showed that the 16% fall in domestic demand equated to an 11 PJ decline to 57.5 PJ in the December quarter. This means that domestic demand comprises an even smaller part of the total eastern Australia demand with gas feedstock for the three LNG export plants at Gladstone, Queensland accounting for 83% of total demand.
So, talk of domestic shortages have nothing to do with a shortage of gas. It is a shortage of adequate provisions for secure domestic supply.
The remaining 3.8% of eastern Australia demand is gas used for power generation, which dropped by 5% in the latest quarter to 16.8 PJ from 17.8 PJ a year earlier. This decline counters another narrative of gas producers is that gas is a transition fuel to back up renewables whereas the market is saying something different.
AEMO gave a brief summary of the weaker gas demand, saying that in the domestic market there were large falls in demand from AEMO markets (-11  PJ) (this is residential, commercial and industrial demand), and a small decrease in gas-fired generation (-1 PJ). All markets experienced lower demand, with the largest decrease of 5PJ in Victoria’s declared wholesale gas market (DWGM) due to warmer temperatures combined with lower commercial and industrial demand.
In Brisbane, volumes recorded a decrease of 4.5 PJ, primarily due to the shutdown of Incitec Pivot’s Gibson Island facility in January 2023. Obviously, it is unfortunate that some of Australia’s manufacturing capacity is due to the inability to secure reasonable energy prices.
IEEFA is of the view that more can be done on the demand side. The Victorian and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) governments have embarked on this part of the energy equation, which until now has been dominated by supply side debate. In 2022, the Victorian government released its first Gas Substitution Roadmap (GSR) – a first step in planning the transition away from fossil gas.
The roadmap signalled the Victorian government’s recognition that electrification is a cost-effective decarbonisation option for households. Nevertheless, despite these initiatives there are still forecasts of gas shortage by the end of the decade, largely due to the decline in supplies from the Gippsland basin offshore Victoria.
In AEMO’s 2023 Gas Statement of Opportunities (GSOO), it forecast that southern regions could face annual shortages of domestic gas supply as early as 2027. They forecast a cumulative 1,389 PJ of supply from 2027-2042 that is unsecured.
This estimate is based on AEMO’s Orchestrated Step Change scenario, which assumes investments in electrification increase at a pace beyond current levels. If such an increase does not eventuate, residential fossil gas demand could be much higher – as seen in AEMO’s No Electrification sensitivity.
However, if all household gas appliances were converted to electric at end of life, the cumulative gas supply shortage is greatly reduced, to just over 1,000 PJ (or around 66 PJ a year). This is 53% lower than in No electrification, and 22% lower than in Orchestrated Step Change. It also delays the onset of the annual supply gap, with the first material gap not observed until 2029 or two years after AEMO currently sees the shortages emerge.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/02/transgrid-unveils-preferred-route-for-vni-west-project/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",ALEISHA HEY,2024-02-02,Transgrid unveils preferred route for VNI West project,"Network operator Transgrid is calling for community feedback after unveiling its preferred route for the VNI West interconnector, a proposed new 500 kV double circuit transmission line connecting the high-voltage electricity grids in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria.
Transgrid is responsible for the NSW component of the project. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and Transmission Company Victoria (TCV) are responsible for the Victorian stretch of the $3.6 billion (USD 2.16 billion) 800-kilometre project.
The preferred route for the NSW component would see the interconnector weave its way west from the Dinawan substation in the Murray River region before turning south around of the town of Moulamein and wending its way to Murrabit on the NSW/Victoria border. From there it will snake its way south to the town of Bulgana in central Victoria.
The recommended preferred route, Route C, is one of four short-listed routes detailed in the newly published draft route report.

Transgrid said the route, the northern most option, best caters to local constraints identified by stakeholders and the community and will have the lowest impact on irrigated agricultural lands.
“[Route C] provides the greatest opportunity to co-locate the new transmission line with existing infrastructure assets, like railway corridors and roads minimising the need for building extensive new access tracks and maximising land use efficiency,” it said.
The network operator said the route has a comparable length to the other options considered and allows for the straightest alignment compared to the other route options, reducing construction and maintenance costs.
Transgrid Project Director Colin Mayer said the draft route report outlines all options, and details the benefits and risks for each.
“We strongly encourage people to review the information and provide us with their feedback on this critical transmission project,” he said.
Feedback is sought by 4 March 2024.
Transgrid said the final route will be confirmed in late March, signalling the start of studies to assess environmental and social impacts as part of the formal environmental assessment and approvals process.
Planning is also continuing on the Victorian stretch of the project with TCV having published a report in October showing the draft corridor for the Victorian component of the transmission line project. TCV has narrowed the area of interest for the proposed transmission line to width of about two kilometres.
TCV Project Director Sam Magee said the corridor, which runs from the Murray River through to Bulgana, will be narrowed considerably through ongoing consultation over the next two years, from an average width of about 2km to an easement of 70 metres to 120 metres.
“We recognise that VNI West has created uncertainty in communities and has been stressful for many people. We’d like to thank all those involved who continue to provide information to reduce the impact of this new transmission line,” he said.
The project is expected to be implemented by 2028.

An international group of scientists investigated the use of silicon dioxide (SiO2) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) as an anti-reflection coating for polycrystalline silicon solar cells.
“The primary objective of anti-reflective coatings is to minimize the reflection loss, so enhancing the absorption properties by the semiconductor material, often silicon, and facilitating its conversion into electrical energy,” the academics explained. “This is essential for increasing solar cell efficiency.”
In addition, they have also tested the effect of a mixed SiO2-ZrO2 coating, with a ratio of 1:1, on the cell performances.
For their research, the group purchased polycrystalline Si solar cells measuring 5.0 cm × 4.0 cm with an efficiency of 14.4%. Then, they coated them with either SiO2, ZrO2, or SiO2-ZrO2 using the radiofrequency (RF) sputter coating technique.
“To ensure a nearly uniform distribution, the mixture underwent mechanical grinding with a mortar and pestle for approximately 120 minutes,” they highlighted.
The RF sputter coating technique utilises radiofrequency energy to generate plasma and sputter material from a target onto a substrate. In the process described in this study, argon gas was ionized to form a plasma during the sputtering process. The coating process lasted 45 m at room temperature.
Following the coating of the three cells, the academics assessed light absorption and transmittance and compared their performance with that of uncoated reference cells.
Based on the results of an I–V measurement, the uncoated cell’s power conversion efficiency was 14.4%, while that of the SiO2-ZrO2 sample was 17.6%. The SiO2-only sample had an efficiency of 15.6%, and the ZrO2 had 16.7%.
“The root mean square (RMS) values of roughness for SiO2, ZrO2, and SiO2–ZrO2 blend coated solar cells were measured at 35.42 nm, 47.47 nm, and 62.36 nm respectively,” the researchers said. “The increased surface roughness may also serve to reduce the reflection loss potentially and enhance optical transmittance.”
The anti-reflective coating was presented in the paper “Surface engineering of Sio2-Zro2 films for augmenting power conversion efficiency performance of silicon solar cells,” published in the Journal of Materials Research and Technology.
The research was conducted by scientists from Saudi Arabia’s Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, and Qassim University, as well as from India’s Kongu Engineering College and Velalar College of Engineering and Technology. The group also included researchers from Thailand’s King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok and Egypt’s National Research Centre.

The round was led by New Zealand-headquartered software company Gentrack, with a $12 million investment. The raise also saw Netherlands-headquartered venture capital fund Rubio Impact Ventures join existing shareholders NRMA, Alberts, Square Peg, Main Sequence and the Commonwealth Bank, which nabbed a 23% stake in Amber with a $20 million investment during the Series B raise in 2021.
Melbourne-based Amber gives customers direct access to the real-time wholesale electricity price and the technology to automate smart devices in their homes, including home batteries and EVs, to use more cheap, renewable power when it’s available in the grid, and sell their excess renewable energy back to the grid.
The company said its customer base has doubled in the past six months to 30,000.
Amber co-founder and co-Chief Executive Office Dan Adams said the funds from the latest investment round will accelerate the company’s ambition of maximising and expanding the number of markets it can reach with its technology.
“We’ve received significant interest from overseas utilities to license our software,” he said. “We are now at the stage where we are ready to license our technology globally.”

Adams said the capital will be used to support Amber’s growth in Australia, to release a planned EV-to-grid automation product and to start licensing its technology to utilities internationally via a white labelling scheme through Gentrack’s utility customer network globally.
Part of the funds will be used to upgrade Gentrack’s billing and CRM system.
Gentrack Chief Executive Officer Gary Miles said Amber, which launched publicly in late 2019, is in some ways leading the transition to a two-way grid.
“Bundling Amber’s award-winning technology, which allows customers to reduce their bills, and even make money from their own electricity generation, with our seamless integrated billing and customer care platform, is a product international utilities are extremely keen to take advantage of,” he said. “It is a team and technology that we are excited to invest in and take globally.”
