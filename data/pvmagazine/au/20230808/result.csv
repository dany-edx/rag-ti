The companies said the 2.5 GW framework agreement aims to explore opportunities for the expansion of Indonesia’s renewable energy supply chain with the components slated for both domestic and export markets. They will also be used in Vena’s solar-storage project being developed at Batam in the Riau Islands in the nation’s west.
Vena, which has commissioned five solar and onshore wind projects totalling 114 MW in Indonesia, said the Batam solar power plant is to have a capacity of up to 2 GW and will be coupled with battery systems with a potential storage capacity of more than 8 GWh.
Vena Energy Chief Executive Officer Nitin Apte said clean energy generated by the plant will be exported from Batam to Singapore, which is only 30 nautical miles away, with the company having inked a deal with global energy giant Shell.
Apte said the company has signed a “collaboration agreement” with Shell for the “cross-border supply” of renewable energy generated by the proposed hybrid megaproject.

Although Vena has yet to provide timeline details for the Batam project, the establishment of local production lines for solar panel and energy storage system components is expected to play a key role in its delivery.
Apte said the companies aim to “significantly contribute” to the development of a productive domestic supply chain in the renewable energy sector. He said the strategy will foster industrial expansion and open export opportunities, as well as support Indonesia’s energy transition plan.
For Suntech, the agreement builds upon an already established presence in Indonesia.
The Chinese manufacturer is already operating a 500 MW capacity solar module factory in Batam. Suntech said it expects the collaboration with Vena would significantly increase that factory’s capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/08/blackrock-links-with-nz-on-2-billion-clean-energy-strategy/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2023",BlackRock links with NZ on $2 billion clean energy strategy,"New Zealand has struck a deal with United States multinational BlackRock to develop a climate infrastructure fund with the goal of super charging investments in clean energy technology and making the nation one of the first in the world to transition to a 100% renewable energy-powered electricity grid.
NZ Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said “the first of its kind” net zero fund demonstrated the “huge economic potential of New Zealand being a climate leader and our goal of generating 100% renewable electricity.”
“This is a game changer for the clean tech sector,” Hipkins said. “This fund is a massive opportunity for New Zealand innovators to develop and grow companies.”
“I am absolutely stoked that we’ve been able to secure this world-leading investment in New Zealand businesses and it’s proof of our ambitious climate targets having the world’s attention.”
New Zealand has an 83% renewable energy penetration rate but BlackRock has estimated the transition to a 100% renewable electricity mix will require investment running to NZ$42 billion in renewable power generation and distribution, as well as battery storage.

Hipkins said the climate infrastructure fund will mean renewable energy intellectual properties can be developed in New Zealand, laying a broader foundation for the country’s energy transition.
“It’s the exact type of government and private-sector climate partnership that’s central to my vision for action on climate, partnering with and supporting industry to solve the climate crisis is a no-brainer,” he said.
“This investment will be a boon for Kiwi businesses and it will make New Zealand a hub for renewable tech expertise.”
BlackRock Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Fink said the fund is the largest single-country low-carbon transition investment initiative the investment management firm has created to date.
“It will enable New Zealand companies to access greater pools of capital to build out climate infrastructure across the country’s energy system including in wind power, solar power, battery storage, electric vehicle charging, and natural capital projects,” he said.
While no details have been provided about the net zero fund’s launch date, NZ Energy Minister Megan Woods said the fund will look to crowd in investment from Crown companies and entities, including superannuation funds, and private sector funds.
Woods said the fund will provide businesses in the clean energy sector with access to capital that will enable them to develop and grow.
“We’ve already making significant progress on New Zealand’s decarbonisation transition. This arrangement means we will get there faster,” she said. “This fund will allow New Zealand to go further and faster.”
For BlackRock, the initiative builds on its entry into the New Zealand clean energy market which was announced in September 2022 with the acquisition of NZ rooftop solar and battery energy storage specialist SolarZero.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/08/rooftop-solar-system-average-size-climbs-above-9-kw/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2023",Rooftop solar system average size climbs above 9 kW,"The size of rooftop solar installations is continuing to trend upwards with Australian Energy Council (AEC) analysis of the Clean Energy Regulator’s (CER) latest Quarterly Carbon Market Report revealing that the average size of a rooftop PV system installed in Australia in the second quarter of 2023 was 9.3 kW. This is up on the Q1 2023 average of 8.7 kW and well above the acknowledged norm of 6.6 kW.
Households in the Northern Territory installed some of the largest rooftop systems rolled out in the second quarter, with systems hitting a high of 14.1 kW during the 1 April to 30 June 2023 period. Queensland and South Australia were next with average system size in both states reaching 10.1 kW during the term.
The AEC said the growth of system size continues a trend seen in recent years with Australian households and businesses keen to take advantage of technology advancements and decreasing costs in the market in their search for greater energy independence.
At the end of the second quarter, Australia’s total installed solar rooftop capacity had reached 20.5 GW with more than 61,000 new installations added to the grid in the three months with a total installed capacity of 520 MW.
The number of installations is down on the 80,300 rooftop PV systems installed in Q1 2023 but the AEC said it expects the Q2 figures will be revised upwards, noting that the data reporting has a 12-month lag.
“Based on projections, the final figures are expected to be even higher, with approximately 91,000 new rooftop installations expected to be recorded by the end of the reporting period,” it said. “This surge in installations is also projected to lead to a total installed capacity of 827 MW, further indicating the growing adoption of rooftop solar solutions in the second quarter of 2023.”

New South Wales (NSW) homeowners led Australia in terms of newly installed rooftop solar systems, with 33.1% of the national total for the quarter. It was followed by Queensland and Victoria with 26.1% and 17% of the total installations respectively.
The AEC said the improved take-up came despite increasing interest rates which is estimated to have pushed out the payback period for solar systems by 12 months.

The robot can move on the panel rows independently and does not require human assistance. It is also able to recharge itself via solar panels and return to its docking station at the end of the journey.
The SandStorm system is equipped with a system of brushes that act as the cleaning force.
“The approach normally adopted involves cleaning the surfaces with pressure washers or tractors equipped with hydraulic brushes; both cases entail water consumption and gas emissions from the motor vehicles used,” Enel Green Power said. “Sturdy and versatile, SandStorm adapts – when necessary – even to the non-homogeneous alignment of the trackers of the panels, managing to move independently from one row of panels to the adjacent one.”
Enel Green Power has already tested the system at its Innovation LabEGP research center of Passo Martino, near Catania, and then on an industrial scale in a 1 MW section of a PV plant it operates in Totana, Spain.
“Today EGP is scaling up the application of this technology with an initial contract for the implementation of around 150 robots in two Spanish PV plants, Totana and Las Corchas, for a total capacity of 135 MW,” the company said.
