This is a rather unfortunate truth and one which industry generally prefer to overlook, at least when there aren’t many alternatives.
Vulcan Energy Resources, listed on the Australian stock exchange (ASX), however, believes it has found just that alternative – a method which has minimal environmental disruption and leaves behind infrastructure for ongoing renewable heating. 
“We basically designed this process with existing technologies, but we were careful to exclude fossil fuels,” the company’s managing director and cofounder Francis Wedin told pv magazine Australia. 
A geologist who initially worked in Australia’s gold mining sector before becoming intrigued by lithium in 2014, Wedin’s years spent examining ways to get the material using geothermal resources are now coming to fruition.
The company he cofounded with geothermal expert Horst Kreuter, based in Germany, has been running its pilot plant for over a year now and is currently building its demonstration plant, which Wedin says will mimic the scope of the real life project it is pursuing in Germany’s Upper Rhine region. “So there’s a lithium extraction demonstration plant and there’s the lithium processing to produce the end product,” Wedin says.
Despite being early days, Vulcan has already attracted not only Stellantis, with which it has a large offtake agreement extending to 2035, but LG Energy Solution, Volkswagen, Reno, and Belgian battery cathode specialist Umicore, all of which have secured offtake agreements for Vulcan’s future output.
In short, interest in Vulcan’s lithium is already well oversubscribed, much like its capital raises.
Precisely what goes into getting battery minerals out of the ground can make people a little skittish. It often isn’t pretty, so we tend to instead focus on the technologies those products will go on to produce.
The lithium we use today largely come from two main sources: hard rock mining and brines. Australia is home to much of this hard rock mining, a high energy (and therefore high carbon footprint) process which pollutes its sites. The other option, mostly done in what’s known as the ‘lithium triangle’ in South America, involves evaporating lithium-rich brines. This is water intensive and usually uses polluting regents and gas for heating.

Vulcan’s process also involves brines, albeit in a different way. Its process has three main components, the first of which involves pretty stock standard geothermal plants. Geothermal plants are longstanding and commonplace around the world, providing significant amounts of energy in places like Indonesia and some parts of the US. 
Where geothermal is used depends on where reservoirs of hot fluid below the earth’s surface can be found. Basically generating geothermal energy involves drilling down into this hot liquid and using it heat up a secondary fluid, the steam from which drives a turbine which creates electricity. 
“You can also, and this is increasingly what we’re planning to do… use it for heating as opposed to power,” Wedin says, noting using the resources specifically for heating rather than electricity incurs less conversion losses, making it more efficient.
One of Europe’s greatest geothermal resources is found in the Upper Rhine, which sits across the south west of Germany and into France. This is what Vulcan wants to tap into, not just because Wedin believes heating is “the elephant in the room in terms of decarbonisation,” but also because the fluid found in the Upper Rhine is very lithium rich.
Vulcan Energy Resources
Vulcan is already operating a geothermal plant in the Upper Rhine, and in April signed a contract to supply up to 350 GWh of energy per year to the city of Mannheim, in Germany’s southwest.
It’s envisioned future, though, will see it extract the lithium from the “hot, briny, lithium-rich fluid” before reinjecting it back into the Rhine in (crucially) a closed loop system. 
“In this case, we divert the brine first through what we call an absorption plant and there the brine runs through a series of tanks,” Wedin explains. “The tanks are loaded with a type of absorbent. A bit like what’s used in water treatment, it’s an alumina-based resin. Basically, there’s lithium chloride within the brine and the lithium chloride adsorbs onto the resin. So it’s a Physicochemical process, it needs heat to work and the brine needs to be about 60 to 80 degrees.”
In the Upper Rhine, the brine “comes preheated,” as Wedin says. “That’s kind of advantage one.”

Pure water is then used to strip the resin of the lithium and reverse osmosis used to evaporate the excess water. “We use some of the steam from the geothermal plant to drive a forced evaporation process,” Wedin says. “So that’s advantage two.”
After all that, Vulcan is left with a lithium chloride concentrate which gets sent to a chemical plant. Importantly, the one Vulcan intends to use is situated just outside of Frankfurt, less than 100 kilometres away – a significantly shorter distance for processing than, say, Australia to China – the more usual route.

Wedin is eager to emphasise that Vulcan has focused on using existing methods and technologies for its processes, but notes that while all the components so far are commercially used already, the final step of lithium electrolysis is more novel.
“Lithium electrolysis not currently used commercially, but it’s very similar to the chloralkali industry,” he says. Essentially the company will use electrolysis cells, pretty much the same cells used by the chloralkali industry, to create the final lithium hydroxide product. 
Vulcan has chosen this method over the more traditional reagent process because it has both a lower carbon footprint and reduces its costs. “We wanted to use electrolysis because we can use green power, green electricity,” Wedin says.

Because of the structure of Vulcan’s process, its project is not one massive entity, but rather involves building a series of geothermal plants which will feed into the nearby chemical plant.
“So we’re able to grow in quite a modular fashion,” Wedin says. That is, the more plants it builds, the more it will increase its lithium output, giving it the capacity to scale with industry growth.
The fact that the Upper Rhine isn’t a single destination but rather a region which stretches deep underground (the wells Vulcan will drill are roughly between 2.5 to 5 kilometres deep) also means the plants can built anywhere within a wide radius. 
“We don’t have to destroy any nature,” Wedin says, noting the plants could, for instance, be planned in former industrial areas or other locations where local communities see fit.

In 50 years, when there is enough lithium in the system for it to simply be recycled, Wedin adds the infrastructure left behind by Vulcan’s endeavours can continue being used for ongoing heating and electricity in the local area. “So it fits in with a circular economy ideal.”
While the line Vulcan is selling its lithium on is ‘zero carbon lithium,’ Wedin thinks the process goes further than that. “We’ve designed it so we have a net negative carbon footprint because we’re exporting energy to the grid and displacing fossil fuels.”
In terms of what happens to the lithium, Wedin says the company’s idea was always to sell to either European-based businesses or companies with a specific focus on the region.
“We see markets as being much more localised in future,” he says, noting that geographically long supply chains have questionable relevance in a sustainable world.
Stellantis will be the project’s largest offtaker, and it is also the company’s second largest shareholder now. The $76 million (USD 47.8 million) of equity capital it invected into Vulcan this week will go towards to developing the drilling sites of the project.

In terms of what’s next for Vulcan, Wedin said the company is “going as quickly as possible.”
It’s currently working on its definitive feasibility study, also known as the bankable feasibility study. This is especially crucial for the project because while it is operationally forecast to be in the lowest cost quartile, Wedin says, “to get to that point, we need a large amount of capital.”
“So it’s high CAPEX, low OPEX basically.”
The roaring interest in offtake has definitely helped its financing prospects though, and Wedin says Vulcan is now seeking to expand its output. Its pre-feasibility study forecast a lithium hydroxide output of 40,000 tonnes, but in the feasibility study that number has been upped – though he wouldn’t say exactly how far.
Vulcan Energy Resources
The company is also continuing to deepen its “strategic alliances” across the supply chain “because this is a big complex infrastructure project.”
“Stellantis was one, we are speaking to others,” Wedin adds, saying automakers, chemical companies and energy companies are all in the mix.
Vulcan’s demonstration plant is expected to be coming online towards the end of the year, with the lithium extraction component set for Q4, while the lithium electrolysis facilities should be commissioned by Q1, 2023.
The company today has 130 employees, many of which have been gained from strategic acquisitions of geothermal and other lithium companies. Of those, Wedin estimates 95% are based in Germany.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/29/how-the-new-round-of-sres-changes-will-alter-the-makeup-of-australias-solar-industry/,"LEGAL,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 29, 2022",How the new round of SRES changes will alter the makeup of Australia’s solar industry,"Commonwealth government agency the Clean Energy Regulator this morning held a webinar outlining more changes coming up for Australia’s solar industry which it says are designed to ensure integrity. The second round of changes involve two main prongs: industry accreditations and product approval lists.
Formerly, industry body the Clean Energy Council (CEC) has been in charge of both of these aspects of the small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES), essentially Australia’s federal solar rebate program, and it will remain in that role for the time being. 
However, after taking over some of the CEC’s roles to become the sole regulator of the SRES last year, the government-run Clean Energy Regulator is now planning to offload more of the Council’s responsibilities.
This, it noted, is being done in accordance with the amendments passed into law last year as a result of the government’s Integrity Review of the Rooftop Solar PV Sector.
Basically, in future, installers and designers will (probably) no longer be CEC accredited, but rather that accreditation and the little stamp that comes with it will be from a different body, or bodies potentially. Whether CEC will still be folks publishing the lists of panels and inverters those installers can use is still to be decided, but the Regulator is encouraging the industry to let them know their thoughts on this, holding a consultation period sometime before the end of the year.*
Sometime between this Friday and March 31, 2023, the Regulator will open up applications to decide who will take over responsibility for solar accreditations. 
It seems unlikely the Regulator will be opening the market for that in the next few weeks though, as it appears to still be in the process of drawing up the rules and framework any body pursuing the role would need to work within.
Which is kind of the thing here: while a separate organisation would manage the scheme, including running the processes involved with gaining accreditation and making that list public, they would be working within a guidance set by the Regulator. 
The Regulator has opted for this design so it’s able to ensure integrity of the scheme, without it actually managing the scheme itself, which is not permitted under Australia’s current regulatory framework.
Once the framework and guidelines for the accreditation scheme has been finalised by the Regulator, it will open applications and eventually award a contract to the successful applicant or applicants.
It’s worth noting that technically, CEC could win back the contract with the Regulator, in which case it would continue in its role as accreditation manager. 
However, the Regulator has flagged its openness to awarding the contract to several different bodies – a pathway which could create competitiveness and lower costs, Jessica Edwards, The Regulator’s SRES Reform manager said during the webinar.
The Regulator wouldn’t give any firm date on when it plans to open applications, but it did note the application period will last three months and it included what kind of information it expects organisations to include in applications (slide below).
Any organisations wishing to apply will need to set out how they plan to structure fees as part of their application.* This includes whether they would recoup the scheme management costs exclusively from solar industry participants or seek some financial support from the government.
The Regulator has said it will select a scheme manager which is able to provide the best service at the lowest cost.

Coming back to the Regulator finalising the rules and framework for accreditation, Edwards said her team is particularly “keen” to engage with state and territory electrical safety regulators while they are in this process (so, right now), because there are intersections between the federal SRES scheme and electrical standards put in place by states and territories.
“It is especially helpful for us to understand further details on the interconnections between their roles and responsibilities and the solar accreditation framework that we will be setting,” Edwards said.
Specifically, the Regulator is interested in how elements of the current SRES framework, like mandatory solar installer onsite attendance, the number of installs completed by accredited installers per day, solar array to inverter ratios, which are technically additional to electrical standards but which impact STC eligibility, could be better arranged.
The second component of the upcoming changes is whether the body responsible for listing approved solar panels and inverters should change. Unlike the accreditation changes, this remains a big ‘if’.
That is, the Regulator is not yet sure if CEC should continue in this role and is currently preparing to open a period of consultation for the solar industry. While no firm date has been set, the consultation period must open before January 1, 2023, though in all likelihood it will open before then.

Since it is currently very focussed on consultation, speakers from the Regulator were hesitant to confirm whether, if another body were to take over this role, it would involve actually choosing which equipment gained approval and running tests, or whether it would simply involve publishing and keeping these product lists up to date.
“It wouldn’t be fair for us to preempt any of those details,” Edwards noted, which neither confirm nor denies how expansive the scope of the role could be.
The consultation process, the Regulator said, will inform whether it approaches the market to take over this role, but if industry stakeholders are happy with CEC’s work, it will continue.
Holding a question and answer session during the webinar, a number of viewers asked the Regulator whether the approved equipment listings would include batteries. The short answer is no. 
Since batteries currently do not fall under the SRES scheme, and are therefore not eligible for rebates in the form of STCs, the listing would exclusively cover solar modules and inverters.
The Regulators did, however, note that it does keep voluntary records on batteries and indicated it would probably continue to do so.
The first round of changes to Australia’s SRES scheme were introduced by the Regular this April. They involved minor modifications for installers and manufacturers, with the biggest impacts felt among retailers. 
That is, from April solar retailers need to make formal declarations that every system it sells is going to perform as promised and meet standards when filing for STCs. There were also changes to the written paperwork for installers, though they amount to small changes like including photographic evidence of being on site.
The changes also saw a new requirement for all solar panels and inverters to have their serial numbers recorded in a Clean Energy Regulator ledger.
* This article was amended on July 4 to clarify the Regulator will open the consultation period on equipment approval listing before January 1, rather than until then. Amendments regarding the fees involved with managing the solar accreditation scheme were also made, as the previous version had stated no fees would be involved which was incorrect.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/29/single-axis-trackers-on-commercial-rooftops-increase-generation-by-37/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"JUNE 29, 2022",Single-axis trackers on commercial rooftops increase generation by 37%,"From pv magazine USA
Alion Energy’s single-axis tracker racking product was originally designed to be deployed in regions where heavy installation equipment was more challenging to access, but labor might be more available.
One aspect of this design philosophy is that the system is light and can be easily carried and assembled, and doesn’t require metal pilings to be driven deep into the ground. And interestingly, this carries over to commercial rooftops.
Mark Kingsley, Alion Energy CEO, said in a post on LinkedIn that a commercial real estate group had installed a standard rooftop, 10-degree fixed tilt monofacial solar array, as well as a competing Alion Energy system.
The results were as expected – 37.5% greater generation on a per watt basis from the single-axis tracker, on a pristine white thermoplastic roof versus standard modules. Of course, the real breakthrough is that they were able to get single-axis trackers installed on a commercial rooftop at all.
The rooftop in their example has a lot of skylights, and the overall structure is not facing due south. In this configuration, Alion Energy suggests that it can fit 4.55 MW of modules on the Maryland structure with a standard 10-degree installation. This system is projected to generate 1.34 kWh per watt each year.
Alion has designed a system that is 5.4 MW – a full 18% increase in wattage due to systems ability to be installed directly over skylights without needing the standard setback. Additionally, this hardware is projected to generate 1.54 kWh per watt installed per year.
In this case, that works out to 37% more electricity from the same rooftop. And when the trackers are directly attached to the roof – a 2.15 pounds per square foot dead load. Add in one Alion’s customised robotic cleaners, and the company says the levelised cost of electricity from the system falls to US4.67¢/kWh and generates 40% more electricity than a standard rooftop solar install.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/29/indian-researchers-find-way-to-stop-dendrites-in-solid-state-lithium-batteries/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,INDIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 29, 2022",Indian researchers find way to stop dendrites in solid-state lithium batteries,"Solid-state Li-ion batteries with lithium anodes offer higher energy densities and are safer than conventional liquid electrolyte-based Li-ion batteries. However, a long-standing challenge with solid-state batteries is the growth of lithium dendrites across the solid-state electrolyte layer that leads to the premature shorting of cells and limits their practical viability. The dendrite growth accentuates during fast charging.
Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, have come up with an innovative interfacial engineering approach to enable fast charge-discharge rates in solid-state lithium metal batteries. They have found that nanoscopic refractory metal layers like Tungsten could improve the performance of these batteries by improving dendrite growth tolerance in solid-state electrolytes. 
The researchers performed extensive fundamental electrochemical measurements over several hundreds of solid-state lithium half cells with metallic interlayers between a garnet-based lithium-ion conductor and lithium. After nano-characterisation, they realised that interfacial void growth precedes dendrite nucleation and growth. They identified that the growth of lithium voids during discharge leads to dendrite growth during charge.
The team comprising Vikalp Raj, Victor Venturi, Varun R Kankanallu, Bibhatsu Kuiri, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan, and Naga Phani B Aetukuri found that Li-ion currents were concentrated at the edges of the microscopic voids. The currents at these edges were around 10,000 times larger than average currents in the cell. Hence it is necessary to impede void growth to prevent dendrite growth.
To delay void growth, the researchers experimented with an ultra-thin layer of refractory metals between the lithium anode and the solid electrolyte. They noted that tungsten is an ideal candidate to impede lithium vacancy motion due to its low solubility for lithium and therefore delay void growth. They collaborated with researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to corroborate their work through computational methods. 
The research was carried out under the collaborative energy storage platform between the Indian government’s Department of Science and Technology and the IISc. The Energy Storage Platform on Supercapacitors and Power Dense Devices platform aims to develop and engineer techno-economically viable, power-dense electrochemical energy storage solutions through active collaboration and accelerated technology development.
The team now intends to build on this advance to develop full solid-state cells that could enable charging in less than an hour and offer up to 1,000 or more cycles while withstanding high temperatures of 45 degrees Centigrade or higher.
