According to the company’s managing director, Kevork Sahagian, the company had “grand ambitions” for renewable investment in Australia, but has found the landscape for renewables tricky.
“We’ve intentionally stayed away from the [Renewable Energy Zones]… we see a lot of risk in some of the delays. We’d prefer to focus on opportunities where we can control our own destiny,” Sahagian told the Australian Financial Review Infrastructure Summit in Sydney.

Omers bought a 49% stake in FRV Australia in 2021, a solar and storage developer behind a number of major projects here. Although the company continues to work on projects, currently developing the 250 MW / 500 MWh Gnarwarre battery and the 100 MW / 200 MWh Terang Battery in Victoria, the landscape in Australia has left Omers wanting. 
Specifically, Sahagian pointed to rising interest rates, difficulties finding equipped engineering contractors and, on the flip side, customers willing to commit to power purchasing agreements (PPAs) as reasons why FRV Australia is struggling to close investments.
Compounding this, Sahagian said, was soaring insurance premiums and more expensive equipment costs in Australia.
FRV Australia is jointly owned by Omers and United Arab Emirates-based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy.
In 2022, FRV Australia reached financial close on its 300 MW (AC) Walla Walla Solar Farm in the Riverina region of New South Wales (NSW). That year, it also completed its third Australian solar project, the 100 MW (AC) Lilyvale solar farm in Queensland.
FRV’s Australian portfolio includes the 125 MW Clare Solar Farm in northern Queensland and the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria. It also includes the 69.75 MW Goonumbla and 56 MW Moree solar farms in NSW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/15/nsw-gov-proposes-standard-benefit-sharing-and-revised-approval-pathways-to-accelerate-renewables/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",NSW gov proposes ‘standard’ benefit sharing and revised approval pathways to accelerate renewables,"The New South Wales government has released several new guidelines for large-scale solar, wind, and transmission projects aimed at streamlining and standardising renewable project decisions as the state attempts to rapidly replace outgoing coal plants.
The draft guidelines speak to the state’s ongoing issues around social licence, with the government saying in a formal review published in March that “the friction that is emerging [between communities and renewable proponents] may be the most significant risk to policy success.”

The most pertinent proposals include a “standard” benefit sharing payment for both solar and wind projects, sitting at $850 per megawatt per annum for solar, and $1050 per megawatt per annum for wind. The state government estimates the scheme would provide up to $413 million to host communities over a 25-year period. This scheme does not include the payments to individual landowners hosting projects.
The government is also proposing wind and solar projects which include a “significant energy storage system” could be deemed Critical State Significant Infrastructure, shifting the approval pathway purely to the state government, meaning there less opportunity for projects to be overturned by local opposition. The ballpark for “significant storage” is 750 MW of capacity or more.
The government has also provided two maps charting suitable to non-suitable locations for both solar and wind projects across the state. While the solar map has many possibilities along transmission routes, the potential for wind looks far more desolate, with almost no areas deemed “suitable.”

The draft guidelines will remain on public exhibition until December 18, 2023, with the government urging industry and community to provide feedback. It is aiming to have the finalised guidelines completed by early 2024.
While councils and local communities have been lobbying for greater community benefits, some fear the proposed scheme could undercut ongoing negotiations between developers and councils in the Renewable Energy Zones. For example, the three main local government councils within the Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) –  Warrumbungle, Dubbo, and Mid-Western councils – already have policies stating renewable proponents must provide contributions to the tune of  1.5% of their project’s Capital Investment Value via a Planning Agreement. This contribution over the life of the project aims to offset impacts and disturbances to local communities, including covering the costs of ongoing damage to local roads, other  infrastructure and social services.

A person familiar with  negotiations told pv magazine Australia the state government’s proposed benefit sharing scheme roughly equates to this 1.5% figure that impacted councils have been advocating. The fear is that under the state government’s proposal, some of the benefit sharing income could be paid directly to various ad-hoc community groups which do not have a mandate to maintain shared assets within the district, as a local council does. Moreover, such groups are not covered by the same accountability provisions as local government. 
In other words, there is concern that under the proposed scheme, councils could lose a substantial portion the project’s benefit payments as the funding would be dissipated across various community groups and funnelled into things like local sports clubs.
Councils within the Central West Orana and New England REZs have been working in concert to bolster their position amid an influx of project proposals in their areas. However, councils outside the formal REZs may still have a number of renewable proposals to examine, but lack the know-how to properly assess these and negotiate with developers – making formal, state-backed guidelines helpful.
The other potential issue raised around the draft guidelines is just that – the document is a guideline, not a mandate, meaning renewable proponents would not be actually required to share monetary benefits. 
The guideline is likely the result of ongoing unrest in regional communities who often feel they are the ones bearing the negative impacts of renewable projects, including increased traffic and road damage, increased demands on social services and other community changes. So while the whole state benefits from decarbonisation, the negative impacts are only shouldered by regional populations.
Currently in NSW, renewable energy generation projects are defined as State Significant Developments, and the elevated title of State Significant Infrastructure is usually set aside only for major transmission lines, major roads, rail projects and other major infrastructure.

While local government and communities have an opportunity to examine the adequacy of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for both types of development, Significant Infrastructure projects are in effect mandated by the state government and there is limited scope for councils or the general public to overturn such a development. 
On the other hand, projects deemed State Significant Developments can be tangibly affected by community and council opposition with decisions deferred to the Independent Planning Commission of NSW if the applicable council decides to oppose the project or if more than 50 public objections are lodged in response to the EIS.
This may not sink a project, but it does heavily delay it. Such things likely lay behind the new proposal to deem even solar and wind projects as State Significant Infrastructure if they include 750 MW+ of storage – deemed the most vital technology for actually getting the state to a fully decarbonised grid.
The draft guidelines also outline how noise, visual and other community impacts should be evaluated and managed through the development assessment process.
The government has also put forward a range of draft tools to help landholders considering hosting renewable energy development. Again, this is an attempt to level the playing field with the government in March publishing its review of the renewable sector’s conflicts with agriculture, in which it flagged that farmers and individuals often lack the tools to adequately negotiate with the big companies behind projects.
“These proposed new guidelines will support faster decisions and clearer rules that will increase certainty for the industry and communities,” NSW Minister for Planning and Public Spaces Paul Scully said.

What the project vision involves appears undecided though, with the NT’s Chief Minister, Natasha Fyles, clarifying at the end of the announcement that the memorandum of understanding actually pertains to “scoping” and “investigating” the feasibility of a large scale green energy project over the next two years. This process will include landing on a technology form, with solar, wind, hydrogen and battery energy storage systems all flagged as possibilities within the announcement.
A location for the project is also to be decided, with the government saying the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct is “one of the locations to be investigated.”
The government also noted that Samsung C&T intends to establish a “substantial manufacturing hub” as part of this project which would allow Samsung, its “affiliates” and other global companies transition to 100% renewable energy.
Interestingly, the announcement says the deal is with “Samsung C&T Corporation Engineering & Construction” which could suggests Samsung would not only be the customer but also developer or even project EPC.
Samsung C&T is yet to release its own announcement.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/15/the-case-for-ultra-deep-e-methanol-storage/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",The case for ultra-deep e-methanol storage,"An alternative form of storage with an order of magnitude cheaper capital cost is e-methanol. This ultra-deep storage can also double as a national fuel security strategy.
Converting electricity to hydrogen and then back to electricity is criticised due to the high round-trip losses – and the same would apply to e-methanol. However, in this case, the round-trip efficiency is not relevant altogether because the stored e-methanol is not turned back into electricity but used as a commodity. 

Instead of using the ultra-deep e-methanol storage like a traditional “charge and discharge” battery, it can be optimised as a flexible load or as part of a larger asset ecosystem.
Let’s first assume that the e-methanol production plant capacity is fully utilised, i.e. it sells e-methanol through continuous supply contracts and runs 24/7 on carbon-free electricity. By adding extra storage capacity, the plant can occasionally deliver the e-methanol from the tanks instead of from the production line and effectively release the electricity back to the market, just like a discharging battery would. A relatively small amount of extra production capacity is also required to slowly refill the tanks after use.
While such a plant could operate as a stand-alone unit – subject to the availability of green baseload electricity – there are additional benefits of optimising it as part of an asset ecosystem such as Superhybrid developed by Sunshine Hydro. 
A Superhybrid consists of long-duration energy storage and flexible load like e-methanol production, optimised by a purpose-built software called AESOP. The system buys large quantities of wind and solar and uses the assets to transform the intermittent generation into a long-term baseload-type electricity supply. The excess energy is converted into hydrogen and green fuels that are also sold through steady-stream supply contracts. Additionally, Superhybrid sells peak power and grid support services on the market. 
There is no technical upper limit for the depth of the e-methanol storage because it is modular and can be easily expanded by adding more tanks. Furthermore, the optimisation of electrolysers can also respond to short-term daily peaks and provide grid support in a normal market situation, earning extra revenues and providing downward pressure on consumer prices. 
While this article focuses on e-methanol as a national electricity security reserve, we must point out that it can alternatively – and to an extent simultaneously – act as a fuel reserve that keeps food trucks and other heavy transport on the road. 
There are trucks available today that run on methanol and are offered by various truck vendors such as Geely (China), Ashok-Leyland (India) and Dor (Israel). These vehicles use internal combustion engines, providing an easy first step in decarbonising transport to run on methanol. Alternatively, methanol can be used in a fuel cell to power an electric vehicle or other devices – for example, it is currently used to power remote telecommunications sites.
Methanol is rapidly gaining market share in the marine sector with 10% of the ships contracted this year able to run on methanol. Smaller vessels such as tugs are already running on methanol as a fuel both in reciprocating engines and soon on fuel cells.
As the transport and delivery logistics chains develop it becomes increasingly easy to use methanol in other industries such as agriculture, construction and mining – which are further important sectors for national security and resilience. 
It’s time for national fuel security to turn green as well.
For a decade Australia has fallen short of its obligation to stock at least 90 days of oil net imports as a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Transition to e-methanol would simultaneously reduce the need to import oil and enable stockpiling alternatives that would be subsidised through electricity market optimisation.
It is very challenging or virtually impossible to build a pumped hydro station with three months of storage, and even more so using batteries. However, these are the closest comparisons to make when assessing the capital cost of deep e-methanol storage.
The capital cost of Borumba Pumped Hydro Project in Queensland is estimated at $14.2 billion (USD 9.06 billion). It’s a 2,000 MW pumped hydro station with 24-hour reservoir and is planned to be operational by 2030. The capital cost relative to energy capacity is nearly $300 per kWh (this is the price of installed capacity, not LCOE, levelised cost of energy). 
The price of a 12-hour vanadium flow battery system with 100 MW power capacity is currently over $800 million. This is about $700 per kWh installed. Both alternatives are economically challenging as a stand-alone business, to say the least.
When energy is stored by using a surrogate as “electricity not needed in the production,” the investment only needs to cover the incremental increase in production capacity, storing the product and managing the stockpile.
For example, let’s look at a methanol plant that draws 100 MW of 24/7 carbon-free electricity from the grid (or from an asset ecosystem like Superhybrid) to supply 300 tonnes of e-methanol per day through a long-term contract. Let’s then add a three-month ultra-deep storage capability to it and allow two years to build the storage up. The capex spent on the extra electrolysers and storage tanks is about $70 million – an order of magnitude cheaper than the alternatives (if they are scaled to the same power capacity when discharging, i.e. 100 MW). 
However, the starkest comparison comes from capex per energy capacity. In this example, it is $0.32 per kWh for energy storage that can last three months. Pumped hydro capex per kWh is over 900 times more for one day of storage and the battery capex is over 2,000 times more for half a day. Ultra-long duration storage may just have started to make economic sense – even though there are still no market structures to truly incentivise it.
This is an example of how thinking outside of the box can reveal opportunities to increase resilience and accelerate decarbonising our electricity grid and even provide additional benefits. The electricity sector needs to think creatively to identify energy-intensive products that can be easily stored and stockpiled and where the production process enables some level of ramping. 
Typically, these businesses would be focused on maximising production and minimising shelf life, so it’s up to the energy sector, together with the governments, to incentivise the change. Perhaps, in addition to synthetic fuels like e-methanol or Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), further examples could be found in cryogenic distillation or elsewhere in chemical processes.
Sunshine Hydro is currently open for crowdfunding investment through Birchal. Always consider the general CSF (crowd sourced funding) risk warning and offer document before investing.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/15/message-framing-techniques-to-boost-solar-sales/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY,NETHERLANDS,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 15, 2023",Message framing techniques to boost solar sales,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU Munich) in Germany and the Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands have investigated how the sales of rooftop PV systems may be boosted by message framing, a communication theory that presents certain information or a product by using a “framed” message in order to elicit persuasion of the message receivers.
Message framing consists of a series of techniques that helps the receivers interpret what they see or what they are being told and is commonly used to send a message to a specific audience while advocating health perceptions and behaviours.
“Our study primarily examined how retailers can boost solar panel demand,” the research’s lead author, Dominik Bär, told pv magazine. “However, fostering solar panel installation involves considering the broader market context. A combination of public policies, financial incentives, and effective communication strategies, like those explored in our study, are critical in encouraging private households to invest in green technologies.”
Behavioral responses
The research group presented the approach in the paper “Message framing to promote solar panels,” published in nature communications, where it explained that message framing refers to a kind of communication that typically provides a scalable and cost-efficient approach to induce certain behavioural responses.
The scientists also explained that previous literature tended to create an opposition between economic gains and environmental concerns in convincing consumers to buy a photovoltaic system and opted, instead, for a strategy using both arguments. “We propose messages designed to promote a serious commitment of retail consumers to adopt solar panels by targeting themselves or the environment,” they stated.
Loss vs. earnings
The group explained, for example, that messages focusing on self-interests should take into account the opposition between cost savings and additional earnings, and said that the concept of savings is associated with the idea of avoiding a “loss,” which may trigger stronger behavioural reactions compared to the idea of “earning” something.
“We thus test whether the following two messages promote solar panels: (1) Self-Save: “Save on average €813 ($1367) per year” and (2) Self-Earn: “Earn on average €813 per year,” the academics explained.
CO2 emissions vs. green power
The researchers also investigated the opposition between a message seeking to convince consumers to buy a PV system to reduce CO2 emissions, which they said is intended to avoid environmental harm, and another one inviting them to produce clean electricity, which emphasises a positive environmental achievement.
“Previous research showed that preventing a negative environmental outcome may be a stronger incentive to adopt environmentally friendly behaviour but again outside of large-scale investments,” they also explained.
Testing
The team tested these arguments with the support of an undisclosed “leading” online retailer from the Netherlands during a study period of 14 days. The company’s website showed visiting customers one of four messages in a call-to-action box.
Through their analysis, the researchers found that all proposed messages effectively promote solar panels with a 3.8% higher rate of customers committing to solar panels compared to the two weeks before the experiment.
They also found that the Self-Save frame achieved the highest rate, followed by the Self-Earn frame at 4.17%. The Environment CO2 nd Environment Green frames achieved 4.12% and 3.98%, respectively.
“Our study primarily examined how retailers can boost solar panel demand,” Bär said. “However, fostering solar panel installation involves considering the broader market context. A combination of public policies, financial incentives, and effective communication strategies, like those explored in our study, are critical in encouraging private households to invest in green technologies.”

The Sri Lankan government’s CEB has kicked off a 70 MW ground-mounted solar tender in the South Asian country. According to recently published tender documents, the Sri Lankan-based projects will range from 1 MW to 5 MW and be developed on a 20-year build, own and operate (BOO) basis.
The projects will be connected to existing grid substations. These are the 1 MW (AC) Kurunagala grid substation; the 2 MW (AC) Ampara grid substation; the 2 MW (AC) Habanara grid substation; the 3 MW (AC) Veyangoda grid substation; the 5 MW (AC) Kosgama grid substation; and the 5 MW (AC) Pannala grid substation. Developers must procure 22-year lease agreements for 1.21 hectares per 1 MW of land.
Projects will be awarded 20-year PPAs with a maximum tariff of LKR 34.93/kWh ($0.17/kWh).
The project’s technical requirements are not specified in the tender documents.
Applications must include a feasibility study covering costs, technical details, and environmental and archaeological impact. Projects will be selected as part of the “competitive bidding” process.
The plant’s commercial operation date is expected to be roughly two years after the letter of award is issued. Deadline for applications is Dec. 19, 2023.
This tender is the third launched in the country since October. Sri Lanka recorded 714 MW installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2022, according to the most recent data published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
