https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/03/patriot-hydrogen-joins-gasification-outfit-cac-h2s-bulging-partner-list/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,SINGAPORE",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 3, 2021",Patriot Hydrogen joins gasification outfit CAC-H2’s bulging partner list,"Australian company Patriot Hydrogen Limited today announced it has formed a joint venture with CAC-H2, joining the fast-growing list of companies partnering with the newly formed Singapore-headquartered enterprise.
The agreement will see CAC-H2 become the exclusive technical and mechanical advisor and supplier for Patriot’s so called P2H units. These P2H units are modular and designed to be portable for ease of use and transportability. Their outputs include syngas, hydrogen, green energy and biochar, according to Patriot.
Although the term biomass doesn’t appear in the companies’ press release on the announcement, both Patriot and CAC-H2 use the material as the foundation for hydrogen production. Unlike other renewable hydrogen production process, CAC-H2 does not use electrolysers, but rather creates hydrogen through gasification. Gasification, including to make hydrogen, has been around for decades but has typically used fossil fuel feedstocks like coal. CAC-H2, on the other hand, is seeking to use biomass like wood and other organic materials.
Patriot Hydrogen says its P2H units will be based on CAC-H2’s proprietary technology, which includes components such as the in-feed system, discharge system for the produced biochar and the recovery and cleaning of the produced syngas suitable for immediate input to fuelled generator equipment. 
CAC-H2 is itself a joint venture, the coming together of Malaysian-based gasification and EPC company Renewables Plus and CannAcubed, the making of Singapore-based Australian Glenn Davies. The company was only officially established in the middle of this year and quickly announced a suite of partnerships including projects with Sweetman Renewables, Clean Holdings, and now Patriot Hydrogen.
CAC-H2 is adamant that even though the ‘net zero’ classification of biomass as an energy input is highly questionable, its processes are nonetheless totally green. It bases those claims on its biochar byproduct, which it says sequesters carbon and promotes soil health.
Speaking to pv magazine Australia last month, CAC-H2’s chief executive of energy, Arman Massoumi, said it is crucial to note the company’s technology does not combust biomass (burning wood, of course, releases carbon dioxide), but rather gasifies it in the absence of oxygen.
“We get wood and gasify it, or we get corn cob or cannabis, whatever, you get a gas that is a fuel gas with 20% hydrogen in it. We are then separating the hydrogen from that gas… so you’re removing the part that is sought after,” Massoumi said.
Next to hydrogen, the process’ outputs include nitrogen (50%) and carbon dioxide (20%). Massoumi said the company will likely release the nitrogen into the atmosphere because it has a low market value, while the CO2 will be emitted “into a greenhouse farm” or otherwise used or sequestered. Despite these two greenhouse gas byproducts, Massoumi is adamant the company’s process is still carbon negative thanks to the biochar, which contains much of the carbon its source plant sequestered.
In the middle of this year, Patriot Hydrogen was partially acquired by Western Australia-based oil and gas company Prominence Energy. Prominence bought a 20% stake in the hydrogen company in the hopes its P2H units will build into a solid revenue stream.
The company sold its first two units around the same time as Prominence Energy bought its stake in the company, which were sold for $5.8 million to Port Anthony Renewables.
Patriot Hydrogen has also previously said it intends to construct a ‘biomass to hydrogen’ plant at Port Anthony in Victoria. Patriot holds a binding term sheet to lease the site and construct the plant, which is expected to take around 12 months to be planned, constructed, commissioned and reach steady state production of two tonnes of hydrogen per day.

Repurposing technologies invented by mining, fostering European partnerships and amassing a series of striking core projects, Neometals has quietly reinvented itself, dislodging its foothold from regional backwaters and marching it directly into a global battery epicentre. 
Just in the last week, Neometals completed the commissioning of its Primobius battery recycling demonstration plant. Located in its partner SMS Group’s manufacturing hub in Hilchenbach, Germany, an hour a half’s drive from former West German capital, Bonn, the facility uses distinctive hydrometallurgy processes to recover materials from lithium-based batteries. 
What distinguishes the process though is its waste-free status. “We’ve developed flowsheets that not only try to maximise our recoveries, but that are actually green,” Chris Reed, Neometal’s managing director, told pv magazine Australia. “There’s no emission of any water, any waste water – we’ll be reusing that, and our tails are a fertiliser product and our CO2 footprint is very low.”
Primobius (Neometals & SMS Group)
The facility has been six years in the making, the result of an extensive research and development program by Neometals. After cracking the chemistry code, the company knew the real trick would be in scaling.
As Neometal’s general manager of commercial and investor relations, Jeremy McManus, puts it: European carmakers don’t have time for small Australian companies who are just going to build “one dinky plant”. Which meant Neometals had to find a way to go “very industrial scale” with its capacity or risk carmakers taking their battery recycling programs in-house. That capacity came in the form of the SMS Group partnership. To the joint venture, SMS Group brings its 140 year reputation in plant building, operation, maintenance, and permit know-how. 
Attaching itself to an enduring European company has been vital for the Western Australian outfit. Neometals’ longterm strategy is to link with European carmakers by promising to close their car battery loop, recovering materials from their stocks of spent electric vehicle (EV) batteries so they can go into the next generation afresh – a ESG reporting dream. “That’s how we make money – it’s sort of a partnership model at large, where we manipulate sharing the economics, recycling services and selling the chemicals at the back,” McManus told pv magazine Australia.
Primobius uses solvent extraction as its primary recovery tool, a process Reed says was actually invented in the Australian mining hub of Mount Isa in central Queensland. “We’re still recovering nickel, cobalt, manganese, base metals, but instead of using a mineral source, we’re using the batteries,” Reed said. “It’s applying existing Australian technology into a new field.” 
The Primobius pilot which took place in Canada saw materials recovery rates sitting around 85%, something Reed is hoping to boost in the more advanced German demonstration plant. 
Neometals
A combination of Primobius’ sequence and reagents mean its process produces minimal waste. “Rather than using sodium as the pH adjustor, we used [the more expensive] ammonia gas which means instead of having a shitty sodium sulphate… we get ammonium [sulphate] out the backend, and it’s actually a very high purity fertiliser,” Reed explained. As for the gas fumes which come with battery recycling, Reed says the company actually captures its vapours, dries and condenses them “because that’s still got lithium in it.”
“Pretty much nothing goes to waste, or down the drain or into landfill,” McManus said of the process.
“We’re trying to design it as if you were going to build it next to your house [because] it’s going to be next door to someone somewhere in the world,” Reed said. This approach has seen Primobius selected as a finalist in the German Sustainability Award’s resources category for 2022, with the winner to be announced in early December. 
Neometals’ journey from gold mining in the turn of the century to (hopefully) winning sustainability awards in 2021 came, as Reed puts it, after “God slapped me in the face.” 
It was Reed’s birthday, 2008, and he was watching concentrates being leached at Thyssenkrupp’s headquarters in Essen, Germany, when a cohort of engineers and businessmen emerged and told the Australian mining director that he should go looking for lithium. “They told me the future of transportation was going to be lithium batteries,” Reed recalled. Intrigued, he began researching. 

As it turned out, Reed did know where to find lithium – there was a vast deposit right in his home state. He spent the next year shifting his business, which at the time was called Reed Resources, away from gold and toward lithium, eventually changing the company’s name to Neometals and extending the scope from just lithium to a broad spectrum of battery minerals.
“We [then] made a conscious pivot five years ago to move into those more sustainable materials recovery projects,” Reed said, pointing to the company’s turning away from its mining roots towards recycling.
Primobius’ plan is to focus in on car batteries, specifically pursuing chemistries with high nickel contents, like lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt or NMC chemistries and lithium-cobalt or LCO chemistries. Despite the surging popularity of lithium-iron-phosphate or LFP chemistries, the company isn’t prioritising that direction, describing it as far less economic. “You might get a cheaper car at the front end, but the the total cost is more expensive if you include recycling, which is where the world is going,” McManus said.
Primobius (Neometals & SMS Group)
It’s riding on carmakers, especially German luxury carmakers, opting away from cheaper, less flexible chemistries and towards more recyclable options. “All of my big discussions with potential partners, often the first person that ever speaks is the guy or girl responsible for lifecycle carbon analysis. Which Aussies don’t get, and I must admit I was a bit surprised,” McManus said. 
For the Neometals team, Europe’s closed loop battery focus – not to mention incoming regulations – are leagues ahead of Australia. In the EU, battery makers will soon be mandated to use recycled content in their new products. “You can’t magic recycled content, it has to come from a recycler,” McManus said, opening up a seizable opportunity for well positioned players like Primobius.
“We’re doing a study on a 20,000 tonne per annum plant, and at the same time we’re doing a study on a 200,000 tonne per annum plant because that’s where we see the volumes going to,” he said.
Reed’s vision for Primobius is for it to become a preeminent global battery recycler. From his perspective, Europe is going to be where that first kicks off in earnest. “We’ll come to Australia as soon as the market is there,” Reed added.
Over this month, November, Primobius will complete the testing of its Hilchenbach demonstration plant and put the final touches on its feasibility study. It’s set to make its final investment decision on the endeavour in the first quarter of next year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/03/storing-hydrogen-with-aluminium-hydrides/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 3, 2021",Storing hydrogen with aluminium hydrides,"From pv magazine Global
A team of scientists from the U.S. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories has proposed to use aluminium hydride (AlH3) to store hydrogen. This solid-state metal hydride, which is also known as “alane,” is commonly used for rocket fuel, explosives, as a reducing agent in alkali batteries, and as a hydrogen source for low-temperature fuel cells. 
According to the researchers, this material is able to overcome the challenge represented by the thermodynamic limitation of hydrides in storing hydrogen. “Many high-capacity metal hydrides suffer from poor thermodynamics of hydrogen uptake after initial release, which necessitates extreme hydrogen pressures to regenerate,” the scientists explained. “Such a limitation is often tied to their metastable nature and hinders their real-world applications.”
At room temperature, aluminium hydride is a metastable crystalline solid and when it goes through an endothermic reaction it decomposes
to generate aluminium and hydrogen gas. The research team developed a nanoconfined material with improved thermodynamics and placed it within the nanopores of a highly porous bipyridine-functionalised covalent triazine framework, which they called AlH3@CTF-bipyridine. 
This configuration made it possible to convert bulk metallic aluminium into alane at 60 degrees Celsius and at a hydrogen pressure of only 700 bar, which compares to 6,900 bar in conventional processes. “This pressure is readily achievable in commercial hydrogen fuelling stations, although further improvements are necessary to achieve rapid fuelling,” the scientists further explained, noting that current processes used to produce alane are carried out under “extreme conditions.”
The academics found that the alane they developed offered more stability. They observed that intrinsically stable radicals and tiny alane clusters interact chemically with the nanopores of the confining framework, which creates thermodynamic conditions that are completely different from those of bulk metallic aluminium. “Nanoconfinement is a really interesting approach for stabilising metastable hydrogen-storage materials, particularly given the wide palette of potential host materials,” said LLNL materials scientist Brandon Wood.
A full description of the technology can be found in the study Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage, which was recently published in Angewandte Chemie.

Filipino renewables developer Solar Philippines this morning announced it will finance the first 225 MW of generation capacity at a planned more-than-500 MW project on the island of Luzon by floating the project company which is preparing the plant.
The parent company will take advantage of a ruling laid down by the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) in 2011 that permits renewable energy projects to be the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) at the development stage, provided they meet criteria such as holding a service contract from the Department of Energy.
“The PSE showed great foresight in creating this program for RE [renewable energy] companies,” said Solar Philippines founder Leandro Leviste, quoted in a press release issued by the company today. “Through this offering, we hope to give the public a new option to invest in RE, and expand RE in the Philippines.”
The developer did not reveal how much it hopes to raise from the planned IPO, stating only that the proceeds would fund the initial, 225 MW phase of a project its backer has predicted will be the biggest in South East Asia.
That first stage, said Solar Philippines, would already constitute the nation’s largest solar field, with plans to extend capacity to 500 MW through “further financing,” in future, and to eventually expand the project even more, “beyond this capacity.”
The developer said it hopes to begin construction at the former ranch site in Peñaranda, in the province of Nueva Ecija, this year, with the project “operational,” with an unspecified generation capacity, next year.
Solar Philippines added, the Nueva Ecija facility is one of five large solar plants it hopes to install next year, alongside a 63 MW project in Batangas being developed with utility the Korea Electric Power Company; a 200 MW field at Tarlac taking shape with the Prime Infra business of port handling magnate Enrique K Razon Jr; and two further arrays, with a combined generation capacity of 140 MW, planned in Batangas and Cavite.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/03/australias-battery-pipeline-charges-to-over-26-gw-says-new-research/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"NOVEMBER 3, 2021","Australia’s battery pipeline charges to over 26 GW, says new research","Less than 12 months ago, analysts Cornwall Insight Australia (CIA) pegged Australia’s battery energy storage (BESS) pipeline at 7 GW, with a vast majority of that projection still firmly in the proposal phase. Eleven months later, and new CIA research shows the pipeline of proposed storage has grown enormously, to over 26 GW of announced projects. What is more, CIA believes the technical lifetime of BESS assets has increased in that time too. 
Growing pipeline 
The last year has seen no shortage of announcements and proposals. EnergyAustralia is progressing its plans for what it calls the ‘world’s biggest battery’, the Wooreen Energy Storage System, a 350 MW / 1.4 GWh battery to be built in place of the retiring Yallourn coal-fired power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, though that might not be the biggest by the time it is build considering Neoen announced plans to build a 500 MW/1 GWh big battery west of Sydney, and fellow gen-tailer Origin plans to develop a 700 MW/2.4 GWh battery storage system at the site of its Eraring coal generator in the NSW Hunter region.
Just yesterday, Maoneng has secured approval for its 225 MWp / 450 MWh Gould Creek Battery project near Adelaide, South Australia, an addition to the 240 MWp/480 MWh big battery in Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula that the company announced in July. 
Last month, Sydney-based Genex Power inked a deal with Tesla to develop the 50 MW/100 MWh Bouldercombe Battery Project in Queensland (QLD). And indeed the QLD government itself has announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries, with a combined capacity of 40 MWh in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial.
Over in Western Australia (WA) Italy-headquartered energy storage specialist New Horizons Ahead has been awarded the contract to build a 100 MW/200 MWh battery at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station, near Perth.
In September, Edify Energy was granted development approval from the Townsville City Council for a 1 GW green hydrogen and battery project, and in the same month AGL got the tick of approval from the New South Wales state government for its 50 MW/100 MWh battery project in Broken Hill. And renewable energy developer Elliott Green Power received approval to develop a 75 MW battery at its Susan River Solar Farm in regional QLD.
And the enormous growth in the BESS pipeline shouldn’t come as a surprise. In its new paper — Battery Storage — The New, Clean Peaker — released in April, the Clean Energy Council (CEC) amassed a battery of evidence that large-scale BESS has become the superior solution to spreading energy generated by solar and wind throughout any day, and instantly responding to peak energy needs in the National Electricity Market (NEM) for long and short durations.
Extended lifetime 
On top of this massive increase in CIA’s projection, CIA is also seeing the expected technical lifetime of BESS assets increasing, from a 10-15 year lifetime only a few years ago, to up to 15-20 years today (dpending on warranties and cycling requirements). 
As a result, CIA has also increased its Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) price forecast from 15 to 20 years, aligning it with the increase in the lifetime of BESS assets. 
“FCAS currently makes up a significant proportion of most storage business cases” said CIA principal consultant Ben Cerini. “Understanding each service’s price drivers and expected price changes will affect future project connection size and duration and the optimal time for refurbishment and extension planning. The extended duration of the curves allows new project developers to better understand the potential future FCAS cost liabilities for their assets, for a more significant portion of their operational life, to better reflect actual future costs.”
