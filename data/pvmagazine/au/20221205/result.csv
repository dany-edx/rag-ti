The bill laying the groundwork for the formation of the $15 billion fund was introduced to the House of Representatives on Wednesday by Industry Minister Ed Husic who said government will this week hold the first meetings to establish the peak group that will oversee the NRF in the hope of making investments next year.
“Around the world, industry policy is being remade to shore up local manufacturing capability,” Husic said.
“Now, Australia can be a bystander, or it can be a driver of change. We want to see Australia once more at the forefront of technological innovation and advanced manufacturing to make sure Australians benefit from our homegrown ingenuity.
“We want more Australian companies to think globally and build locally.”
Husic said the NRF will help Australian industry move up the ladder toward higher value-added activities, support the transition to a net-zero economy and improve supply chain resilience through an expanded national industrial base.
“We want to be a country that makes more onshore, and that means backing the businesses that are making things here and supporting manufacturing in regional Australia,” he said.

The NRF will deliver targeted co-investments in independently assessed projects across a range of strategic industries including resources value adding; transport; enabling capabilities across engineering; and critical technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics.
The government has earmarked up to $3 billion of the NRF’s initial $15 billion to support renewables and low-emission technologies.
The fund will pursue commercial opportunities for the manufacture of clean energy components including wind turbines, and the production of batteries and solar panels and hydrogen electrolysers. It will also look to invest in the manufacture of green metals, agricultural methane reduction, and innovative solutions for waste reduction.
The NRF will be modelled on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s (CEFC) ‘co-investment’ model with government planning to partner with businesses and superannuation funds to unlock further potential private investment of more than $30 billion through the fund.
The fund is to be administered by an independent board, operating under a government mandate. It is expected the fund will provide multiple investment options including loans, guarantees and equity to support projects.

“The National Reconstruction Fund will play a key part in ensuring Australia is a country that makes things,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement. “It will help create secure local jobs, boost sovereign capability and diversify our nation’s industry and economy.”
The government said it will now work with industry to select a board and chair, which will help develop the fund’s investment mandate. It intends to have this work completed ahead of the May 2023 budget, which will make capital allocations for investment. The NRF is intended to be operational in July 2023.
Public consultation on the fund has also opened, focusing on further defining the scope of the fund and how it will make investment decisions.
Husic said companies seeking funding through the new initiative will need to have a business plan outlining how they will establish a solid company generating returns and creating secure, well-paid jobs.
“The NRF is the connective tissue between human capital and technological potential that shapes my portfolio,” he said. “It is one mechanism through which we will realise our ambition to better connect science and industry, to ensure Australian-made discoveries can be commercialised and scaled in our nation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/05/domestic-supply-chains-would-benefit-significantly-from-addressing-modern-slavery/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,DR CONGO,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Domestic supply chains would ‘benefit significantly’ from addressing modern slavery,"A new report from the Clean Energy Council (CEC) in collaboration with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright – titled “Addressing Modern Slavery in the Clean Energy Sector” – argues that addressing modern slavery in the clean energy sector comes with the added bonus of domestic supply chain opportunities for Australia.
According to the International Labour Organisation, approximately 40 million people are victims of modern slavery worldwide. The report continues that the renewables industry has significant risk of modern slavery practices in the supply chains which support wind, solar and battery production.
That risk includes the mining of cobalt for lithium-ion battery production, which has been tied to child labour and forced labour practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And the serious allegations in polysilicon manufacturing of forced labour involving the ethnic Uyghur population in the Xinjiang region of China – allegations the Chinese government denies.
However, the report described the risk of forced labour entering into the supply chains of Australia’s solar energy industry as a result of Xinjiang manufactured polysilicon as “significant.”
Some governments have already taken legislative action on the basis of these allegations, most notably in the United States. The US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevent Act went into effect on June 21. This legislation assumes any goods produced or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang region are the product of forced labour and therefore banned.
CEC Policy Director of Energy Generation and Storage Nicholas Aberle noted that Australia is on its way to producing the vast majority of its electricity from solar, wind, hydro and batteries by 2030, “but it’s important this shift happens in a way that is fair and equitable. As with many other modern products ubiquitous in everyday life, renewable energy technologies can have long supply chains that are linked at various points to modern slavery.”
Aberle suggested that one of the strategies which Australia can explore in order to play its part in addressing modern slavery in renewable energy supply chains “is the potential for establishing domestic supply chain capabilities. Australia has significant expertise in mineral extraction, so as a nation, we can be looking at developing our capacity to extract, process and manufacture materials and components for solar panels, batteries and wind turbines.”
“Australia would stand to benefit significantly from vertical integration in domestic production of clean energy raw materials and finished products, which will also reduce reliance on foreign supply chains,” the report states. And yet, the report’s authors concede that shifting Australia’s supply chains “does not necessarily lead to a reduction in overall forced labour as materials produced with forced labour may still be sold in jurisdictions that do not apply these standards or even used within the country of production.”
It is not yet clear whether Australia will follow in the legislative footsteps of the US. With China as a major trading partner and Australia’s posture in recent decades as a low-tariff nation and supporter of free trade it could appear unlikely. However, Norton Rose Fulbright Partner Abigail McGregor said key nations can promote a globally recognised certificate of origin to certify products are not the product of modern slavery.
McGregor said that businesses and investors can also implement their own strategies to respond to human rights abuses, including supply chain due diligence.
To that end, the CEC has prepared a voluntary pledge of corporate responsibility in the sector. The pledge includes declarations to “adopt adequate procedures to manage the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chains,” and to “seek to contractually oblige our suppliers to have in place adequate procedures to manage their modern slavery risk.”
NSW Anti-slavery Commissioner James Cockayne said industry, government, the financial sector and civil society” must work together “to provide access to competitively costed, slavery-free renewable energy. If we don’t, modern slavery risks significantly complicating the just transition to a decarbonised economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/05/fast-charger-to-help-drive-transgrids-net-zero-ambitions/,"EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,SPAIN",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Fast-charger to help drive Transgrid’s net-zero ambitions,"Transgrid has passed another milestone on the journey to achieving its net-zero targets with the installation of a 60 kW Supernova DC fast-charger developed by Spanish company Wallbox Chargers. The installation is part of a wider program to transition the network operator’s passenger and commercial fleets to electric vehicles (EVs) by the end of the decade.
The 60 kW charger has been installed at Transgrid’s Wallgrove site at Eastern Creek in Sydney and is the first of Wallbox’s 60 kW Supernova DC fast-chargers deployed in the Australian market.
Wallbox said the unit, which can be expanded upon and upgraded, can charge some EVs from 20% to 80% battery in just 15 minutes and is capable of simultaneously charging two vehicles. When two EVs are connected the unit delivers 30 kW per outlet. Power increases to 60 kW to one car when the second one unplugs.
Transgrid Fleet Manager Ryan Thomas said the new technology will play a critical part in the electrification of the company’s fleet of 400 utility vehicles while it has “already transitioned more than half of our passenger fleet to electric or hybrid vehicles.”
“This charger gives the ability for our staff to be able to turn up, charge and leave in as little as 20 minutes,” he said. “In the future it will also give us the option to upgrade to ultra-rapid charging which allows some EVS to be charged from 20% to 80% battery capacity in just 15 minutes.”
Wallbox Australia and New Zealand Country Manager Reece Davis said the Supernova charger has been developed with reliability and scalability at the forefront to ensure a seamless experience for both charge-point operators and drivers.

Thomas said the trial will focus on Transgrid’s Sydney fleet but will also help the network operator to identify other sites on its network which would benefit from installing similar charging units.
The installation of the EV charger comes just days after Transgrid outlined new net-zero commitments, with a goal to reduce both direct and indirect emissions, with an overall target of reaching net zero by 2040.
Transgrid has committed to reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 60% by 2030 compared to 2021 levels and is targeting net zero by 2040. Additionally, Transgrid has aiming to reduce Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, and capital goods, by 48% per million dollars spent on these two categories by the end of the decade and net zero by 2050.
“As we build a better power system for all Australians and accelerate the transition to clean, renewable energy, we will work equally hard to minimise our climate impact,” Transgrid Chief Executive Brett Redman said.
“We have a responsibility to deliver a fit-for-future electricity network that minimises climate impact in construction and operation and to do that, we are accelerating our program of works and rolling out credible and ambitious long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.”spai

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/05/xodus-announces-1-gw-green-hydrogen-project-for-wa/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Xodus announces 1 GW green hydrogen project for WA,"The Australian arm of Scotland-headquartered Xodus Group said its proposed MercurHy project would allow for the industrial-scale production of green hydrogen, helping to unlock and decarbonise new industries while leveraging economies of scale, particularly regarding the supply and purchase of renewable energy.
The company plans to build the hydrogen production facility in stages with the initial phase to comprise 150 MW of electrolyser capacity. The second stage would increase the capacity of the facility to 500 MW before a third stage is completed for a total electrolyser capacity of 1 GW.
Xodus Managing Director Stephen Swindell said the staged approach will allow the market for green hydrogen time to develop sufficiently and also allow the company to capitalise on future technology price reductions.
“As we accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon economy, the investment landscape is becoming more and more complex as markets, policies and regulations also undergo rapid change,” he said. “Upscaling of the hydrogen sector is still in its infancy and the local supply chains must be developed further to maximise opportunities.
“The aim of this project is to push the supply chain forward, reduce technology risks and achieve cost reductions.”
While no details about the exact location and renewable energy components of the project were made available, Xodus said it has secured the support of local landowners and the state government for the MercurHy project.

The company has also opened talks with potential capital and infrastructure partners to secure equity funding for the project and has already signed a deal to investigate the possible supply of green hydrogen to ASX-listed VRX Silica, a resources company with multiple silica sand projects in WA and plans for the manufacture of ultra-clear glass for solar panels to supply national and international demand.
In a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding signed in March, Xodus agreed to explore the future supply of green hydrogen to VRX’s Arrowsmith North and Muchea silica sand projects in the Mid-West, as well as to potential, nearby glass-manufacturing facilities.
“Project MercurHy provides a strong economic development opportunity for the region by helping to unlock and decarbonise new industries, which in the case of VRX Silica would see the opening up of domestic capacity for local net-zero glass and solar panel manufacturing,” Xodus said.
The deal is exploring a future offtake of between 9,000 tonnes to 11,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum.
Xodus said it has also advanced discussions with other potential green hydrogen offtakers.
“It’s an exciting project,” Swindell said. “We have led it from its infancy and have attracted partners to achieve joint success. Our aim is to have an active role in energy transition with the high-quality, low-carbon, economically viable projects that Australia and the world desperately needs.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/05/tindos-sales-skyrocket-as-consumers-turn-to-homegrown-solar/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"DECEMBER 5, 2022",Tindo’s sales skyrocket as consumers turn to homegrown solar,"According to Adelaide-based Tindo Solar, Australia’s only panel manufacturer, the sales of its solar panels have doubled in the space of two months. The company says the boost comes off the back of rising energy costs, a potential recession in the offing, and increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of buying quality.
In a statement, Tindo said the doubling of sales from September to November was mirrored by an equal doubling in battery sales. Tindo Solar CEO Richard Petterson said the doubling of sales of both solar and battery systems is indicative of consumer concern about electricity price rises and an economic downturn. Petterson also suggested a growing preference for Australia-made products.
“Consumers have spent several months watching energy prices rise and being warned that there are more to come,” said Petterson. “Along with the inflation outlook and talk of recession, we can see Australians wanting to take control of their electricity costs by using the Sun as an energy source and storing that energy in a battery.”
It is Petterson’s opinion that the days of mere rooftop PV uptake in Australia are over, and that Australians are now keen to incorporate battery systems for the improved solar consumption and independence, and also for access to Virtual Power Plants.
“More people are seeking high-quality solutions which includes Australia-made solar modules designed for Australian conditions,” added Petterson. What is more, Australian consumers may also be inclined to pay a premium for Australia-made products due to sustainability concerns and alleged forced labour in parts of the global supply chain.
In December 2021, Tindo committed to a program with Reclaim PV that sees close to 100% of its panels recycled and re-used in the industry at the end of their working life. Researchers from the University of South Australia have estimated that more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter the waste stream by 2035 and currently almost all expired or discarded solar panels in Australia go into landfill.
Reclaim PV has developed recycling facilities in Adelaide and Brisbane and is establishing a national network of collection locations for solar modules to be recycled at its plants.

In August, Tindo unveiled its largest residential rooftop module yet, the 410 W solar panel with 20.6% efficiency. The 410 W Karra panel is made with 108 half-cut monocrystalline cells based on M10 wafers with a size of 182mm. It operates with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and a temperature coefficient of -0.34% per degree Celsius.
The new panel measures 1,731mm x 1,149mm x 40mm and weighs 21.5kg. It is built with fully tempered glass and is wrapped in a black anodised aluminium alloy frame. It comes with a 25-year product guarantee and a 25-year performance guarantee. End power output is guaranteed to be no less than 80% of the nominal output power.
