The survey took place in late 2020, and involved 4336 respondents across the state – with data separated according to gender, age, location and home ownership. Queensland’s Minister for Energy, Mick de Brenni, described the survey as an illustration of goodwill towards clean energy, calling on renewables industries to “leverage” the surge in interest. “Building on this positive sentiment right now is the key to future of success,” de Brenni said at the virtual Queensland Smart Energy Summit last week, where he teased some of the survey’s findings.
The number of Queensland households with battery storage systems has doubled from 3% to 6% in the last 24 months, with the most significant growth seen in regional Queensland.
Although the total percentage of households with batteries remains small, a third of Queenslanders said they intend to purchase a energy storage system, with 10% planning to do so in the next three years. The number of respondents disinterested in batteries continued to fall.

Of those intending to install a battery storage system, 37% are only willing to pay a maximum of $5000, while 32% would pay up to $10,000 and 29% would pay $15,000 or more.
Regional Queenslanders, the group which saw the most growth in battery interest, reported that they see the technology not so much as a means to lower their bills, but rather a way to increase self sufficiency and to be less reliant on the grid.

As for the barriers, 29% said the technology doesn’t make financial sense yet and a further 24% cited a lack of knowledge.
Just 23% of respondents knew about community batteries, but of those 22% are interested in them.
Almost a quarter (24%) of Queenslander said they would like to go off-grid, particularly Queenslanders between 18 to 34. 56% said they would like to do so to save money, while 37% said the intention was to help save the environment.

Queensland has among the highest penetration of rooftop solar in the world, and it shows no signs of slowing. A massive 37% of Queensland households have solar, up from 33% in 2019. A further 22% of respondents said they are either looking to install solar or upgrade their solar system in the next three years. 
The average quarterly bill for households with solar PV was $231, compared to $383 for households without solar – saving solar households an average of $600 less per year.

Of the households interested in or already installed with solar, 60% said they did so to save on their bills and 30% wanted to do their bit for the environment – a sentiment most prevalent among younger generations of Queenslanders.
Satisfaction with solar’s benefits appears high, with 93% of solar owners saying they would replace their solar system if it were to fail with a system of the same size or bigger.

Just 3% of Queenslanders have an electric vehicle (EV), though a growing percentage of the population is looking to purchase. That is, 54% of respondents said they’d consider buying an EV compared to 40% two years ago. Of those, 35% are looking to buy within the next three years.

Although respondents’ range requirements differ by region, most of those considering an EV would require a range of at least 500km. The price points most are willing to consider for an EV sit around the $30,000 to $50,000 mark, dropping off considerably above that.

The growing interest in cleaner technology actually comes as fewer Queenslanders reported feeling concerned about electricity bills. Of those polled, 51% said their level of concern about electricity bills was low while only 29% said it was high. This coincides with a decrease in average bills.
While the rooftop solar boom in Australia is often linked with a spike in electricity prices, which peaked around 2016, it seems the decline in costs is not causing disinterest in renewable alternatives.

Responding to the survey, Queensland community group Solar Citizens called on the government to do more to bridge the technology price barriers through incentive schemes.
“This survey shows that there’s a real appetite in Queensland for battery storage and cleaner electric vehicles but cost remains a barrier to accessing these technologies,” said Stephanie Gray, Energy Strategist at Solar Citizens.
“This is where the state and federal governments can play a constructive role. By incentivising the rollout of battery storage and electric transport they can bring down the cost of clean technology to make it easier for more Australians to save money and do their bit for the environment.
“Governments played a key role in bringing down the cost of rooftop solar by incentivising uptake and now Australian homes and businesses are leading the world. It’s our great energy success story and we can do that again.”
Earlier this month, Solar Citizens released the findings of a survey it had commissioned – revealing areas that have traditionally been Queensland’s conservative strongholds are now showing clear support for clean energy. Its regional-only poll found more than half of regional Queenslanders believe clean energy industries will be major employers by 2030, while just shy of half support transitioning to a renewables-dominated grid in the next 15 years or sooner.

The Melbourne city council announced the scheme this morning, saying it is currently developing a business case for the pilot battery network which could scale up to 5 MW of storage by 2024. The council has allocated $300,000 in this year’s budget to deliver the pilot.
The Melbourne city council is also calling on the private sector and state government to take part in the scheme. “We are looking for likeminded partners to join us in delivering cutting-edge technology that makes our city more sustainable, and delivering future savings to businesses and residents,” Lord Mayor Sally Capp said.
The roll out of the mid-scale community batteries will focus on the council’s existing infrastructure initially, as well as the Melbourne Innovation District located in the CBD’s north. Future battery locations will be proposed for areas where network demand is constrained or expected to increase over the coming decades, the council added.
The aim of the scheme is to deliver more renewable energy into the grid, accelerating the City of Melbourne’s ambition of being 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030.
Lord Mayor Sally Capp said Power Melbourne would encourage greater uptake of renewables, create new opportunities for research, training and jobs in the green technology sector, and help build Melbourne’s reputation as a centre for clean energy innovation. “Melbourne has been a leader in sustainability for decades and this project will encourage a new wave of innovation in the mid-scale battery sector,” the Lord Mayor said.
Environment portfolio lead Councillor Rohan Leppert said Power Melbourne would showcase what can be achieved through collaborating to increase battery storage in urban areas. “Power Melbourne will deliver a huge amount of insight and data into how we can best reform our electricity networks to encourage more renewables and battery storage,” he said.
Australia has this year seen a deluge of new big battery announcements, with storage considered an important means to stabilise our grid as it’s flooded with evermore variable renewable energy. Residential battery storage, which typically stores around 5 kWh to 10 kWh, are also increasingly being mobilised as a means of stabilisation through Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).
VPPs aggregate home battery systems through software platforms, though, as Discover Energy CEO’s Anson Zhang has previously noted, such schemes have limitations as unreliable internet connections and shifts in household schedules means capacity cannot always been drawn when needed.
Community batteries are expected to be an important piece of the puzzle here since they hold significantly more capacity and should be more reliable in terms of connection, making them able to respond immediately to shifts in demand.
In January, CitiPower and Yarra Energy Foundation, a not-for-profit primarily funded by the Melbourne’s Yarra City Council, announced they would parter to create a community battery network in the Melbourne CBD and inner-city suburbs. The City of Melbourne’s scheme would see a considerable extension to this ‘solar sponge’ concept for Melbourne city.
Community battery pilots are growing in popularity, with schemes being rolled out in New South Wales and Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/27/arc-shaped-pv-system-for-agrivoltaics-from-germany/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,GERMANY,NETHERLANDS",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"JULY 27, 2021",Arc-shaped PV system for agrivoltaics from Germany,"From pv magazine Germany
German EPC contractor Goldbeck Solar has developed an arc-shaped PV system for applications in agrivoltaic projects.
Called MarcS, the system was developed in partnership with German mounting structure provider PMT and is said to enable more effective land use, increased profitability, and more efficient use of resources.
The arches have been designed to slide on the side rails so that the positions of the solar modules can be flexibly adjusted and the arable land underneath can either be exposed to, or protected from, the sun, depending on the farmer’s need. At the same time, the solar modules offer animals and plants protection from extreme weather conditions such as hail, drought, or excessive sunlight. Furthermore, temperature, humidity, and light can be controlled and the quality of breeding and harvest can be optimised.
The assembly of the solar arches can be automated or at least semi-automated. It consists of rows of solar modules that are arched at a height of 2.50 to 3.50 meters. The arrangement connects the modules with the substructure to form a fixed static part that can span up to nine meters, according to Goldbeck Solar.
The modules are aligned with an east-west orientation with different angles of inclination, which increases the yield. The company estimated the additional yield at up to 30% compared to conventional ground-mounted systems and up to 60% compared to other agrivoltaic systems. It added that this technology can enable more than 2 MW of photovoltaic output per hectare.
From 2022, Goldbeck Solar intends to offer the “MarcS” mounting system in the Netherlands. A 45 MW pilot PV project is also currently being planned.

The PV plant, which is Global Business Power Corporation’s (GBP) first project in the renewable energy market, is being constructed across a 135-hectare area owned by the Philippine Communications Satellite Corporation (Philcomsat) in partnership with Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co. and China Energy Engineering Corporation.
“We aim to transition to cleaner fuel sources by obtaining 1,500 MW of our power requirements from renewable energy in the next five years,” said Meralco CEO, Ray C. Espinosa.
No more technical or financial details on the projects were provided.
Several large-scale PV projects are currently being developed and/or constructed in the Philippines. In June, Manila-based PV module manufacturer and project developer Solar Philippines said it was set to start construction on a 500 MW solar park on former ranch land in Peñaranda, in the province of Nueva Ecija, in the Central Luzon region. The project is part of a 1 GW PV project pipeline that the company announced in December.
Several giant solar projects have also been announced in recent months. Three PV projects with capacities of 1.2 GW each were included in a list of solar projects with web-based monitoring systems for energy applications under a program known as The Energy Virtual One Stop Shop (EVOSS) System. In total, 13.2 GW of solar capacity was included on the list by the end of June 2020.
