Pending development and grid connection approvals, the Upper Calliope solar plant will be built and operated by the Australian arm of Danish-headquartered developer European Energy on a 2,400-hectare site about 50 kilometres southwest of Gladstone on Queensland’s central coast.
Once approved, construction of the solar farm is expected to commence in 2025 or 2026. The project is expected to take two years to construct.
Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm said the solar farm, which is expected to generate 2.8 TWh of clean energy per year, is a key element of the company’s plans to green its aluminium production facilities in the state.
“This agreement is a first important step in our work to repower our Gladstone operations and illustrates our commitment to keeping sustainably powered industry in central Queensland,” he said.
“The task remains challenging, but we have a pathway to provide the competitive, firmed power our Gladstone plants need, and we are continuing to work hard with all stakeholders, including the Queensland and Australian governments, on getting there.”
“Competitive capacity, firming, and transmission, are critical to developing a modern energy system that can ensure more large-scale renewables development in Queensland and help guarantee the future of Australian industry.”
Rio, which is aiming to halve its global Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions this decade, said the Upper Calliope solar plant has the potential to lower the company’s operating carbon emissions by 1.8 million tonnes per year.
European Energy Chief Executive Officer Erik Andersen said the supply of renewable and reliable energy to what is one of Australia’s key industrial hubs marks a new standard for industrial energy consumption.
“The Upper Calliope Solar Farm is not just a solar power project; it’s a testament to our shared vision for a greener future,” he said.
“This project underlines our dedication to driving the transition towards renewable energy in Australia and demonstrates the potential of solar power in transforming the energy landscape of the region. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Rio Tinto and other stakeholders to create a sustainable and energy-efficient future for Australia.”
European Energy, which established its Australian office in Melbourne in 2022, is developing a portfolio of wind and solar assets with a combined capacity of more than 2.5 GW. This includes the 1 GW Sawpit Solar Farm being developed near Biloela in central Queensland and the 56 Mokoan Solar Farm which is being constructed near Winton in Victoria.
The Upper Calliope Solar Farm is the first successful applicant in a formal Request for Proposals Rio made for an estimated 4 GW of wind, solar farms and firming capacity to power its operations in the Gladstone region, which include the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland Alumina refinery.
Rio Tinto said it was continuing to assess other proposals, solutions and partnerships to help competitively meet the energy needs of the production assets which require more than 1 GW of reliable power to operate.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/24/developer-eyes-new-opportunities-after-mudgee-solar-farm-rejected/,"LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",EV FOLEY,"JANUARY 24, 2024",Developer eyes new opportunities after Mudgee solar farm rejected,"The New South Wales (NSW) court has rejected renewables developer IT Power’s application to build a 10 MW solar farm on the outskirts of Mudgee, agreeing with the Mid-Western Regional Council that the project would be an ‘alien feature’ in the existing landscape which would be “irreversibly changed” by the development.
Canberra-headquartered IT Power had planned to establish the Burrundulla Solar Farm on a block of land located 2.4 kilometres southeast of Mudgee. The development application was in 2020 rejected by the Western Regional Planning Panel and now IT Power’s appeal has been dismissed.
In her judgement, NSW Land and Environment Court Senior Commissioner Susan Dixon said the proposed Burrundulla Solar Farm did not comply with environmental policies, was located too close to Mudgee, and plans to mitigate the visual impact by building mounds of earth to hide the solar panels from view would have a significant adverse impact on the regional city’s scenic quality and landscape character.
“The excessive scale of the proposed solar arrays, located on a site that is within a low-lying, visually sensitive rural landscape setting adjoining the main entrance corridor to Mudgee, and inconsistencies with the relevant strategic documents, demonstrates that the development as proposed is not suitable for the site,” she said.
“The council submits that the development of this solar farm will be an alien feature in the relevant setting, and based on my observation at the site view, I agree. The development, whilst permissible, is uncharacteristic and will intrude into the landscape.”
An IT Power spokesperson told pv magazine that despite its disappointment at the outcome, the company respects the court’s decision.
“It’s a shame to have a small number of opponents drown out support for a project, but we continue to look for other opportunities in the region,” the spokesperson said, noting that the opposition from the local council was the first time it has received pushback for a solar project.
“We engaged widely in the community in accordance with our community engagement plan and the council’s guidelines and otherwise received great support for the project, plus we were excited to contribute to the local community and believed it would have been beneficial to all involved,” the spokesperson said.
The proposed Burrundulla Solar Farm was to comprise 25,000 solar panels and would have generated enough power for approximately 4,300 homes.
“We estimate that a solar farm of this size could have provided 34% of the electricity the town requires, and this particular site has a high-quality solar resource, in relatively infertile land, falls outside future housing development plans of the town, and is close enough to the centre of town to minimise electrical connection losses,” the spokesperson said.
IT Power said it has successfully developed more than a dozen renewable energy projects, some of which have now completed construction.
“We also have more than 30 similar town-scale projects under development in regional NSW as well as larger projects to power regional centres using renewable resources,” the spokesperson said.
Midway through the five-year dispute, Mudgee and its surrounds were reclassified by the state government as a regional city, which created new development consent protocols. The new policy also applies to Albury, Armidale, Bathurst, Dubbo, Griffith, Goulburn, Orange, Tamworth, and Wagga Wagga.
The classification states a development cannot be granted if it renders significant conflict with existing or approved residential and commercial uses of land around it, nor can it be found to impact the regional city’s capacity for growth or scenic quality and landscape character.
Mudgee is located within the planned Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) which is intended to deliver 6 GW of new renewable energy into the grid by 2038.

The project, to be built on a 182-hectare site near Te Aroha about 140 kilometres south of Auckland, will comprise approximately 330,000 solar panels capable of generating more than 270 GWh of clean energy per year, enough to supply the equivalent of approximately 35,000 New Zealand homes.
The joint venture marks a new direction for Clarus, one of New Zealand’s largest energy groups with transmission, distribution, supply and storage operations that service nearly half a million homes and businesses.
Clarus General Manager of Future Fuels, James Irvine, said the development of the Tauhei Solar Farm is an important milestone for the company and is in line with its commitment to help drive the decarbonisation of New Zealand’s energy system.
“Utility-scale solar generation presents a significant, complimentary, and largely untapped source of renewable energy in New Zealand, as proven in many markets overseas,” he said.
“This project is an opportunity for us to build on our desire to deliver renewable energy to meet the needs of energy consumers.”
A final investment decision on the Tauhei Solar Farm, which secured development approval in 2022 under fast-track consenting legislation introduced to speed up infrastructure development, is expected later this year, pending regulatory approvals.
Construction is also expected to commence this year with Harmony Energy Director Pete Grogan saying the project will enhance New Zealand’s energy security and help mitigate the negative impact of climate change.
“It will also create opportunities for local businesses, employment and significant biodiversity gains, as well as being able to generate energy alongside continued farming production,” he said.
The project is expected to be the largest solar farm in New Zealand when it comes online in 2026, eclipsing the largest operational solar farm in the country, the 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm which started exporting late last year. It will also be larger than the 47 MW Lauriston Solar Farm being developed on New Zealand’s South Island by Genesis Energy and renewables partner FRV Australia.
Other large-scale solar projects in the pipeline include Lightsource bp and New Zealand energy giant Contract Energy’s plans to develop a 150 MW solar project at the Christchurch Airport while energy company Todd Generation has announced plans to establish a 400 MW solar farm at Rangitāiki on the North Island.

The government is keen to expedite the application process so it can complete the design of the zone and reach financial close, which is scheduled for the second half of 2024. Construction is expected to start in early 2025 with the new infrastructure to commence operation in 2027-2028.
EnergyCo, which is leading the development of the REZ transmission network infrastructure in its capacity as the infrastructure planner for the renewable energy zones in the state, said to obtain initial access rights for the Central-West Orana REZ, projects will be required to comply with a set of minimum criteria.
EnergyCo also said the first allocation of access rights will be offered separately to the long-term energy service agreements (LTESA) program. It is expected this reform will not extend beyond the awarding of the initial tranche of access rights.
The reforms will also include a sunset clause that will allow for any agreements to be terminated if developers fail to progress their project in a timely way.
The Environmental Impact Statement for the Central-West Orana REZ was recently placed on public exhibition and a response to submissions will be released early this year, ahead of state and Commonwealth planning approvals, expected in mid-2024.
The initial stage of the Central-West Orana REZ, which encompasses approximately 20,000 square kilometres centred around the towns of Dubbo, Dunedoo and Mudgee, is to deliver at least 6 GW of new network capacity by 2038. The renewable energy zone is expected to generate up to $10 billion (USD 6.59 billion) in private investment in the region by 2030.
The Central-West Orana REZ is the first of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, South-West and Illawarra regions.
Released in 2020, the 20-year roadmap calls for at least 12 GW of renewable energy backed up by 2 GW of storage by 2030, helping replace capacity lost with the shutdown of coal power generators including AGL Energy’s Liddell, and Origin Energy’s Eraring.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/24/solar-sites-linked-to-higher-levels-of-insects/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PATRICK JOWETT,"JANUARY 24, 2024",Solar sites linked to higher levels of insects,"From pv magazine Global
A research team from the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have said that insect levels have tripled in less than five years at two solar sites built on retired agricultural land in southern Minnesota.
Native grass and wildflowers were planted at the two solar facilities, operated by Enel Green Power North America, in early 2018. Between August 2018 and August 2022, the research group conducted 358 observational surveys of flowering vegetation and insect communities.
They found that total insect levels tripled, with native bees showing a 20-fold increase in numbers. The most commonly observed insect groups were beetles, flies and moths. An increase in native plant species was also noted, while pollinators from the solar sites were seen visiting and pollinating soybean flowers in adjacent crop fields.
Lee Waltson, a landscape ecologist and environmental scientist who was the lead author of the study, said the research “highlights the relatively rapid insect community responses to habitat restoration at solar energy sites.”
“It demonstrates that, if properly sited, habitat-friendly solar energy can be a feasible way to safeguard insect populations and can improve the pollination services in adjacent agricultural fields,” said Waltson.
The Argonne National Laboratory said the findings suggest that habitat-friendly solar sites could play an important role in conserving biodiversity and mitigating land-use conflicts associated with the conversion of farmland for solar energy production. It noted that this could be particularly beneficial for the future development of ground-mounted solar.
However, they warned that additional research is needed to understand the feasibility of habitat-friendly solar across different regions and to meet ecological goals such as conserving target insects or wildlife species.
