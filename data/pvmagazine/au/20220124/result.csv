Dixon highlighted the achievement in a linkedin post, noting that the facility, originally developed by Risen Energy, had topped the list of Australia’s best performing utility scale (>15 MW) solar farms for the year.
Adani Australia’s 65 MW Rugby Run Solar Farm near Moranbah in central Queensland was second with an average capacity factor (AC CF) of 28.3% followed by Neoen’s 36 MW Griffith Solar Farm (27.1% AC CF) in New South Wales (NSW). Genex’s 50 KW Kidston Solar Farm in north Queensland and the 132 MWp Nevertire Solar Farm in north-west NSW round out the top five.

Singapore-headquartered SUN Energy purchased the Merredin Solar Farm, located adjacent to Western Power’s Merredin Terminal Substation about 260 kilometres east of Perth, from Risen in October.
The solar farm comprises approximately 360,000 Risen 370 W high performance monocrystalline PERC module panels mounted on a single axis tracking system.
SUN Energy chief executive officer Philip Lee said at the time of the acquisition the solar farm is an integral part of the company’s expansion strategy and provides the group with a strong foothold to grow its renewable energy presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
“The Australian market is key for us, given the long-term potential for renewable energy and its geographical proximity,” he said.
“The acquisition supports our strategy to become one of the leading renewable energy companies in the region, through a combination of new project development and selective acquisitions.”
SUN Energy’s acquisition came just months after mining giant BHP signed an offtake agreement for the Merredin Solar Farm to supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs for its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
The project, which is adjacent to Western Power’s Merredin Terminal Substation, has also secured development approval to deploy up to 20 MW/40 MWh of battery energy storage onsite.
Merredin’s performance was part of a record-breaking year for utility PV and wind generation in Australia.
Dixon said large-scale solar PV and wind generation totalled 35,564 GWh in 2021, with utility PV contributing 9,184 GWh and wind 26,380 GWh. That equated to a 22% rise on the previous year (29,052 GWh).
At a state level, Victoria was the largest generator of utility PV and wind generation in 2021 with 9,767 GWh, followed by NSW (8,819 GWh) and South Australia (6,396 GWh) respectively.
APA Group’s 130 MW Badgingarra Wind Farm in WA was the top performing wind farm for 2021 with an average capacity factor of 46.7% CF, followed by the 31 MW Kiata Wind Farm (43.0% CF) in Victoria ahead of the 112 MW Granville Harbor Wind Farm (41.6% AC CF) in Tasmania.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/24/researchers-claim-new-efficiency-record-for-solar-cell-technology/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,ASIA,AUSTRALIA,SINGAPORE",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 24, 2022",Researchers claim new efficiency record for solar cell technology,"A team of researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) claim their solar cells made using perovskite and organic materials have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 23.6%, approaching that of conventional silicon solar PV cells.
Dr Chen Wei, Research Fellow at the NUS Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, said the achievement is a “significant leap” from the current power conversion rate of about 20% reported by other studies on perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.
“In our latest work, we have demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 23.6%,” he said. “This is the best performance for this type of solar cell to date.”
Wei said the latest result is approaching the power conversion rate of 26.7% of conventional silicon solar cells, which is the dominating technology in the current solar PV market.
Although perovskite/organic tandem solar cell technology is attractive for next-generation thin-film PV, its efficiency lags behind other types of tandem solar cells featuring stacks of two or more absorber layers.
To address this technological challenge, the NUS research team, in collaboration with scientists from the University of Hong Kong and Southern University of Science and Technology in China, developed an interconnecting layer (ICL) that reduces voltage, optical and electrical losses within the tandem solar cell.
In a paper published in Nature Energy, the research team revealed that the ICL is based on a 4-nanometre-thick sputtered indium zinc oxide layer inserted between organic bathocuproine and molybdenum oxide with enhanced electrical properties and transmittance in the near-infrared region.
Wei said the technology had delivered a maximum efficiency of 23.60% (22.95% certified) in the perovskite/organic tandem solar cell. In addition, the tandem device retained 90% initial efficiency after 500 hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination.
Lead researcher Professor Hou Yi said the technological breakthrough opens the door to thin-film tandem solar cells that are light and flexible.
“Our study shows the great potential of perovskite-based tandem solar cells for future commercial application of photovoltaic technology,” he said. “Building on our new discovery, we hope to further improve the performance of our tandem solar cells and scale up this technology.”

Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabić said all decisions and licences regarding Rio Tinto’s Jadar lithium project had been annulled after requests by various environmental groups to halt the $3.3 billion project that was expected to start production in 2027.
Brnabić, who faces a general election in early April, told a news conference in Belgrade late last week the government had “fulfilled all the demands from the environmental protests and have put an end to Rio Tinto in the Republic of Serbia”.
“All decisions (linked to the lithium project) and all licences have been annulled,” she said.
“As far as the Jadar project and Rio Tinto are concerned, everything is over.”

Rio Tinto said in a statement it was “extremely concerned” by Serbia’s decision and was reviewing the legal basis for it, saying “it had always operated in compliance” with Serbian laws.
“Rio Tinto is reviewing the legal basis of this decision and the implications for our activities and our people in Serbia,” the company said.
Brnabić said the government was prepared to “fight against” any potential lawsuit from Rio Tinto linked to its cancellation of the project.
The decision shapes as a major setback for Rio Tinto, which was hoping the project would help make it one of the world’s 10 biggest producers of lithium, a key ingredient used in batteries for EVs and energy storage.
At full capacity, the Jadar mine was expected to produce approximately 58,000 tonnes of refined battery-grade lithium carbonate a year, making it Europe’s biggest lithium mine by output. Rio Tinto said the mine would have been capable of producing enough lithium to make about 1 million EV batteries a year to the highest environmental standards.
In addition, Jadar was expected to produce borates, which are used in solar panels and wind turbines.
The company said in a project fact sheet in July that it had already spent $450 million in pre-feasibility, feasibility and other studies on Jadar to understand the nature of the deposit.
The Jadar mine is Rio’s only lithium project although the company last month announced plans to buy a lithium asset in Argentina for $825 million, as it looks to build its battery materials business.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/24/genex-heads-underground-on-250-mw-2-gwh-pumped-hydro-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 24, 2022",Genex heads underground on 250 MW/2 GWh pumped hydro project,"Sydney-based developer Genex has confirmed that tunnelling works have commenced at its $777 million Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project being developed at the site of two abandoned gold mine pits near Kidston, about 270 kilometres north-west of Townsville in northern Queensland.
The pumped hydro facility is the centrepiece of what will become the Kidston Clean Energy Hub, which comprises the existing 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm, which Genex has been operating since 2017, while up to 270 MW of additional solar and up to 150 MW of wind generation have also been proposed.
Planned for commissioning in 2024, the pumped hydro energy storage plant involves the transfer of water between the two disused gold mine pits which are located at different elevations. Water stored in the upper reservoir will drop about 220 metres down two vertical inlet shafts through reversible turbine-generators – to be located approximately 250 metres below ground level – into the lower reservoir to generate electricity.
Genex announced on Friday it had already undertaken extensive works in the past two months to establish the 1.5-kilometre-long underground main access tunnel which will lead to the “powerhouse cavern” which will house the two 125 MW Andritz hydro reversible pump turbines.
The company said preparation works for the main access tunnel had been completed and the underground excavation works formally commenced with the first major blast.

Genex CEO James Harding said the start of major engineering works at the site was a significant milestone for the project.
“Following an intense period of site establishment and preparation works, I am delighted that the EPC contractor JV of McConnell Dowell and John Holland has formally commenced the underground excavation works for the Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project,” he said.
“This represents a significant milestone in the project construction timeline, which was achieved ahead of schedule. We look forward to working alongside the EPC JV and keeping the market updated as the program continues to push ahead over the course of this year.”
Work on the main access tunnel is expected to continue on a 24/7 basis with the shaft progressing at an average rate of 8 metres per day over the next six months.
In addition to the underground works, Genex said work on a 22 kV distribution line which will connect the site to Ergon Energy’s Kidston substation is almost complete with the transformer already installed.
Work is also progressing on the prototype testing of electrical towers for a new 186km 275 kV transmission line being constructed by Powerlink Queensland between Kidston and a new switchyard at Mount Fox. This will connect with the existing Ross to Chalumbin 275 kV transmission line, allowing the facility to connect with the National Electricity Market (NEM).

The Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project will have 250 MW generating capacity and energy storage capacity of 2 GWh. The company said the storage equates to eight hours of generation at full load, or enough to power 143,000 homes. It will have a start-up time of less than 30 seconds, allowing it to respond quickly to any shortages of electricity supply.
Electricity provider EnergyAustralia will operate the pumped hydro storage asset for up to 30 years after inking a binding energy storage services agreement (ESSA).
Under the ESSA, EnergyAustralia, which is owned by Hong Kong-based China Light and Power Group (CLP), will have full operational dispatch rights for the hydro plant, in exchange for a fixed annual rental payment that will increase over the term of the agreement.
The 30-year agreement for operation of the asset is divided into 10-year terms, with two options to extend after the first 10-year period; and should EnergyAustralia take the agreement to its full extension, it will have the right to acquire Genex’s holding in the project which has an expected life of at least 80 years.

Genex said the construction program remains on schedule for first generation in Q4 2024.
The Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project is the first pumped hydro power station to be built in Australia since the Wivenhoe Power Station was constructed in Queensland in 1984.
When complete it will be one of four operating pumped hydro energy storage projects in Australia, including the Wivenhoe Power Station and the Tumut 3 power station that forms part of the Snowy Hydro scheme and the Shoalhaven Scheme in New South Wales.
There are however several pumped hydro projects in the pipeline in Australia, including the 400 MW Big T project being developed by Melbourne-based BE Power in southeast Queensland.
The Queensland government has also called for tenders for the proposed 1 GW Borumba Dam pumped hydro energy storage project being developed near Gympie in the state’s south-east.
Further south, the NSW and federal governments are pushing ahead with the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro storage project. The pumped-hydro expansion of the existing Snowy Scheme will provide 2 GW of on-demand generation and 350,000 MWh of large-scale energy storage.
EnergyAustralia is investigating the feasibility of developing a 350 MW pumped hydro energy storage facility near its Mt Piper coal-fired power station at Lithgow while fellow gen-tailer AGL has revealed plans to explore the engineering feasibility of establishing a 250 MW, eight-hour duration pumped-hydro energy storage project at its Bells Mountain coal mine site in the Hunter Valley.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/24/topcon-vs-perc/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 24, 2022",TOPCon vs PERC,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE have outlined a series of cost-driven strategies to accelerate the industrial upscale of tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar products.
“Maintaining a high conversion efficiency in mass production is a key aspect to compete with the state-of-the-art PERC cell in terms of system cost and levelised cost of electricity,” the research’s corresponding author, Bishal Kafle, told pv magazine. “Recent developments in device research have led to an increasing gap between the conversion efficiencies of TOPCon and PERC cells. Nevertheless, a standard process flow for industrial TOPCon cells is not yet established.”
According to him, although a reduction in production costs is important, the economic viability of TOPCon requires a stable 24/7 production with equivalent uptime and utilisation rates to current passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cell manufacturing facilities. “Additionally, a TOPCon cells on an n-type substrate requires silver (Ag) contacts on both sides, reduction of Ag usage remains an important aspect as well for this concept, at least in the middle and long term,” he further explained.
In the paper, TOPCon – Technology options for cost efficient industrial manufacturing, published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, the German research team explained that the processes and existing equipment that are commonly used in the manufacturing of PERC cells may be easily adapted to TOPCon cell production by adding two process steps: the formation of tunnel oxide and the deposition of intrinsic/doped polysilicon.
“The properties of these layers are vital towards designing the subsequent cell processing steps, aiming to achieve high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a low series resistance promised by the TOPCon-concept,” explained the researchers, noting that n-type substrates are more expensive to integrate than their p-type counterparts, due to the higher costs of the boron emitter diffusion process compared the phosphorous diffusion process typically used in PERC cell manufacturing.
The study provides a technical route to improve the low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) process, which is currently the standard in the industry for TOPCon products, and evaluates possible alternatives to this technique, based on industrial tool availability, process compatibility, availability of all process parameters required for a cost of ownership (COO) modelling, lean process flow, and successful demonstration of the process functionality.
The LPCVD technique is still considered a valid approach by the research team as it ensures good thickness distribution along the wafer, pin-hole free layers with good step coverage, the use of relatively low deposition temperatures close to 600 degrees Celsius, a large number of wafers per batch, and the option of in-situ doping with constant doping profile. However, the LPCVD tool also has a reduced throughput due to a significantly longer process duration compared to that used in PERC cell manufacturing, which inevitably leads to higher production costs.
“Nevertheless, for the process route featuring in-situ deposited LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si layers, we identify a possibility of combining the high temperature annealing and oxidation of boron emitter in a single step, which makes this approach economically competitive in comparison to the process route featuring ex-situ LPCVD a-Si/poly-Si layers,” they continued.
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and Atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) were considered as alternatives to LPCVD and the analysis showed that no clear winner can be identified between the three technologies. “It is observed that COO of a-Si deposition step scales down significantly with the thickness of the a-Si layer, although interestingly the cost reduction is largely dependent upon the used deposition technology,” the Fraunhofer ISE researchers said. “A much stronger reduction in COO for thinner layers is observed for PECVD and APCVD-deposition technologies, which is mainly related to their significantly higher a-Si deposition rates in comparison to LPCVD.”
The scientists also compared the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for 5MW ground-mounted PV plants relying on bifacial PERC technology and TOPCon products featuring LPCVD, PECVD and APCVD. Their analysis showed that the TOPCon techs have 13.5–18.6% higher All-in Cell costs and 3.6–5.5% higher All-in Module costs in comparison to PERC benchmark.
“The additional cost for TOPCon module is mainly related to a higher CAPEX and facility-related costs for the cell production facility, a significantly higher process consumable costs in the cell processing due to the additional process steps required compared to a PERC cell, and the higher price of n-type as to the PERC p-type wafer substrate,” they emphasised. “At LCOE level, all the evaluated TOPCon concepts under monofacial illumination show slightly lower LCOE values to the bifacial p-PERC technology, assuming a TOPCon cell efficiency advantage of 0.5% over PERC at 23.5% and 23.0% respectively.”
According to them, in order to outperform PERC in economical terms, the most conservative TOPCon concept should achieve a minimum efficiency gain of 0.55%. “For the best-case TOPCon concept, a cell efficiency gain >0.40% to bifacial p-PERC already allows cost-effective high-volume manufacturing of TOPCon solar cells,” they concluded.
