SSROC, which brokered the deal with South Australia-headquartered renewable energy retailer ZEN Energy, said the clean energy will be sourced from the 132MW Nevertire and the 56MW Moree solar farms in the NSW’s northwest and the 120MW Hillston Solar Farm in the state’s southwest.
The PPA includes the supply of electricity to more than 300 major council facilities and more than 3,400 small sites managed by the 25 councils, which collectively represent more than 3 million people, which is almost 38% of the state’s population.
The agreement will commence this year and continue through to 2026, with the option to extend to 2030.
SSROC president and Burwood Council Mayor John Faker said the councils have saved money by buying as a group and had secured a renewable energy deal at the same or lower cost than their existing contracts for traditional fossil-fuel fired power.
“This is a major win for the environment at a time when the world’s focus is on taking solid steps to address climate change,” he said.
“It is a huge demonstration of the commitment of councils to serving their communities, minimising their carbon emissions and growing the economy of NSW.”

SSROC chief executive Helen Sloan said the organisation had been leading the market in advocating for shorter term, lower risk renewable energy supply agreements for councils that can be negotiated at competitive supply rates.
“The approach taken proves that councils can secure competitive pricing and meet their renewable energy targets without having to enter into a long-term agreement,” she said.
SSROC said 83% of the councils’ total electricity supply will be covered by renewable energy from the Nevertire, Moree and Hillston solar farms.
Nineteen of the participating councils have opted for 100% renewable energy under the agreement.
Minister for Local Government Wendy Tuckerman said the collaboration between councils brings NSW one step closer to achieving its net-zero goals.
“Councils working together in this way shows just what all levels of government can achieve in aiming for net-zero emissions and energy security,” she said in a statement.
“This huge investment in NSW will be the foundation of a brighter and cleaner future.”

The participating councils are: Bayside, Burwood, Campbelltown, Canada Bay, Canterbury- Bankstown, Fairfield, Georges River, Hornsby, Hunters Hill, Inner West, Ku-ring-gai, Lane Cove, Liverpool, Mosman, North Sydney, Parramatta, Port Stephens, Randwick, Ryde, Singleton, Sutherland, Tamworth, Waverley, Willoughby Woollahra.
The agreement is the latest in a string of clean energy supply deals signed by Australian councils.
Earlier this month a group of six councils in the NSW Hunter region banded together to broker a 10-year PPA with Sydney-based retailer Mojo Power while Procurement Australia revealed it was progressing an energy supply agreement which will see seven councils in the Albury, Wollongong and Bega Valley regions using 100% renewable energy from 2023.
In December, 48 West Australian (WA) councils signed an agreement with WA energy provider Synergy to source all renewable energy from wind farms at Albany, Emu Downs and Collgar.
The initiative, negotiated by the WA Local Government Association (WALGA), came after more than half of the Victoria’s local councils signed up to a similar deal earlier in 2021.
The Victorian Energy Collaboration (VECO) ensured 46 of Victoria’s 79 councils will be powered by renewable energy with Melbourne-based energy retailer Red Energy, an offshoot of the Federal Government-owned Snowy Hydro, signing an agreement to supply the councils with a combined 240GWh of renewable energy each year until the end of 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/24/australian-hydrogen-battery-technology-to-be-tested-in-uk/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",Australian hydrogen battery technology to be tested in UK,"Sydney-headquartered professional services outfit GHD announced on Wednesday it has secured funding from the UK government to install a demonstration plant in England featuring Lavo’s hydrogen-based battery technology, which contains both a water purifier and an electrolyser, and is specifically designed for incorporation with a solar PV system.
GHD, a cornerstone investor in Lavo, has secured $264,000 (£141,000) from the UK government’s Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to demonstrate the feasibility of a grid-connected energy storage system based on storing hydrogen in Lavo’s innovative and patented metal hydride.
GHD project manager Tej Gidda said the demonstration facility, to be installed at the University of Chester’s Thornton Science Park in England’s northwest, will allow it to effectively demonstrate and prove the concept of Lavo’s hydrogen energy storage system.
“We’re delighted to have the support of BEIS and to be working with our partner and the University of Chester on this important project to demonstrate the feasibility of longer duration hydrogen storage in the UK energy system,” he said.
“Collaborating with clients and industry partners around the world to develop and commercialise new solutions, such as Lavo, puts us in a strong position to harness the enormous opportunities presented by the global energy transition.”
Developed in partnership with the University of New South Wales’ Hydrogen Energy Research Centre, Lavo’s energy storage system contains both a water purifier and electrolyser, so that solar energy can separate the hydrogen from the water, release the oxygen, and store the hydrogen safely as a solid material by combining it with a patented metal hybrid.
When stored energy is needed, the hydrogen can then be released through a reduction in pressure and diverted into a fuel cell to produce useable electricity.
GHD said the project would help illustrate the economics of creating hydrogen in times of excess renewables electricity generation and storing in long-duration energy storage medium. It will also demonstrate the scalability of Lavo’s modular, stackable hydrogen energy storage device.
Lavo’s hydride technology has seen initial demonstration in Australia but GHD said this project will apply the technology at a larger scale to demonstrate how it can support energy storage for the UK electricity network by providing low cost, and low carbon, hydrogen to local users in the northwest of England.

The funding is part of the BEIS’s Longer Duration Energy Storage Demonstration program which is in turn part of the UK government’s $1.87 billion (£1bn) Net Zero Innovation Portfolio which aims to accelerate the commercialisation of innovative longer duration energy storage technologies which provide grid flexibility.
The BEIS said the latest round of funding aims to demonstrate first-of-a-kind energy storage system prototypes in relevant or operational environments.
“This should build a pipeline of longer duration energy storage systems to be commercially deployed,” it said in a statement.
UK Energy Minister Greg Hands said the project offers the potential to be an important enabler for an emerging hydrogen economy, providing hydrogen for customers at low cost.
“Driving forward energy storage technologies will be vital in our transition towards cheap, clean and secure renewable energy,” he said.
“It will allow us to extract the full benefit from our home-grown renewable energy sources, drive down costs and end our reliance on volatile and expensive fossil fuels.”
The UK government is not the only supporter of Lavo’s hydrogen battery. The company last month secured $5 million in funding from the NSW Regional Job Creation Fund and late last year the Queensland government announced funding for Lavo to help it establish a $15 million hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing facility.

“The decision comes as uncertainties in the global solar panel business continue to increase due to a variety of contributing factors, including the intensification of price competition and the rising cost of raw materials,” the company said in a statement.
LG, which last month launched a new range of solar panels for the Australian rooftop market, said it will continue to stand behind its brand and the company will maintain support for customers of existing LG solar panels, however only promises this “for a period of time after the business’s closure”.
The company also said it plans to continue solar panel production through to the end of June 2022 “to maintain adequate inventory for future service support”.
Despite its planned exit of the solar panel manufacturing business, LG said it remains committed to renewables and plans to “leverage its renewable energy expertise to unlock value for its customers”.
“The company will concentrate on growth sectors and plug into a new era of sustainability through rapidly evolving products and solutions including energy storage systems, energy management solutions and other yet-to-be-announced advancements,” it said.
LG’s announcement comes just days after one of Australia’s largest residential and commercial solar PV retailers and installers revealed it will exit the market, blaming low margins and “once-in-a-generation” disruptions to the supply chain brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic for the decision.
Western Australia-headquartered Infinite Energy, which is wholly owned by Japanese industrial giant Sumitomo Corporation, plans to stop selling rooftop PV and battery systems, saying maintaining a successful business model in a highly saturated and rapidly changing market is no longer sustainable.

Green hydrogen business Fusion Fuel Green and Portuguese self-consumption energy project developer KEME Energy have agreed to install a green hydrogen plant in Sines, Portugal. “The project, which is expected to require a capital investment of €2.54 million, would have an equivalent electrolysis capacity of 1.22MW and produce an estimated 77 tons of green hydrogen per annum,” Dublin-based Fusion Fuel said today. “The output from the facility will be used by the Sines Renewable Energy Community.” The project will feature a special proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser developed by Fusion Fuel. “The tech is Portuguese and also the factory,” the company told PV Magazine. Called Hevo, the electrolyser is powered by a concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) cell, which converts more than 40% of the solar energy it captures into electricity. The remaining 60% is released as thermal energy. By coupling directly to the CPV unit, Hevo can use electrical energy without transport or conversion losses to power the electrochemical reaction while using thermal energy to preheat the feed water and reduce the energy load needed to split the water molecule. “In a place with 2,100 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year of solar irradiation, which coincides with the annual average in the south of Portugal, each Hevo Solar [unit] can produce 1 ton of hydrogen per year,” said Fusion Fuel Green, adding “it is also designed to use renewable energy from the grid or other sources to operate at night or when the sun is not shining, which would double the annual production of each unit.”
India’s Adani Group and Canadian PEM fuel cell producer Ballard Power Systems have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to evaluate a joint investment in the commercialisation of hydrogen fuel cells for mobility and industrial applications in India. “Under the MoU, both parties will examine various options to cooperate, including potential collaboration for fuel cell manufacturing in India,” Adani Group wrote yesterday.
Researchers at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) have demonstrated an “easily produced” composite of gallium and aluminium creates aluminium nanoparticles that react rapidly with water at room temperature, to yield large amounts of hydrogen. “We don’t need any energy input and it bubbles hydrogen like crazy. I’ve never seen anything like it,” said UCSC chemistry professor Scott Oliver who, together with professor Bakthan Singaram, wrote a paper on the finding, which was published last week in Applied Nano Materials. “The gallium was easily recovered for reuse after the reaction, which yields 90% of the hydrogen that could theoretically be produced from [the] reaction of all the aluminium in the composite,” the researchers wrote. A US patent application is pending on the technology.
The government of Niger has signed an agreement with Germany’s Emerging Energy Corporation (EEC) to work together to explore and develop commercial green hydrogen projects in the African state. “Emerging Energy Corporation will also invest in various project[s] to decarbonise oil field operations and refineries in Niger with carbon capture technologies,” EEC said yesterday. “Green hydrogen will be produced in Niger by electrolysis, using renewable power.  This low-carbon solution will decarbonise emission-intensive industries in Niger, Africa, Europe and other countries that depend a lot on fossil fuels.” The agreement came after last week’s summit between the African Union and the EU. German economy and climate protection minister Robert Habeck last week said hydrogen will ramp up very quickly in a short time as he visited energy company Apex Energy, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Euro-African co-operation plans include a project consortium led by Norwegian clean energy company Scatec, which is planning to install an electrolyser near the Suez Canal ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.
Australian engineer Worley, Swedish-Swiss electrical equipment firm ABB, and American tech giant IBM have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop an “integrated, digitally enabled solution for facility owners to build green hydrogen assets more quickly, cheaply, and safely, and operate them more efficiently.” Worley will provide engineering, procurement, and construction expertise; ABB electrical infrastructure input, automation, operations digitalisation and optimisation, and energy management; and IBM will support systems integration.
Belgian consortium Hyoffwind – comprising generation company Virya Energy and gas transport system operator Fluxys – has signed an agreement with compatriot businesses the mechanical engineer John Cockerill and construction company Besix to design and build a green hydrogen production unit in Zeebrugge. “The permit application process was begun in late 2021 and the consortium expects to receive a permit by mid-2022,” said Fluxys last week. “The final investment decision, which is also subject to the granting of subsidies by the Flemish government under the [Covid] recovery plan, will be made in the course of 2022.” John Cockerill has reported solid growth in its electrolyser business and last week claimed to be “the global leader in the supply of electrolysers in 2021, with a 33% market share of shipments.” The business sold almost 200MW of electrolyser capacity last year to book a threefold annual rise in hydrogen revenue. The company said it shipped two stacks of electrolysers in November which had a unit power of 6.5MW, which John Cokerill described as “the largest in the world.”
The Hy24 joint venture between French private investment house Ardian and Swiss hydrogen asset management company FiveT Hydrogen will acquire a 30% stake in the renewables division of Spanish energy company Enagás. The Enagás Renovable start-up was founded in 2019 with a portfolio of more than 50 Spanish renewable gas and decarbonisation projects. The furthest advanced projects represent more than 750MW of electrolysis capacity with planned commercial operation dates between next year and 2026. “This deal follows the first investment made earlier this month in participating [in] the €200 million fund rais[ing round] of the German company Hy2gen AG,” Hy24 said today.
University College London (UCL) spin-out company Bramble Energy has closed a £35 million (€42 million) investment round which should help the company expand its hydrogen fuel cell stack operations. “UCL engineers think about solutions that will ‘change the world’ and the faculty of engineering is very entrepreneurially-minded, incubating young companies such as Bramble to maximise the chances of success,” said UCL chemical engineering professor Dan Brett last week. Brett is the co-founder of Bramble Energy, a company led by UK-based investor HydrogenOne Capital Growth and supported by institutional investors including the BGF small business investor set up by the biggest UK banks in the wake of the financial crisis; London-based university intellectual property investors IP Group and Parkwalk Advisors; and the UCL Technology Fund which is part of London based investor Albion Capital Group.
The UK is collaborating with several countries in the hydrogen sector. Last week, for instance, the British government spoke with Australian politicians about measures to boost bilateral cooperation and work more closely in the Indo-Pacific. “[UK-based fund manager] Octopus Australia is partnering with an indigenous business group to create Desert Springs Octopus, a project worth £26 billion (€31.2 billion) over ten years that will deliver wind, solar and hydrogen energy,” the British government announced last week. 
The UK is also proceeding with natural gas powered blue hydrogen plans. The Eni UK unit of the Italian energy company this month announced it has signed agreements with 19 companies interested in having their emissions captured, transported and stored at Eni UK’s depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, as part of the HyNet North West industrial decarbonisation project focused on the North West of England and North Wales.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/24/price-spike-in-sa-perhaps-because-of-sudden-drop-in-output-at-bungala-solar-farm/,"MARKETS,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 24, 2022",Price spike in SA – (perhaps) because of sudden drop in output at Bungala Solar Farm?,"From Watt Clarity 
As noted before, there’s been a cacophony of commentary (at all different points of the the Emotion-o-meter) stemming from recent announcements which we view under a heading of ‘The Messy Collapse of Coal’ (something we wrote about in some detail inside GenInsights21).
1)  Hence it was an uncanny coincidence that one of the largest coal units saw fit to trip on Monday 21st February, with the trip being being a major contributor to the spike that occurred in the NSW and QLD regions on Monday afternoon.
2)  Understandably there have been a number of people (including RenewEconomy here) highlight this event as an example of some pretty simplistic thinking inside of the Federal Government.  Does not take long on social media to find others echoing this thought (to be frank, the Federal Government’s making it very easy for critics to poke holes):

… but in all the political point scoring (from both ‘sides’) are we not losing sight of the bigger picture?
Today in South Australia, the market appears to have received a reminder that NEMDE is technology agnostic, and that all types of technologies can experience their own challenges leading to price volatility.
The 5-minute dispatch in the South Australian region spiked to $4,031.78/MWh … so not as high as was the case in NSW on South Australia, but with bid volumes so thin at such high price levels it probably would not have taken much more for the price to pop all the way to the Market Price Cap (currently $15,100/MWh).

As with every price spike there is almost always more than one factor contributing – and this appears to be the case today in South Australia.  Here’s three for a start, related to the numbering on the above snapshot from ez2view at 14:45 (NEM time).
It’s a pretty rare event when prices spike and interconnectors are unconstrained right across the NEM … on Monday it was the VIC-NSW interconnector and today it was the Heywood and Murraylink interconnectors.
Based on the constraint data publicly available at this time it does not appear that any wind farms in South Australia were constrained at this point in time (e.g. for System Strength reasons, or due to local network limits), and with healthy prices it seems highly unlikely that any wind farms have bid themselves out of the market – which leads to the conclusion that it’s low wind conditions leading to aggregate output of barely 100MW at this point in time across all Wind Farms in South Australia.
The red colour coding in the image above has resulted from a sudden increase in output – from the ‘Final MW’ level metered at 14:40 to the ‘Final MW’ level metered at 14:45 (note that ez2view is in Time Travel Mode here).
What’s more important from a NEMDE perspective is the sudden drop that occurred in the 5 minutes preceding this.  Both BNGSF1 and BNGSF2 dropped output in between 14:35 and 14:40 – with BNGSF2 being the slightly larger drop (41MW, or a drop in output of almost 50% of what it had been beforehand), as shown in the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view here:

Note that the table has been focused on the (prior) 14:40 dispatch interval, which shows the drop in output – which we presume* would have fed through into the Availability forecast for both units for the 14:45 dispatch interval … which (given the lack of wind and import capability) would have triggered the price spike.
* there’s not full visibility of what’s happening within the market within the ‘Current Day’ so we need to make some assumptions
As noted before, we released GenInsights21 on 15th December 2022, and since then, the readership has continued to grow.
One of the early readers of the publication was Bella Peacock from PV Magazine … and one of the conclusions that jumped out at Bella from the report was that …
“In summary: our electricity generation is becoming more variable and uncertain, which is not necessarily bad but does add layers of complexity to a system already piling them on faster than a game of Uno. Each of these layers of complexity is shadowed by an additional layer of risk.
New risks mean new premiums. Which leads us to the question, who pays? Again, you get the picture. Clusterf*ck.”
Bella’s article here was fittingly titled ‘Variability compounding complexity compounding risk: the state of play in the NEM today’.
For those who have an interest, here’s some of the other comments people have made about GenInsights21.
In essence, what happened on Monday in NSW and what happened today in South Australia are both examples of the same underlying dynamic … the NEM is increasingly sitting on a knife edge, with not much required (i.e. any type of ‘trip’, for instance) to tip it ‘over the edge’.
Again this week I am wondering whether it’s possible for us all to collectively cool the ideological barrage and really think through what we’re expecting to happen as we move together through this energy transition….

Called Alaminos Energy Storage, the facility consists of two 20MW storage facilities that are planned to store power when electricity demand is low while also providing rapid power charging and ancillary services to the national grid.
“The facility holds 24 battery containers with SAFT 2.5MWh lithium-ion batteries, enough to power about 20,000 homes and avoid 35.87 metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The Alaminos solar plant is located in Alaminos, Laguna province, in the Calabarzon region’s island of Luzon. The plant began commercial operations in June.
Several large scale storage projects were completed or announced in the Philippines over the past months.
The power arm of the Philippines-based brewing-to-energy conglomerate San Miguel Corporation (SMC) recently said it is ready to start operations of an initial 690MW of battery storage facilities. These projects include a 470MW/470MWh portfolio that UK storage specialist Fluence is developing with San Miguel. The first 20MW/20MWh battery energy storage system of this portfolio was commissioned in late January.
