The company is also looking to move forward with its projects, including the subsea cables between Darwin and Singapore, but at a significantly more modest scale, at least initially.
In a statement, SunCable said its ambition is to now deliver just ~6 GW of firmed renewable energy in multiple stages, beginning with delivering “at least” 900 MW of green power to Darwin and 1.75 GW to Singapore.
To realise this, the company will be split into a domestic Australian division, to be overseen by Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners – Australian founded investment company which also holds a stake in the project. 
Meanwhile, the international division will continue working on the Australia-Asia Power Link (AAPowerLink) proposal to build a high voltage (HV) subsea cable between Darwin and Singapore. To that end, the company will lodge its submission to the Singaporean Energy Market Authority to gain the energy import conditional licence later this month.
If SunCable is able to deliver this first stage, it will move forward with its original megaproject proposal to build up to 20 GW of solar near Powell Creek in the NT.

SunCable went into administration earlier this year following a fallout between its two key billionaire investors, Mike Canon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest. Its buyout was completed today from a consortium led by Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures. In terms of Quinbrook’s role in SunCable, the company said: “Quinbrook is providing a range of development services to Grok and SunCable including prospective customer engagement, project construction and operations and has rights to make a substantial equity investment into the onshore projects.”
New components for SunCable have also been flagged, including that the company plans to establish an advanced HV subsea cable manufacturing and testing facility, with AAPowerLink as an anchor customer. “SunCable is in discussions with established global subsea cable manufacturers to jointly develop, construct and operate this facility,” it said in a statement.
Beyond this, SunCable’s eventual plan now involves flooding Darwin with green energy, with the company flagging it wants to deliver an additional 3 GW of renewable electricity for customers in Darwin, representing nearly ~4 GW in total.
These figures are vastly more than the Territory’s demand and current grid capacity. That is, the project is banking on supplying a yet-to-be established green manufacturing industry, excitement over which has swept through Australia in the last year. This includes supplying the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct in Darwin, where vanadium hopeful Tivan is seeking to establish itself.
“The availability of competitively priced, 24/7 renewable electricity offers the opportunity to underpin a new wave of green industrial development in the region, supporting local jobs and the growth of sustainable new industries which could include hydrogen electrolysis, critical minerals processing, e-fuels and green data centres,” the SunCable statement says.
The company is planning to draw on large institutional investors to fund its projects, with Grok Ventures CEO Jeremy Kwong-Law commenting: “Once all milestones are reached and we reach financial investment decision (FID), we have a high conviction that large institutional investors and debt providers will fund the capital expenditure to construct the project.”
As the company noted, “the Australia-Asia Power Link is SunCable’s flagship project and encompasses five key infrastructure components:
1. Solar precinct: solar precinct in the Northern Territory with capacity of up to 20 GW
2. Overhead transmission line: ~800km HVDC overhead transmission line (OHTL) from the
solar precinct to Murrumujuk (NE Darwin)
3. Darwin converter site: terminal location for the OHTL and converts electricity from HVDC
to HVAC for connection to Darwin, before being converted back to HVDC for
transmission to Singapore
4. HVDC subsea cable system: approximately 4,300km in length from Darwin converter site
to Singapore
5. Singapore converter site: The HVDC power is converted via a Voltage Source Converter
(VSC) to connect to the local network.”

The new coal royalties scheme is expected to generate a total of $2.7 billion for NSW over four years from 2024.
While the usual suspects, including the National Party, railed against the move, it has been welcomed by many in the clean energy industries, including think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF).
Its Director, Tim Buckley, said: “CEF prefers the Queensland government’s progressive royalty approach, which only applies in full less than once a decade or or even more infrequently, at times of coal export sector superprofits, but an increased share in NSW to guarantee a fairer return to public coffers is definitely a good start.”
““The previous flat 6-8% coal export royalty rate in NSW was long overdue for review and uplift. The NSW decision today is an example of our government finally standing up to the self-serving coal lobby and acting in the public interest to ensure an appropriate return to the people of the state from the use of its finite sovereign public assets, appropriately applying the proceeds to alleviate the energy poverty the fossil fuel industry has inflicted on consumers as it rakes in superprofits,” Buckley added.

It seems the partnership will focus on deploying renewable technologies on new warehouse builds, though retrofitting may also be part of the program.
The renewable energy program, which will boost real asset manager ESR’s sustainability credentials, is set to invest $500 million over the next ten years. While solar is a major part of that program, battery storage appears the mainstay – with the companies saying they expect to deploy 300 MW, though it is not clear what kind of durations they are looking into. 
The pair are seeking to install roughly 125,000 solar panels, capable of generating 500 MW.
According to the Australian Financial Review, the partnership will see ESR and Solar Bay establish a new company to sell energy generated from these behind-the-meter systems back to warehouse tenants.

“ESR Australia will work closely with our customers to provide bespoke energy solutions with a view to offering savings of up to 50% on their energy bills with retail providers,” ESR Australia CEO, Phil Pearce, said.
“The multi-year partnership also allows us to maximise renewable energy penetration across ESR’s development pipeline by implementing innovative electrification solutions like embedded networks during the build stage,” Solar Bay Director and Co-Founder, James Doyle, added.
The pair say their renewable infrastructure strategy will “continually evaluate opportunities for the installation of solar across ESR Australia’s 4.1 million sqm portfolio and 2.3 million sqm development pipeline.”

Researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the US have analysed the technical potential for floating PV (FPV) in the 10 countries that are part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The assessment, which is the first-of-its-kind for Southeast Asia, included 88 reservoirs, including hydropower and non-hydropower facilities, and 7,213 natural waterbodies in the final dataset.
The group found that the FPV technical potential for the region ranges from 134–278 GW on reservoirs and 343–768 GW on natural waterbodies. When waterbody types are taken into consideration, the technical potential for FPV is higher on reservoirs in Laos and Malaysia, while natural waterbodies hold the greater potential in Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The potential is equivalent across waterbody types in Vietnam.
“Our results show that the average net capacity factor, which accounts for inverter losses, does not change significantly between the waterbody types and various distance sensitivities for monofacial panels (the average net capacity factor varied from 15.6–16.0%),” the researchers said, noting that the average net capacity factor increases by a factor of 1.05 with the use of bifacial fixed tilt panels, based on previous analyses.
NREL’s team used a high-level geospatial assessment methodology to develop a total of four technical potential scenarios based on two different FPV types – monofacial and bifacial – and two waterbody types – reservoirs and natural waterbodies. The study builds off previous research by including non-hydropower reservoirs, inland natural waterbodies, and bifacial PV panels. In addition, the group uses high temporal and spatial resolution solar irradiance data that was not available for previous technical potential assessments.
“Overall, the modelled technical potential for FPV on natural waterbodies is higher than that of reservoirs. However, the actual developable capacity on natural waterbodies might be significantly lower due to site-specific constraints and environmental impact considerations,” the academics explained, adding that waterbodies that are more than 50 km from major roads and those within protected areas were excluded from the analysis.
Thailand had the top potential for FPV on reservoirs, with 576 suitable waterbodies, a capacity of 57,645 MW, and generation of 83,781 GWh/Year. The top potential for FPV on natural waterbodies was found in Indonesia, which has 2,719 suitable waterbodies, 271,897 MW of capacity, and 369,059 GWh/year of generation.
“Overall, these findings indicate significant technical potential for FPV in each country and across the region,” the researchers said. “Several countries have ambitious renewable energy targets, mainly focused on solar, hydropower, and wind deployment. FPV presents an additional RE option that can leverage existing infrastructure, especially existing hydropower capacity, and support ongoing and increasingly ambitious decarbonisation efforts in the region.”
Their findings are available in the report “Enabling Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FPV) Deployment: FPV Technical Potential Assessment for Southeast Asia,” published on NREL’s website. The study is claimed to “help policymakers and planners better understand the role that FPV could play in meeting regional energy demand and could ultimately help inform investment decisions.”
“Detailed market and economic technical potential assessments will be needed to further assess the FPV opportunities in each country. For specific sites, detailed site-specific analysis will need to be conducted given the lack of bathymetry, wind, wave, and sediment data at a regional level,” the scientists concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/07/the-case-for-hard-carbon-based-sodium-ion-batteries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2023",The case for hard carbon-based sodium-ion batteries,"From pv magazine Global
Sodium-ion batteries have attracted extensive attention for their advantages over ubiquitous lithium-ion technology, including low-cost raw materials, improved safety, fast charging capabilities, and low temperature performance. With the technology on the cusp of commercialisation, the search for electrode materials with high electrochemical performance is ongoing and hard carbon is emerging as the most promising anode material.
Now, a new research paper authored by scientists from Fuzhou University in China and the University of Macau has summarised the challenges as well as the perspectives on the future of hard carbon.
The researchers note that the commercialisation of hard carbon still faces technical issues of low initial Coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance, and insufficient cycling stability, due to the intrinsically irregular microstructure of hard carbon.
“To address these challenges, the rational design of the hard carbon microstructure is crucial for achieving high-performance sodium-ion batteries, via gaining an in-depth understanding of its structure–performance correlations,” they write.
Furthermore, their review looks into a range of research studies brought about by the emergence of hard carbon electrodes, covering in the process the sodium storage mechanism of hard carbon electrodes, the selection of hard carbon precursors, electrolyte matching engineering, and the requirements for practical commercial engineering.
The researchers highlight the importance of precursor selection with most hard carbon electrode precursors derived from biomass materials and industrial product derivatives, such as cellulose, ginkgo leaf, glucose, cotton, resin, sucrose, or glucose. “The selection of low-cost, scalable precursors has become a key factor affecting hard carbon’s commercialisation,” they write.
Their review also considers various sodium storage mechanisms, such as the insertion–nanopore filling model, absorption-insertion model, absorption-nanopore filling model, or absorption-insertion nanopore filling model, which can yield hard carbon materials with different properties.
In addition, the researchers underline the importance of matching the hard carbon electrode with the right electrolyte as an important factor for the electrochemical performance of the batteries. They note that ester electrolytes are a poor match with hard carbon, and therefore the search for high-voltage ester electrolytes should be a priority.
“In the future, determining how to construct high-performance hard carbon to achieve practical commercial applications of sodium-ion batteries is crucial, and this will require a thorough understanding of the real sodium-ion storage mechanism, hard carbon preparation and precursor selection, and electrolyte regulation,” the researchers write.
Finally, the paper highlights directions for the future development of hard carbon to achieve the commercialisation of high-performance sodium-ion batteries.
This includes further study of the mechanism of hard carbon sodium storage to help improve the electrochemical performance of hard carbon electrodes, further improvement of their electrochemical performance, development of precursor materials with low cost, low energy consumption, and high carbon yield, and those derived from industrial waste product material, as well as presodiation treatments that can ensure high Coulombic efficiency and optimise the energy density of the battery.
“While the emergence of hard carbon electrodes has indeed promoted the commercialisation of sodium-ion batteries, more work is still needed to make commercialisation a reality, the researchers write in the paper titled “Revitalizing sodium-ion batteries via controllable microstructures and advanced electrolytes for hard carbon,” published in eScience.
