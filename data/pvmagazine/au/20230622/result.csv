“There will be no transition without transmission,” Transgrid Chief Executive Officer Brett Redman said in a statement.
“With over 80% of coal-fired capacity in NSW expected to retire and 28 GW of new renewable and storage capacity coming online in the next 10 years, we must urgently accelerate the investment in all areas of the energy transition.”
Transgrid’s existing 13,000km transmission system serves as the backbone of the National Energy Market (NEM), facilitating energy trading with its neighbouring states.
In the System Security Roadmap released on Wednesday, Transgrid outlines its plan to invest $14 billion to build 2,500km of new transmission lines and infrastructure. This includes a $7 billion spend to deliver the EnergyConnect, HumeLink and VNI West projects.
Transgrid said the “energy superhighway” will connect new large-scale renewable energy and storage to the grid, integrate five renewable energy zones, and expand transmission interconnection between regions and states.

The roadmap also reveals an estimated $2.2 billion will be spent on building new system security infrastructure to replace services currently provided by coal generators. The investment will deliver the equivalent of 21 large synchronous condensers.
“As coal generators become less available and retire, and new inverter-based renewables connect to the grid, new sources of system security services are urgently needed,” Transgrid said.
The network operator will also spend $300 million to deliver the “step-change” in analytical and operational capabilities and capacity required to operate an increasingly complex power system.
Transgrid said over the next decade it will invest $160 million to train and strengthen its workforce and $140 million to build new operational technology tools to ensure the secure operation of a “more complex and dynamic power system.”
Transgrid Network Executive General Manager Marie Jordan said the System Security Roadmap outlines the company’s plan to securely operate the grid of the future.
“We’ve spent a lot of time modelling our system and planning for the retirements of all the coal-fired generation making sure that we’re ready to move into a renewable future,” she said.
“We spent an entire year modelling our system with no thermal generation, with 100% variable generation. Now we know what the big picture is and as we go into the retirement of these plants, we aren’t solving it one off – we have a master plan.”

The Australian Parliament has passed amendments to its Treasury laws, paving the way for the CEFC to receive the first increase in its capital allocation since it was established in 2012 with $10 billion in capital.
The federal government said amendments have been approved providing for the CEFC to receive the first $11.5 billion of the new funding and allowing for a further $9 billion to be added by other new appropriations.
The additional funding includes $19 billion to help deliver the Rewiring the Nation program, which is the backbone of the federal government’s plan to cut emissions by 43% by 2030, while also reaching 82% renewable energy grid penetration.
The CEFC said the new funding will be utilised to help finance new high-voltage transmission links between states and regions, long-duration grid storage and electricity distribution network infrastructure as the nation transitions from thermal generation to renewable energy.
The increase in capital funding also includes $1 billion to create the Household Energy Upgrades Fund which will provide discounted consumer finance to increase sustainability across the housing sector and $500 million for a new Powering Australia Technology Fund which will facilitate the development, commercialisation and take up of clean energy technologies.
CEFC Chief Executive Officer Ian Learmonth said he expects the first investments funded by the new capital will be announced in the coming months in a bid to fast-track the decarbonisation of Australia’s electricity sector and secure a strong and stable clean energy supply.
“We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge or the pace at which this transformation must occur, especially in light of the economic and supply chain headwinds impacting many sectors of our economy, including energy,” he said.
“Subject to commercial considerations, we expect to make substantial grid-related investment decisions within the next 12 months.”
“While these transactions are often large and complex, we must move quickly to invest in the expansion and augmentation of our grid and related infrastructure to deliver on Australia’s net-zero objectives.”
Learmonth said public investment has an important role to play in the development of the transmission and infrastructure projects needed to build a grid that’s fit for a clean energy future.
“At the intersection of this revolution in low-emissions energy generation and distribution is government and private sector capital, delivered via new and tailored investment models that leverage the considerable market momentum toward sustainable green investment opportunities,” he said.
Learmonth said the “very substantial increase” in additional capital allocation will be invested alongside ongoing CEFC investment activities across the economy, including in renewable energy and energy efficiency, emerging cleantech and hydrogen opportunities.
CEFC Chair Steven Skala said the additional capital funding recognises the success of the CEFC model in investing to lead the market and proving up investment opportunities.
“The Rewiring the Nation program, Household Energy Upgrades Fund and Powering Australia Technology Fund substantially expand the role of the CEFC, alongside its ongoing core businesses,” he said.
“New large-scale investments in priority grid infrastructure projects complement our existing work in transforming our energy system and bringing the benefits of decarbonisation to key sectors of our economy.”
At 31 December 2022, the CEFC had made lifetime investment commitments of $11.7 billion. After repayments and returns on its investments, the CEFC had $4.6 billion available for ongoing investment activities from its original $10 billion funding allocation from the Australian government.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/22/officeworks-closes-on-100-renewables-with-solar-and-storage-solution/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 22, 2023",Officeworks closes on 100% renewables with solar and storage solution,"Officeworks’ Warana store on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast is now able to be powered by 100% renewable energy following the installation of a 100 kW solar array and 100 kWh lithium battery energy storage system.
When fully charged, the solar and battery system will have enough energy to satisfy approximately 70% of the store’s power requirements. The remainder is provided by an already established renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland government-owned energy generator and retailer CleanCo.
The 1,722 square-metre Warana retail outlet is the first of Officeworks’ 166 stores nationwide to be fitted with a behind-the-meter solar and battery storage system but Officeworks Energy and Carbon Manager Patrick Heagney said the company aims to have all Queensland stores running on 100% renewable energy within two years.
“While Warana is the first Officeworks store capable of using 100% renewable energy, much of our store network uses onsite generation and where possible renewable electricity procurement,” he said. “By 2025 all Queensland stores will operate using 100% renewable energy, which is an important step as a brand, as we work towards using 100% renewable energy by 2025 and net-zero emissions by 2030.”
Officeworks, as part of the Perth-based Wesfarmers retailer conglomerate, inked a long-term agreement with CleanCo in 2022 to source renewable energy from large-scale wind and solar farms to power its stores.
The renewable energy will come from CleanCo’s offtake agreements with French developer Neoen’s 400 MW Western Downs Solar Farm near Chinchilla in Queensland’s southwest. The PPA will also utilise energy sourced from the 1,026 MW MacIntyre Wind Farm being built by Spanish renewables developer Acciona Energia near Warwick in Queensland’s Southern Downs region.

Officeworks Chief Financial Officer Brendan Hargreaves said the agreement with CleanCo would be critical for the company to achieve its renewable energy ambitions but said the introduction of behind-the-meter battery energy storage is also a significant step forward.
“The introduction of our first lithium battery is an important step for our business, and we’re really proud that we can deliver something that’s good for people and the planet, while also making good business sense,” he said.
“The rising cost of living, increasing energy prices, inflationary pressure, and the impacts of climate change, means that we need to look at new ways to innovate, while ensuring we’re investing in a sustainable future for us all.”
“By creating and procuring our own energy, and working alongside clean energy providers like CleanCo Queensland, we can create our own energy and lower our costs of doing business – all while knowing that we’re making a positive impact for future generations.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/22/global-benchmark-for-solar-irradiance-data-released-by-iea-pvps/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 22, 2023",Global benchmark for solar irradiance data released by IEA-PVPS,"From pv magazine Global
Solar irradiance plays a crucial role in managing PV assets throughout the world. Numerous institutional and commercial providers offer modelled solar irradiance data, making it challenging for users to determine the most suitable providers for their specific applications and locations.
Now, IEA-PVPS Task 16 has produced a worldwide benchmark of modelled solar irradiance data to help the solar industry to make better-informed decisions about solar resource assessments.
The study gives a point of reference for model-derived direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data, using 129 high-quality ground-based radiation measurement stations across the globe from 2015 to 2020. It then compares DNI and GHI estimates from 10 solar radiation datasets, either public-domain or commercial, against this reference point. The datasets are ACCESSG3, DWDSARAH, CAMS v3.2, KNMISEVIRI, CAMS pre-v4, METEOTEST, CERES, NSRDBGOES, CSIROHIMAWARI, and Solargis.
The comparison is conducted at hourly temporal resolution and the performance of the modelled information is analysed with respect to different regions and climate zones.
IEA-PVPS says the quality of the reference database is assured by selecting data based on a “comprehensive set of best practices and newly implemented quality-control procedures. These include automatic and manual data quality-control tests carried out by a team of experts for all stations and result in flags describing the quality for each time stamp.” Of the total 129 stations, 31 are in Africa, 31 in Asia, 27 in North America, 20 in Europe, 13 in Australia, five in South America, and two in Antarctica. The report calculates the mean bias deviation, root mean square deviation, and standard deviation between the benchmark and each station across the 2015-20 period.
“The benchmark results have shown noticeable deviations in performance between the various modeled data sets,” the report says. “In particular, it was found that the most appropriate data set actually depends on both site and climate or continent of interest. Some stations are especially challenging for some models, as evidenced by the high deviations observed for several data sets in difficult environments (e.g., high mountains or coastal areas).”
The report showed that the model errors and the differences between the various modeled data sets are much higher for DNI than for GHI, because of the former’s higher sensitivity to aerosols, clouds, and elevation, among other factors.
As for dataset-specific results, the study shows that CERES had significantly higher deviations than all other satellite-derived datasets, likely due to its coarser resolution. Solargis showed the lowest average deviation metrics and was also the best performer at many individual stations, according to IEA-PVPS.
“From a methodological standpoint, this benchmark underlined the importance of the reference data quality. Without a stringent quality control procedure, no real validation can be done, with the risk of obtaining invalid results,” the researchers concluded.

A group of Belgian companies and research entities is currently trying to reuse silicon from end-of-life solar panels for the production of composite silicon carbon anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
The Resiliex project, funded by the European Union, aims to demonstrate eight innovative technological solutions for carbon-free silicon production. Two research groups, including scientists from the University of Liege, are involved. One team, Greenmat, focuses on recycling silicon from solar modules for lithium-ion batteries. The second team, known as Gemme, develops technologies to recover silicon and silver from end-of-life panels.
The Si/C powders derived from recycled silicon have the potential to enhance the performance and charging capacity of high-energy batteries, enabling electric vehicles to travel longer distances on a single charge. The researchers also highlight the batteries’ suitability for stationary energy storage.
In addition to Recma Group and the Comet Group, which participate in the project, Ghent University researchers assess the environmental impact of new silicon solutions and explore recycling methods to reduce the environmental impact of mining and manufacturing.
The Resilex project, launched in 2022 with funding from HorizonEurope, includes the European PV association SolarPower Europe.
