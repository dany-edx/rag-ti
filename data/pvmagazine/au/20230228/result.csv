In 2022 Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm noted Australia buys more of the company’s Powerwall home batteries than its lauded electric vehicles.

While its Powerwall product has proven wildly popular in its six years on the market, its pricing has been something of a sore point. Tesla has consistently raised the cost of its battery hardware, ballooning from a start price of just $9,600 back in 2017.
The price hit a high point in October 2022, reaching $16,230 – a figure inclusive of GST, but not installation.
On Feb. 14, 2023, the company informed its installers that “ongoing improvements in supply chains and foreign exchange” had led the company to finally reverse its pricing trend, dropping the recommended Powerwall price by over $1,600, to $14,599.
Though the Powerwall remains significantly more expensive than it was in 2017, Tesla has maintained its position as Australia’s most popular battery brand. 
As of July 2022, Australia had installed more than 33,000 Tesla Powerwall home battery systems, accounting for a nearly 12% share of the company’s total global Powerwall installations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/28/australian-startup-buys-collapsed-battery-maker-britishvolt-doubling-its-manufacturing-ambitions/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",Australia-based startup buys collapsed battery maker Britishvolt,"Australia-based startup Recharge Industries, owned by US fund Scale Facilitation, has acquired Britishvolt’s assets and business, after the company went into administration in January.
Before running out of capital earlier this year, Britishvolt had planned to build a $6.6 billion (GBP 3.8 billion, USD 4.71 billion) lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing plant in Cambois, northern England. At full capacity, Britishvolt’s proposed 30 GWh factory envisioned making enough cells for more than 300,000 lithium-ion batteries every year.
Recharge Industries has now acquired Britishvolt after finalising a deal with its administrators, who had selected Recharge as their preferred bidder from a field of contenders. The price of the deal has not been made public.
In January, Recharge Industries made a splash by announcing its plan to construct a lithium-ion gigafactory in Geelong, Victoria. It is aiming to begin construction on that project by the end of the year, targeting 2 GWh of production annually in 2024 before also scaling up to 30 GWh of storage capacity per year.

Recharge was founded by Australian David Collard, a former PwC partner now based in New York. The startup is part of the portfolio of another Collard venture, a US fund called Scale Facilitation. 
Far from detracting from the Geelong plans, Collard says the acquisition of Britishvolt will supercharge its Australian vision. “This is the definition of synergy. We now have so many economies of scale, and we have a global manufacturing footprint that aligns,” Collard told The Australian Financial Review.
Crucial to Recharge Industries’ pitch is that it will use battery technology from US company C4V, removing the expense of developing its own process. “Our technology – including an exclusive license for the intellectual property and battery technology – has been developed and validated over the last decade through C4V in the US and will be the backbone of both gigafactories in Geelong and Cambois,” Collard said.

Recharge Industries has repeatedly publicised that its battery cells won’t use materials from China or Russia. Instead, the startup’s plans rest on partnerships between the three countries in the Aukus trilateral security pact: Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Indeed, Collard has described Recharge’s projects as “a flagship for friendshoring.”
Given this, it appears likely Recharge will opt to use Australian materials for its Britishvolt play. As part of the deal, Recharge will also reportedly take over the 27 battery experts still on Britishvolt’s payroll.
Collard has said he hopes Australian superannuation funds will get behind Recharge, which has now doubled its ambitions by taking on Britishvolt. “This provides a great opportunity for Australian superannuation funds to co-invest with the UK fund manager, or invest through their existing fund structure… helping an Australian company scale,” he told AFR.

It appears the Geelong gigafactory will be first cab off the rank, with Collard noting construction in the UK would take another year.
“Backed by our global supply chain, strategic delivery partners and a number of significant customer agreements in place, we’re confident of making the [Britishvolt] Cambois gigafactory a success and growing it into an advanced green energy project,” Collard said.
Today, China accounts for a vast majority of lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Australia, on the other hand, is the globe’s leading lithium supplier, and tops that list for a range of other commodities vital for making batteries and other renewable equipment.

The push to “friendshore” new energy supply chains has taken on a new sense of urgency with the shifting geopolitics of 2022, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The move has also been propelled by US President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes massive funding support to build clean energy manufacturing capability in the US and, seemingly, partner countries like Australia.
“Working with our closest allies, America (sic) and Australia, and using world-leading and proven technology, now we can take Britishvolt forward with real purpose,” said Edward Dawes, Scale Facilitation’s UK-based advisor.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/28/lightsource-bp-reportedly-looks-to-sell-package-of-australian-solar-farms/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",Lightsource bp looks to sell package of Australian solar farms,"Lightsource bp, an equal joint venture between renewables developer Lightsource and global oil giant bp, is reportedly making moves to sell three of its operational Australian solar farms, and potentially another two under construction, according to the Australian Financial Review. 
Citing a pitch prepared by Macquarie Capital, Lightsource bp is looking to sell its 200 MWp Wellington Solar Farm and the 107 MW (DC) West Wyalong Solar Farm, both in New South Wales, as well as the 210 MW (DC) Woolooga solar farm in Queensland.
The company is also considering including its enormous 400 MW (DC) Wellington North project and 90 MW (DC) Wunghnu Solar Farm in the package, potentially making it a five asset deal that the AFR reports could be worth $1 billion.

The sale would afford Lightsource bp capital to realise the megaprojects it has in its Australian pipeline. Based on the company’s total megawatts of solar generation capacity as of August 2022, Lightsource bp is Australia’s largest solar developer and owner.
Macquarie Capital’s “soft soundings” on the package sale have reportedly been designed to inform a two-part auction, slated to kick off in April. 
An information memorandum is expected to be made available in the second quarter, with the binding offer phase due mid-year.
Macquarie has approached infrastructure fund managers and Australian utilities to consider purchasing the portfolio of solar assets, the AFR noted.
According to the pitch, Lightsource bp could either sell the assets in full, or potentially retain a minority stake. The company appears also to be open to continuing to run the assets under an operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement, though this will depend on how the potential deal progresses.
Lightsource bp has Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and offtake deals for almost all of the assets included in the potential sale – having previously signed deals with Mars, Engie, bp, and Australian beer brand XXXX.
Lightsource bp has been one of Australia’s most successful solar developers to date, with particularly notable projects in NSW. 
On top of the 1 GWp of Australian projects in operation or under construction already, in 2022 Lightsource bp said there was a further 3 GWp planned for Australia and New Zealand.

“We see the acceleration of renewables happening more rapidly than previously anticipated, and expect our operations in Australia to make a significant contribution to meeting Lightsource bp’s global target of 25 GW of solar by 2025,” Lightsource bp’s Managing Director for Australia and New Zealand Adam Pegg said.
Its 400 MW Wellington North project, currently being constructed next to its 200 MWp Wellington Solar Farm near Dubbo, is expected to be operational by 2024. Likewise, the company expects its 90 MW (DC) Wunghnu Solar Farm in Victoria’s Goulburn Valley to be completed within this timeframe, having had Wunghnu reach financial close last December.
The company has even bigger projects in the pipeline though – which is potentially why it is looking to sell its realised projects. Those include the 840 MW (DC) Sandy Creek solar farm and battery project, located 25 kilometres southwest of Dunedoo in the New South Wales Central West. Lightsource is currently preparing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project.
It is also in the early stages of developing the Goulburn River hybrid project. Located between Wollar and Merriwa in the Upper Hunter Region of NSW, the project will include 588 MWp of solar with a 296 MWp battery system. The company expects to submit the EIS for Goulburn any day now, noting early 2023 on its website.

According to Infradebt, the ETF will provide “senior debt finance” for six to eight utility-scale battery projects with a total capacity of 1.5 GW to 2 GW over coming years.
The ETF’s first two investments consist of loans to the 100 MW/200 MWh Neon Capital Battery outside Canberra and the 50 MW/100 MWh Genex Bouldercombe BESS southwest of Rockhampton in Queensland. For the latter project the ETF is the sole financer, though both projects are expected to begin operations in 2023.
Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures wasn’t the only investor in the ETF’s first round, with more funds coming from JANA Diversified Infrastructure Trust and others.
Infradebt CEO Alexander Austin described energy storage, and grid-scale batteries in particular, as “a key element to facilitating the orderly and rapid decarbonisation of the grid. Decarbonisation requires the rapid buildout of wind and solar and dispatchable grid-scale storage to allow the matching of supply and demand on a 24 x 7 x 365 (sic) basis.”
Grok Ventures CEO Jeremy Kwong-Law noted that accelerating Australia’s decarbonisation efforts was key its investment. “Since investing in Infradebt Ethical Fund back in 2017, we’ve closely observed Infradebt identifying gaps in the capital stack to accelerate Australia’s decarbonisation efforts, whilst providing solid risk adjusted returns,” said Kwong-Law. “We believe ETF will be another fund to deliver returns and accelerate decarbonisation of our grid.”
Infradebt has financed 43 projects since its 2014 launch.
In 2022, Cannon-Brookes led a protracted take over attempt of Australia’s biggest gen-tailer, AGL. Though Cannon-Brookes’ attempts were ultimately stifled, he did manage to block the company’s demerger after Grok Ventures became AGL’s biggest shareholder.
According to the Australian Financial Review, the ETF could total as much as $1 billion (USD 673 million), though only the first two aforementioned batteries are finalised.

Wood Mackenzie says that global capacity for hydrogen project announcements hit 71.4 million tons per annum (Mtpa) in 2022. “Despite a record 12 Mtpa of project capacity announcements in the first quarter of 2022, the global hydrogen pipeline slowed through the year, with only 1 Mtpa of new projects announced in Q4 – falling short of total capacity announcements in 2021 by 3 Mtpa,” said Wood Mackenzie. It said a record 45 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolysers were announced in the fourth quarter.
ETH Zurich researchers have found that large-scale, hydrogen-based heating is not a financially viable option in the European Union. “Green hydrogen was shown to be uneconomical due to a large amount of renewable energy infrastructure required,” the team said in “Planetary boundaries assessment of deep decarbonisation options for building heating in the European Union,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion and Management. “The cost driver for hydrogen was generally high-end user costs for local hydrogen storage.” They said the building heating sector can be made sustainable by expanding renewable electricity, combined with heat pumps.
IHI has signed a deal with ACME to study the feasibility of producing and using green ammonia from renewable energy. Japan-based IHI said it will consider green ammonia production projects in Oman, India, the United States, and Egypt, as well as the use of ammonia for decarbonised power generation in Asia and other parts of the world. 
TES and Energie 360° have announced a plan to use existing global energy infrastructure to supply customers with renewable synthetic methane (eNG), which is produced by combining green hydrogen and CO2. “TES wants to supply Energie 360° with eNG produced in regions that have large amounts of renewable energy,” said the two companies. “In return, Energie 360° wants to supply renewable CO2, for example from its own energy plants.”
Hyliko has revealed plans to integrate Toyota’s second-generation hydrogen fuel cell modules into heavy-duty trucks for their zero-emission fleet offering. The French startup said it plans to offer all of the main components of an eco-cluster: a fuel cell truck, the supply of green hydrogen, and a leasing and maintenance scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/02/28/catl-offers-big-battery-discounts-amid-looming-lithium-surplus/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,FINANCE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"FEBRUARY 28, 2023",CATL offers big battery discounts amid looming lithium surplus,"From pv magazine Global
CATL is reportedly offering sharp discounts on battery purchases to its strategic clients, including major Chinese automotive manufacturers such as NIO, Li Auto, Huawei, and ZEEKR. The Chinese battery manufacturer, which produced 37% of the world’s electric-vehicle batteries in 2022, will not offer such discounts to its largest customer, Tesla, which operates a gigafactory in Shanghai.
Based on the proposal, which has yet to be confirmed, OEMs will be able to produce 50% of batteries in their contracts with CATL with battery-grade lithium carbonate, at costs of CNY 200,000/mt ($43/kg) per metric tonne, provided they agree to source 80% of the battery demand from CATL in the first three years. The remaining 50% of the batteries will be priced at spot market prices.
Comparing to spot market prices of currently around RMB 456,300/mt for lithium hydroxide and RMB 427,750/mt for lithium carbonate, the impact for NMC811 only based on the lithium is around USD 24.6/kWh ($36.6/kWh), Munich-based consultancy Roland Berger calculates.
“Considering a lower value of scrap in the production and lower markups based on fixed percentage values, we end up at USD 31.4/kWh. For LFP cells, the respective numbers are USD 16.5/kWh and USD 21.2/kWh,” Wolfgang Bernhart, partner at Munich-based consultancy Roland Berger, tells pv magazine “This represents a potential cost advantage of more than 20% compared to spot market prices.”
CATL is able to offer such prices because it secured significant amounts of lithium through direct investments. The list includes CATL’s own mining subsidy, Guizhou Shidai Mining, 8.5% stakes in Pilbara Minerals in Australia, and a 24% stake in AVZ Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It also includes the acquisition of Sinuowei with access to a 24.9 mt reserve and the joint development of the world’s greatest lithium reserves – the Uyuni and Oruro salt flats in Bolivia – with China Molybdenum (CMOC).
“Once again it becomes clear,” said Bernhart. “Competitiveness of battery cell manufacturers will be decided on the playground of raw material access.”
Cell manufacturers have been increasingly focused on securing raw materials through either long-term agreements (LTAs) or direct investments. Most of the currently observed LTAs offer price advantages of 5% to 25% compared to spot market prices. Prices are reassessed quarterly based on an agreed formula, but also a few contracts with fixed lithium prices can be observed, according to Roland Berger.
In addition, major cell manufacturers start to vertically integrate into mining and refining projects through direct investments, which gives them the opportunity to source material to a cost basis.
While some industry analysts see CATL’s move as an industry response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, others say that the battery manufacturer is simply passing on the benefits of its longer-term lithium offtake contracts. Either way, this will likely help CATL to retain some of its key customers in China as electric vehicle sales dip and market sentiment for battery materials and EVs turns bearish.
Norwegian-based consultancy Rystad Energy says this proposed discount on lithium in the pricing mechanism reflects the oversupplied battery markets in China, with domestic cell production hitting a 60% surplus in 2022. It says the domestic Chinese battery-grade lithium carbonate price was CNY 486,000/t in January 2023, down 18% from the record high of CNY 593,000/t in November 2022. However, the current price is still 40% higher than it was in the same period last year.
It is estimated that the lithium carbonate prices in China will drop by 40% in the fourth quarter from current spot levels. Rystad Energy’s battery cell cost model shows that if the condition for prices of other materials remains unchanged, and battery-grade lithium carbonate price drops to CNY 200,000/MT, then battery cell costs will decline 22.6% and 24.1% for LFP and NMC523 cells. respectively.
By mixing the proposed lithium carbonate price and market price with a 50-50% ratio, battery cell costs will decline 11.3% and 12.2% for LFP and NMC523 cells respectively, Rystad calculates.
“It is probable that CATL’s proposal could cause other cell manufacturers in China to take similar actions in order to secure existing clients,” says Susan Zou, vice president of Rystad Energy.
