The technology is a result of a partnership between US-based Sandia National Laboratories and the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative (ASTRI), an $100 million consortium established through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and CSIRO.
Concentrated solar thermal technology stores energy by using concentrated sunlight to heat a “curtain” of falling low-cost particles to 700°C. The heated particles can then be stored and reheated later to power a turbine at any time, making the technology’s power output adjustable to grid demand.
Clean Energy Council
Preceding the funding decision, the Australian National University (ANU) modelled the technology and found it to be “cost-effective and reliable.”
“Our modelling shows a concentrated solar power system built around this falling particle curtain could generate a megawatt-hour of stored electricity for less than US$60,” Associate Professor John Pye said.
 “A least-cost system built at the 100 megawatt scale would come with enough storage to run the turbine for 14 hours, easily enough to allow continuous night-time electricity for large parts of the year.”
Australia will continue to collaborate with the US on developing the new technology, including trials at the CSIRO solar thermal falling particle test facility, set to commence in the coming weeks.
“This form of energy is not only inexpensive and clean; with its built-in low-cost storage, it can contribute greatly to the reliability of the renewable energy mix, and to facilitating the global transition from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy as mandated by the Paris Agreement,” Pye added.
The ANU Associate Professor also noted the heat-storing ceramic particles in this system were, in fact, originally developed for use in unconventional natural gas fracking – a far cry from the clean technology they now feature in.
“Zero emissions, dispatchable energy sources like concentrated solar thermal storage will be needed to back up increasing shares of renewable energy,” Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, said in a statement today.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/26/premiums-set-to-rise-for-renewable-projects-as-insurance-specialists-lament-years-of-underperformance/,"FINANCE,INSURANCE,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 26, 2021",Premiums set to rise for renewable projects as insurance specialists lament years of underperformance,"At its heart, insurance comes down to an exceptionally simple formula: premiums must be greater than claims paid. For renewable energy projects though, the numbers just aren’t stacking up, according to a report from the Australian team of the specialist insurance broking group BMS in partnership with renewable energy insurance business GCube Underwriting.
“The reality is the renewables energy sector has been underperforming for many years due to a sustained period of claim activity,” the report reads.
BMS Group
This period of sustained claim activity, which has grown with the booming industry, will likely mean insurance premiums, along with deductibles or excesses, will increase for the sector, continuing the trend of 2020 into 2021.
The report also predicts policy coverage is set to decrease, with BMS recommending insurers pay far closer attention to subcontractors and project locations.
Although it was not fleshed out, a provoking quote from GCube’s CEO, Fraser McLachlan, is included: “More than ever we’re seeing repeated incidents across the globe from certain OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturers] in both wind and solar… there will be a time when these incidents are no longer fortuitous.”
BMS Group
For the report, BMS analysed data provided by GCube based on its client portfolio performance. “Whilst this data will not capture all claims activity in the Australian Renewable Energy market, as a major global insurer in the sector and one of the early participants in the Australian market, [GCube’s] data provides a broad representation of the market losses as a whole,” the report said.
The report found renewable energy project claims stem primarily from:
BMS Group

“As illustrated in Figure 6 and 7, the data demonstrates that significant claims activity across both wind and solar projects originated from Contractor Error which has accounted for ~68% of claims quantum for solar projects and ~36% for wind projects. This risk has been a major focus for insurers and for new construction projects insurers are seeking increased information on whom are the contracting parties involved in the projects and their experience on projects of a similar nature,” the report says.
Wind projects consistently perform worse for insurers than solar projects, the report found. This is primarily because components in wind projects are considerably more expensive.
The majority of claims occur during the construction phase of both wind and solar projects.
BMS Group
“As part of the insurer engagement process, presenting the project in the best possible light will assist insurers to make informed decisions around their potential participation,” the report says. BMS goes on to recommend a “structured approach to market engagement,” saying early preparation and planning, risk workshops, a focused engineering & operations approach and risk prospectus are crucial.
In closing, the insurance broking specialist recommended insurers pay close attention to key areas of underwriting criteria, including:
“Insurers continue to focus on increased levels of underwriting information, notably contractor / sub-contractor experience and site location data / project design specification, to support their revised underwriting guidelines and to drive profitability back to a sector that has underperformed for a sustained period of time.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/26/australias-first-hydrogen-refuelling-station-opens-in-canberra/,"EV,HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 26, 2021",Australia’s first hydrogen refuelling station opens in Canberra,"Australia’s first publicly available hydrogen refuelling station today opened in Fyshwick, southeast Canberra.
French renewables giant Neoen was behind the station, partnering with Australia’s ActewAGL on the project. Neoen’s delivery of the refuelling station goes hand in hand with the Australia Capital Territory (ACT) government’s new fleet of 20 Hyundai Nexo hydrogen vehicles, and was agreed to as part of its contract with the ACT government for Hornsdale Wind Farm Stage 3.
The ACT’s Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury, described the opening as a major milestone in the roll-out of zero emissions vehicles, accelerating Canberra’s renewable energy innovation.
Green hydrogen produced using the ACT’s 100% renewable electricity supply will be available at the station, according to Rattenbury. The minister went on to say this was made possible by the state’s “innovative renewable electricity reverse auctions.”
“There are many benefits with Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles like these. They have short refuelling times, can be powered hydrogen made from renewable-energy and they also purify the air as they drive which will help remove harmful particulates produced by petrol and diesel vehicles,” Rattenbury said in a statement.
“This station will allow fuel cell electric vehicles on our roads alongside battery electric vehicles, forming a strong pathway to zero emissions transport in Canberra.”
Louis de Sambucy, Managing Director of Neoen Australia, said the station’s opening paves the way for the delivery of many more hydrogen refuelling stations across Australia. “Renewable hydrogen represents an exciting opportunity for the decarbonisation of transport, gas and industrial sectors in the ACT and beyond as we transition towards a high penetration renewable energy electricity grid.”
Alongside Neoen and ActewAGL, which is a joint venture between AGL and the state government owned Icon Water Limited (formerly ACTEW Corporation), companies ENGV, IVYS, Nel and PDC Machines contributed to the design and construction of the station.
“Over the coming months we look forwarding to servicing the ACT Government’s fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and building our knowledge of the viability of hydrogen use in our transport networks, including longer term logistics and operating costs,” ActewAGL’s CEO, John Knox, said.
Hyundai, which is delivering the government’s fleet of NEXO advanced hydrogen-powered SUVs, were also involved in the project and applauded the ACT government for turning its green vision into a reality.
Last October, the Greens won a record six seats in the ACT, tripling their presence in the state’s Legislative Assembly. Continuing its partnership with ACT Labor for their fourth consecutive term, the alliance have committed getting the territory to net zero-emissions by 2045, at the latest.

Province Resources revealed plans for its HyEnergy Renewable Hydrogen Project (HyEnergy Project) back in February, plans including 1 GW of co-located wind and solar in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia. The energy from that project will be used to produce approximately 60,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, or up to 300,000 tons of green ammonia.
Province Resources managing director David Frances stressed the critical importance of having a company like ERM onboard as negotiating the path of approvals in a timely manner is of foundational importance to any project, especially one of this scale. “I am looking forward to working with the team at ERM and progressing the HyEnergy Project in what is quickly becoming a massive emerging clean energy industry,” Frances said. 

The Gascoyne region is ideal for a clean energy project of this size. A vast flat-lying arid landscape not dissimilar to the Pilbara where the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub is planned. However, despite the imminent surge of demand in green hydrogen and green ammonia, large-scale green supply projects remain enormous tasks to get off the ground. 
Perhaps the most trying aspect is ensuring a project can generate enough energy cheaply, and the most economical way of generating enough green energy to supply offtaker markets like Japan and South Korea is to co-locate wind and solar in vast flat areas that are as windy as they are sunny. Generally, places with the amount of wind and sun necessary are colloquially known as deserts, and Australia is chockers with them. 
Big batteries are still relatively expensive, meaning that co-location of wind and solar is the best way to ensure 24/7 generation for the production of green hydrogen and ammonia. Solar dominates the day, wind dominates the night. 
Interestingly, the HyEnergy Project is also set to be located near the town of Carnarvon, a town which boasts high-class infrastructure including the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline (DBNGP). Unlike some other large-scale green hydrogen projects in planning or development, this means the HyEnergy Project already has the infrastructure in place for at least some level of domestic pipeline supply. After all, WA’s Hydrogen Strategy aims to reach a 10% mix of green hydrogen in the DBNGP by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/26/location-dependent-performance-model-for-bifacial-installations/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,BANGLADESH,PAKISTAN,UNITED STATES",MARIAN WILLUHN,"MARCH 26, 2021",Location-dependent performance model for bifacial installations,"From pv magazine Global. 
Bifacial PV modules and single-axis trackers do go well together, but there are quite a few system parameters to consider to maximise an installation’s yield. One of the most important ones is the orientation of the tracker.
At latitudes lower than 30 degrees, using bifacial modules on a single-axis tracker will increase energy yields by 45% if the trackers are set up in an east-west orientation, rather than the fixed-tilt north-west setup for bifacial modules. At latitudes above 30 degrees, fixed-tilt bifacial installations tend to outperform tracking mono-facial installations by 5-15% in terms of energy yield. These points are among the key findings of “Global analysis of next-generation utility-scale PV: Tracking bifacial solar farms,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. 
The researchers – from universities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the United States – used multiple irradiance and temperature-dependent energy gain models to determine optimal system parameters for various locations. The team took values of pitch, view factor, and historical weather data for specific areas into account and modelled the energy yield of installations. By modelling different plant setups in various locations, the team was able to reach a number of conclusions regarding each site’s optimal plant layout.  
They concluded that fixed-tilt bifacial installations outperform mono-facial single-axis tracking installation by 5- 15% at locations in latitudes higher than 30 degrees. Additionally, north-south tracker orientations in regions where the seasons are more pronounced can improve energy yield during the winter. In contrast, east-west orientations improve energy yield during the summer months. 
The researchers therefore suggest that for installations above 50 degrees latitude, north-south orientations should be used for bifacial trackers. But in regions closer to the equator, 50-degree, east-west-oriented trackers with bifacial modules are the best choice. “Thus, in terms of energy maximisation, a bifacial tracking PV would be a worthwhile farm technology (sic) in most locations,” the scientists said.
The team also analysed which land types promise the highest yields for bifacial tracking installations. To do this, the researchers put land into 17 different categories and analysed the modelled yearly albedo for each land type. Reportedly, the maximum energy gain can be expected in the “Evergreen and Deciduous Broadleaf Forests” land category. However, the researchers said that such locations should be preserved for the sake of biodiversity. Project developers should therefore eye deserts and savannahs as the next best locations for PV generation. 
Another variable in single-axis tracking is the pitch-over-panel-height ratio – the figure changes with different module and land costs. A pitch-in single-axis tracker solar array describes the spacing between the rows. Leaving cost aside, a project’s energy yield increases the higher the pitch gets, as there is less inter-row shading and more unshaded space to improve albedo light collection. But bringing in the module-to-land cost ratio shifts the optimum pitch. For a modelled east-west installation in Washington, D.C., for example, the perfect pitch was between 2 meters and 3 meters for different cost-ratio scenarios.
The researchers aim to use their model to determine the economic viability of bifacial PV for agrivoltaics. They have suggested comparing the cost for vertical and tracking bifacial modules. The model they used in their research can reportedly be extended to model crop-specific tracking algorithms.

French automation company Sirea has installed, last year, a 21 kW solar carport for self-consumption at its facility in Castres, southern France. The installation, which was partially funded through a program for solar self-consumption promoted by the Occitanie region, is also being used for the recharging of the company’s electric vehicle fleet.
Furthermore, the solar carport’s self-consumption rate was optimised by linking it with 40 kW of recycled batteries provided by French specialist Phenix. This storage technology allows the company to rely on short-term storage to quickly recharge its electric vehicles without increasing the share of power taken from the electricity network.
This system configuration has now been further modified by Sirea with the addition of long-term and inter-seasonal hydrogen storage. The energy management specialist has integrated a 430 W electrolyser to convert the surplus energy from photovoltaics into hydrogen. Up to 80 kWh of electrical energy in hydrogen, at 10 bars, can be stored. So, on days of low solar production, the system’s fuel cell will de-stock hydrogen to provide the electricity needed for the building and vehicles.
“Today, the challenge for Sirea is to show that beyond technical feasibility, the compatibility of renewable energies with cleaner ways of storing energy is possible either with second-life batteries or hydrogen,” the company’s CEO, Bruno Bouteille, stated. “There is a certain complementarity between these different storage technologies.”
To interact with the hydrogen storage and convey the surplus PV power towards the electrolyser or use the fuel cell, Sirea will use its own smart management system, called SmartEMS. This controller, designed for energy management, is already fitted to several photovoltaic installations for controlled self-consumption but this will be a first for the connection of a hydrogen storage system.
