The Moolawatana Renewable Hydrogen Project, as it’s called, could potentially see a combined solar and wind farm, each with up to 3 GW of capacity, being used to power electrolysers producing renewable, green hydrogen.
Kallis told pv magazine Australia the project will likely not be grid connected, and therefore able to avoid the congestion and grid connection issues which have plagued numerous large-scale projects in the region.
Kallis expects the project will require around 100,000 hectares or 1,000 square kilometres to construct. It is being planned for a location just east of the northern Flinders Ranges, chosen for its premium wind and solar resources. The renewable hydrogen produced there would then be transported to Port Bonython in the south via a dedicated hydrogen pipeline and exported, with the company flagging a particular focus on the Japanese and Korean markets.
Following the completion of a preliminary environmental and planning fatal flaw assessment, Kallis Energy said the project is now at the pre-feasibility stage with the company concurrently doing preliminary consultations. Kallis Energy is also planning to include a desalination plant at the site, flagging that during these early stages it will consider issues like water availability. 
Developer Kallis Energy Investments described itself as “a special purpose vehicle” used to develop the Moolawatana Renewable Hydrogen Project and is wholly owned by the Kallis Family Trust. Terry Kallis, the company’s chairman and founder, is also behind South Australia’s Starfish Hill Wind Farm, the offshore 2 GW Star of the South wind farm, and is the co-founder of the Murchison Renewable Hydrogen project in Western Australia’s mid-west which could scale up to 5 GW.
Of his latest endeavour, the Moolawatana Renewable Hydrogen Project, Kallis said it has the potential to contribute significantly to South Australia and indeed Australia’s hydrogen ambitions. “If the project is built to its maximum of 6000 MW, it would contribute about 40% of the state’s goal for 500% renewables by 2050,” he said.
“The development of a global hydrogen industry in Australia has the strong support of both sides of politics in SA and indeed across Australia creating a good environment for investment.”

The company says its Evos Fleet Home22 AC Charger represents the first Australian-made home EV charger available on the market today. It will be sold from December through Ampol, Australia’s largest petroleum company, with strata companies able to purchase the charger for their properties through Queensland energy retailer LPE. The chargers will also be generally available from Evos Energy.
The charger targets businesses providing charging for fleet vehicles as it’s designed for employees to be able to easily install at their homes, increasing reliability and simplifying the charging experience. The charger also features Evos’ patented energy management software, which picks ideal charging hours during non-peak periods and controls the charge rate, speed and power to reduce costs.

“Electric fleets will need more than just hardware that charge their new electric vehicles,” Evos’ CEO and founder, Marcelo Salgado, said. “EV fleet owners will need to negotiate power purchases, manage peak electricity loads, report on emissions savings, install electrical equipment, find capital to fund EV chargers, sign up to third party charger management software and find ways to reduce operating cost not currently known to them.
“Our mission is to make managing EV fleet charging effortless for businesses.”
The EVOS Fleet Home22 AC Charger can be installed either single phase or three phase to provide flexibility for business providing charging for fleet vehicles which will travel to employee’s homes. It can deliver up to 22kW of power which, over an hour, can provide the average EV with as much as 120km range, according to the company.

The news marks Mytilineos’ first project financing in Australia, and the first project financing of solar PV projects by the company’s Renewables and Storage Development (RSD) business unit. Mytilineos’ specific renewables unit was formed after the company acquired Metka EGN in 2019, along with its NSW solar farm portfolio. The acquisition was part of Mytilineos’ strategic entrance into the Australian market, which the company says will be key for its expansion into the Asia-Pacific region more broadly.
Mytilineos’ 120 MWp solar farm portfolio financing is structured to allow “money to be drawn for each project at its respective Commercial Operation Date (COD)” and includes a $95 million term loan and $9 million loan for ancillary facilities, it said.
The company noted it had managed to complete project construction in the first half of this year, seemingly referring to its Corowa Solar Farm which became fully operational in June. Its other solar farm in Wagga Wagga announced in April it would receive a 23 MW extension, though it is not clear whether that has been completed. In its statement, Mytilineos said its remaining projects are reaching “maturity stage” with construction slated for 2022.
Whenever the solar farms come online, the majority of the power produced within Mytilineos’ portfolio will be sold to supermarket giant Coles as part of a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The company expects the projects to produce 220 GWh annually.
In addition to this 120 MWp portfolio of solar farms in NSW, Mytilineos also owns the 110 MW Moura Solar Farm in Queensland which it acquired in December 2020. That very same month, the Greek company also bought the 75 MW Wyalong Solar Farm in New South Wales. As of December 2020, the company’s Australian portfolio sat at 400 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/19/victorian-solar-homes-program-reaches-1-gw-of-energy-capacity/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BLAKE MATICH,"NOVEMBER 19, 2021",Victorian Solar Homes program reaches 1 GW of energy capacity,"The Victorian (VIC) government’s Solar Homes Program (program) had controversial beginnings, but then it seemed to right the ship and now the program is a bonafide success story. Indeed, so much so that Victoria now has more than 3 million panels and 1 GW of energy capacity from solar panels installed through the program. 
From backfire to firing on all cylinders 
When the Solar Homes program was originally introduced to an already flourishing Victorian solar industry making 3,500 installations a month, it immediately backfired. Though the VIC government had admirable intentions, but the program’s relatively small 3,333 monthly cap had two unintended effects. 
Firstly, the small cap meant that people who were thinking about installing solar, but didn’t get the rebate, simply decided to bide their time. And secondly, since buyers became only interested in the small number of rebates on offer, the steady flow of installations that existed before the program turned into short periods of state-wide rush followed by long periods of troughs that put solar businesses under the pump. 
The program’s unintended consequences saw two rallies from solar installers on the steps of Victoria’s Parliament and in front of the office of Premier Andrews. Industry group Solar Cutters expressed the sentiment at the time that although the solar industry supports the Andrews government’s “endeavour to increase the behind the meter renewable energy generation which will lower electricity costs and reduce the state’s carbon emissions,” the way in which the scheme has been rolled out has unintentionally blown out the tyres of the state’s solar industry. Or, as one Smart Energy Council (SEC) member put it, it is as if the “government has their foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time.”

The Andrews government briefly suspended the program as a result of protests, before restarting with a revised system on July 1 2019. The restart went far more smoothly and the government has consistently strengthened the program offering ever since. One example was when applications for rebates on batteries weren’t meeting the number of subsidies on offer, so the government increased the number of postcodes eligible for the rebate.
In January 2021 the tally for household solar installations in Victoria passed 510,000, a figure in part the result of the reconstituted Solar Homes program, and supported by 15,000 battery installations. 
And now, nearing the end of 2021, the $1.3 billion Solar Homes program claims to have passed the 1 GW mark through the installation of three million panels on more than 165,000 Victorian homes, and is making a significant contribution to the state’s ambitions to half emissions by 2030. 
The Victorian Government’s landmark Solar Homes program is one of my proudest achievements as Minister. We are putting renewable energy into the hands — and on to the roofs — of hundreds of thousands of households right across Victoria.
— Lily D'Ambrosio MP (@LilyDAmbrosioMP) June 22, 2021

Minister for Solar Homes Lily D’Ambrosio also claimed the program has created 5,000 jobs and increased levels of household solar in some suburbs by more than 70%. In Melbourne, the program’s top five suburbs are Tarneit, Cragieburn, Clyde North, Point Cook and Truganina. While in regional areas it is Mildura, Shepparton, Wodonga, Wangaratta and Wallan that are shining brightest. 
“The impact of this program is clear,” said D’Ambrosio, “with Victorians continuing to embrace the opportunity to be part of the energy revolution.”
Overall, it is claimed that the program is responsible for an increase of homes with solar from 14% to 22%, with 71% of respondents to a Customer survey saying they would not have installed solar if it weren’t for the program’s rebate. 
What is more, survey data shows that Victorian customers are also leaning towards larger systems, with the average system size now just over 7 kW, up from 5.7 kW at the outset of the program. 
“With summer just around the corner, now is a great time to join the more than 180,000 households and small businesses who have applied for $340 million in rebates since the Solar Homes Program began in 2018” continued D’Ambrosio. “People will save on energy bills but will also be playing a key role in Victoria’s transition to a clean energy economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/19/the-energy-storage-decade-has-arrived-says-bnef/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"NOVEMBER 19, 2021","The energy storage decade has arrived, says BNEF","From pv magazine USA
Energy storage installations throughout the world are forecast to reach 358 GW/1,028 GWh by the end of 2030, more than 20 times greater than the 17 GW/34 GWh online at the end of 2020, according to the latest forecast from BloombergNEF (BNEF).
This projected growth in stationary energy storage will require more than US$262 billion (AU$359 billion) of investment, BNEF said in its 2021 Global Energy Storage Outlook.
“This is the energy storage decade. We’ve been anticipating significant scale-up for many years and the industry is now more than ready to deliver,” said Yayoi Sekine, the company’s head of decentralised energy.
The outlook estimated that 345 GW/999 GWh of new energy storage capacity will be added globally between 2021 and 2030. The United States and China are expected to be the two largest markets, representing more than half of the global storage installations by 2030. Clean power ambitions of state governments and utilities propel storage deployment in the United States, the outlook said. In China, the installation target of 30 GW of cumulative build by 2025 and stricter renewable integration rules boost expected storage installations.
Other top markets according to BNEF include India, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Supportive policies, ambitious climate commitments, and the growing need for flexible resources are common drivers. The forecast said that although Asia-Pacific will lead the storage build on a megawatt basis by 2030, the Americas will build more on a megawatt-hour basis. BNEF said that is because storage plants in the United States usually have more hours of storage.
Europe, Middle East and Africa currently lags behind its counterparts due to a lack of targeted storage policies and incentives. Growth in the region could accelerate, however, as renewables penetration surges, more fossil-fuel generators close, and the battery supply chain becomes more localised.
BNEF said that falling battery costs and “surging” renewables penetration make energy storage a “compelling flexible resource in many power systems.” Energy storage projects are growing in scale, increasing in dispatch duration, and are increasingly paired with renewables, it said.
BNEF’s forecast suggests that 55% of energy storage build by 2030 will be to provide energy shifting. Co-located renewable-plus-storage projects, solar+storage in particular, are becoming commonplace globally.
Customer-sited batteries, both residential and commercial and industrial ones, will also grow at a steady pace, BNEF said. Germany and Japan are currently leading markets, with sizeable markets in Australia and California.
BNEF said it expects energy storage located at homes and businesses to make up about one quarter of global storage installations by 2030. The desire of electricity consumers to use more self-generated solar power and appetite for back-up power are major drivers.
Other applications, such as using energy storage to defer grid investment, may remain marginal in most markets to 2030. Build could pick up, the outlook said, if regulatory barriers are removed and incentives are aligned for network owners to consider storage as an alternative to traditional infrastructure investment.
Rapidly evolving battery technology is driving the energy storage market. The report found that the industry is adopting multiple lithium-ion battery chemistries. It said that in 2021, lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) will be used more than nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries for stationary storage for the first time.
LFP is poised to become the major lithium-ion battery chemistry choice in the energy storage sector until at least 2030, driven by its dominant role in China and increasing penetration in the rest of the world. BNEF also updated its technology outlook to include sodium-ion batteries, a lithium-ion battery contender, which it said could play a “meaningful role” by 2030.
Besides batteries, many non-battery technologies are under development, such as compressed air and thermal energy storage. The report said that many of these can provide longer dispatch duration compared to batteries, looking to supply during prolonged periods of low renewable energy generation in future net-zero power systems.
However, BNEF said it expects batteries to dominate the market at least until the 2030s, in large part due to their price competitiveness, established supply chain, and track record. If new technologies successfully outcompete lithium-ion, then total uptake may well be larger.
