This new research also undercuts BloomberNEF’s previous 2030 forecast by 13% and its 2050 forecast by 17%. The key force behind this accelerating cost decline of green hydrogen is the continuously falling costs of solar PV. BloombergNEF forecasts that solar electricity will be 40% cheaper in 2050 than what the financial research company thought only two years previous. 
This continuous cost decline on the solar front is being driven by automatic manufacturing, less silicon and silver consumption, higher photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells, and the greater yields provided by bifacial panels. 
Stepping on the gas
BloombergNEF modelled 28 major markets in this most recent research and found that green hydrogen would be cheaper than natural gas (on an energy-equivalent basis) by 2050 in 15 of the 28 markets. But if those markets were using natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS), then green hydrogen out-competes gas across the board. 
“Such low renewable hydrogen costs could completely rewrite the energy map,” said BloombergNEF lead hydrogen analyst, Martin Tengler. “It shows that in future, at least 33% of the world economy could be powered by clean energy for not a cent more than it pays for fossil fuels. But the technology will require continued government support to get there – we are at the high part of the cost curve now, and policy-supported investment is needed to get to the low part.”
Green light 
Not only is BloombergNEF forecasting that green hydrogen will undercut natural gas, but also blue hydrogen (generated from fossil fuels with CCS), as well as straight ‘grey’ hydrogen produced from fossil fuels without CCS. 
Tengler predicts that by 2030, “it will make little economic sense to build ‘blue’ hydrogen production facilities in most countries, unless space constraints are an issue for renewables. Companies currently banking on producing hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCS will have at most ten years before they feel the pinch. Eventually those assets will be undercut, like what is happening with coal in the power sector today.”
Of course, that green energy and therefore green hydrogen is getting cheaper is not surprising, but the rate at which costs are declining certainly is. “Every year it gets cheaper, faster than anyone expects,” continues Tengler, “The key driver is falling cost of solar PV electricity. We now think solar PV power will be 40% cheaper by 2050 than what we had thought just two years ago.” 
The other major contributor to the accelerating price decline of green hydrogen is reductions in electrolyzer-related costs.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/07/danish-and-swedish-australian-companies-partner-on-mysterious-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 7, 2021",Danish and Swedish-Australian companies partner on mysterious green hydrogen project,"A Danish company specialising in green hydrogen electrolysers, Green Hydrogen Systems, will partner with Skai Energies, which has roots Sweden but is based in Victoria, on a green hydrogen project.
Details about the project are scarce, with Skai Energies’ website detailing mainly which products it plans to use rather than any real project information like precise location and scale.
Nonetheless, partner Green Hydrogen Systems on Tuesday published that the first stage of the hydrogen project is to be commissioned in early 2022 and will produce around 60kg to 90kg of green hydrogen per day. The company went on to say it expects the project to grow in scale to meet increasing demand.
The Danish company also alluded to a “prime location,” although precisely where that is doesn’t seem to be specified.
Skai Energy, which will lead and operate the project, said it plans to use partner Green Hydrogen Systems’ 430kW pressurised alkaline electrolyser, a 125kW fuel cell, and overall control system from Nilsson Energy to produce hydrogen “powered entirely off the fossil fuel energy grid.” Presumably meaning ‘off’ as in not using electricity from the main power grid.
Skai Energies’ brief project explanation concludes with the sign off: “more details to come.”
As enigmatic as the project sounds, Green Hydrogen Systems have entered a three-year service agreement, which will see the company provide an electrolyser as well as onsite project support and maintenance.
“There is an unprecedented momentum in the Australian market for green hydrogen supported by industrial demand and political decisions. And we at Green Hydrogen Systems are thrilled to be working on this project with partners who possess the crucial market knowledge and share our vision to pioneer the field of green hydrogen and drive a sustainable global energy transition,” Green Hydrogen Systems Chief Commercial Officer Søren Rydbirk said in a statement.
“I am incredibly excited to be selected as a technology partner and system integrator for this green hydrogen project, and proud to be bringing Green Hydrogen Systems and Nilsson Energy technology to Australian shores. The HyProvide A-Series equipment is designed to work very efficiently with the variable load from renewable electricity sources – in this case, solar. With hydrogen solutions becoming competitive with traditional energy carriers, particularly when using highly efficient and proven equipment from my partners, it is great to get into a green hydrogen project to support the vision of the project developer, and accelerate the energy transition,” Craig Ehrke, CEO of Skai Energies said in the sam statement.

The ASX-listed company on Tuesday announced the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) completed test work from a sample of its product, successfully extracting over 95% of lithium on two kilogram samples of blended concentrate in two separate tests.
Australia is by far the world’s top producer of lithium, with a number of mines concentrated in Western Australia. The Finniss Lithium Project is the first-ever lithium mine to be approved outside of the state and is the first new mine of significant scale to be approved in the NT since 2013.

Global lithium consumption is projected to rise around 750,000 tonnes by 2025, spurred by electric vehicle uptake and the expansion of big batteries – which continue to dominated by lithium-ion models.
Core Lithium aspires to have its Finniss Lithium Project at the “forefront” of lithium production for the global market. Proponents of project argue has perhaps the best-supporting logistics chain to markets in Asia of any Australian lithium project. The Project lies within 25 km of the port, power station, gas, rail and one hour by sealed road to workforce accommodated in Darwin and importantly to Darwin Port – Australia’s nearest port to Asia. The Finniss Lithium Project was recently awarded Major Project Status by Australia’s federal government.
“Today’s announcement confirms that battery grade lithium hydroxide suitable for high-end uses in the lithium battery, renewable energy and EV industries, can be produced from Core’s excellent quality lithium concentrate produced from the Finniss Project,” Managing Director Stephen Biggins said. The company is also looking at the potential of adding downstream processing infrastructure to its portfolio, he added.
The company said it remains focussed on on completing its definitive feasibility study for the Finniss Lithium Project and finalising off-take negotiation deals ahead of its final investment decision expected in the third quarter of this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/07/province-resources-seeks-to-acquire-more-land-for-its-1-gw-green-hydrogen-project-in-wa/,"HYDROGEN,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 7, 2021",Province Resources seeks to acquire more land for its 1 GW green hydrogen project in WA,"Perth-based company Province Resources (ASX: PRL) on Wednesday announced it had applied for additional 864 square kilometres of tenure in the Gascoyne region in northwest Western Australia, where it plans to construct its massive green hydrogen project.
Province Resources – originally a gold and nickel exploration company – is currently seeking to finalise its acquisition of Ozexco Pty Ltd, which holds the license applications for the land where Province wants to locate its trademarked HyEnergy Zero Carbon Hydrogen project. The project was announced in February to colossal fanfare, with its stock price almost tripling.
Its HyEnergy project will include 1 GW of hybrid solar and wind capacity, with the generated electricity being used to produce approximately 60,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, or up to 300,000 tons of green ammonia.
The project is benefiting from a windfall of hydrogen enthusiasm, with Western Australia’s Hydrogen Strategy devoting $10 million worth of funding to green hydrogen, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency earmarking $70 million and the Australian Government’s Advancing Hydrogen Fund setting aside $300 million to advance the market.
Province is seeking to capitalise on the available funding for its HyEnergy project, and seems to be moving at a cracking pace, appointing multinational ERM to de-risk the project for the raft of necessary approvals in March. It has also appointed Sydney-based technology company Fulcrum3D to collect preliminary wind and solar data every 10 minutes within the project area to assess the wind and solar resource potential.
Now, the company is now seeking to expand before the acquisition of the project area has even been finalised.
“The identification of the additional 864 square kilometres of tenure complements both the Gascoyne Industrial Minerals Project and HyEnergy Green Hydrogen Project and importantly, gives us greater critical mass in the region,” Managing Director David Frances said in a statement today.
“As we continue our desktop studies and progress the tenements to grant, I look forward to further outlining the company’s initial exploration work programmes,” he added.
Province’s projects are set to cover an area of 2,272 square kilometres in Gascoyne, which was selected in part because of its infrastructure, which includes the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline and the North West Coastal Highway.

Singapore-based renewables developer Sunseap will sell power to Facebook in Singapore through a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA).
The electricity will be provided by a 5 MW offshore floating PV array that Sunseap operates in the Straits of Johor.
“The energy from the 5 MW offshore floating photovoltaic system will be exported to the national grid,” the company said. “All renewable energy credits (RECs) from the project will be transferred to Facebook under the VPPA and will support the tech company’s operations in Singapore, including Facebook’s first custom–built data center in Asia.”
Singapore’s Economic Development Board supported the project. The array was originally designed to provide power to the grid over a 25-year period. Floating PV is of particular interest in countries such as Singapore, where the availability of land is a major obstacle to the deployment of ground-mounted PV projects.
Last August, a unit of Sembcorp Industries began working on a 60 MW floating solar power plant at the Tengeh Reservoir. The solar facility will provide electricity under a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Public Utilities Board. The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore has been using the Tengeh Reservoir as a test bed for floating solar since 2017.

Scientists have studied radiative sky cooling (RSC) at the research level as a potential passive cooling technique for buildings and solar modules. RSC occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from its environment and less than the energy it radiates. When this happens, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
Researchers from France’s Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon (INL) recently started studying the effects of RSC on single-junction solar cells. They aim to determine the ideal thermal emissivity profile of cells that could allow the best cooling. “We also quantified the cooling potential in a broad range of scenarios,” researcher Jérémy Dumoulin told pv magazine.
The scientists explained that PV systems are naturally good candidates for RSC techniques, which use the transparency of the earth’s atmosphere in the 8-micrometer to 13-micrometer range, in order to enhance radiative heat transfer.
“In practice, improving RSC consists in tuning the optical absorption and thermal emission in the infrared range which makes it possible to also reduce the absorption of sub-bandgap photons, referred hereafter as parasitic solar absorption,” they said.
Dumoulin said the technique could be applied in module manufacturing by changing the optical properties of the glass cover. RSC could also be improved to some extent by changing the optical properties of the cells. “We are currently exploring different technical pathways to obtain the desired emissivity while maintaining low cost,” he said.
The academics initially developed a thermal and electrical model to measure cell temperature and yield. They then created a “step model” to establish the cell’s emissivity profile. They used this modeling framework to compare the selective and broadband emissivity profiles in different scenarios.
The scientists claim the broadband profile is the ideal choice, as it ensures lower temperatures and higher electrical power output under most environmental conditions, as long as the bandgap is around 2.3 eV. The selective profile is only the most appropriate option in solar cells with a bandgap energy of more than 2.3 eV. Crystalline silicon (C-Si), for example, has a bandgap energy of 1.11 eV and cadmium telluride (CdTe), which is less efficient than C-Si for power generation, has a bandgap of 1.44 eV.
The broadband profile achieved lower module temperatures and a higher power yield for a crystalline silicon cell with a 1.12 eV bandgap, provided that solar illumination surpasses 300 W/mw, and for a perovskite cell with a 1.64 eV, as long as solar illumination exceeds 500 W/m2. “This is valid even if convection is suppressed and under clear sky conditions,” Dumoulin said.
In their simulation, the researchers determined that RSC improvements might lead to a reduction in PV module temperatures of around 10 C. This in turn could raise the performance of the devices by more than 5 W/m2.
“For Si-based devices with high non-radiative recombination, our model predicts an even higher temperature reduction,” the research group said. “Even in the worst scenario – a thick device with initially good thermal management on the front and the rear – a broadband profile can further reduce the temperature by almost 3 C.”
Thus far, they have only simulated their proposed technique, so they can first identify the thermal emissivity profile they need to achieve and its potential benefit. They hope this will justify further research. “We plan to make tests on both cells and modules,” Dumoulin said.
They described the passive cooling technique in “Radiative sky cooling of solar cells: fundamental modeling and cooling potential of single-junction devices,” which was recently published in Sustainable Energy and Fuels.

Chinese oil and gas giant Sinopec committed in March to accelerate investments in hydrogen, focusing on “top-level design, core technology R&D, standard system formulation and industrial policy support”. The company, which produces 3.5 million tons of hydrogen per year, has already built hydrogen refueling stations in Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guangxi. The company expects the number of stations to reach 1,000 by 2025. As part of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, the Beijing-based company has enlarged its scope and included the term “clean” for the first time. It said it would promote the transformation of hydrogen sources from grey hydrogen to blue and green hydrogen. “The China Hydrogen Energy Alliance predicts that by 2050, China’s annual hydrogen demand will be close to 60 million tons,” reads the press release. China has the second largest number of hydrogen refueling stations after Japan.
California-based renewable hydrogen systems manufacturer Ways2H and its shareholder Japan Blue Energy announced on Tuesday the completion of a facility in the Tokyo area that will convert daily 1 ton of dried sewage sludge into 40-50 kilograms of hydrogen for fuel cell mobility and power generation. With construction now completed, the companies plan to start ramping up operations by mid-2021. The facility was developed and built in partnership with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Toda Corporation, Tokyu Construction, Chiyoda Kenko and researchers at the Tokyo University of Science.
American hydrogen fuel cell developer Plug Power and Canada-headquartered Brookfield Renewable Partners announced on Tuesday their plans to build a green hydrogen production plant utilizing 100% renewable energy from Brookfield Renewable’s Holtwood hydroelectric facility. The plant will be located along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. “The plant is expected to be online by late 2022, with construction slated to begin in the first quarter of 2022. Once operational, the plant is projected to produce approximately 15 metric-tons of 100% emissions-free liquid hydrogen per day,” reads the press release. Plug Power plans to establish the first North American green hydrogen network and “to produce over 500 tons per day of hydrogen by 2025”.
Australia-based mining company Province Resources began collecting wind and solar data through the Fulcrum3D Sodar monitoring station to asses the wind and solar potential in an area of 1,408 square kilometres in Western Australia. The HyEnergy project could make use of local infrastructure, including the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline (DBNGP). “It is great to be able to hit the ground running on the exciting HyEnergy green hydrogen project, I look forward to progressing the feasibility studies as quickly as possible,” managing director David France commented in a note.
UK-based aerospace company Cranfield Aerospace Solutions announced on Tuesday that two new British companies will join the government-supported Project Fresson consortium. “Ricardo UK Ltd brings expertise in fuel cell system development and Innovatus Technologies Ltd brings their innovative Scottish Hydrogen Fuel Tank (SHyFT) technology,” reads the press release. Project Fresson aims to deliver an emission-free (zero CO2), hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered flying demonstrator by September 2022. Cranfield Aerospace Solutions argues that the technology would also reduce operating costs. The consortium includes Britten Norman and Cranfield University. Rolls-Royce is still part of the consortium but is withdrawing from the group. Project Fresson is supported by ATI Programme, a joint government and industry investment to increase the UK’s competitiveness in civil aerospace design and manufacture.
Danish multinational power company Ørsted said on Wednesday it planned to build two renewable hydrogen production facilities for a total of 1 GW by 2030, connecting them directly to a planned 2 GW offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea. The green hydrogen would then be distributed through a 45-kilometre regional cross-border pipeline between the Netherlands and Belgium. “The major industrial companies in the region, ArcelorMittal, Yara, Dow Benelux and Zeeland Refinery, support the development of the required regional infrastructure to enable sustainably-produced steel, ammonia, ethylene, and fuels in the future,” wrote Ørsted, saying the companies are speaking with TSOs and local authorities. “Subject to a regulatory framework being in place, the regional network will unlock the first phase of SeaH2Land, which comprises 500 MW of electrolyzer capacity. The second phase of SeaH2Land, which scales the electrolyzer capacity to 1 GW, will require the possibility to connect to a national hydrogen backbone.”
Gas infrastructure operator Enagás signed an agreement with France’s Teréga and GazelEnergie and renewable hydrogen producer DH2 for a hydrogen project called Lacq Hydrogen. The project, announced on Tuesday, involves the production and supply of renewable hydrogen from Spain to France between DH2 and GazelEnergie; hydrogen transmission from Spain to France between Enagás and Teréga; the storage and transport of hydrogen through the Teréga network to GazelEnergie’s renewable energy plant; and the production of renewable energy via a combined cycle power plant operated by GazelEnergie. The Lacq Hydrogen project was submitted to the Call for Expressions of Interest launched by France in June 2020 as part of an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI).
“We want the [IPCEI] to be adopted by the end of 2021 and we want to define concrete projects between Italian and French companies on the exploitation of hydrogen,” said French Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire during a meeting with Italian Minister of Economic Development Giancarlo Giorgetti. The meeting was meant to strengthen cooperation between the two countries and define a European industrial strategy, with a focus on hydrogen, microelectronics and aerospace.
The European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) approved two reports last week: “A European Strategy for Energy System Integration” and “A European Strategy for Hydrogen”. The European Parliament “believes that the classification of the different forms of hydrogen should be determined according to an independent, science-based assessment, stepping away from the commonly used colour-based approach; is of the opinion that this classification should be based on the hydrogen lifecycle,” reads the final version of the document on hydrogen. The report also asks the Commission to stimulate innovation across the entire hydrogen value chain. “The report is well-balanced and clearly acknowledges renewable hydrogen as the most sustainable and future-proof solution,” said Aurelie Beauvais, deputy CEO and policy director at SolarPower Europe. “While the report keeps the door open for low-carbon hydrogen sources, it is critical to ensure such technologies abide by the highest sustainability standards, and remain transitional solutions to avoid any investments in stranded assets.”
German multinational chemical company Wacker Chemie announced on Wednesday that its project funding proposal to the European Union for production of green hydrogen and renewable methanol at its Burghausen site had reached the next selection stage. “The requested support is in the high double-digit millions,” said the company in a press release, noting that the EU’s Innovation Fund has a budget of €10 billion to support innovative low-carbon technologies for energy-intensive industries until 2030. The Munich-based company wants to build a 20 MW electrolysis plant with multinational chemical company Linde to produce hydrogen from water using renewable electricity. The €100 million project includes a synthesis plant to process the green hydrogen into renewable methanol using carbon dioxide from existing production processes. The synthesis plant’s expected capacity is 15,000 metric tons per year.
Eurogas, the European gas industry association representing 56 companies and associations, has increased its ambition to develop a carbon neutral gas sector, saying it can achieve the goal “not much later than 2045,” well before its previous 2050 target. The association also called for “binding targets for the reduction of green-house gas emissions from gas, and targets for volumes of renewable gas consumed in the EU by 2030”.
