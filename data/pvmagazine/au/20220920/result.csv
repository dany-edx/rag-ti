https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/20/electric-planes-are-coming-short-hop-regional-flights-could-be-running-on-batteries-in-a-few-years/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Electric planes are coming: Short-hop regional flights could be running on batteries in a few years,"Air Canada announced earlier this month it would buy 30 electric-hybrid regional aircraft from Sweden’s Heart Aerospace, which expects to have its 30-seat plane in service by 2028. Analysts at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab note that the first hybrid electric 50- to 70-seat commuter plane could be ready not long after that. In the 2030s, they say, electric aviation could really take off.
That matters for managing climate change. About 3% of global emissions come from aviation today, and with more passengers and flights expected as the population expands, aviation could be producing three to five times more carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Aerospace engineer and assistant professor Gökçin Çınar develops sustainable aviation concepts, including hybrid-electric planes and hydrogen fuel alternatives, at the University of Michigan. We asked her about the key ways to cut aviation emissions today and where technologies like electrification and hydrogen are headed.
Aircraft are some of the most complex vehicles out there, but the biggest problem for electrifying them is the battery weight.
If you tried to fully electrify a 737 with today’s batteries, you would have to take out all the passengers and cargo and fill that space with batteries just to fly for under an hour.
Jet fuel can hold about 50 times more energy compared to batteries per unit mass. So, you can have 1 pound of jet fuel or 50 pounds of batteries. To close that gap, we need to either make lithium-ion batteries lighter or develop new batteries that hold more energy. New batteries are being developed, but they aren’t yet ready for aircraft.

An electric alternative is hybrids.
Even though we might not be able to fully electrify a 737, we can get some fuel burn benefits from batteries in the larger jets by using hybrid propulsion systems. We are trying to make that happen in the short term, with a 2030-2035 target for smaller regional planes. The less fuel burned during flight, the fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
Hybrid electric aircraft are similar to hybrid electric cars in that they use a combination of batteries and aviation fuels. The problem is that no other industry has the weight limitations that we do in the aerospace industry.
That’s why we have to be very smart about how and how much we are hybridizing the propulsion system.
Using batteries as a power assist during take-off and climb are very promising options. Taxiing to the runway using just electric power could also save a significant amount of fuel and reduce the local emissions at airports. There is a sweet spot between the added weight of the battery and how much electricity you can use to get net fuel benefits. This optimization problem is at the centre of my research.
Hybrids would still burn fuel during flight, but it could be considerably less than just relying entirely on jet fuel.
I see hybridization as a mid-term option for larger jets, but a near-term solution for regional aircraft.
For 2030 to 2035, we’re focused on hybrid turboprops, typically regional aircraft with 50-80 passengers or used for freight. These hybrids could cut fuel use by about 10%.
With electric hybrids, airlines could also make more use of regional airports, reducing congestion and time larger planes spend idling on the runway.
Shorter term we’ll see more use of sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF. With today’s engines, you can dump sustainable aviation fuel into the same fuel tank and burn it. Fuels made from corn, oilseeds, algae and other fats are already being used.
Sustainable aviation fuels can reduce an aircraft’s net carbon dioxide emissions by around 80%, but supply is limited, and using more biomass for fuel could compete with food production and lead to deforestation.
A second option is using synthetic sustainable aviation fuels, which involves capturing carbon from the air or other industrial processes and synthesizing it with hydrogen. But that’s a complex and costly process and does not have a high production scale yet.

Airlines can also optimize their operations in the short term, such as route planning to avoid flying nearly empty planes. That can also reduce emissions.
Hydrogen fuel has been around a very long time, and when it’s green hydrogen – produced with water and electrolysis powered by renewable energy – it doesn’t produce carbon dioxide. It can also hold more energy per unit of mass than batteries.
There are two ways to use hydrogen in an airplane: either in place of regular jet fuel in an engine, or combined with oxygen to power hydrogen fuel cells, which then generate electricity to power the aircraft.
The problem is volume – hydrogen gas takes up a lot of space. That’s why engineers are looking at methods like keeping it very cool so it can be stored as liquid until it’s burned as a gas. It still takes up more space than jet fuel, and the storage tanks are heavy, so how to store, handle or distribute it on aircraft is still being worked out.
Airbus is doing a lot of research on hydrogen combustion using modified gas turbine engines with an A380 platform, and aiming to have mature technology by 2025. Australia’s Rex airline expects to start testing a 34-seat, hydrogen-electric airplane for short hops in the next few years.
Due to the variety of options, I see hydrogen as one of the key technologies for sustainable aviation.
The problem with aviation emissions isn’t their current levels – it’s the fear that their emissions will increase rapidly as demand increases. By 2050, we could see three to five times more carbon dioxide emissions from aviation than before the pandemic.

The International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, generally defines the industry’s goals, looking at what’s feasible and how aviation can push the boundaries.
Its long-term goal is to cut net carbon dioxide emissions 50% by 2050 compared with 2005 levels. Getting there will require a mix of different technologies and optimization. I don’t know if we’re going to be able to reach it by 2050, but I believe we must do everything we can to make future aviation environmentally sustainable.

GSEO declined to pinpoint the locations of the three individual 5 MW projects but said they are “fully permitted” and construction of the assets is expected to begin later this year. It is anticipated commercial operations will be achieved in the second quarter of next year.
The output of the three PV plants is expected to be sold on a merchant basis and through power purchase agreements (PPAs).
GSEO said it is also exploring the possibility of co-locating battery energy storage systems with up to two hours of capacity at each site.
“We are very cognisant of the journey which Australians have embarked on to meet the challenges of addressing climate change, whilst ensuring that the country benefits from a reliable energy system in which renewable power generation becomes fully integrated,” co-chief investment officer Richard Lum said in a statement.
GSEO said as part of the transaction, it will retain exclusivity to acquire two more projects of 5 MW each.
The acquisition follows GSEO’s initial entry into the Australian market last year when, in collaboration with Melbourne-based partner Birdwood Energy, it announced the $25 million (£15 million) purchase of two operating solar PV sites, totalling 17 MWdc, in South Australia and Queensland.
GSEO said the installation of a battery energy storage system at one of the original sites has already commenced, saying the co-location of storage capacity forms “a critical part of the investment strategy”.
“The trust is committed towards addressing the intermittency issues nations such as Australia face, in particular the mismatch between when power is generated and when it is actually used,” the company said. “By integrating battery storage power across solar farms, the intermittency issue is remedied and the imperative to turn on coal plants diminishes.”
GSEO said the addition of battery storage capacity at the sites will also allow greater ability to capture positive power price movements, prevent over-exposure to negative power prices, and allow it to benefit from energy arbitrage opportunities and frequency services revenues.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/20/solar-powered-backpacks-to-help-bring-birds-back-from-brink/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Solar-powered ‘backpacks’ to help bring birds back from brink,"Researchers hope to learn about the movements of critically endangered plains-wanderers using solar-powered transmitters backed by satellite tracking technology.
Plains wanderers, small, ground-dwelling birds found mainly in the semi-arid grasslands of the New South Wales (NSW) Riverina region and north-western Victoria, were declared critically endangers by the Australian government in 2015. Recent estimates suggest there are just 500 to 1,000 of the elusive bird left in the wild.
Now 15 plains wanderers and their solar-powered backpacks have been released into Oolambeyan National Park in the Riverina as part of the conservation effort between the NSW, South Australia and Victorian governments. It is the second release in NSW after 10 birds were released near Hay in March. Sixteen were released in Victoria in 2021.
Researchers have previously struggled to understand the movements of the birds in the wild, but the tiny solar-powered tracking devices are expected to shed new light on their behaviour.
The technology, sourced from United States-based Microwave Telemetry, comprises a rechargeable battery powered by high-efficiency miniature solar cells. Each unit is programmed to regulate battery charging for continuous transmission.

The individual unit measures about 2 cm x 1.2 cm x 0.85 cm and weighs in at 2 grams.  With a supply voltage of approximately 3.6 to 4 volts, it has a power output of 80 milliwatts.
The new solar-powered backpacks can provide data for up to two years and will be tracked by satellite. Previously, tracking was limited by a 12-week battery life and the birds could only be followed with a transmitter in the field.
NSW Environment Minister James Griffin said tracking their movements following release was “the culmination of work aimed at bringing the species back from the brink”.
“They’re a critical part of the ecosystem because their presence or absence is an indicator of the health of their native habitat,” he said.
“These solar backpack-wearing plains wanderers are paving the way for us to gather important data, which will ultimately help us improve our conservation efforts for wild populations into the future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/20/solar-pv-employed-about-3-4-million-people-in-2021/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,EMPLOYMENT,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Solar PV employed about 3.4 million people in 2021,"The energy sector employed more than 65 million people in 2019, or 2% of global employment, according to the new World Energy Employment Report published by the (International Energy Agency) IEA. Half of this workforce is employed in the clean energy sector, with solar PV employing more workers than any other power generation technology.
According to the report, power generation employment totalled 11.2 million in 2019, comprising 3 million in solar PV, 2 million in coal power, and 1.9 million in hydro. Onshore and offshore wind power employed 1.2 million and nuclear power 1 million. Employment in other renewables totalled about 710,000 employees.
The agency estimates that employment in the entire energy sector in 2021 was up by about 1.3 million and could increase by another six percentage points by 2022, with clean energy accounting for all of the growth. Energy investment could rise by 8% in 2022, reaching $3.57 trillion (US$2.4 trillion), but with almost half of the increase in capital spending linked to higher costs.
About 3.4 million workers were employed in solar PV in 2021, almost half of which were in China, enabled by lower-cost labour, according to the report. North America employed about 280,000 workers and Europe over 260,000. There were about 50,000 people working in the solar industry in Africa, with this number set to grow due to the proliferation of on- and off-grid solutions in the continent, the agency said.
Most employees in the industry work in manufacturing and installation of new capacity, with manufacturing jobs being strongly concentrated in a few countries: China alone accounted for 260,000 workers in the production of polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules.
“Residential solar panels are often installed by construction workers and electricians who also work on other projects, such that many solar PV jobs are not full-time, and it can be difficult to count employees accurately,” the agency noted.
Shortage of skilled labor poses a major challenge for the industry, which is expected to see continuous growth in annual capacity installation in every IEA scenario.
About US$215 billion was invested in the industry in 2021, an annual average growth of 5% over the previous decade, according to the report. Total installed capacity worldwide stood at 740 GW in 2019, comprising 425 GW of utility-scale installations and 315 GW of residential and commercial and industrial (C&I) installations.

Construction of new projects, including manufacturing of components, is reportedly the main driver of employment across the energy sector, employing over 60% of the workforce. Industries with a higher share of workers in construction, like solar, have lower wage premiums than industries like nuclear, oil, and gas, according to the report. The solar industry also has less trade union representation than fossil fuel industries, where labour representation has led to higher wages.
According to the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 14 million new clean energy jobs will be created by 2030, with another 16 million workers shifting to new roles related to clean energy. In this scenario, about 60% of new employees will require at least two years of post-secondary education, making worker training essential to the sustainable development of the industry.
The report also shows that currently women are strongly under-represented in the energy sector, accounting for 16% of the sector’s workforce, compared to 39% of global employment.
“Women make up a very small share of senior management in energy, just under 14% on average. However, there is substantial variation among energy sectors, with the percentage shares in nuclear and coal the lowest at 8% and 9%, respectively, whereas electric utilities are among the highest with nearly 20%. This compares with 16% of women in senior management economy-wide,” the report says. There are no major differences in the share of women’s employment between fossil fuels and clean energy globally.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/20/energy-vault-to-deploy-2-gwh-of-gravity-storage-in-china/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2022",Energy Vault to deploy 2 GWh of gravity storage in China,"Switzerland-based gravity storage system provider Energy Vault announced it will build five storage projects with a combined storage capacity of 2 GWh in China.
The company said the projects will rely on its EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and that it will partner with US-based Atlas Renewable Energy, Chinese NGO EIPC, China-based telecommunications company China Tianying, and unspecified selected provincial and local governments for their construction.
“In February 2022, Energy Vault and Atlas Renewable signed a licensing and royalty agreement for the deployment of Energy Vault’s gravity energy storage technology in China which followed a US$50 million ($74 million) equity investment into the company as part of the IPO earlier this year on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),” the company said in a statement. “The companies immediately commenced the construction of a first 25 MW, 100 MWh system outside Shanghai in the district of Pudong, which broke ground in March 2022 earlier this year.”
In April, Energy Vault signed an agreement with Indian utility NTPC Ltd aimed at forging a long-term strategic partnership. NTPC will deploy Energy Vault’s EVx gravity-based energy storage technology and software solutions based on the outcome of a joint feasibility study.
In January, Korea Zinc agreed to invest US$50 million in Energy Vault so it can use its energy storage technology at its Australian refinery. The South Korean smelting giant is the latest major company to back Energy Vault ahead of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
The new investment upsized previously announced private investment in public equity funding from US$100 million to US$150 million, in conjunction with Energy Vault’s agreement to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Novus Capital Corporation II. Its previous funding round included investments from Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, BHP Ventures, Volta Energy Technologies, and Softbank Vision Fund, among others.
Energy Vault’s EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-ton blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
According to the company, there is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time. Its composite blocks are developed in cooperation with Mexico’s Cemex, using local soil at sites where it builds its storage systems, as well as other materials such as recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and decommissioned wind turbine blades.
Energy Vault’s EVx tower features 80% to 85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple GWh in storage capacity.
