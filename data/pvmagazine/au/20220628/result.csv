One way is to build electricity systems that can withstand natural disasters. That was the starting point of a three-year project we’re undertaking. The project has just reached a milestone: selecting eight sites where microgrids – small, self-sufficient energy systems – might help boost disaster resilience.
Smart site selection for new technologies is crucial. Too often, projects have been parachuted into communities without enough consideration, leading to poor outcomes for both project operators and residents.
The climate and environmental crises demand innovations in our everyday infrastructures. If these changes are to be accepted and adopted en masse, we must find the right fit between communities and infrastructure. Here, we share what we’ve learnt so far, in the hope other regional communities might benefit.
Microgrids are small-scale electricity networks that can be used as part of, or separate to, the main electricity grid. They usually involve a range of local electricity sources, and can supply power when communities are cut off from the main network – such as during a storm or fire.
But the form that microgrids should take is unclear and contested. A microgrid could be limited to servicing a handful of essential shops during disasters, or it could power the whole community all year round – protecting it from electricity market volatility as well as disasters.
The Eurobodalla Shire is a picturesque coastal region with a growing population. During the Black Summer fires, power supplies were lost across large parts region and the outage lasted several days.
Our project is working with Eurobodalla communities to determine if microgrids are right for them. We aim to model using microgrids coupled with renewable energy – including household, commercial and community solar, and small- and medium-scale batteries.

Under the previous federal government, Australia’s approach to emissions reduction was narrow and technology-centred.
The new Labor government – elected on the promise of climate action – has the opportunity to move to a community-based approach. This should ensure any new infrastructure integrates with people’s lives, values, and aspirations.
Such an approach requires proponents and funding bodies (both government and private) to genuinely listen to communities’ needs – right from the early design stage.
If local circumstances are not considered, a trial can be plagued with problems. These include:
So how did we decide which communities to work with? One guiding principle was to elevate local voices in the decision-making process.
For the selection of sites we held discussions with organisations including the local electricity network company, a prominent community group focused on sustainability and the Eurobodalla Shire Council.
Based on our initial discussions and a literature review, we compiled a set of indicators to help identify which communities would most benefit from the resilience boost that microgrids offer. The indicators include:
In the case of the Eurobodalla region, we also considered communities’ past experience of traumatic disasters, and subsequent “consultation fatigue” following the many investigations into the Black Summer fires.
While our assessment was project specific, we’ve made our framework freely available here so it might inform future technology trials.
From these indicators, we selected eight communities ranging from small hamlets of less than 100 residents to larger towns with more than 2,000 residents.
All were found to be vulnerable to natural disaster – for example, they may have had high residential occupancy rates (as opposed to holiday lettings), or lots of elderly people and those with disability. These communities also had high rates of rooftop solar installation.
The project team will now speak to residents and businesses in each community about their future energy needs, and whether microgrids might have a role. We’ll ask questions such as:
By the end of the project, we hope to have identified which, if any, communities wish to move forward with microgrids. For those that do, our project will provide the initial social research and technical feasibility studies on which to build proposals and potentially apply for federal funding.
As the climate emergency worsens, there is too much at stake to adopt the “decide, announce, defend” method of technology roll-out. Community-based approaches will better build the widespread support needed to accelerate climate action.
And the recent energy crisis on east coast showed natural disasters aren’t the only threats to electricity supplies. As the national electricity market grapples with a perfect storm of challenges, technology to help communities become energy self-sufficient makes even more sense.

The initiative is born of the partnership between Flinders and Engie and will see the university charge its EV fleet during the night from Engie’s Willogoleche Wind Farm, which sits about 200 kilometres north of the university. Intermittent daytime charging will be supplemented by Flinders University’s onsite solar, it said. The EVs will then be used as batteries feeding renewable energy back to the campus grid between 5-9 pm, when demand is highest and the grid is primarily supplied by gas.
10 of the chargers will be located at Flinders University’s car park, nine in Bedford Park, which is where the university’s current EV fleet is based. The other 10 chargers will be at the university’s solar car park, where 4,136 solar panels provide both power and shade.
The state government is supporting the initiative by providing more than $350,000 as part of the South Australian Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Trials. This funding will enable the university to procure a series of Nissan Leaf vehicles which come with V2G capabilities. 
“Our goal is to expand the Flinders University EV fleet so we can construct a 650 kW virtual battery, using both smart charging stations and vehicle to grid technology,” Flinders’ Vice-Chancellor Colin Stirling, said. 
“This will allow our fleet of security and pool vehicles to operate in a way that embodies renewable energy generation, reducing the university’s peak demand while delivering benefits for the SA grid.”
Melbourne-based Jet Charge, which has been involved in a number of V2G trials, installed the chargers. Its chief executive Tim Washington, is a firm believer EVs will replace stationary storage in homes.
In future, Washington – who is also the chairperson of Australia’s Electric Vehicle Council and co-founder of Chargefox– predicts EVs capacity to store and move electrons via V2G charing ports will eventually transform entire cities and electricity networks.
Flinders University today runs on 100% renewable energy through its campus-based solar arrays and its power purchase agreement with Engie’s 119 MW Willogoleche Wind Farm.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/28/renus-first-tangible-hydrogen-project-announced-for-tasmania/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,TASMANIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 28, 2022",ReNu’s first ‘tangible’ hydrogen project announced for Tasmania,"The Hydrogen Tasmania Brighton Project, as its called, is to be located about half an hour’s drive north of Hobart and is targeting a production of between 430 to 900 kilograms per day, which would equate to between 155 to 330 tonnes annually.
The project is funded by clean energy incubator ReNu Energy and developed by its new subsidiary Countrywide Renewable Hydrogen (CRH), which it acquired in February, launching ReNu’s foray into hydrogen. The companies, via LinkedIn, described it as “our very first tangible renewable hydrogen project.”
CRH has now executed an option to lease a site for the project, it said, though parties must yet agree to the commercial terms for the lease and make definitive arrangements.
The 1 MW to 2 MW facility is set to sit adjacent to the Brighton Transport Hub and is targeting offtake from transport diesel users looking to decarbonise. 
The project also has the “capacity to supply the TasGas Network Bridgewater city gate for potential blending with natural gas,” ReNu’s ASX statement said, with CRH Managing Director Geoffrey Drucker noting the company is in “advanced discussions” with TasGas to either blend the hydrogen or to use it “as 100% hydrogen, a first for Australia.”
The Hydrogen Tasmania Brighton Project is aiming to be in production by early 2024, though this is of course subject to a final investment decision.
CRH has also entered into a term sheet, a non-binding agreement outlining the basic terms and conditions of the investment, with local contractor Bullock Civil Contracting. 
The agreement includes potential to install a behind-the-meter solar farm to lower the project’s electricity cost. The solar component would be located to the north of the intended site’s land parcel in a location CRH jointly identified with Bullock Civil. Tasmanian engineering consultancy Entura has been engaged to undertake a pre-feasibility study on behind the meter solar generation component.
Back to the project at large, owner ReNu said it is “expected to be a collaboration between CRH, an identified partner, Bullock Civil and the Tasmanian government.” Precisely what the state government’s participation will look like is not quite clear, though Drucker said CRH is in discussions with Renewables, Climate and Future Industries Tasmania, a government department, to make sure its domestic hydrogen supply plans support the government’s vision for Tasmania’s energy transformation and its target of net zero emissions by 2030.
Finally, ReNu’s ASX announcement noted the Hydrogen Tasmania Brighton Project “complements advanced discussions with potential offtakers  and partners to progress the planned 5 – 10 MW Tasmania green hydrogen project located in the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone.” CRH, owned by ReNu, seems to again be working with the government to progress this project, one of many planned for the Bell Bay industrial centre located in Tasmania’s north.
CRH says it currently has five renewable hydrogen projects under development in Australia, the two in Tasmania, two in Victoria and another in Queensland.

Tata Power Solar has commissioned India’s largest floating solar power project in Kayamkulam, Kerala.
The 101.6 MWp project was installed on a 350-acre body of water in Kerala. It is India’s first floating solar plant to benefit from a power purchase agreement. It will supply the power to Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB).
“This installation was completed within the scheduled timeline, despite the arduous challenges of variable water depths, high sea tides, and severe water salinity concerns faced throughout the project’s construction duration,” Tata Power said.
The plant includes a 5 MW inverter on a floating platform. The system is anchored with 134 cast pile foundations, bored to a depth of 20 meters underwater. 
The array had to be towed for 3 km on a sea-linked national waterway, which was 15 meters deep. The company then synchronised the 33/220 kV air-insulated substation with the existing 220 kV gas-insulated substation.
Separately, NTPC recently commissioned its 92 MW Kayamkulam floating solar project in Kerala. The array spans a number of reservoirs owned by NTPC’s Rajiv Gandhi Gas-based Power Station. NTPC switched on the initial 22 MW phase in March and the second 35 MW phase in May.

The Green Energy Auction Bids Evaluation and Awards Committee (GEA-BEAC) of the Philippines’ Department of Energy (DOE) has published a list of 19 winners of a recent auction to allocate 2 GW of renewable energy capacity.
The GEA-BEAC launched the auction in January. It had previously pre-selected 24 bidders for the procurement exercise’s final phase. Overall, it allocated 1,966.4 MW of renewables in the procurement exercise. About 119.1 MW of the total was hydropower, 1.490.3 GW was large-scale solar, 374 MW was wind power, and 3.4 MW was biomass.
The main winner of the auction is Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corp. (SPNEC), which secured three PV projects with capacities of 200 MW, 280 MW, and 450 MW, in the Luzon region. It also won a 300 MW solar project in the Visayas region and a 200 MW scheme on the island of Mindanao. 
In the Luzon region, Pavi Green Renewable Energy secured a 40.4 MW PC project and Greenergy Solutions won a 99.9 MW project. However, the agency has yet to reveal the final prices in the auction.
“The winning bidders were ranked based on their offers from the lowest to the highest bid price and stacked corresponding to the respective renewable energy technology per grid,” it said, without providing additional details.
The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has set a cap price for PV technology at PHP 3.628 ($0.066)/kWh for the exercise. The cap for wind power is PHP 5.2887.
The government of the Philippines announced plans to introduce the Green Energy Tariff Program auction in February 2020.
