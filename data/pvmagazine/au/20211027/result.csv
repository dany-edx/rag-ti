Keen to shake our reputation as a global quarry, a number of Australian groups are progressing promising plans which range from recovering storage minerals from tailings (essentially mining waste), to creating scaleable, efficient and sustainable recycling processes, as well as low-emission lithium extraction.
Having transitioned from a traditional mining outfit to today focussing on recycling and closed loop mineral recovery, Neometals has quietly been forming partnerships across the world to establish a handful of core projects. Yesterday, the company announced the completion of its Primobius battery recycling plant, which is a 50:50 joint venture with Germany’s SMS Group, and is based in Hilchenbach, north of Frankfurt. Trials of the plant are expected to begin in the coming weeks and be completed by the end of November.

The project has reached the final round of the prestigious German Sustainability Award for 2022, gaining attention for its recycling processes which don’t produce waste water, reuse gas byproducts and have ammonia tailings to be used by the fertiliser industry.
Neometals is also working on a project which is seeking to recover high purity vanadium from stockpiled slag from Scandinavian steel mills. The company’s general manager, Jeremy McManus, told pv magazine Australia, that despite the project still being in its early stages, it has received significant interest from potential customers eager to secure the greenest possible version of the budding battery storage material.

The Queensland government yesterday announced it will be pursuing a joint venture with Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) and the University of Queensland to examine whether cobalt can be retrieved economically from old copper mine tailings.
As part of the three year international study, samples from the tailings of Copper Resources Australia’s Rocklands copper mine in north west Queensland will be studied at the University of Queensland’s Sustainable Minerals Institute and at JOGMEC’s laboratories in Japan.
“Queensland is renowned for having a large endowment of cobalt, however extracting and processing this mineral is often difficult due to costs and resources,” the state’s resources minister, Scott Stewart, said in a statement. “It could also revolutionise how Queensland copper mines operate by turning their waste into a revenue stream.”
The study is part of the Queensland government’s $23 million New Economy Minerals Initiative, and is expected to be completed by 2024 with a public report and data set.
Queensland-based Alumtek Minerals is also looking to recover materials including gallium, titanium, scandium and other rare earth elements from mined tailings, recently announcing a partnership with US aluminium producer Alcoa.
Finally, Sydney-based startup Novalith has managed to catch the eye of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) with its novel low carbon, sustainable approach to lithium production.
The government-backed green energy fund has invested $1.5 million into Novalith’s $2.5 million seed round, which it says will go towards the building and operation of a pilot plant in Sydney.
What is novel about the startup is that its process for extracting lithium consumes carbon dioxide as a reagent, reducing emissions, eliminating the need for conventionally consumed chemicals and minimising waste footprints. The approach also cuts out extensive offshore processing, enabling Australian-produced lithium ore to be processed closer to mine sites, further strengthening the sustainability of the supply chain.
 “The Novalith technology has the potential to change the nature of lithium production by using less energy and creating less emissions than current alternatives. It also offers an exciting opportunity for Australia to become a major processing, manufacturing and trading hub for lithium resources rather than merely exporting raw materials,” CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth said.
Global battery uptake is expected to grow at least nine-fold over the next decade as the world increases renewable energy use. According to analysis from Future Battery Industries, a diversified battery industry using onshore materials processing could create more than 34,000 jobs and increase the value of the Australian battery industry by $7.4 billion by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/27/hydrogen-ship-maker-to-develop-2-8-gw-green-facility-off-the-north-coast/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NORTHERN TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",Hydrogen ship maker to develop 2.8 GW green facility off the north coast,"Western Australian company Global Energy Ventures (GEV) today announced it will be developing a major green hydrogen project off Australia’s north coast with the backing of the Northern Territory government and traditional land owners. The Tiwi Hydrogen Project, as its called, will be constructed in phased capacity up to 2.8 GW, eventually producing 100,000 tonnes per annum of green hydrogen for export into the Asia-Pacific region. 
The initial development will see around 500 MW of solar generation installed on the island, expanding as regional hydrogen markets grow and costs of solar, electrolysers and shipping reduce. A financial investment decision for the project’s first phase is expected in 2023, with the company saying this would allow its first hydrogen export to begin in 2026, subject to approvals and offtake.
The project seeks to vertically integrate GEV’s hydrogen business, which has largely focussed on designing and making ships to both run on and carry compressed hydrogen. “This project can transition GEV from a midstream service provider to an innovative hydrogen company,” GEV’s managing director and CEO, Martin Carolan, said. “Our compressed shipping solution is highly modular and can therefore scale to match the advancement of electrolyser technologies and market demand for pure green hydrogen gas, and deliver a competitive cost of hydrogen as the project scales.”
Storing hydrogen as a compressed gas has received far less attention than its denser cousins, liquified hydrogen and ammonia. The Western Australian company, however, is convinced the simplicity of compressed hydrogen makes it both a quicker and more financially feasible way to supply the Asia-Pacific region.
The Tiwi Islands were selected for the project because of their proximity to key future markets like Japan, Korea and China. The project’s location is also near to Port Melville, with GEV saying it will continue working with the port’s owners AusGroup Limited to integrate the project and port facilities. 
The company will be developing the Tiwi Hydrogen Project in parallel to its ship engineering and class approval program, which earlier this month cleared a significant approval milestone after being issued its Approval in Principle from the American Bureau of Shipping.
The Northern Territory’s Minister for Renewables and Energy, Eva Lawler, welcomed the news and the company’s work with the Tiwi Land Council and Traditional Owners of the land. GEV’s proposed project is located on the traditional lands of the Munupi people, with the company saying its next steps in developing the project include working with the Tiwi Plantation Corporation, Tiwi Land Council and Munupi Landowners to progress securing a Section 19 Lease/Licence over the proposed solar site. 
It is also seeking to finalise community benefits to the Tiwi people, in the form of leasehold payments, employment, and supporting power and water infrastructure.
GEV plans to fast track the installation of solar monitoring stations at several locations on the island, allowing it to establish bankable solar generation data for the proposed project location. It will then move forward with feasibility studies, gathering further information on the project development schedule, technical partners, project scale, solar monitoring activities and appointment of consultants.

The pair will look into producing hydrogen fuel cells, electrolysers, hydrogen-powered vehicles, as well as hydrogen power units including generators and emergency power supplies as part of the ambitious deal.
GCEP is a consortium of Gippsland-based businesses including Ferguson Civil, Solis RE and Nexsys Industries Consulting, which say they are driven by a shared desire to develop an integrated hydrogen economy in the region. With a long history in coal, Gippsland’s high level of engineering, power generation and manufacturing expertise was a major factor in the decision to establish the centre of excellence and renewables precinct in the area, executive director of GCEP, Brett Singh, said. So far, the members of GCEP have fostered significant investment in the region, securing Octopus Investments Australia and the Clean Energy Finance Council (CEFC) as investment partners who have wholly acquired the region’s Perry Bridge and Fulham Solar Farm projects. With the electricity from these projects, GCEP is looking to support green hydrogen initiatives.
Bringing in the fast growing H2X outfit, which has multiple arms stretching across the globe, is expected to help fast track the Gippsland precinct plans.
Less than a week ago, ASX-listed hydrogen producer Pure Hydrogen bought a 24% stake in H2X Global. The deal will see Pure Hydrogen become H2X’s preferred hydrogen supplier, and will usher in a new joint venture company, Pure X Mobility, which will develop and sell hydrogen fuel cell utility vehicles like waste disposal trucks and concrete agitators.
H2X is planning to unveil a range of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) over the next 24 months, including everything from trucks and buses to light vehicles like the Warrego ute which the company launched to much fanfare in September. The company is also looking to target the agricultural industry and create farm-ready machines, according to the company’s corporate affairs specialist, Tony Blackie.
It appears the fuel cells and some of H2X’s future vehicles may well be manufactured in Gippsland, with the return of manufacturing capabilities to Australia having long been the vision of H2X’s CEO, Brendan Norman. H2X says its facilities, coupled with work from the Gippsland Circular Economy Precinct, will provide new jobs and training to transition the region from legacy power generation at Hazelwood, Yallourn and Loy Yang coal fire generators to a fresh new hydrogen economy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/27/plastic-for-solar-panels/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",Plastic for solar panels?,"From pv magazine USA
Three manufacturers, Merlin Solar, Solarge, and LG, are making a move away from the standard aluminium and glass solar panel in a bid to lower weight, emissions, and cost.
The product from Merlin Solar has been found recently on yachts in pv magazine USA. Its value is that, first, it isn’t a standard framed product and so can be attached directly to a flat surface. Second, due to its unique busbar technology, the product is able to be walked on without damage.
Merlin Solar’s main goal, however, is to place its product on top of commercial structures whose limited available collateral load — the amount of weight that can be added to a structure’s roof and meet local building code regulations — doesn’t allow for the pounds per square foot (3-7 psf) that a standard solar installation requires.
The company recently installed 550 kWdc of its product on an oil storage tank in Rensselaer, New York. Merlin Solar said this site could neither take on the additional weight, nor gain owner approval for an attachment technique that might puncture the structure’s outer roofing layer.
Merlin Solar also markets its product in a framed format where a stronger structural attachment is required, or where a more rigid solar panel is desired. Even so, the product weighs considerably less than a standard solar panel because it does not use a glass front shield.
Solarge has released a product that replaces the glass of a solar panel with a plastic product. Currently, the company is manufacturing the panel on a pilot line which it said it hopes to scale up by the end of 2022. The company’s panel can be bought on its own, or as part of their custom designed east-west facing rooftop racking product.
The solar panel weighs just under 32 pounds (14.5 kg). For comparison’s sake, a Q Cell product made in Georgia weighs 43.8 pounds (19.9 kg). In the east-west configuration and including the racking hardware, the Solarge DUO will weigh 1.35 psf (6.6 kg/m2). And keep in mind that the lowest allowable collateral load often is around 3 psf.
 One point emphasised by the manufacturer is the product’s apparent strong emissions and recyclability credibility:
The product will have a CO2 footprint which is 80% lower than conventional solar panels and the panel is completely circular in design and uses no Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) materials, unlike all other solar panels that use a polymeric film instead of glass.
LG Chem — part of the conglomerate that also sells the successful LG solar panel line with a manufacturing facility in Alabama — has announced that it is exploring turning the frames of solar panels from aluminium into plastics.
LG Chem said the product is as strong as aluminium, but cheaper and, of course, lightweight. Although no specific numbers were available, an LG Chem press release said its product can be manufactured with post-consumer recycled polycarbonate which will lower the emissions of the frame.
The compound, called LUPOY EU5201, is an engineering plastic composed of ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) resins with polycarbonate as a base, and reinforced with glass fibres. High rooftop temperatures are well tolerated by the compound, which incorporates a flame retardant. It can maintain its shape across a range of temperatures due to its low coefficient of thermal expansion. And LG Chem claimed the new compound is highly resistant to corrosion, resistant to impacts, and extremely resistant to UV.
The company said it began selling products in the third quarter, indicating that it could already be headed toward solar panel factories for final manufacturing.
A shift to more plastics in solar panels will gain the attention of those who are considering the environmental credibility of solar power. While aluminium and glass manufacturing use an immense amount of energy, plastics are a major contributor to global trash pollution. They also are manufactured from hydrocarbons (oil).
However, the actual manufacturing of plastics from hydrocarbons — a process called cracking — doesn’t release emissions. It is the energy used to generate the heat — usually from fossil gas — that results in greenhouse gas emissions.
From this author’s experience building rooftop solar power, access to products that would lower the psf by greater than 50% of what is often our lowest allowable collateral load of 3 psf would open up a large amount of rooftop space for development.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/27/australias-belated-net-zero-2050-commitment-depends-upon-ultra-low-cost-solar/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 27, 2021",Australia’s belated net zero 2050 commitment depends upon ‘ultra low-cost solar’,"Once the Murdoch media decided to support the energy transition, the Morrison government was sure to follow meekly behind. With only days before Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to appear in Glasgow, Scotland, for the COP26 climate conference, he has finally joined much of the rest of the world in setting a 2050 net zero carbon emissions target. 
Perhaps Morrison hopes to have saved himself from dressing down on the international stage from the Queen or the U.S. President, but at least the country is now set to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions, or at least remove the equivalent of whatever it produces, by 2050. However, while Morrison said in a statement that his government “will act in a practical, responsible way to deliver net zero emissions by 2050”, that does not amount to legislation or much in the way of discernible policy. 
The Morrison government’s Plan, described by shadow energy minister Adam Bandt as having less detail than a fortune cookie, rests on its “existing $20 billion investment in low emissions technology…including clean hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and energy storage.” 
So, the long-awaited commitment to net zero 2050 is less of a commitment and more of a reliance on existing investment and promising technology. The Morrison government hasn’t actually provided a plan or introduced a policy. 
However, what the Morrison government has done is finally concede the centrality of solar to Australia’s energy future. Morrison pointed to the potential “for continued technology advances and breakthroughs to unlock ultra low-cost solar…we have set a stretch goal of solar electricity generation at $15/MWh”. 
Ultra low-cost solar 
The Plan, albeit more of a publicity stunt, stated: “Unlocking ultra low-cost solar is therefore crucial for Australia’s electricity system to achieve near zero emissions.” 
While ARENA and the CEFC won’t be bolstered in any way from this announcement, the Australian government has “set an objective to achieve 30% module efficiency at 30 cents per installed watt by 2030 – the ‘Solar 30 30 30’ Initiative.” 
Although the Morrison government is not adding anything new to the push the price of solar down further, it does concede that ultra low-cost solar “would enable low-cost clean hydrogen production and increase our competitiveness in hydrogen export markets. It would also support cost-competitive production of low emissions steel and aluminium and emerging technologies like direct air capture of CO2.” 
Reaction 
Wood Mackenzie Asia Pacific head of markets and transitions, Parkash Sharma, said the Morrison government’s change of heart, after having said it would not commit to net zero 2050 at the previous election, “is a step in the right direction. Our analysis shows that Australia can reach net zero emissions by 2050. Although the pathway requires complete transformation of its traditional energy and export sectors, there are significant opportunities to capitalise on and protect future revenues.”
And while independent MP Zali Steggall welcomed the “commitment” as a “win for all who have been calling on the Government to adopt it for the last 2 years. However, beyond that, the Government’s climate ‘plan’ released today falls well short of the 2015 Paris Agreement commitment for signatories to do all things necessary to keep global warming under 2 degrees. In fact, as usual, it is a plan with no new announcements, no new money and smokescreens and mirrors.”
“The Prime Minister’s policy is made on the run,” continued Steggall, “at the last minute, at the 11th hour and without evidence. We need an independent, expert based climate change commission to guide our transition, not Nationals holding the Government to ransom.”
Prof Tim Flannery of the Climate Council also panned the “Plan”, saying it was not credible nor concrete and “means little”, noting that “A net zero target is fundamentally incompatible with new coal or gas – yet, the Federal Government is still funding fossil fuels.”
Meanwhile, the Clean Energy Council (CEC) said opportunities are going begging without greater climate ambition. “Without a stronger 2030 target,” said the CEC in a statement, “there remains a lack of clarity and positive investment signals to accelerate the decarbonisation of Australia and take advantage of the enormous economic opportunity in play. Today’s announcement does little more than echo the commitments and action already underway by state governments, businesses and households.”
According to Sharma’s analysis, nearly 83% of Australia’s power generation will come from solar and wind by 2050, compared to about 20% last year.

Scottish start-up Gravitricity is considering the deployment of its gravity energy storage system at the decommissioned Staříč coal mine, in the Moravian Silesian region of Czechia.
The mine consists of six deep sites that could potentially host the storage solution developed by Gravitricity, which uses clean power to raise a mass in a 150-1,500m shaft and discharges the electricity thus ‘stored’ by releasing the mass to rotate an electric generator.
Specialists from the U.K. company and Diamo, which is a state-owned entity that manages decommissioned mining sites across Czechia, investigated the location features down to a depth of over 1km.
An investment decision is expected to be made early next year and more mining sites in the country may be considered for further plans, Gravitricity said in a statement. “We are ready to cooperate in [the] preparation of this project and have provided Gravitricity with all the information to allow them to make a fully qualified decision on the Staříč mine,” stated Diamo CEO Ludvík Kašpar. “We are convinced that closed mines have the potential for further use and an energy storage project could be attractive and useful for the region.”
Experts from the VSB Technical University of Ostrava were also active in the project assessment. The project is part of a plan to commence a full-scale, 4-8 MW prototype scheme in a disused mine next year.
The storage system developed by Gravitricity has so far been built as a 250 kW demonstrator project on an industrial site at Port of Leith, Scotland’s largest enclosed deepwater port. That facility was built with a 15m high lattice tower, two 25-ton weights suspended by steel cables and two grid-connected generator units. The technology is claimed to have a faster response time than lithium-ion storage technology and to be able to help stabilise electricity networks at 50Hz by responding to full power demand in less than a second.
Gravity storage has begun to raise interest in the renewable energy industry in recent years. U.S. company Energy Vault unveiled, in 2019, gravity-based storage technology relying on a crane and 35-ton concrete blocks. Austrian research organisation the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) recently suggested gravitational energy storage for low-energy-demand locations.
