The company sends out between 30 to 35 pumps domestically and internationally each week, Commodore’s Marketing Manager Matt Miller told pv magazine Australia.
Commodore recently crunched the numbers on how much customers, primarily farmers in this case, save by opting for a solar water pump over diesel, petrol or mains-connected pumps. It found at the largest end of the scale, savings could reach $44,837 per year.

Few farms would need a pump that big however, so their savings wouldn’t reach such epic proportions. Nonetheless, Commodore found that for a mid-sized solar pump, the customer could save $1,793 in a year – paying off the bare running costs of a diesel pump in 2.77 years. Compared with a mains-connected grid, customers would save $1,404 and meet the running costs in 3.54 years. 
These numbers, Miller noted, don’t even include the costs of travel for diesel or maintenance, which can be significant.
“[Solar pumps] are a renewable source, it’s also a cost effective source,” Miller said. Be that as it may, solar pumps are routinely underestimated, he says, adding that there’s a real lack of awareness about how effective solar pumps are. “That’s quite often a misconception.”
That is, most farmers or other customers don’t expect solar-powered water pumps to have anywhere near the pumping capacity they do. For instance, a small 0.75 kW pump Miller says can in fact deliver 10,000 to 20,000 litres of water per day, dependant on head hight (which means how high up the water needs to travel). On the other end of the scale, the biggest solar pumps can draw up to 100,000L per hour. “It’s an enormous amount of water,”  Miller said, noting the pumps are not at all not supported by mains electricity supply.
Naturally, solar pumps only run in the daytime and continue to perform well even on cloudy days. The ground mounted solar arrays which power the pump can also be located in premium positions, with Miller pointing to a recent job where the solar array sat around 300 metres away from the pump, connected via cable.
Batteries can also be fitted to the pumps so they can be used on command. Miller says only around 10% of the solar pumps Commodore installs include batteries though.
While water pumps are most commonly used by farmers to irrigate crops, Commodore has fitted pumps in remote parts of Papua New Guinea as part of humanitarian projects bringing water to dry villages. Part of the beauty of solar pumps is they require far less maintenance compared to diesel pumps and require no fuel, which makes them far better suited for developing and remote communities.
In the last six months, solar pumps have also began integrating remote app access and monitoring, allowing customers to stop and start the pump and irrigations on their phones.

His familiarity with, and love of, Australia’s country has meant the solar broking startup he founded, Solar Saviour, is putting a particular emphasis on ensuring regional communities have access to what he calls “fairly priced” solar. Mitchell’s country roots have also seeded Saviour’s unusual growth strategy. By leveraging the often tight-knit relationships of country towns, Mitchell told pv magazine Australia the plan is to work with community groups, sports clubs and schools which have existing member bases to build referrals programs.
Coming into solar from traditional energy brokerage, Saviour’s Head of Partnerships, David Cobb, described himself as “shocked” to see most solar installers doing one job and simply leaving to the next. “Theres not a great deal of follow up, after sales service,” he told pv magazine Australia. Which is a massive oversight for businesses, he says, as it fails to recognise the wellspring of leads existing customers can generate. In his experience, nurturing relationships can form the core of a businesses growth.
In its first few months of existence, Solar Saviour – the solar broking arm of Mitchell’s larger Saviour Group startup – has already established a referral system for the commercial jobs it’s done. That is, once the company has successfully arranged and delivered a solar system for a business, it offers the business’ staff a discount to use the same solar company as their employer.
Saviour Group
The ultimate goal though is to become involved with regional community groups like sports clubs, offering them a kickback to use their membership base and get the word out about referrals. The startup was recently involved with a regional charity which had worked with one of its partnered installers. “The western downs outreach program – we donated $600 to their cause and we have a referral program launching next week in their community. For any locals, they will receive a further discount and we will donate $10 per kW to the charity in Chinchilla and Dalby areas in Queensland,” Mitchell said.
Through this method of word-of-mouth referrals, Saviour is seeking to get “happier, stickier customers who are referring friends,” Cobb said. Based in the Gold Coast, Saviour services all of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia. Mitchell says the startup also recently secured installers in WA, and plans to start working in the state from September. The startup is also the first accredited solar broker with the National Energy Charter.
Saviour Group
How Saviour Group vets the installers it works with, and ultimately recommends to customers, is by looking into the companies within its industry networks, alongside basic checks. For instance, Cobb said he will talk to wholesalers, financiers and people he knows in the industry. “If one of our financiers like Energy Ease or Plenti or Bright won’t work with an installer for some reason, then that would be a red flag for us,” he said.
Mitchell adds that it is in Saviour’s best interest to find reputable installers with consistent points of contact. “We need that relationship as well,” he said.
As for payment, Saviour’s fees come from the installers who, through its service, save on marketing. Both Mitchell and Cobb are adamant the service doesn’t give preferential treatment either. “Our wholesale rates with our installers are almost identical across the board, so there’s very little difference at all,” Cobb said. “We set that up purposefully.”
“With our consultants as well, it doesn’t matter which company their going to get the customers install with, they’re not incentivised.”
Extending its scope, the startup also recently began brokering energy from solar farms to retailers, with Mitchell noting he is currently speaking with two major retailers. Mitchell added the company is also “aiding in brokering supply of panels” for two solar farms, one in Western Australia and another in regional Queensland.

The projects will focus on partnership between community, industry, research and governments with “thoughtful investment” in people and infrastructure, Director of Deakin’s Energy Initiative, Dr Adrian Panow said.
“Of particular note is the recognition that social licence and training are essential if adoption of new technologies is to be efficient and to ensure that benefits of the transition flow across the breadth of the community,” Panow wrote on LinkedIn.
Deakin University
Of the state government’s funding, the lion’s share at $9 million will go towards Deakin’s hydrogen Hycel hub. The facility, a factory of sorts, will be devoted to the development, testing, training, demonstration and manufacture of hydrogen fuel technology at scale. It will be constructed on Deakin’s Warrnambool campus, on the coast in Victoria’s west – a region slated to become one of Australia’s future regional hydrogen hubs as part of the National Hydrogen Strategy. The federal government has also committed $2 million to Deakin’s Hycel project.
The new facility, for which construction is set to begin in December with completion expected by December 2022, will include a fuel cell wing with specialised fuel cell assembly and testing equipment, plumbed with hydrogen.
A particular focus will be on how hydrogen can be used in hard to abate sectors like transport, heavy vehicles and industry. In line with that goal, Deakin is partnering with Warrnambool Bus Lines to develop an optimisation model for hydrogen refuelling logistics, which supports a plan to transition buses from diesel to hydrogen.
Alongside the technology component, the facility is also intended to develop an education pipeline.
“Importantly, it’ll be a facility that will interface directly with communities, and particularly regional communities, to build that social licence so that when hydrogen becomes a viable large scale economy that the community is ready to accept it and we have a trained workforce that knows how to implement safely,” Panow told the ABC.
Partnering with South West TAFE, Deakin’s Hycel will connect industry to higher education institutions to prepare workers for the future industry. The design of the Hycel education programs are set to get underway later this year.
“These projects will create world-class training and research facilities right here in Victoria – with huge benefits not just on skills and training but also industry and our economy,” Victoria’s Minister for Higher Education, Gayle Tierney, said at the project’s launch yesterday.
Deakin University
The second project being supported is Deakin’s Battery Technology Research and Innovation Hub 2.0, with the somewhat unfortunate acronym BatTRI-HUB 2.0. This facility is set to be built at the university’s Burwood campus in Melbourne city.
The “technology research and translation facility” will specialise in advanced battery design, fabrication and testing. It will include a pilot production line to manufacture advanced batteries and battery components, an expansion of existing pouch cell prototyping, a cell and pack testing lab, and advanced cell diagnostics and materials characterisation.
Deakin says the facility will seek to advance existing technologies such as lithium but will also focus on sustainable alternatives such as sodium batteries.
In the state government’s media release on the funding, it said the facility’s “products will be developed to meet bespoke requirements in defence, agriculture, disaster zones and health settings.”
Like the Hycel Hub, the BatTRI-HUB 2.0 will also have a focus on providing education, training and employment opportunities.
Construction to begin in January 2022 and to be completed by May 2022 – though research projects will begin sooner elsewhere on campus.
The Victorian government said the projects will accommodate 290 jobs in research, manufacturing and energy while the construction process will create about 78 local jobs.

An international research team has developed a novel concept of gravitational energy storage based on buoyancy, that can be used in locations with deep sea floors and applied to both the storage of offshore wind power and compressed hydrogen.
Called Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST), the proposed technology is defined as an alternative to pumped-hydro storage for coasts and islands without mountains that are close to deep waters. It consists of using stored renewable electricity to power a motor that lowers a compressed gas recipient and then generating electricity by releasing the compressed gas recipient to rise back to the surface through the water.
“The system is a low-cost, long-term solution for storing compressed green hydrogen produced with solar power or renewable electricity generated by large scale offshore wind facilities,” research co-author, Julian David Hunt, told pv magazine, noting that the use of BEST is interesting for offshore wind power plants, as these should operate in weekly energy circles and be able to store energy for four days and then generate electricity for another four days.
“Regarding the use of buoyancy energy storage for floating solar panels, even though there might be potential for this technology, as it is located close to the deep sea, it would be cheaper to store energy with batteries, as it only requires daily energy storage,” he further explained. “In other words, BEST systems are expensive for storing energy for 12 hours but are cheap to store energy for four days.”
The proposed system uses air or hydrogen as compression gases to fill the recipient, which can be shaped as a series of balloons or tanks. The buoyancy force is exerted by the gas as it has a smaller density than the water. The recipient is connected to the motor and the anchor, located on the ocean’s depths, through a cable and pulleys. “The cable is stored in a cylinder attached to the motor/generator when the buoyancy recipient is lowered,” the scientists explained. “The pulleys also contribute to increasing the speed of the cables and lowering the forces applied to the motor/generator.”
The cost of the cable is pointed out as a possible limiting factor for the technology at this, initial stage, due to its long length and the robustness it has to show. The anchor, on the other hand, must also be built with extreme robustness, as it must sustain the high buoyancy forces created by the gas recipient. “The anchor would be made of steel and screwed to the bottom of the ocean with a system similar to an oil rig,” the group explained. “The weight of the ground where the forces are applied should be larger than the buoyancy force of the recipient.”
The system is able to increase or decrease the speed of the buoyancy recipient depending on the storage needs, and a velocity of 0.01m/s is considered ideal to minimise losses due to friction. The recipient must be built with holes to allow water to penetrate it when it is lowered and the pressure increases. When the recipient is raised, the pressure difference increases and water is pushed out. “Given the rapid reduction in volume of the compressed gas in the first ten to 100m from the surface, the installation of the system requires the support of a ship on the surface to lower the system to the minimum operation depth and then introduce the pressurised compressed gas to the system,” the research team further explained.
The system can operate at a maximum depth of around 10,000m and pressure of 1,000 bars and a minimum depth of around 3,000m and pressure of 300 bars. “If the designed minimum pressure of the system is smaller, the volume of the gas will reduce substantially, reducing the energy storage potential of the system,” the academics emphasised. “If the designed minimum pressure increases, the altitude variation in which the system can operate reduces, reducing the energy storage potential.”
When combined with offshore wind, the proposed system can store electricity at an investment cost of between €50 and €100/kWh while, when utilised for compressing hydrogen, it is said to improve compression efficiency to up to 90%, according to the research group. To achieve a lower cost, the system can also be combined with battery storage, especially if the capital costs of the latter will further drop in the future. “Thus, the combination of both systems will offer an energy storage solution with low cost of stored energy ($/MWh) and low cost of power capacity ($/MW),” it further explained. “[The] BEST system operates slowly but [can] constantly charge and discharge in a weekly cycle while the battery will rapidly charge and discharge in a six to 24-hour cycle.”
The scientists recognised that this kind of storage has so far been studied on a theoretical level and that only small, lab-scale experiments were conducted. Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, the USA, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Cuba, Jamaica, Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Portugal, Oman, South Africa, Madagascar and Somalia, Ivory Coast and Ghana were pointed out as the most suitable locations for this storage technology.
It was presented in the paper Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology: An energy storage solution for islands, coastal regions, offshore wind power and hydrogen compression, published in the Journal of Energy Storage. The research team included scientists from Brazil’s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul; the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in Austria; and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, in Germany.

Revolt Energy Green, a French lighting and electrical distribution equipment specialist, is leasing solar kits with capacities ranging from 4.3 kW to 30 kW, in multiple configurations.
The 4.3 kW arrays can be deployed with 15 kWh energy storage systems.
“It can be installed with a modular approach on maritime containers or containers for construction sites,” CEO Fabrice Lefebvre told pv magazine. “It allows the production of energy for self-consumption and in total autonomy.”
For mobile solutions, the company offers solar trailers with capacities up to 5.25 kW, linked to 23 kWh batteries. The plug-and-play solution, which can also be equipped with remote monitoring, can be adapted to different construction sites.
The company’s largest and most powerful solution is a semi-mobile 74 kW solar system with a 153 kWh energy storage unit.
“This can be used, for example, for one-off events, such as festivals that take place outside large cities,” said Lefebvre.
The entire range is equipped with solar panels from France’s Voltec Solar, while minigrid specialist Ecosun has agreed to handle the integration of the mobile systems. Germany’s Victron Energy supplies the converters, solar charge controllers and battery management systems.
Revolt Energy Green’s first customers have included recreational centres, music festivals, and French telecoms group Orange, which uses the solar+storage systems to provide power for its antennas.
It has also developed an electricity generator that runs on hydrogen to replace fossil fuel power generators. Developed in cooperation with startup H2Sys, the system includes a 3 kW fuel cell.
“For now, they are filled with blue hydrogen, but our ultimate goal is to move to a green hydrogen supplier,” said Lefebvre.
