The Australian and German governments have announced conditional funding of up to $50 million (USD 35.5 million) and EUD 40 million ($61.2 million, USD 43.5 million), respectively, has been awarded across four projects as part of the HyGATE initiative that aims to spark collaboration between industry and research partners for the development of renewable hydrogen technologies and open up new market opportunities.
Hysata is among those to receive funding as part of the initiative, awarded $8.98 million from the Australian Energy Agency (ARENA) and $9 million (EUD 5.9 million) from Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) to support the development of the company’s electrolyser technology which it said will deliver the most efficient electrolyser in the world.
Based in the Illawarra on the New South Wales (NSW) south coast, Hysata will work with Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology to develop its ‘capillary-fed’ electrolyser technology to deliver low-cost hydrogen at Port Kembla.
Hysata Chief Executive Officer Paul Barrett said the company’s electrolyser technology operates at 95% system efficiency, delivering a “giant leap” in performance and cost over incumbent technologies, which he said typically operate at 75% or less.
Barrett said Hysata’s electrolysis cell can produce green hydrogen from water at 98% cell energy efficiency.
The company says its technology could enable hydrogen production of below $1.50 per kg by the “mid 2020s”, making hydrogen commercially available and supports Australia’s ambitions of reducing the cost of green hydrogen to facilitate its wider adoption.
“Australia has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to be a global leader in green hydrogen and we are delighted to see the government backing Australian innovators,” Barrett said.
“Our technology will enhance sovereign manufacturing capabilities, create high-skilled jobs and position Australia as a green hydrogen powerhouse by providing electrolysers for domestic projects and exports.”
Hysata said the technology has been proven at lab-scale and the company is now focused on developing and commercialising a full-scale system with Barrett saying the funding will allow Hysata to tap into German engineering expertise to help it design its “factory of the future.”

The other projects to receive funding under the Hygate initiative include a“world-first” green methanol production plant proposed by Australian concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) specialist Vast Solar and German engineering consultancy Fichtner and a green hydrogen project backed by Australian renewables developer Edify Energy and German engineering and technology company Siemens Energy. The Australian arm of Canadian gas giant ATCO will also receive funding for a green hydrogen and ammonia production facility in New South Wales (NSW).
Vast Solar and Fichtner, part of the broader Solar Methanol Consortium, will receive almost $40 million ($19.48 million and EUR 13.2 million) to develop a “world-first” green methanol production plant near Port Augusta in South Australia.
The SM1 project entails the use of a 10 MW electrolyser for the manufacture of green hydrogen as an input to green methanol production. The project is to be powered by a 30 MW CSP plant Vast Solar is developing at Port Augusta.
Vast Solar Chief Executive Officer Craig Wood said SM1 will produce 7,500 tonnes of green methanol per annum and has already attracted the interest of local and international offtakers, including major shipping companies and airlines.
“SM1 has the potential to supply the shipping and aviation industries with zero-emission fuel,” he said. “This is a major step forward in helping to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors. Today’s announcement has the potential to supercharge the domestic renewables industry.”

The Edify project, known as EGH2, is the first stage of a planned 1 GW green hydrogen production facility that will export hydrogen globally through the Port of Townsville in north Queensland.
The first phase of the project includes the deployment of a 17.5 MW Siemens Energy electrolyser, which will be powered by 21 MW of solar, to produce green hydrogen. The aim is to expand the project to an electrolyser capacity of 1 GW capable of producing up to 150,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year.
Edify has been awarded more than $45 million ($20.74 million and EUD 16.4 million) to progress the project.
The Sydney-headquartered company is also in the development stages of building its 200 MW Majors Creek Solar Power Station, which will supply electricity to the Lansdown facility.
ATCO was awarded almost $8 million ($800,000 and EUD 4.7 million) to investigate the feasibility of developing a 1 GW green hydrogen production facility and 800,000 tonne per year green ammonia facility near Port Kembla in NSW.
Karen Nielsen, managing director of Global Renewables at ATCO, said the output of both facilities, known collectively as ScaleH2, is be exported to Germany, creating a scalable export value chain.
“ATCO has set its sights on exports to global markets and the ScaleH2 project will further advance our ambitions to expand our capabilities as a hydrogen leader in Australia and the globe,” she said. “The ScaleH2 project, with our partners, will accelerate understanding across industry of hydrogen’s economic potential towards a clean energy future.”

As well as the funding announcement, Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen and Germany’s Minister of Education and Research Bettina Stark-Watzinger released a joint report which outlines the steps needed to establish a supply chain for renewable hydrogen between our countries.
Bowen said the collaboration with Germany further helps Australia strengthen its renewable energies export infrastructure, while allowing Germany to meet its growing energy needs via cleaner sources.
“Collaboration with Germany will help grow Australia’s hydrogen export market and support our nation’s vision of becoming a renewable energy superpower,” he said.
Bowen said by 2050, Australia’s hydrogen industry could generate $50 billion in additional GDP and create more than 16,000 jobs, as well as an additional 13,000 jobs from the construction of renewable energy infrastructure to power the production of green hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/30/res-plans-600-mwh-big-battery-as-coal-fired-plants-exit-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,UNITED KINGDOM",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 30, 2023",RES plans 600 MWh big battery as coal-fired plants exit system,"The New South Wales (NSW) government’s plan to bring at least 2 GW of energy storage online by 2030 to replace the state’s ageing coal-fired power generators has received a boost with British developer Renewable Energy Systems (RES) proposing to build a 600 MWh battery energy storage project at Brandy Hill in the Hunter region.
The proposed 250 MW/600 MWh Brandy Hill battery energy storage systems is to be constructed next to network operator Ausgrid’s Brandy Hill substation about 30 kilometres northwest of Newcastle in the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone.
RES said the big battery will fit within the strategic direction of the NSW and Australian energy generation market and assist the transition to an increased contribution of renewable energy to fill the gap created by the planned retirement of the state’s coal-fired generation fleet.
The Hunter and Central Coast is home to four of the state’s five existing coal-fired generators. Four of those power stations are slated to shut down within 15 years, starting with the Liddell Power Station which is to be closed entirely in April.
RES said the Brandy Hill battery would be able to provide the stabilising and other grid benefits that have traditionally been provided by thermal generation.
“The BESS, through its connection to the substation, would provide the ability to charge energy and discharge it to the network at times of peak demand or critical need,” the company said. “It would also have the capacity to charge or discharge when power system services are required to maintain the stability of the broader electricity grid.”
“This will be of particular importance as Australian energy generation transitions from conventional dispatchable thermal generation to 100% non-dispatchable intermittent renewable energy generation.”

RES is currently seeking community feedback on the project as it waits for the NSW Department of Planning and Environment to provide their project specific assessment requirements (SEARs) which will inform the required environmental impact statement (EIS). It is anticipated that the application and approval processes will commence in April.
The company is targeting start of construction of the Brandy Hill battery in 2025 with commissioning and operation to begin in 2027.
The Brandy Hill battery is the latest big battery proposal announced by RES. The developer also plans to build a 400 MW/1200 MWh battery storage facility as part of a renewable energy hub being developed near Stawell in western Victoria.
Plans for the Watta Wella Renewable Energy Hub include a three-hour big battery, a 62.5 MW solar farm and a 315 MW wind farm. Both the solar farm and the big battery would be located close to the existing Bulgana substation.
RES has also announced plans to include a “containerised battery energy storage system” of unspecified capacity as part of the Tarong West Wind Farm project being developed near Kingaroy in central Queensland.
Those projects are part of RES’ burgeoning Australian portfolio. The developer, which entered the Australian market in 2004, said it manages a portfolio of 3 GW of renewable assets in Australia including 1.4 GW of solar facilities. This includes the 68 MW Emerald Solar Park in Queensland and the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australia. Its Australian wind assets include the Murra Warra and Ararat wind farms in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/30/renewable-energy-generation-hits-record-levels-in-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 30, 2023",Renewable energy generation hits record levels in Australia,"The latest data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) shows that average renewable energy output from wind, solar and hydro was the highest on record in the final quarter of 2022 with peak renewable contribution records also broken as the overall contribution of both coal-fired and gas generation fell.
AEMO’s Quarterly Energy Dynamics (QED) report for the December quarter reveals that renewable energy provided an average of 40.3% of power in the National Electricity Market (NEM), a record for any quarter since the NEM started in 1998.
The record performance of renewables also reached Western Australia (WA) where renewables supplied a record quarterly share of nearly 43% of power in the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) in the final three months of 2022, up 3% on the same period in 2021.
The report also shows that renewable energy generation in the WEM peaked at 84.3% on 12 December, up 3.7% on the previous high.
In the NEM, instantaneous renewable penetration reached a record high of 68.7% on 28 October, exceeding the previous record of 64% set in the previous quarter.

AEMO said the records were “largely driven” by rooftop solar which delivered a 16% increase in electricity output for the quarter. An increase due in part to a rise in rooftop solar installations in the third quarter of 2022. After substantial declines in rooftop PV installation rates in the first half of 2022, with installed capacity down 27% compared with first half of 2021, AEMO said Clean Energy Regulator (CER) data showed an estimated 729 MW of small-scale PV capacity was installed in the third quarter of 2022.
Rooftop solar output reached a record high of 10,685 MW on 27 December 2022, 8% higher than the previous record achieved in the same period the year prior. (Figure 39). New South Wales (NSW) led the way with a 28% increase in distributed PV output relative to the same quarter in 2021. Queensland (+15%), Victoria (+12%), Tasmania (+7%) and South Australia (+4%) also experienced growth relative to last quarter.

Output from wind and grid-scale solar also grew strongly in the December quarter, producing 20% of total generation in the NEM. This continued the upwards trend for large-scale renewable generation which delivered a record quarterly average of 4,532 MW, up 645 MW from the same period the year prior. Grid-scale solar reached an all-time average output record of 1,644 MW as new facilities were connected and commissioned.
AEMO said 139 MW of increased grid-scale solar generation arose from ramping up of solar farms commissioning since the fourth quarter of 2021, including the 120 MW Gangarri Solar Farm in southwest Queensland. An additional 200 MW of the generation increase was from new grid-scale solar commencing production since the fourth quarter of 2021. Of this, 159 MW was in Queensland, including the recently connected Western Downs Green Power Hub, Blue Grass, Woolooga and Coolumboola solar farms. The Moura Solar Farm in Queensland, the West Wyalong Solar Farm in NSW and the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park in South Australia also began generating in the final quarter of 2022.
Grid-scale solar output reached a record high of 5,311 MW on 6 December, 15% above the previous record set in the previous quarter.
The result of this increase in output from large-scale wind and solar farms and rooftop PV was that power generation from black and brown coal-fired plants was the lowest since the NEM started, down 926 MW from the same period last year. Overall demand from gas-fired generators also decreased during the quarter.

Researchers from the University of Oxford have looked at how second-life batteries (SLBs) could be combined with rooftop solar in remote school buildings throughout East Africa. They found that such devices could provide a lower LCOE than new storage systems.
They described their findings in “Second-life battery systems for affordable energy access in Kenyan primary schools,” which was recently published in Scientific Reports. They investigated the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed system configuration and said that its use could be extended to electrify all rural households.
“Lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles are particularly high-value SLBs,” they explained. “At their ‘end-of-life’, they still typically have 70% to 80% of their capacity remaining. This equates to thousands of charge/discharge cycles and hours of usable energy storage.”
The academics spoke to 12 East African schools about their respective consumption profiles and projected energy needs, as well as the technical and financial challenges. They aimed to compare the performance of the proposed system configuration with two reference systems featuring conventional batteries and grid electricity.
The electricity produced by the solar-plus-storage system would be used for classroom lighting, security lighting, information technology, and phone charging.
“These all use relatively little power, which speaks well to the potential suitability of hybrid battery and PV solutions to meet school energy needs,” the scientists explained.
Th appliances are roughly the same for the four schools. They would require an average installed power of around 5 kW, given an annual average demand of 10,220 kWh.
The scientists calculated the LCOE of the three system configurations over 25 years.
“This was estimated at USD 0.31/kWh ($0.44/kWh), resulting from the current electricity cost of USD 0.28/kWh and considering an annual utility escalating factor of 1%,” they said. “Results for each scenario show that the LCOE varies between USD 0.11/kWh and USD 0.22/kWh and that in 97.2% of the scenarios studies, using second-life batteries is cheaper compared to new batteries as per the LCOE obtained.”
They identified a minimum payback time of 2.9 years for a hybrid system consisting of a 5 kW PV system and 5 kWh of SLB storage. They found that locally sourced SLBs were cheaper than imported new batteries in all of the scenarios. They also determined that the maximum reduction in LCOE of 29.4% could be achieved for a system that combines 7.5 kW of PV with 20 kWh of SLB storage, or for a 10 kW of PV paired with 20 kWh of SLB storage.
“While we have shown that SLBs can reduce the costs of school energy access in Kenya significantly while effectively mitigating the challenges of battery waste, there are still a number of issues that need to be overcome for SLBs to be effectively used on a wide scale,” the scientists concluded, noting that more research will be needed to address the aforementioned issues.
