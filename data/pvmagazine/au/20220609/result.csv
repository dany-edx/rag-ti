The Illawarra REZ, centred around the steel city of Wollongong south of Sydney, is one of five renewable energy zones included in the NSW government’s electricity Roadmap, which is forecast to support more than $32 billion of private investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission in the state.
REZs will also be developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, New England and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage online.
That capacity is likely to be revised with the four REZs for which ROIs have so far been requested having been swamped by investors. The Central West Orana REZ drew 27GW of interest when it had planned to coordinate 3GW and the New England REZ attracted 34GW for a proposed 8GW of integrated assets. The Hunter-Central Coast REZ attracted more than 80 clean energy projects totalling almost 40GW while the South-West REZ attracted 34GW of potential generation and storage projects.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo), the government-controlled authority appointed to lead the delivery of the REZs, has not set any targets for the amount of generation and energy storage capacity to be hosted in the Illawarra REZ but said is an ideal location for the development of a renewable energy zone.
“The region already hosts major energy, port and transport infrastructure, has a skilled workforce, has the potential to utilise existing dams for pumped hydro, harness significant offshore wind generation and has strong demand for future hydrogen projects, including for future green steel production,” it said.
EnergyCo said two separate 2GW offshore wind projects have already been proposed off the coast of the Illawarra, which could connect to existing infrastructure to generate affordable, clean and reliable electricity.

Hydrogen projects are also expected to play a significant role in the Illawarra REZ, building on the NSW government’s $70 million commitment to develop hydrogen hubs in the Hunter and Illawarra.
EnergyCo said the ROI is the first step in engaging with industry on the design, location and delivery of the Illawarra REZ which would “support large energy users with cheap, reliable and clean electricity”.
“The Illawarra REZ will ensure the region has a key role in a renewable energy future, powering existing industries and supporting economic growth, including emerging technology in green hydrogen, ammonia and metal production,” it said.
EnergyCo said the ROI would provide vital information for the planning of the Illawarra REZ, including the estimated investment value, location and types of projects looking to connect.
The call for registrations of interest in the Illawarra REZ will close on 22 July, 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/09/3-key-measures-in-the-suite-of-new-reforms-to-deal-with-australias-energy-crisis/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 9, 2022",3 key measures in the suite of new reforms to deal with Australia’s energy crisis,"The market is pricing electricity at over $300 per megawatt hour, more than three times what it traded at the beginning of this year.
In Wednesday’s meeting, ministers agreed on 11 actions for lowering gas bills and to ensure a crisis like this doesn’t happen again. Here we take a closer look at three key ones.
None will address prices immediately, so all consumers should look for the best deal on electricity through excellent comparison sites, such as the Energy Made Easy website.
Power bills are set to remain high for months to come. Wholesale electricity makes up one third of a typical household retail bill, and the Australian Energy Regulator recently approved household electricity price rises of up to 20%.
If wholesale prices stay at current levels, Australians will have to pay even more for their electricity during the second half of the year.

So what key measures have the ministers proposed to address this? First, the ministers will allow the market operator to purchase gas and hold it in reserve.
If done well, holding reserves to release in times of supply shortage could smooth out extreme prices. Holding reserves of gas won’t be costless, but the cost of that insurance may be worth it to taxpayers. It will be important to see the detail of how this will be implemented.
The second action is to develop a national plan for growth in renewables, hydrogen, and transmission.
Accelerating new renewables will be key to reducing our exposure to fuel prices. A new wind or solar project can provide energy for $50-80 per megawatt hour, compared to $300-500 per megawatt hour from fossil fuel plants today.
Having a clear plan is a good start, but ministers will need to work out how to deliver it. Expanding the national Renewable Energy Target would be a good first step.
This target, legislated by the Rudd government, currently requires roughly 20% of electricity to come from new renewable energy. This could be increased significantly.
Indeed, state targets in place now could be more efficiently delivered if they were amalgamated into a stronger national target. Ministers could also consider similar targets for green gas or hydrogen.

The third action is the most contested. Ministers have recommended implementing a capacity mechanism that would pay units to be available even if they’re not used, which may be similar to a capacity market. It’s not clear what this proposal will look like in detail or how this proposal would address the current crisis.
The communique doesn’t explicitly rule out coal. But there are reasons to be hopeful that what ministers have actually asked for is a capacity reserve, which will facilitate more renewables accompanied by modern technologies such as battery storage.
A traditional capacity market is designed to pay all power stations (including existing coal) for being available, even if they’re not used.
This sort of capacity market won’t build the type of capacity we urgently need. Our grid requires generation that can turn on and off quickly, adjusting to consumers’ increasing appetite for installing their own solar panels.
A traditional capacity market that pays inflexible capacity such as coal will delay investment in new flexible capacity such as hydro, batteries, and hydrogen-ready gas peakers. Coal is considered inflexible because it takes hours to ramp up to full production, whereas “flexible” capacity can ramp to full production in seconds or minutes.
Locking in existing inflexible generation can reduce the reliability of the grid, a risk now possible in Western Australia.
Paying coal power stations to stay around longer also exposes Australia to fuel price spikes as we’ve seen recently, as well as continued shortfalls of capacity. This is because, as federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen pointed out, the current crisis is due to an unexpected shortage of coal, not gas.
Paying coal power stations twice – once for their capacity, and again for their energy – means it’s harder to build new, flexible capacity. A capacity market like this wouldn’t have avoided our current crisis or reduced consumers’ bills: the cost of coal and gas would still be high.

Coal is also increasingly unreliable. Currently up to 25% of coal is offline for maintenance, and unplanned outages are rising. Ironically, some coal generators are simultaneously asking to be paid to close their power stations.
Governments also need to consider the very significant financial assistance already paid to coal-fired generators when the Clean Energy Future package was introduced in 2012 and repealed only two years later.
None of the over $5 billion in assistance provided to coal-fired generators was paid back to taxpayers. Asking consumers to pay again for these power stations to “stay in the market” via a capacity market payment doesn’t seem fair or equitable.
Our current market already provides strong signals for investment in the right mix of capacity.
The market operator says there are around 1.2GW of new gas, 1.2GW of battery, and 2.3GW of hydro projects entering the market in coming years. Total new capacity entering the market is over 11GW.
With electricity prices as high as they are, investors such as Snowy Hydro say it’s simply incorrect that the existing market doesn’t incentivise new storage such as batteries and pumped hydro.
However, a well designed “capacity reserve” would smooth out the market. New capacity, such as batteries and pumped hydro, could be brought into a “waiting room” and held until it’s needed.
Image: Snowy Hydro
This could be implemented very quickly. The New South Wales roadmap provides a somewhat similar approach – underwriting new investments to ensure they’re built sooner rather than later.
Importantly, ministers make it clear in their communique that they’re only really wanting the mechanism to support new investment in fast-start zero emissions technologies. As such, it may be that the “capacity mechanism” they have in mind is actually more akin to the “capacity reserve” we have articulated here.
In the near-term, governments need to ensure all energy companies are doing their fair share to address costs and reliability.
The government has asked the ACCC to consider this, as we suggested last week.
But for now, the best option to keep warm this winter without breaking the bank is to shop around for the best electricity deals.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/09/rio-tinto-targets-large-scale-solar-as-part-of-shift-to-renewables/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 9, 2022",Rio Tinto targets large-scale solar as part of shift to renewables,"Rio Tinto has issued a formal market Request for Proposals (RFP) intended to support the development of multiple new large-scale wind and solar projects that can, in parallel with firming solutions, start supplying power to the miner’s Queensland aluminium assets by 2030.
The mining giant’s aluminium chief Ivan Vella on Thursday said Rio Tinto is seeking proposals that can competitively meet the energy needs of its three production assets in the Gladstone region: the Boyne smelter, the Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland Alumina refinery.
Rio Tinto said the three projects would “need a combined 1,140MW of reliable power to operate, which equates to at least 4,000MW of quality wind or solar power with firming”.
Vella said it is expected the new wind and solar projects will start supplying power to Rio Tinto’s Gladstone operations by the end of the decade.
“As Queensland’s largest energy user, we have an important role to play in driving the development of competitive renewable energy sources for our Gladstone assets and supporting the state’s renewable energy targets,” he said.
“It is early in the process, but this is an important step towards meeting both our group climate change target of halving our emissions by the end of the decade and our commitment to net zero emissions by 2050.”

Australian Conservation Foundation’s Gladstone campaigner Jaclyn McCosker said the announcement shows Rio Tinto is “serious about using large-scale wind and solar to power its energy-hungry aluminium refineries and smelters”.
“Coupled with the news that Australia’s energy ministers have agreed to come up with a national transition plan to phase out fossil fuels, this marks a significant moment in Australian action to tackle climate change,” she said.
“Queensland can and should be a renewable energy superpower and central Queensland has all the ingredients to thrive in a low carbon world.”
Advocacy group Solar Citizens deputy director Stephanie Gray said Rio Tinto’s demonstrates the scale and speed of change underway in Australia’s energy system but warned more grid infrastructure is needed to support clean energy development in Queensland.
“Unfortunately, in central and northern Queensland there’s currently a cap on how much clean energy can be developed locally because there’s a dire need to upgrade grid infrastructure,” she said.
“In both Central and North Queensland there are significant proposals on the table to develop renewable hydrogen facilities that will require many more solar and wind projects to connect locally.”

Gray called on the new federal government to work with the Queensland government to fast-track the development of “vital” grid upgrades around Gladstone.
Rio Tinto’s announcement of the RFP comes after the group last year strengthened its climate change ambitions, confirming it would invest approximately $7.5 billion to help achieve its targets, including cutting carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. Rio Tinto committed to increasing renewable power usage, saying its decarbonising efforts will focus on its aluminium operations. The division accounts for about 70% of the group’s direct and indirect emissions.
That announcement followed the signing of a statement of cooperation with the Queensland government to investigate off-take agreements for large-scale renewable energy projects to power its aluminium assets in the state.
“We are working closely with the Queensland government on the role we can play by underwriting long-term green offtake for our industrial assets,” Vella said.
“This should help create the industrial demand needed to develop a globally competitive green energy solution and lead to more processing and manufacturing in central Queensland.”
Rio Tinto’s shift towards renewable energy mirrors the Queensland government’s ambitions with Energy Minister Mick de Brenni saying the state remains focused on “connecting more renewables and back-up storage to our grid”.
“We are scheduled to deliver at least another 10 solar, five wind farms, three large-scale batteries and one pumped hydro scheme by 2024,” he said.
“By the end of 2024, this project pipeline will add more than 1,700MW of wind, 1,363MW of solar and at least 300MW of storage into Queensland’s energy system.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/09/silver-alloyed-cigs-solar-cell-with-transparent-indium-back-contacts-12-efficiency/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 9, 2022","Silver-alloyed CIGS solar cell with transparent indium back contacts, 12% efficiency","Researchers from the Uppsala University in Sweden have fabricated a silver-alloyed copper, indium, gallium and selenium (ACIGS) thin-film solar cell relying either on indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent back contacts or hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IOH). “The cell can be used as top cells in four-terminal tandem devices,” the research’s corresponding author, Jan Keller, told pv magazine. “For a two-terminal configuration, the bandgaps are too low. For this, a bandgap of at least 1.55 eV is needed.”
The scientists built the cell using a three-stage co-evaporation technique and a high-temperature absorber deposition process. They also utilized cadmium sulfide (CdS) for the buffer layer, ITO and IOH contacts with a thickness of 180/310 nm, and silver alloying to increase the absorber bandgap energy.
As conventional transparent back contacts (TBCs), ITO contacts may cause the formation of gallium oxigen (GaOx) at the TBC/absorber interface, which is detrimental to the cell’s fill factor. “ITO forms a similar amount of GaOx as IOH,” Keller emphasized. “What we found is that a fine-tuning of the sodium fluoride (NaF) supply, as well as using stoichiometric absorber composition, enables high fill factor values and most likely mitigates GaOx formation.”
“The ITO films used in this study effectively block sodium (Na) diffusion from the substrate, according to glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) measurements,” the researchers highlighted, noting that the origin for the increased sodium sensitivity for the ACIGS solar cell remained unclear.
The ACIGS cell with a band gap of 1.44 eV and with the ITO contacts achieved a power conversion efficiency of 10.4%, an open-circuit voltage of 817 mV, a short-circuit current of 19.3 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 63.4%. The same device with the IOH contacts reached an efficiency of 12.0%, an open-circuit voltage of 835 mV, a short-circuit current of 22.1 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 65.2%.
For comparison, a reference CIGS cell without silver with ITO contacts achieved a power conversion efficiency of 11.2%, an open-circuit voltage of 828 mV, a short-circuit current of 19.8 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 68.0%. The same device with the IOH contacts reached an efficiency of 10.5%, an open-circuit voltage of 828 mV, a short-circuit current of 18.6 mA cm2, and a fill factor of 67.9%.
“An efficiency of 12% is reached for the best cell with an IOH back contact,” the academics stated. “This is the highest reported value for a wide-gap chalcopyrite solar cell on a TBC. In addition, a very high infrared transparency is possible, due to the negligible free charge-carrier absorption (FCA) of the IOH (compare Figure 6) and the absence of an interlayer to improve the electronical properties of the contact.”
“We plan to try fabricating these devices in superstrate configuration in the future, which requires the usage of thermally stable buffer layers. In this way, only one glass sheet is needed, which would reduce the costs in a final module,” Keller further explained, adding that efficiency of up to 18% would be required to help the device reach commercial maturity.
The researchers presented the cell in the paper “Wide-Gap Chalcopyrite Solar Cells with Indium Oxide–Based Transparent Back Contacts,” published in RRL Solar.

The ministers agreed to an 11-point plan at the meeting, called in response to the soaring coal, gas and electricity prices impacting households and businesses in Australia’s eastern states.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said there was no “silver bullet” or overnight fix to the energy crisis, blaming the former government for a rigid energy grid unable to adapt to evolving pressures.
“The reason why we are in this crisis today is because there hasn’t been enough planning about the changes that are necessary,” he said. “That’s the result of poor planning and a previous government which didn’t see the opportunities for transmission, didn’t see the opportunity to renewable energy.
“(This) is a big step forward, some of the steps will apply very quickly and others are an agreement to work in the medium term.”
Bowen said state, territory and federal governments had agreed to a national plan that would coordinate the shift from fossil fuel-dominated energy systems to net-zero emissions.
“We need more transmission, we need more renewables, we need more storage,” he said.
The ministers also agreed to broaden the scope of regulators to ensure transparency in the sector, while AEMO has been empowered to procure and store gas for release in emergency situations.

The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has been instructed to proceed with the development of the capacity mechanism which would provide incentives for dispatchable power to improve reliability as the system moves to renewables.
The capacity mechanism will focus on new technologies such as transmission, storage and renewables, but Bowen would not rule out the use of coal-fired power plants when asked if they would be included in the energy mix, saying he thought the “principles are pretty clear that it should support new technologies”.
“It’s designed to improve the capacity in the system,” he said.
“I also believe it should be expert led. In terms of the detailed design, the ESB will do their work and put it out for detailed consultation.”
Bowen said the new powers given to AEMO would be the quickest to take effect, while new investments in renewables would also be crucial to provide extra capacity.
“The (AEMO) could not procure some gas and keep it in reserve to be released for urgent and crisis situations,” he said following the meeting.
“That is technically possible. There’s storage facilities around the country. We agreed to work to give AEMO that power, and to give them that power expeditiously.”

The development of a national transition plan for the energy market ahead of the next meeting of ministers in July has also been agreed to.
The meeting came just hours after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese criticised the former government for its role in the current energy crisis.
Speaking in Darwin on Wednesday, Albanese said the situation is due to the former government’s lack of investment in renewables and infrastructure to support the technology.
“One of the problems that has occurred here is a failure of investment. You don’t have a grid that’s fit for purpose in the 21st century,” he said.
“If you had a grid that was fit for purpose, where renewables were being plugged into the grid … you would have a real alleviation on pressures that are in place right now.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/09/wine-not-treasury-wine-estates-set-to-install-9500-solar-panels/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 9, 2022","Wine not? Treasury Wine Estates set to install 9,500 solar panels","Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), which includes iconic labels like Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Wynns and Squealing Pig, is set to become 100% renewable by 2024 after announcing a significant solar layout. 
TWE claims the PV outfitting, which will comprise approximately 9,500 solar panels across the company’s Barossa and Karadoc wineries, will generate more than 5,500 MWh of electricity annually. 
TWE expects the solar panels to be installed by the end of 2022 and make it Australia’s largest winery solar installation. Other wineries, such as Pernod Ricard Winemakers, have reached the so-called “100%” renewable mark through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). 
TWE’s chief sustainability and external affairs officer Kirsten Gray said moving to 100% renewable electricity was the most significant contribution the company could make on its journey to net zero direct emissions. The initiative was developed in partnership with Shell Energy and is part of TWE’s broader plan to make wine sustainably.
“Electricity makes up about 70% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions,” said Gray. “So switching to renewables is the single biggest and quickest action we can take to reduce emissions. It paves the way to meet our target of net zero direct emissions by 2030 and forms the foundation for future innovation and resilience.”

Interestingly, the Barossa and Karadoc installations are just the beginning, as TWE plans to install more than 29,000 solar panels across its wineries worldwide, as well as purchase offsite renewable electricity (presumably through PPAs), to meet its clean energy commitments. 
“Sustainability is front of mind for our consumers, customers, and our employees globally, and we’re proud to be making progress towards our bold targets,” continued Gray. “Cultivating a brighter future for everyone means taking action and leading the industry to produce cleaner, greener wine that’s enjoyed by consumers all over the world.”
TWE is partnering with Shell Energy Australia, formerly Trevor St. Baker’s ERM Power, for the energy production plan. 
Shell Energy Australia CEO Greg Joiner said that TWE’s commitments were an important step in becoming a sustainability leader in the global wine and beverage sector. 
“With nearly 13,000 hectares of vineyards all over the world, TWE has an opportunity to shape how the wine industry navigates the energy transition,” said Joiner. 
“TWE’s investment in renewable energy and emissions reduction roadmap ensures it has a clear and considered pathway to achieving its global sustainability goals. Shell Energy’s expertise in end-to-end low carbon solutions means the plan incorporates emissions reduction across the wine company’s operations: from the cellar door to offices, packaging centres and vineyards.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/09/briggs-stratton-launches-residential-storage-solution-with-lithium-ferro-phosphate-chemistry/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 9, 2022",Briggs & Stratton launches residential storage solution with lithium-ferro-phosphate chemistry,"Briggs & Stratton, which acquired California battery maker SimpliPHI Power late in 2021, announced the launch of the SimpliPHI Energy Storage System (ESS), with the product available for orders beginning June 14. The integrated, scalable solution starts with three core components, a 6 kW inverter, 4.9 kWh battery, and a proprietary monitoring system. The system will be on display at the RE+ conference in Anaheim this September.
The battery uses lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which is known for its advantage of having a minimized fire risk when compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. It negates the use of cobalt, a metal associated with health hazards, and a key culprit in battery fires.
“Our energy storage solutions are held to industry-leading standards. From the chemistry, form factor and manufacturing processes of the batteries to the testing and validation requirements on behalf of our customers, we seek to provide a safer and more reliable solution,” said Catherine Von Burg, president and CEO at SimpliPHI Power.
The 6 kW inverter has integrated multiple power point tracking for solar or utility charging in either DC-coupled or retrofit AC coupled systems. The inverter’s eight-millisecond switchover time prevents flickering lights and equipment damage associated with power outages. It is optimized for the LFP battery, and scalable in 6 kW increments.
The battery contains a closed-loop communications system in its battery management system, which logically integrates with the inverter and proprietary EnergyTrak management software. It is scalable from one module to 72, for a total energy storage capacity of up to 358.5 kWh. The battery and inverter are both IP65 rated for both indoor and outdoor use.
The monitoring system allows users to manage energy usage through a mobile app that provides real-time status and updates. The system enables performance optimization, boosts utility bill savings, and creates energy security for customers.
“With ageing power grids, more frequent outages and unpredictable weather patterns, the addition of the SimpliPHI ESS to our product lineup is another solution for people looking for an innovative, scalable energy system for their home or business,” said Tom Rugg, president, Energy Solutions at Briggs & Stratton.
SimpliPHI batteries are backed with over 110 years of power experience, with batteries deployed in over 40 countries. The equipment comes with six to ten-year limited warranties. The batteries are capable of integration with solar arrays, the power grid, and backup generators.
