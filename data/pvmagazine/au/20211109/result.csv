Noticeably absent from the plan is the introduction of fuel efficiency standards, something only a federal government can impose. Likewise, the strategy includes neither rebates nor tax incentives to buy electric vehicles (EVs).
In fact, the plan seems to openly acknowledge its measures will barely move the needle, with the Morrison government’s modelling predicting back in 2019 that EVs would make up 27% of new car sales by 2030. Thanks to the new strategy that figure has grown 3%, with the federal government today predicting EVs will account for 30% of new car sales by the end of the decade.
The strategy will see the government’s Future Fuels Fund expanded to $250 million, including $178 million in new funding. This funding will focus public EV and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, heavy and long-distance vehicle technologies, commercial fleets, and household smart charging. The Morrison government said it expects the plan to inspire a future $500 million in “combined private and public co-investment directed into the uptake of future fuels in Australia”.

The strategy has been criticised for paying little heed to policies and measures which have boosted EV uptake in other parts of the world, with University of Queensland academics Jake Whitehead, Jessica Whitehead and Kai Li Lim pointing out every leading electric vehicle market globally offers financial or tax support to help motorists make the switch to cleaner cars. According to the trio, the strategy is better than nothing – though nowhere near enough.
Other countries have also introduced strategies like sales mandates for manufacturers for electric vehicles, exempting EVs from GST, stamp duty and registration fees, and exempting EVs from other taxes. Of course, countries like Norway and South Korea will ban new petrol and diesel car sales from 2025 with the United Kingdom, Germany, India and Israel to follow suit by 2030.
Despite the strategy solidifying Australia’s position at the back of the EV pack, prime minister Scott Morrison seemed rather chuffed with himself for refusing serious measures, reiterating his approach as “choices not mandates”. “Australians love their family sedan,” Morrison added at the top of his statement on the strategy today.
Industry peak body the Clean Energy Council said the strategy represents the federal government squandering yet another opportunity to drive down emissions and save households money. “The electrification of transport is one of the most efficient strategies for decarbonising our economy, and yet the government has once again decided to take the slow lane by refusing to adopt policies that incentivise uptake,” Clean Energy Council Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said.
“The federal government purports to support choice for Australian motorists, but in fact its strategy stifles choice by making it very challenging for Australia to attract a wide selection of battery electric vehicles (EVs) to the market.
“EVs are in high demand and we are competing with international markets to attract supply to the Australian market. Without explicit policies to drive consumer uptake, we will continue to receive yesterday’s technologies.”
Like Scott Morrison, Thornton also pointed the the high uptake of rooftop solar in Australia, with the country yesterday officially passing the three million mark. Thornton said these household solar systems give Australians “an obvious advantage in electrification and one that should be exploited”. Morrison, on the other hand, seemed to note only that Australians seem willing to embrace new technology once it becomes “cost competitive”.
The strategy is somewhat misaligned to the agreement the federal government signed just last week at the COP26 climate conference, which pledged to make EVs the “new normal”.  “It’s staggering that the Australian government has seen fit to release this strategy to coincide with COP26, given that the purpose of the gathering was for countries to raise their ambition over the coming decade. Apart from the investment in charging infrastructure, this strategy reflects little more than the continuation of the status quo,” Thornton said.

In October, thinktank Rewiring Australia, the work of Australian-American entrepreneur Saul Griffith, released a report on how much converting cars (as well as appliances) to electricity could save Australians. The short answer is billions, but specifically when it comes to EVs, the research found if Australians charged their EVs with a combination of rooftop solar and home batteries, it would save them around 67% in fuel costs by 2030.
Unsurprisingly, after having waited so long for a federal strategy, Australia’s states have already been introducing their own targets and plans. Both New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria are targeting 50% of new sales to come from EVs by 2030. The NSW government alone has pledged double the sum of the federal government to support EV uptake.

The study, partially funded through $1.5 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and supported by project partners, Idemitsu, Keolis Downer, Lake Macquarie, Snowy Hydro, Jemena, Macquarie Agriculture and the University of Newcastle, will investigate potential sites for the hub as well as the potential use cases of green hydrogen in fields such as mobility, bunkering, energy production, as well as the more recognised green hydrogen applications such as renewable ammonia at scale for domestic fertiliser use. 
What is more, the study is set to determine whether the 40 MW electrolyser and hub could be scaled up 1 GW, big enough to produce 150,000 tonnes of green hydrogen for export, and taking advantage of the Port of Newcastle’s well-established supply chains. 
According to Port of Newcastle, it handles approximately 4,400 ship movements and 160 million tonnes of cargo annually and yet is utilising less than 50% of its channel capacity. 
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said if the study proved the project to be feasible, it could enable Newcastle to become a major player in producing clean hydrogen. “We’re excited to be a part of this feasibility study which presents an opportunity to accelerate the diversification of Port of Newcastle which is crucial as Australia starts its journey to net zero by 2050″ said Miller. 
“Newcastle is an ideal location for this project due to existing infrastructure and skilled workforce, both of which will be so important as we scale up. With the backing of Macquarie’s Green Investment Group, Newcastle could become a hub for the production and use of hydrogen for domestic and export opportunities for Australia.”
Thanks to the Council of Australian Government’s (COAG) release of Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy in November 2019, and ARENA’s recently launched 2021 Investment Plan, investment in clean hydrogen is becoming more and more tangible. 
The fact that the potential hub is to be located in Newcastle, capital of the once powerful NSW coal country, is telling. But in recent years the sooty grip of coal around the neck of the Hunter region has loosened. Moreover, the announcement follows the NSW government’s long awaited release of its hydrogen strategy last month. 
NSW’s plan is to make itself a hydrogen superpower. “It’s a pretty good strategy, you have to admit,” Andrew Horvath, the global chairman of hydrogen technology company Star Scientific, told pv magazine Australia. NSW is one of the final states to publish its hydrogen strategy, but Horvath is unequivocal the wait has paid off. “They’ve taken their time to look at this carefully,” he said, describing the government as having examined the hydrogen situation “in its entirety.”
The first ‘pillar,’ as the state is calling it, will see the creation of a hydrogen infrastructure “masterplan.” It will assess the state’s assets, like its port infrastructure, as well as developing “hydrogen-ready” regulatory frameworks. And with this Port of Newcastle feasibility study it looks as if the NSW government isn’t letting any more time go to waste. 
The Port of Newcastle study is the second of its kind, with ARENA funding already announced for Stanwell to complete a feasibility study into the potential for Gladstone, Queensland, to be a green hydrogen export hub.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/09/australians-have-now-installed-more-than-three-million-rooftop-solar-systems/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"NOVEMBER 9, 2021",Australians have now installed more than three million rooftop solar systems,"While globally embarrassed Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Angus Taylor attempt to apply green colour-correcting makeup to their blushing faces via their belated plan for “ultra low-cost solar”, the Australian people are doing their jobs for them, breaking more records this month as everyday Aussies reached the three million rooftop solar installation mark.
According to the Australian PV Institute’s National Survey of PV Power Applications in Australia report, prepared in partnership with the International Energy Agency and published last week, Australia has 22.3 GW of installed solar as of mid 2021, having nearly tripled its capacity since 2017.
What is more, Australia installed a record 360,000 rooftop systems in 2021, a whopping 40% increase on 2020. According to SunWiz, the Clean Energy Council (CEC) and Solar Citizens, those installations have taken Australia over the three million mark.
“So far, it’s everyday people that have done the heavy lifting n carbon emissions reduction, while the Australian government has been dragging its feet,” said Solar Citizens national director Ellen Roberts. “Because of the hard work of Australians, we’re in a good starting position to become a clean energy superpower than can export our sunshine to the world.”
CEC chief executive Kane Thornton agreed, and said Australia has long been the world leader in household solar installations, helping consumers lower their power bills, reducing pressure on the energy grid during the summer peak, reducing emissions and playing a key role in keeping the economy moving.
“On average, more than 41 solar systems are being installed every hour across Australia, equating to one panel every 44 seconds,” said Thornton. “This sheer scale means that on 17 October, rooftop solar was able to account for 38% share of demand on the National Electricity Market.”
Solar market analyst Warwick Johnston, managing director of SunWiz, said passing three million solar installations is a remarkable milestone. “Thanks to our homeowners, Australia leads the world in per-capita uptake of solar power – 22% higher per capita than Germany or Japan in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency,” Johnston said.
AU is witnessing the installation of PV systems at a rate of more than 200,000 p.a. – which is an astonishing feat but also presents challenges for the distribution networks. This project aims to develop a solution allowing flexible export limits.https://t.co/Soh3zeYNUq

“The transformation of Australia’s carbon-intensive electricity supply has been led by households directly investing in solar power on their homes,” continued Johnston, “not just because it benefits the planet – because it makes financial sense to do so.”
“Thanks to Australia’s highly-efficient solar workforce, Australia is one of the lowest-cost countries for a rooftop installation. Our abundant sunshine, large homes and high electricity prices combine to make paybacks in Australia shorter than in most other countries.”
Onwards and upwards
As more solar installations reach Australian rooftops, more Australians benefit, not just from electricity bill savings, and not just from helping to avert global catastrophe, but also for helping create Australian jobs. “For every megawatt of new rooftop solar, six jobs are created each year,” said Thornton, “illustrating that it is the largest generator of employment in the renewable energy industry. These are skilled workers, employed by small- to medium-sized businesses that are critical to local economies right across Australia.”
Thornton also pointed to the recent Transgrid report, Energy vision, in which its Prosumer Power scenario predicts more than 80% of Australian homes could have rooftop solar by 2050, in turn supplying 27% of the National Electricity Market’s generation needs.

Morrison’s reception was hardly a surprise and followed directly from the embarrassment of his belated net zero 2050 commitment, launched mere days previous. This is all to say that it is no secret the Coalition have been failing Australian citizens and, in particular, their rural constitutents. 
I expected so much more from the Government today & like many people across regional Australia I've been left underwhelmed & disappointed. As the Member for Indi, I'll keep fighting for regional Australia to benefit from action on climate change. Even if the Government will not.

Despite the Coalition’s efforts to convince rural communities of the evils of the energy transition, rural communities themselves are starting to cotton on to the fact that they could actually do very well out of it. 
Community energy
As an ABC report relayed recently, the farming town of Katanning in Western Australia’s Wheatbelt south-east of Perth, is just one of a growing number of rural communities in conservative Coalition territory setting itself progressive renewable energy targets.
Katanning, which has voted for Liberal or country parties at the state and federal level for over a century, is now beginning to see the light, which is to say, to see its golden opportunity to take advantage of its rich solar resources through a community energy program. 
Katanning wants to become its own solar power plant, ensuring that the solar resources themselves would be community owned and therefore keeping the money spent on bills local. The program, which has the support of local businesses, people, council and even its state and federal MPs, is being spearheaded by Geoff Stade, a local farmer cum chairman of Katanning Energy, and based off the model set out by Indigo Power, a Victorian energy company which grew out of local community energy group Totally Renewable Yackandandah (TRY).
“We’re all about the economics of it and taking control of our own energy security,” Stade told the ABC, before adding, “I really haven’t come across too much hesitancy. They’re [townspeople] very pragmatic people and they can see how solar saves you money and makes steps towards energy security.” The idea is that Katanning solar system owners and residents own shares in the company and receive a dividend from any community generated energy sold. 
Katanning Energy has already installed solar systems on 30 properties in the last month and looks to have made a full 200 installations (totalling 2,000 kWh) by the end of 2022. 
Western Australian state-owned distribution corporation Western Power is no foe to community power either, most notable among its programs being its deployment of stand-alone power systems (SPS) to sure up remote communities and reduce transmission costs. 
What is more, only last month 51 Western Australian local government associations entered a join renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) that will allow them to satisfy 100% of their electricity demand from the 222 MW Collgar Wind Farm in the state’s southeast as well as the 35.4 MW Albany and 79 MW Emu Downs wind farms.
Victoria 
Over east, Victoria is particular progressive on the community energy front, in part thanks to towns like Yackandandah and Indigo Power, but also due to state government programs like the Andrews Government’s Solar on Public Buildings Program. 
This week Victorian Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D’Ambrosio announced 50 new sites have had solar installed under the program, and a further 55 approved for installation in months to come. 
“Our strong investment in renewable energy and solar energy systems is creating local jobs, reducing power bills and helping us achieve our ambitious emissions reduction targets,” said D’Ambrosio. “This is a terrific outcome for the community, the environment and our hardworking volunteer committees which are the backbone of small communities across Victoria.” 
Yackandandah
As mentioned above, Yackandandah is a real pioneer in the community energy space, and Indigo Power recently installed a community-scale battery. “We want to scope up a working model for community energy taht can be replicated wherever there’s interest,” Indigo Power’s general manager, Ben McGowan told ABC. 
It’s fantastic to see communities around Australia, inspired by the Yackandandah Community Battery, deciding to take a community-owned approach to their energy production and storage.https://t.co/m95dY6XUPa
— Indigo Power (@indigopwr) November 8, 2021

The community-owned battery, known as “Yack01”, is a 274 kWh storage system (enough to power 30-40 homes a for a day) coupled with a 65 kW solar array installed atop the site of an old sawmill, and represents Yackandandah’s first step and pilot project for larger community-scale projects in the future. Originally TRY and Indigo raised $200,000 for a much smaller battery, but the Victorian government threw in an extra $171,000 to double the original system’s size.

Independent MP for the Victorian electorate of Indi (which includes Yackandandah) Helen Haines, proposed a bill to Parliament to underwrite and provide technical support to community renewable energy projects in regional areas, and mandate the opportunity for communities to buy into large-scale projects (such as is mandated in other countries, like Denmark). 
A really powerful day of testimonies today at the parliamentary enquiry into the Australian Local Power Agency bill. TRY was proud to be able to contribute with others and advocate for the benefits of community energy to communities. Thanks @helenhainesindi for all your work! https://t.co/onrCQhtO1X
— Totally Renewable Yackandandah (@TotalRenewYack) August 27, 2021

Haines’ Australian Local Power Agency Bill 2021 (ALPA) first proposed to Parliament in February and still being inquired into, is a plan “to make sure that regional communities benefit from the huge boom in renewable energy that has already started.” If legislated, the bill would establish a $467 million Agency to support the development and investment of renewable energy projects in regional communities.
