Its author, Australian Energy Market Commissioner Michelle Shepherd, found the outages, which began on Christmas Eve and last until December 28, impacted 107,000 Western Power customers and were caused by record-breaking high temperatures over those four days.
“The Christmas outages occurred during an extreme heatwave resulting in electricity demand exceeding historical peaks in some residential areas,” Shepherd said. “The outages were largely caused by parts of the network not having the capacity to meet the unusually high electricity demand.
“While the severity of the heatwave is historically rare, it’s expected similar events may occur more frequently in the future due to the impacts of climate change,” she added.
The recommendations of the report include improving planning and forecasting at the state-owned Western Power, improving its approach to fire risk management and operational response to extreme weather events. It also recommended improvements to customer and community communications, and greater transparency of reliability issues.

Minister Johnston said he has written to the Western Power chair asking for a timeline of when the recommendations will be implemented. He also noted the report’s finding that his government had approved all funding requests made by Western Power towards capital improvements to the distribution network over the past five years, concluding there was ‘no evidence that investments were delayed or did not occur due to regulatory or governmental decisions.’
The minister said Western Power is preparing for future outages by rolling out batteries, microgrids, and standalone power systems. 
The state leads the world in the deployment of standalone systems, often called SAPS and last year Western Power it expanded its successful community battery rollout. 
WA is also moving forward with its first big battery at the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station, awarding New Horizons Ahead the contract to build a 100MW/200MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) at the site.
The state government has also upped the payment for households affected by extended outages, moving it from $80 to $120 permanently. It has also extended the timeframe in which households can lodge a claim for this particular event, giving Western Power customers until August 29, 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/23/nsws-sebastopol-solar-farm-up-and-running/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 23, 2022",NSW’s Sebastopol Solar Farm up and running,"FRV Australia on Tuesday announced it had achieved all the requirements for commercial operation of its Sebastopol Solar Farm, located outside Wagga Wagga. 
The 248 hectare project is now operating at full capacity, although the company noted it has been generating since December 2021, when the farm reached the commissioning phase after less than a year of construction.
FRV Australia, partially owned by Fotowatio Renewable Ventures which was acquired by Saudi’s Abdul Latif Jameel Energy, says the Sebastopol Solar Farm has a net annual energy production capacity of approximately 200,000 MWh and is capable of meeting the energy demand of up to 40,000 households.
The project took Beon Energy Solutions, the project’s Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor, 11 months to construct.

FRV’s Australian portfolio includes the 125 MW Lilyvale Solar Farm in Queensland, the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria, and the 69.75 MW Goonumbla Solar Farm in New South Wales (NSW). The company has also achieved financial close on the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm and continues to develop the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm, all in NSW. It owns nine projects in Australia in total, saying it has developed close to 800MW (DC) of solar capacity here.
Late last year, FRV’s Australian platform announced its intentions to cross the ditch and develop 500 MW of solar energy in New Zealand.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/23/new-adaptive-trackers-for-tricky-terrain-to-cut-both-project-cost-and-land-disturbances/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 23, 2022",New ‘adaptive’ trackers for tricky terrain to cut both project cost and land disturbances,"Nextracker, Australia’s most popular tracker company, has today unveiled its new extreme terrain (hence XTR) product line, which it says will substantially reduce both the costs for building solar projects on uneven ground and decrease land disturbances. 
A new breed of tracker, the breakthrough was initially enabled by Nextracker’s self-contained tracker motor, which allows each row of trackers in an installation to operate independently from each other, referred to as adaptive tracking.
“Essentially, what it allows you to do is to radically reduce the amount of earthwork you know, bulldozers, civil engineering, civil activity that happens on most sites, which radically reduces cost,” Nextracker CEO Dan Shugar told pv magazine USA editor Tim Sylvia in an exclusive interview.

Less groundwork also means less disruption of the natural site, a critical aspect for those, like Shugar, who believe solar installations should exist as harmoniously as possible with the surrounding environment. “The topsoil is very fragile. A lot of the value of the topsoil is just in the upper strata of a few inches, you really don’t want to disturb that. And this technology allows that,” Shugar said.
Nextracker began working on the technology over three years ago, pushed by US solar developer SOLV Energy. The NX Horizon-XTR line has now been deployed in a number of SOLV’s projects, use in over 3GW of cumulative projects, with more under construction or in late-stage development globally – including in Australia.
Nextracker is by far Australia’s preferred tracker brand, with Rystad Energy RenewableCube’s last year finding that alongside Array Technologies, it commanded 77% of the market.
While single axis trackers can increase project yield by up to 35% when coupled with other technologies, they require rows of panels to be at the exact same height and angle. This means projects often need to do significant earthwork and land grading, which can cost as much as 5% of total project budget.
Addressing this problem, Nextracker says the NX Horizon-XTR line can follow sites’ natural contours, saving between 30% to 90% of the “cut and fill” earthmoving work.

This is because its adaptive tracking technology means modules in a row can now be programmed to track at different angles over a different time period from other adjacent rows. 
“[Adaptive tracking] allowed a whole range of benefits: we could self power the tracker with a little solar panel, instead of hooking up to the grid, and each row could be independent, meaning you could drive through the system for vegetation management, cleaning, maintenance on solar panels, or during construction,” Shugar told pv magazine USA.
“In Australia, Nextracker has worked closely with our developer and EPC partners to understand site challenges and barriers to deploying solar on undulating terrain,” Nextracker Australian Director of Sales, Andrew Chino, added.
“This extends beyond the economic feasibility of building solar plants on difficult land, but also encompasses genuine concern around land disturbance, re-seeding time, and dual use of land,” he added.
This is a real and growing issue in Australia, where opposition to solar farms proposed on what regional communities deem agricultural land is mounting. 
Just last week, Riverina Sustainable Food Alliance was established in New South Wales, stating its mission as “safeguarding valuable farmland and food security against the expansion of solar factories.” The group is being championed by Independent MP Joe McGirr.
Edify Energy
While the group said they supported the use of solar technology and acknowledged its importance for global decarbonisation, it said projects “cannot come at the cost of food security or the environment.”
In the statement, McGirr calls on the story of Borambola landowners and alliance members Rick and Pam Martin, who are concerned a proposed solar farm next to their property would require substantial earthworks, impacting the water table and increasing the threat of dryland salinity.
Nextracker directly acknowledges these issues in its product media release, referring to the “inevitable erosion and hydrology issues” which stem from earthworks disrupting topsoil.
“Renewable energy shouldn’t come at the cost of our environment or be prohibited by cost,” Chino said.

The project, which plans to connect into Transgrid’s network via the Darlington Point Substation, seeks to utilise Tesla’s Megapack systems to provide flexible, dispatchable capacity to the NSW market, and complement the region’s renewable generation, including the 275MWac/333MWdc Darlington Point Solar Farm, developed by Edify Energy and UK-based investor Octopus. 
Edify’s chief executive, John Cole, described working with Tesla to deliver this important piece of infrastructure as “another milestone for Edify in this exciting energy transition.” 
Cole went on to describe technological advancement as a key driver in overcoming many of the roadblocks to “a greener energy system,” noting that “the advantages of large-scale batteries in our growing world of renewables are well documented and supported.” 
“Energy storage is rapidly becoming a valued capacity solution for the National Electricity Market,” Cole continued, “given its fast and precise response and technical capability. The pace of advancement in this growing technology class is exciting and with it a breaking of the barriers to acceptance from market and network participants.” 
Cole singled out technological advances in that will allow this combined BESS project to use “advanced inverter technology” allowing the facility to better provide network stability support. 
“Without a doubt, as the understanding of advanced inverters grows, we will see more smart technologies replacing rotating machines and accelerating Australia’s transition to a clean energy future,” said Cole. 
Edify Energy and Tesla previously teamed up on the 25MW/50MWh Gannawarra Energy Storage System, integrated with the 50MW Gannawarra Solar Farm in the state of Victoria.

Chinese-Canadian solar module manufacturer Canadian Solar announced it started commercial production of its new module for rooftop PV applications – the CS6R-MS module.
The new product is part of the company’s HiKu6 series based on 182mm wafers.
The 54-cell PERC module has a power output of up to 420W and a power conversion efficiency of 21.5%. “The CS6R-MS module is especially suitable for rooftop solar applications given its small module size (1.95 m² ˣ 30 mm), light weight (21.3 kg), and outstanding aesthetic design for homogenous appearance,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The module measures 1722x1134x30mm and its temperature coefficient is 0.34%. It comes with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty.
Canadian Solar said the electrical characteristics of the CS6R-MS panel are compatible with the most common photovoltaic inverters thanks to current values below 14A. According to the product sheet, the short-circuit current of the module ranges from 13.55 to 13.93A and the open-circuit voltage is between 36.0 and 37.0V. The maximum system voltage is 1,500V.
The panel also features an IP68 enclosure rating, 3.2mm tempered glass with anti-reflection technology, and an anodised aluminium frame.
“I am excited to announce that we have started mass production and delivered the first batch of the 54-cell modules of up to 420 W based on 182 mm PERC cells,” said Canadian Solar CEO, Shwan Qu, adding that the company will begin production of new CS6R-MS heterojunction solar modules with an efficiency of up to 22.5% and power output up to 440 W in April.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/23/rock-cavern-for-green-hydrogen-storage-takes-shape-in-sweden/,"HYDROGEN,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,SWEDEN",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 23, 2022",Rock cavern for green hydrogen storage takes shape in Sweden,"From pv magazine Global
Vattenfall, Sweden-based steel company SSAB, and Swedish state-owned miner LKAB announced they have reached the halfway point in the construction of a rock cavern storage facility for green hydrogen near Luleå, in northern Sweden.
“The various parts of the plant are now mostly in place,” the consortium said in a statement. “Rock caverns and connecting tunnels have been constructed in the rock and a ventilation shaft has been drilled from the top of the rock down to the upper part of the rock cavern.”
The three companies are investing a total of around SEK 200 million (AU$28.5 million) in three equal parts in the new facility and the Swedish Energy Agency is contributing SEK 50 million (AU$7 million). “Intensive work is underway at the moment to complete and inspect all installations, while the facility’s steel lining is being welded together in the cavern,” the statement reads.

The 100-cubic-metre “Hybrit” facility will be built approximately 30 metres below ground. It is expected to begin operations in 2022 and will reach full capacity in 2024.
The cavern is being built via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC) approach, which involves covering the walls of the cavern with a selected material as a sealing layer.
A recent study by the Jülich Institute for Energy and Climate Research (IEK-3) showed that salt caverns offer a flexible, efficient option for hydrogen storage. The research group estimates that Europe has the technical potential to store 84.8 PWh of hydrogen in bedded salt deposits and salt domes.
The IEK-3 researchers said the proximity of the caverns to the coast will be helpful, as brine disposal remains economical up to 50 km from the sea.
