It is worth noting the lithium market was worth just $1.2 billion in 2020–21, demonstrating the sector’s enormous year-on-year growth.

Lithium’s tripling value looks like something of a shining light in a graph showing the value of nearly all Australia’s other exports like coal, natural gas, iron ore trending down. In fact, the export value of lithium and base metals are expected to equal that of coal within the next four years, reaching parity by 2027–28.

Base metals include materials like copper, nickel, tin, aluminium, zinc, and lead. While these are, of course, vital to a number of industries, an increasing portion is used by renewable industries. Meanwhile, in 2022 Australia grew its overall marketshare for lithium, reaching 53% of the world’s total production.
“The latest Resources and Energy Quarterly underlines the importance of our critical minerals sector,” Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Madeleine King, said.

The company has today announced its GEN3 Li-S Energy battery system, which it says significantly improves volumetric energy density as a result of a lower porosity cathode material; has higher gravimetric energy density attained through its optimised cathode materials, and has better safety due to its low flammability electrolyte.
The 20-layer cells were produced in Li-S Energy’s “semi-automated” facility in Geelong, Victoria where test cell production is anticipated later this year, once the company’s new Phase 3 facility is complete.
Li-S Energy says its third generation cells are currently demonstrating a gravimetric energy density in its laboratories of over 400 Wh/kg, and a volumetric energy density of 540 Wh/l. In other words, the cells are the same physical size as existing lithium-ion batteries but half the weight, according to the company.
Trying to capitalise on this feature, the company’s main target sectors include drones and “eAviation” – electric aviation.
On the issue of durability, Li-S Energy’s cells incorporate both its patented “Li-nanomesh” technology and Boron Nitride Nanotubes to reduce dendrite growth. Its team is currently developing the cell cycle testing and characterisation results to produce an industry standard datasheet on the GEN3 cells. 
“The development of these new battery cells is another validation of the strength of our scientific and technical teams, and our collaboration with Deakin University and other Australian and international institutions,” Li-S Energy CEO, Lee Finniear, said. “In the coming months we look forward to commencing the production of commercial samples for our partners.”
In addition to then new cells, the company is progressing its co-funded project at Deakin University, part of the ARC Research Hub for Safe and Reliable Energy, in which it is seeking to
jointly create a full-solid-state lithium sulfur battery. 
The company also recently announced Apple’s former lead battery scientist, Dr Paul Bayley, had been appointed as its Research and Development Manager.

Battery projects must have a minimum duration of two hours.
The indicative size for the tender in 380 MW, but AEMO Services noted it can award more “if it is in the long-term financial interest of NSW electricity consumers.”
The 380 MW firming capacity, as well as the 600 MW of long duration storage it plans to also tender, seeks to fill the gap that will be created by the impending closure of the country’s biggest coal generator – Origin’s 2.8 GW Eraring power station in the NSW Hunter region – slated for 2025.
During his campaign to become NSW Premier, the newly-elected Labor leader Chris Minns, opened the door to buying Eraring from Origin Energy. Canadian fund Brookfield recently acquired Origin Energy and has not closed the door to this proposition, but its Asia Pacific CEO Stewart Upson said such a deal would need to fit into Brookfield’s decarbonisation vision. 
Interested parties will be able to submit project bids through AEMO Service’s online portal until May 18.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/04/community-battery-tenders-open-as-scheme-enveloped-in-rorting-accusations/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 4, 2023",Community battery tenders open as scheme enveloped in rorting accusations,"As the directors of the federal government’s community battery program, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) today opened expressions of interest for the first of two funding rounds, totalling $171 million, with $120 million of that allocated in round one. 
The program appears quite different from its early visions though. Firstly, applicants must deploy a minimum of five community batteries – a requirement which would surely lead to the exclusion of community groups, unless forming large coalitions. Secondly, the funding will be equally divided between Distributed Network Service Providers (DNSPs), or networks, and non-network applications (everyone else).
To be eligible for the funding, each of the community batteries must be between 50 kW and 5 MW and connect to the local grid as front of meter devices. Applicants will be able to seek up to $20 million each.

Last week, Independent Senator Rex Patrick accused the federal Labor government of rorting this community battery scheme, after a Freedom of Information (FOI) request revealed the locations for 58 of the 400 promised batteries were selected while Labor was in opposition, and had mainly been promised in locations where the Labor party was either looking to hold or gain seats.
To be clear, ARENA is now managing the community battery funding program, but before the agency become involved, the Labor party had already selected 58 community battery locations, leaving ARENA to select the remaining 342 projects through its own tenders.
Specifically, Senator Patrick said 32% of the “eligible locations” for the Labor-party awarded grants were suburbs in safe or fairly safe Labor seats, and 42% of them were in marginal seats. This, Senator Patrick said, “has a rotten stink about it.”

Independent MP Rebekha Sharkie, who has worked with Senator Patrick in the past on renewable industry accountability, confronted Chris Bowen, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, on Labor’s selection decisions in Parliament. Minister Bowen responded: “Opposition [parties] make election commitments… governments, when elected, then deliver on those election commitments.”
Coming back to how the scheme will work, ARENA CEO Darren Miller said community batteries represent the next step in optimising distributed energy resources in the electricity grid.
“Not everyone is able to install rooftop solar, but by storing electricity close to the point of consumer demand, we can reduce network costs and alleviate constraints in areas with high solar penetration.”
This is a somewhat surprising remark given electricity networks in Australia operate under a “postage stamp pricing” mandate which dictates every customer in a network area pay the same service fee. This principle, while based on maintaining equity, sets up a structure where using locally generated power has no financial reward – a fact which has undercut the viability of the number of community battery projects and proposals.

It is not clear if perhaps the ARENA team has been working with networks to provide some flexibility on fees when it comes to local community batteries. 
It is also worth noting that while electricity networks were previously barred from participating in wholesale energy markets, the Australian Energy Regulator in February granted networks an exemption from this rule for community battery projects, known as a Ring-fencing class waiver.
The concept of community batteries has stirred great excitement in Australia, promising to distribute locally produced green energy from rooftop solar power in equitable and efficient ways. Unfortunately, few projects have been able to deliver on such promises to date due to a number of technical, regulatory, financial and other issues.

Community batteries, it seems, are not particularly good revenue generators, nor shared ‘solar shifting’ devices. Where they shine is as a solution to particular local network issues, according to Bjorn Sturmberg, research leader in the battery storage and grid integration program at the Australian National University (ANU). Reliability, daily voltage control, reverse power flows, and energy resilience in the face of natural disasters simply can’t be worked out on the continental electricity system, and have to be addressed locally through devices like community batteries.
This led Sturmberg to conclude electricity networks are the most logical choice to own and operate community batteries. ARENA, it seems, has come to a similar conclusion. 
Trust in electricity networks, however, hardly abounds. Pv magazine has heard reports of transmission and network companies radically shifting the price they charge to connect battery projects, with quotes sometimes shooting up in the tens of millions in a matter of months for utility-scale projects.
Moreover, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the IEEFA, recently released a report on the supernormal profits of Australia’s electricity networks, which tend to be monopolies. It called on state and federal governments to better regulate networks’ profits.

Whether this program can successfully recover and deliver on its conceptual promises remains to be seen. In the meantime, ARENA will hold two webinar information sessions on April 12 and 18 for interested parties. Expressions of interest for round one close on June 30.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/04/three-ways-to-help-the-15-billion-national-reconstruction-fund-revive-manufacturing/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",,"APRIL 4, 2023",Three ways to help the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund revive manufacturing,"From the Conversation
The fund will focus on investing in high-tech manufacturing. There are seven priority areas:
The fund is expected to operate commercially and deliver a return on its investments. Its approach will be similar to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which over the past decade has provided more than $10 billion in grants and loans to low-emission energy projects.
Investments will be in the form of loans, equity and guarantees. It will be a co-investment model, meaning private investors will have to match funds provided.
It will start with $5 billion. The other $10 billion will provided in instalments over the rest of the decade. After 2030, investments are expected generate enough revenue to support new projects. These decisions will be made by a board that will be independent of the federal government.

There is support for the fund from employer groups and trade unions. But there are also criticisms.
More broadly, some economists argue government-supported investment schemes misallocate resources, give certain businesses an unfair advantage, and slow down innovation over time by investing too much in one area and starving other innovative ideas of resources. As The Economist has put it, trying to “pick winners” can also mean investing in losers.
But government-backed investments do play a crucial role in providing financial support to commercialise new technology, for which attracting private investment is typically tough.
The federal opposition has complained the Albanese government should focus on more immediate challenges facing manufacturers, such as high energy prices and labour shortages.
Opposition frontbencher Paul Fletcher has expressed concern the fund will finance projects that “would not succeed in getting private sector finance – but which for political reasons the government wants to fund”. A factory in a marginal seat, for example.
There are precedents for such concerns. The Morrison government, of which Fletcher was a senior member, did such things with funding for car parks and sporting facilities.
But it is also the case that such pork barrelling didn’t happen with the Morrison government’s $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative, which provided grants in roughly the same priority areas as the new fund.
Despite political and financial incentives to find fault with it, the Albanese government has endorsed the Modern Manufacturing Initiative’s expenditure. It has criticised only the way the Morrison government manipulated the timing of funding announcements.
Nor has the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, established by the Gillard government in 2012, faced such criticisms. It is regarded as a success story across the political spectrum, from groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation to mining magnate Clive Palmer.
The establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission should further give confidence that Albanese, a longtime champion of making things in Australia, is sincere about “complete transparency” for the National Reconstruction Fund.
To but to improve the fund’s chance of success, there are three things that can be done.
First, to achieve the transparency Albanese has promised, the fund should publicly share the reasoning behind its investment decisions, similar to how the Reserve Bank of Australia’s board publishes minutes of its monthly policy meetings. Being open about decision-making will build public trust in the fund’s transparency and fairness.
Second, the National Reconstruction Fund’s investment board will need to clearly outline investment priorities while staying flexible, so projects that span multiple sectors or applications don’t fall between the cracks. Breakthrough ideas may not fit neatly into a single category. For instance, synthetic biology technology can be used in food manufacturing and plastic recycling. It doesn’t belong to just one priority area.
Third, supporting individual projects isn’t enough. Here’s where those “enabling capabilities” are crucial. Changing the trajectory of manufacturing in Australia requires a supportive ecosystem that aligns things like funding and policy priorities in education and training, research being done in universities, immigration settings, and natural advantages.
Projects won’t succeed without skilled workers, strong research backing, and easy access to suppliers and customers.
Australia’s renewable energy sector is an example of a supportive environment that can lead to success. Australia has plenty of sun and wind, a growing number of skilled workers in the renewable energy field, top research institutions, a knowledgeable investor base thanks to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and a growing number of people who care about eco-friendly energy solutions.
By setting clear goals, encouraging innovation, and making decisions transparent, the fund stands the best chance to achieve what it has been created to do.

As pressure grows on transmission system operators (TSOs) to accommodate a rising share of renewables on grids, storage-as-transmission assets (SATA)– a relatively new and not widely known BESS application – could prove its worth by providing them with new types of flexibility.
Unlike “regular” big batteries, SATA projects are operated to mimic transmission line flows by injecting and absorbing power. In such applications, they can be used to bolster or even replace existing power lines, thus offering infrastructure planners a new, versatile solution for transmission transition.
With several SATA projects in their pipeline, Fluence has now launched Utrastack, its “highest performance energy storage product to date.” To meet the complex requirements of TSOs, the new system comes with a set of advanced features, including fast response times in under 150 milliseconds, NOC interface and IT security, and high availability of more than 99%.
With such capabilities, Ultrastack can deliver a broad variety of patent pending controls applications and services, including reactive power and voltage regulation, black start, virtual synchronous machine, synthetic inertia, primary frequency control, emergency power contribution, auto gen control, and power oscillations damping.
Fluence now has several SATA projects in its pipeline. In 2021, it deployed a 1 MW/1 MWh in Lithuania, which served as a proof-of-concept for storage being an integral part of the power transmission network and maintaining grid stability and reliability through emergency power, frequency and voltage control, and synthetic inertia response. This has been followed by the ongoing rollout of four 50 MW / 50 MWh SATA projects in Lithuania.
In Germany, Fluence is currently in the process of supplying TransnetBW, the TSO in the state of Baden-Württemberg, with the 250 MW Netzbooster (Grid Booster) project. The system will be tasked with increasing the efficiency of the existing grid infrastructure and easing congestions by providing backup capacity to maintain power system stability in the event of network failure.
There are two more 100 MW grid booster projects in the planning which Germany’s TenneT has not awarded yet. On top of that, an additional 750 MW are being proposed by German TSOs, according to the first draft of their bi-annual network development plan 2037/45 published last week.
Elsewhere in Europe, Red Electrica is planning a tender for a SATA project to increase the utilisation of interconnectors from the mainland to the Balearic islands. Meanwhile, a gigawatt-scale SATA pipeline is being formed in the UK where National Grid ESO procures grid-stability services, such as short circuit level and inertia, from privately-owned assets, under its Stability Pathfinder Phase 2 program.
Although the application of BESS as transmission assets is still in its fledgling stage, some market players and analysts see considerable promise in it. Research group S&P Global forecasts 17 GW/50 GWh of energy storage systems to be deployed globally through 2030 to enhance or defer investment into upgrading existing electricity network infrastructure.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/04/new-software-modelling-tool-for-agrivoltaics/,"MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"APRIL 4, 2023",New software modelling tool for agrivoltaics,"From pv magazine USA
Agrivoltaics, the integration of food production and solar energy, is an emerging technology that makes better use of limited land and soil resources. Because the industry is young, there’s not yet a snappy web-based application like Aurora or Helioscope to help solar developers to quickly lay out designs, taking the crops underneath into account.
Sandbox Solar, a solar contractor, has been developing such a tool, called Spade. Spade aims to help solar developers to determine the best crop types and solar panel layouts for their projects. The tool made it into the fifth and final round of the Department of Energy’s “American Made” solar innovation program. Spade’s early Beta Version is available now, and it has already been used to develop solar power projects paired with potatoes, hemp, hops and other crops.
The software generates several key numerical outputs: irradiance, as well as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), which are two types of light measurements that are less familiar to the solar trade.
PAR refers to the range of wavelengths that are useful for photosynthesis, while PPFD measures the density of photons within that range that reaches a specific surface area. Not all wavelengths of light are equally effective for photosynthesis; plants generally use blue (400 nm to 500 nm) and red (600 nm to 700 nm) light more efficiently than green (500 nm to 600 nm) light. PAR and PPFD are both crucial for understanding and optimising light conditions for plant growth and photosynthesis.

The information is displayed both visually via charts, and numerically, as watts per square meter and PAR/PPFD values. Again, PAR is the quantity of useful light that will reach the plants growing among the solar panels. Most agrivoltaic-compatible crops actually benefit from the reduced irradiance offered by the shade of solar panels.
Spade’s team told us that the fundamental approach to optimising agrivoltaic projects involves addressing the three C’s: configuration, climate and crops. By carefully considering these factors, a developer can refine their strategies by spacing out and elevating solar panels to maximise land use, ensuring the best possible balance between energy generation and agriculture.
The graphic below captures Spade designer Tom Hickey’s changing inputs on solar designs, which then outputs various potential outcomes of solar designs that meet project requirements. Hickey has been with Sandbox for more than five years, and is currently working part-time with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. He uses Spade directly in design work for customers and Sandbox’s agrivoltaic projects.
“Spade has revolutionised what I have been able to do in-house,” said Hickey.
In a recent conversation with pv magazine USA, Alexis Pascaris – a lead in the development of the Spade software – noted the Massachusetts agrivoltaic program and the unique incentives found in the state’s SMART solar program. With Hickey and Pascaris  running the processes, Spade has collaborated with developers as a subcontracted professional who liaises with the Department of Agriculture to move projects through the SMART application process. Pascaris suggested that Spade’s shade analysis tools are more accurate than the tools Massachusetts currently mandates.
Ian Skor, founder of Sandbox Solar, said he believes that the current iteration of the tool is sufficiently robust to meet the immediate needs of both the company and its consulting clients. However, he acknowledges that there is room for growth in developing the software’s frontend to facilitate improved online interactions and refine its overall functionality.
Alexis said the company is developing a budget for bringing Spade to the next level, so they can begin a request for investment proposals sometime in 2023. At this moment, the team doesn’t have any fully installed projects that were developed with Spade. However, several Spade-designed projects are scheduled to begin construction soon, including an in-house vertical bifacial project.
