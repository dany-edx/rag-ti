Despite underwhelming results from Australia-wide trials, the Victorian government is beefing up its funding for neighbourhood batteries.
On Monday, it launched its 100 Neighbourhood Batteries Program, opening the first round of grants in the $42.2 million (USD 27 million) scheme. The grants are open to public entities, private businesses and agencies, educational institutions, local government, co-operatives, and not-for-profit organisations.
The first round will make available $10 million in grant funding, with up to $300,000 available per battery. Projects must be completed by before August 2025, the application website notes.

According to the Victorian government, the new “100NB” program “builds on lessons learned through the successful Neighbourhood Battery Initiative (NBI).”
It announced the successful recipients of the third round of that preexisting NBI scheme, worth $10.92 million, the same day. Round three saw eight “business cases” and one implementation-ready project funded – namely the Alphington Community Battery project. 
The Alphington Community Battery project is to be delivered by community-owned social enterprise Village Powerx with Darebin Council and will have 300 kWh of storage capacity, supporting about 100 households with solar panels.
The Neighbourhood Battery Initiative has allocated funding for batteries in 29 local government areas so far, the Victorian government noted.
Community battery ownership models can take many forms, ranging from projects owned by community members or councils to neighbourhood batteries owned by distribution network service providers (DNSPs), energy retailers, or other renewables investors. Projects can also involve a mix of ownership models.
Perceived community battery benefits include enabling more local solar exports into the grid, widening access to local clean generation, raised community resilience via islanded microgrids and progress on net zero targets. While the concept inspires much hope, the results of many of the trials have found the financial and solar “soaking” benefits to be much more mooted in reality.

Energy sold from community or neighbourhood batteries is rarely cheaper for local communities. This is because electricity networks in Australia operate under a “postage stamp pricing” mandate which dictates every customer in the service area pays the same, even though it costs more to send energy further away.
While this principle itself aims to maintain community equity, it sets up a structure where using locally generated power has no real financial reward currently. That is unless a special arrangement is struck with network companies.
Be that as it may, the energy neighbourhood batteries store is greener, which remains a major drawcard for communities.
Neighbourhood or local batteries do smooth local network issues though and can diminish the need for upgrades or augmentation. Specifically, they can boost reliability, deliver local voltage control, help reverse power flows, and energy resilience in the face of natural disasters.
Australia’s federal Labor government is in the process of implementing its own national community battery program. The scheme has already been enveloped in a rorts controversy. Moreover, the choice to split the $120 million in available funding equally between network (DNSP) applicants and everyone else has meant its faithfulness to community equity is somewhat questionable.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/29/australias-rd-spend-plunges-despite-global-clean-energy-manufacturing-race-intensifying/,"FINANCE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 29, 2023",Australia’s R&D spend continues to shrink despite global clean energy race intensifying,"Recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show Australia’s overall national investment in science and research and development (R&D) continues its 14-year decline. Despite federal Labor’s policy to lift R&D expenditure to 3% by 2030, the 2022/23 budget is forecast to actually decrease spending in the area.
Among the 38 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, Australia ranks third last for its R&D spend, ahead only of New Zealand and Ireland. 
For OECD nations, the average R&D expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) currently sits at 2.74%. Australia’s gross expenditure sat at just 1.68% in 2021/22, falling from 1.8% in 2019/20, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
This is almost three times less than frontrunner South Korea, which spent 4.8% in 2022. The US, Japan, and Germany spent 3.47%, 3.27%, and 3.13% respectively.
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
Alarmingly, in May Dr Robyn Prior published budget analysis on the Parliament of Australia’s website forecasting 2022–23 expenditure to be just 0.49% of GDP (though it seems Dr Prior is using slightly different metrics to the ABS, as her analysis lists previous expenditure at 0.6%, rather than the ABS’ 1.6%). This, she writes, “is the lowest level since the beginning of the data series in 1978–79.”
The lack of capital in Australia to support burgeoning innovation is a major theme at clean energy industry events. The divide is rapidly intensifying as well with countries like the US, China, India, South Korea and others upping investment to compete in what is being described as a global “race” capture the manufacturing market for clean energy technologies.
While the lack of bold capital expenditure is felt throughout the industry, Kirk McDonald, Project Manager at Supercharge Australia, an organisation working with energy startups, has said the dearth of government support means Australia is rapidly losing the innovative technologies which would underpin future success. “The money is coming thick and fast for [startups] to leave, for them to go overseas,” McDonald said at a critical minerals summit held in June.
The “brain drain” phenomenon has historically plagued countries with low GDPs, but is now afflicting Australia where governments, especially at a federal level, remain skittish about investment. 
“Australia urgently needs to develop a 10-year plan to boost government, higher education and business investment in R&D, so we are equipped to manage a large-scale energy transition, an ageing population, and develop critical national security technology,” Australian Academy of Science President, Professor Chennupati Jagadish, said.
“Australia has one of the world’s least differentiated economies,” Professor Chennupati Jagadish said. “We remain vulnerable when our prosperity relies on such a narrow range of industries.” 
“It is imperative we improve Australia’s economic complexity, which can be driven by a more strategic focus on science and research—the fuel for innovation and industry growth,” he added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/29/four-queensland-towns-funded-to-switch-from-diesel-to-solar-and-batteries/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MICROGRID,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 29, 2023",Four Queensland towns funded to switch from diesel to solar and batteries,"The Queensland government has allocated $28 million (USD 18 million) to switch the regional diesel power plants in Boulia, Burketown, Doomadgee, and Windorah to renewable solar and battery microgrids.
In Boulia, a 1.7 MW solar farm is being planned by local provider Ergon Energy Network, a subsidiary of state-owned Energy Queensland. The Boulia solar farm is to be coupled with 1.5 MWh of energy storage.
Burketown is planned to have 1.2 MW of solar and 1 MWh of energy storage. 
For Doomadgee, 4.5 MW of solar and 4 MWh of energy storage is in the works. 
Finally, Windorah is set to have a 850 kW solar installation coupled with 1 MWh of energy storage.
No details on the specific type of planned batteries for any of the projects have been provided.
All four regional towns are serviced by Ergon Energy Network, which currently provides 34 isolated networks across 39 communities in Queensland.
In total, the rural installations are expected to save around $3 million per year by cutting 1.5 million litres of diesel, on top of significant emissions reductions.
The funding allocation has been made as part of Queensland’s 2023-24 budget.
“Queensland’s isolated networks are mostly powered by dedicated diesel power stations, with some generation coming from a combination of customer-owned rooftop solar PV, and centralised renewable energy installations owned and operated by Ergon Energy Network,” Energy Queensland’s Acting Chief Engineer, Jason Hall, said of the state’s current landscape.
“While these new solar farms might be small in size comparative to the Queensland SuperGrid, the benefit of them to these remote communities is incredibly valuable,” Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Road, Mark Bailey, said. 
“This is great for the environment too, getting these isolated networks off millions of litres of diesel will help us to reduce electricity emissions by 96% by 2040,” Bailey added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/29/wa-to-receive-3-billion-for-transmission/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,POLICY,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"AUGUST 29, 2023",Rewiring WA: state to receive $3 billion for transmission,"Up to $3 billion in concessional loans and equity investments will be made available by the Commonwealth government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to fund both upgrades and new transmission in Western Australia.
The funding pertains to both the state’s islanded grids – the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) and the North West Interconnected System (NWIS) – and is part of the federal government’s Rewiring the Nation program, its cornerstone emissions reduction policy. The grid expansion and modernisation will largely happen around Perth metropolitan area; the state’s South West, which includes popular tourist destinations; as well as in the North West Pilbara region, a mining hotbed.
At the Critical Minerals Summit held in Perth in June, founder and CEO of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, noted Western Australia’s separated grids are seriously falling behind Australia’s national grid, which connects its more populace eastern states. In 2022, renewables contributed more than 35% of the generation in Australia’s national electricity market (NEM), but in Western Australia that average drops by more than half, with renewables contributing just 17%. 
“We are falling a long way behind Australia’s decarbonisation of the power sector,” Hare said. “The South West Interconnected System is a bit under half of generation in the state… but the larger part of our power generation – the Pilbara, the North West Interconnected System, the Goldfields and so, is not doing so well and that takes the state average down to about 17% and it doesn’t appear to be accelerating. Now, it’s vital for critical minerals because that’s where critical minerals are being mined.”
Specifically, less the 2% of the electricity generated in the state’s Northern grid comes from renewables. As Hare notes, this is particularly problematic as Australia is looking to become a global exporter of clean minerals, which will need to be mined and refined with renewable energy to be attractive on the international market. There are currently a number of companies seeking to set up refining and downstream projects from minerals mined in Western Australia, Australia’s biggest mining state.
The state government has said the $3 billion deal “will finance priority projects” and “increase the supply of renewable energy, and connect it into the grid by plugging in renewable generation hubs.” 
“The agreement has been informed by WA Government modelling, specifically from the South West Interconnected System Demand Assessment and the Pilbara Industry Roundtable process,” WA Minister for Energy Bill Johnston added.
“It is expected the private sector will largely fund the cost of renewable energy generation and transmission infrastructure in the Pilbara, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars over the coming decades,” he said. “The low-cost finance program will help unlock this significant investment.”
Regional and rural residents in WA’s south west have already seen the impacts of local network inadequacies. The sole network operator for the SWIS grid, Western Power, in February 2022 enforced a rule change which saw regional residents restricted to just 32 Amps per property. By October, the company agreed to increase the supply allocation to match metropolitan standards of 63 Amps due to public outcry.
According to the government’s announcement, initial modelling suggests that in 20 years’ time, the SWIS grid will need to have up to five times more electricity than is available today, as new industrial users connect to the grid.
Controversy around new transmission lines has heated up significantly in Australia over the past year and is receiving evermore attention in the mainstream media. This has led to speculation about whether local opposition could derail Australia’s emissions reduction targets which hinge on transmission unlocking private investment in new renewable projects. 
Greenpeace Australia Pacific today welcomed the funding news, saying it shows the state’s future is in renewables. “We’re looking forward to further details, and will be watching closely to ensure this important funding doesn’t end up in the hands of the gas industry, who have been actively attempting to commandeer funds earmarked for clean energy,” the organisation’s Head of Clean Energy Transition, Jess Panegyres, said. “We look forward to further in-budget federal and state funds allocated for this important work.”

India added approximately 6.8 GW of new solar capacity during the first half of 2023, including 4.2 GW of utility-scale projects, 2.3 GW of rooftop installations, and 0.3 GW of offgrid systems. This marked a decrease of about 15% compared to solar installations in the first half of 2022, according to a recent report by JMK Research & Analytics.
In the second quarter of 2023 (April-June period), around 1.7 GW of utility-scale solar capacity was installed, up 28% from the preceding quarter.
India’s cumulative installed renewable capacity reached 129.6 GW as of June 30, 2023. Among renewable sources, solar maintained its dominance, contributing 54% to the total mix, followed by wind at 34%.
A promising pipeline of approximately 66 GW for solar, wind, and hybrid projects is expected to be commissioned within the next four to five years. Additionally, 61.9 GW of projects are in the bidding phase, where tenders have been issued but auctions are yet to be finalised.
Analysts at JMK Research said that India will add around 13 GW of new solar capacity (9 GW of utility-scale solar and 4 GW of rooftop PV) and 4.1 GW of wind capacity in calendar year 2023. Furthermore, approximately 5.8 GW of solar and 2.3 GW of wind capacity are expected to be added in the upcoming two quarters.
In the second quarter of 2023, Sineng led in terms of inverter shipments, followed by Sungrow and Fimer, while Waaree emerged as the leading module supplier, accounting for approximately 14.2% of the total shipments
Adani emerged as a major player in both the utility-scale solar and wind segments, boasting an operational capacity of approximately 8.3 GW and a robust pipeline of 20.4 GW.
In the Indian market, the price of Chinese mono PERC modules (excluding goods and services tax and basic customs duty) stood at USD 0.27/Wp to USD 0.29/Wp during the second quarter of 2023, down 9% to 13% from the previous quarter. Bifacial module prices ranged between USD 0.30/Wp to USD 0.32/Wp.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/29/energy-management-system-to-combine-residential-pv-with-gravity-storage/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,MOROCCO",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 29, 2023",Energy management system to combine residential PV with gravity storage,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers from the International University of Rabat in Morocco has developed a smart house energy management system (SHEMS) to optimise electricity production in residential PV systems combined with gravity energy storage (GES).
“The SHEMS supports two-way communication between smart home users and grid utilities,” the research’s corresponding author, Asmae Berrada, told pv magazine. “SHEMS is flexible in managing and controlling smart home appliances, renewable energy resources, and energy storage systems in order to participate in electricity conservation and demand response.”
In the paper “Intelligent Energy Management System for Smart Home with Grid-Connected Hybrid Photovoltaic/Gravity Energy Storage System,” published in the Journal of Energy Storage, Berrada and her colleagues explained that the proposed system is based on a novel one-week dynamic forecasting model that considers PV power generation, the state of charge of the GES system, the electricity price, and the scheduled load on the horizon for one week.
“In addition, it enables the user to perform intelligent household energy allocation, optimise household load allocation in the time dimension, achieve customer demand response, relieve grid pressure during peak hours, and improve grid stability,” they stated, adding that the system’s hardware consists of a SHEMS centre, smart meters, communication and networking systems, and other unspecified smart devices that connect all home appliances.
The SHEMS usually uses PV power generation from the solar array to power the house’s loads. When excess electricity is produced, the system uses it to energise the GES system or injects it into the grid. When PV power is insufficient to meet all the household’s electricity needs, the GES system is activated by the SHEMS. “In situations where neither the PV power nor the GES power is sufficient to cover the entire energy demand of the loads, the system draws power from the electrical grid,” the Moroccan group said. “The grid acts as a backup source of electricity to ensure that all the loads in the house receive the required power.”
The researchers validated their model through a case study considering a household with a maximum power consumption of 6 kW, a 5 kW PV system, and a 0.5 kWh GES system with a water tank volume of 28.63 m3. The house is assumed to also use heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and to host EV recharging, with the EV battery being programmed to charge during the period between 1 am and 5 am.
“This time window takes advantage of the low energy prices and ensures that the vehicle is fully charged by the morning,” the research team explained. “Other loads are scheduled to operate when there is available PV production, except for the refrigerator, lighting, TV, computer, and fans. However, a portion of the energy consumption for these appliances can be supplied by the energy storage system (GES).”
Through their modelling, the academics found that the PV-GES unit can cover the household’s power demand for approximately 8 h each day, with discharging of the GES system occurring usually between 4 pm and 5 pm. “This leads to significant reductions in the house’s energy costs and its adverse environmental footprint,” it emphasised.
