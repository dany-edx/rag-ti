The project is underpinned by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Snowy Hydro, signed in 2018 as part of the Snowy Hydro Renewable Energy Procurement Program.
FRV Australia managing director Carlo Frigerio said the plant, built on a 248-hectare site near Armidale, has been generating clean energy since December 2021 and first sent power to the grid in March.
“We are delighted to see that Metz Solar Farm is working at its full capacity and generating clean energy,” he said.
“This is the fourth project that FRV has delivered in NSW and another key milestone for Australia’s energy transformation process ahead of the retirement of coal power stations in the coming years.”
Fady Jameel, the deputy president and vice chair of Abdul Latif Jameel said projects like Metz, which is underpinned by a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Snowy Hydro, signed in 2018 as part of the Snowy Hydro Renewable Energy Procurement Program, serve as a strong example of the benefits of working together and combining skills and expertise towards greater climate resilience and economic development.
“Metz Solar Farm reaffirms our ongoing commitment to working with likeminded partners to deliver innovative solutions that will contribute towards the world’s renewable energy targets,” he said.

FRV Australia, owned by UAE-based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy and Canadian fund manager Omers Infrastructure, has established itself as one of Australia’s largest solar developers since its emergence in 2010.
The company said this week it has developed almost 800 MWdc of Australian PV across nine projects for a total project investment value of more than $1 billion.
The company’s Australian portfolio includes the 125 MW Lilyvale and 125 MW Clare solar farm in Queensland and the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria. It also includes the 69.75 MW Goonumbla, the 56 MW Moree, and the 300 MW Walla Walla solar farms, all in NSW. It has also started work on a 5 MW solar-storage hybrid power plant near Dalby in southern Queensland. The Dalby Hybrid Power Plant will comprise 2.4 MW of solar PV capacity and a 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery, making it the first battery energy storage system FRV has developed in Australia.
The company also owns the 90 MW Sebastopol Solar Farm, which earlier this year began sending power to the grid in NSW.
It has also turned its focus to New Zealand, announcing late last year that it intends to develop 500 MW of solar energy across the North and South islands.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/13/three-ways-fossil-fuel-industry-failed-women-and-how-clean-energy-can-learn-from-mistakes/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022",Three ways fossil fuel industry failed women (and how clean energy can learn from mistakes),"Energy is a particularly male-dominated STEM industry, with clean energy on the brink of massive expansion. However, to ensure the clean energy industry is truly sustainable, it must learn from the mistakes of the mining and fossil fuel industry.
If mining workplaces are anything to go by, the clean energy sector will have their work cut out for them to retain women in the workforce.
It’s easy to understand why women are leaving careers in the fossil fuel sector. For example, a Western Australian parliamentary inquiry earlier this year revealed appalling reports of widespread sexual harassment and assault in the state’s fly-in-fly-out mining industry.
At a glance, it seems Australia’s clean energy industry is making great progress. A 2021 Clean Energy Council survey found 39% of Australia’s clean energy workforce identify as women. Compare this to 32% of the global renewables sector, 25.9% in Australia’s oil and gas sector, and 17.5% in coal mining.
However, the Australian result was based on a voluntary survey of the renewables sector, which people who feel marginalised by their diversity are more likely to opt into. This means the percentage of women in the sector actually may be lower.
The male-dominated renewables construction sector also had low representation in survey responses, further skewing results.
If we look at the mining sector overall, census data reveals that at junior levels there is a relatively even gender split, with women comprising roughly 40% of 20-27 year olds in the industry.

But this gender split doesn’t persist for long. The proportion of women in mining begins to decrease from age 28, so that in the 56-59 age bracket, women comprise less than 15% of the workforce. The census data also reveal there has been little improvement in these numbers in the last 15 years.
So why are women leaving the mining industry? There are three main reasons.
The mining industry, including the fossil fuel industry, can be a dangerous place for women.
In early 2022, an external review of Rio Tinto’s workplace culture found bullying, sexism and racism are systemic across the company.
In the last five years, 28% of women had experienced sexual harassment at Rio Tinto worksites, and 21 women were victims of actual or attempted rape or sexual assault.
This finding is consistent with the WA parliamentary inquiry, which found sexual harassment is, and has long been, prevalent across the industry. It is fostered by gender inequality, power imbalances and exacerbated by high alcohol consumption.
The inquiry’s report highlighted that when women tried to report harassment and assault they were bullied, threatened or lost their jobs.
The parliamentary inquiry made a number of recommendations to improve the safety of women in the FIFO mining industry, such as an overhaul of reporting structures within companies.
So far Rio Tinto is the only major mining company that has announced their plan to overhaul their systems to protect women. There has been no word from governments outside of WA on any action in the face of this damning parliamentary inquiry.

Women tend to face more obstacles to progression and job satisfaction than men do, because there are systematic biases against them. While a minority belief persists that biases against women simply do not exist, we have known of bias in science for a long time.
In Australia, as in many nations, women do more household and caring work, and STEM fields are generally male dominated. Our expectations of the roles of each gender are influenced accordingly, creating implicit bias against women in science.
Research shows these biases negatively affect all decisions made about women in a professional context, including hiring, promotion, awards, the value of their work, and other professional opportunities.
This means once women are in STEM careers, especially in male-dominated industries such as the mining industry, they encounter more barriers to success than their male colleagues.
It’s clear having children isn’t the sole cause of women leaving STEM careers, otherwise we’d see a flood of childfree women in leadership positions throughout the STEM sector, and this is certainly not the case.
However, in Australian heterosexual couples, women generally shoulder the bulk of childcare. This is perhaps in part because men are not ordinarily given equal access to parental leave and flexible working arrangements.
When both parents have equal access to parental leave, families can structure home and outside work equitably. On the other hand, providing birth mums vastly more leave can incentivise inequality, since families may be better off financially or otherwise by not using childcare.
Some mining companies recognise that flexible working conditions could increase retention, and have policies allowing any employee to work flexibly. Others have “family friendly” FIFO rosters, which tends to involve prescription of the roster they believe to be family friendly.

Like the fossil fuel industry, women in renewables face barriers to retention and promotion.
Representation of university-qualified women decreases in leadership roles and above age 40. Women in the renewables sector make up just 32% of senior leadership or executive roles, 19% of board positions, and 62% of administrative roles.
In Australia’s mining and energy sector, some people are pushing for change and equity, but the problems are widespread and can be difficult to detect.
We need sector-wide, systemic change. This must be brought about by thoughtful and insightful leadership at our most senior levels, guiding new policies and procedures to make workplaces more inclusive of women.
Research shows achieving greater gender balance leads to better economic performance and outcomes, and more innovation. In many STEM industries, we have a strong pipeline of women university graduates being lost to other sectors in their early to mid-careers.
In fact, shifting only 1% of Australia’s workforce into STEM jobs would add $57.4 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product over 20 years.
The clean energy sector has an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the mining and fossil fuel sector and harness the untapped potential of women in Australia’s STEM-trained workforce. Doing so will deliver even greater economic and environmental benefits.

Liontown has awarded Zenith the contract for the supply of power at its Kathleen Valley project on a build, own and operate basis.
Zenith will construct a 95 MW hybrid power station at the Kathleen Valley project, being developed near Leinster, about 680 kilometres north-east of Perth. The hybrid power station will comprise 30 MW of wind capacity, a 16 MWp fixed-axis solar PV array, and a 17 MW/19 MWh battery energy storage system. The thermal power component will comprise 27 MW of gas generation and 5 MW of diesel standby generation.
With the thermal components of the power plant designed to operate in “engine off” mode at times, it is anticipated the hybrid power plant will deliver at least 60% renewable energy at project start-up and up to 100% during times of high wind and solar radiation.
Zenith managing director Hamish Moffat said with a combined 46 MW of generation capacity and 17 MW of BESS, the hybrid power station is expected to have the largest off-grid renewable capacity of any mining project in the country.
“It’s an exciting opportunity to showcase our expertise, and the ability of renewables to deliver reliable, continuous supply, to power an entire mining operation,” he said.
“It will once again raise the industry benchmark in renewable energy integration and demonstrates our commitment to power decarbonisation.”

Moffat said the Letter of Award enables Zenith, which has installed capacity of more than 400 MW across WA and the Northern Territory, to undertake planning, engineering and design works and order long-lead items while the parties progress towards finalising a binding Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).
Liontown managing director and chief executive officer Tony Ottaviano said Zenith will be incentivised to operate the power station in a manner which maximises renewable power, with a renewable energy guarantee expected to be included in the definitive arrangements.
“We believe Zenith Energy is an ideal partner to delivery an industry leading hybrid power station to meet Liontown’s energy needs and requirements for a high-capacity renewable solution,” he said. “The hybrid power station proposed will enable Liontown to exceed our target of achieving at least 60% renewable energy at project start-up and beyond.”
Liontown expects construction of the Kathleen Valley project to commence later this year. The company said early grade control drilling is well advanced at the planned two open pits with mining expected to commence in Q1 2023 with first production of spodumene concentrate, a critical mineral used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, from Q2 2024.
The project is expected to initially produce about 500,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate per annum, but Liontown hopes to expand production to 700,000 tonnes by 2029.
Liontown has already signed binding offtake agreements for 450,000tpa of spodumene concentrate, representing 90% of the project’s initial planned production. Global car manufacturing giant Ford, US-based electric vehicle and battery manufacturer Tesla and South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution have all inked agreements with the WA company.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/13/nsw-refines-transmission-route-for-central-west-orana-rez/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022",NSW refines transmission plans for Central-West Orana REZ,"The New South Wales government has refined its plans for the new transmission infrastructure which will enable at least 3 GW of large-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects participating in the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) to connect to the rest of the network.
The Central-West Orana REZ, which encompasses approximately 20,000 square kilometres centred on the town of Dubbo, is expected to deliver at least 3 GW of new network capacity by the mid-2020s, enough to power 1.4 million homes.
The Energy Corporation of NSW (EnergyCo) said the development of new transmission infrastructure to connect that renewable energy generation to the grid will be critical for the successful operation of the coordinated clean energy zone and a scoping report for the transmission project has now been submitted to the Department of Planning and Environment.
The scoping report released on Monday shows the Central-West Orana REZ will be serviced by new transmission network infrastructure, with EnergyCo seeking approval for the construction and operation of new 330 kV and 500 kV high-capacity transmission lines and associated infrastructure to connect to the National Electricity Market, energy hubs at Merotherie and Elong Elong, and a new substation at Wollar.
The report presents a preliminary analysis of environmental issues that will be assessed in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as well as the infrastructure proposed for the project.
The scoping report also outlines a refined one-kilometre transmission network study corridor, down from the five-kilometre wide study corridor announced earlier this year.
EnergyCo, which has been tasked with implementing the government’s REZs, has previously announced a shortlist of companies to serve as network operator for the Central-West Orana REZ with electricity distributor Endeavour Energy, Cobra, and ACE Energy (which includes Spanish renewable energy company Acciona), in the running.

The Central-West Orana REZ is the first of five designated clean energy zones detailed in the NSW Government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, South-West and Illawarra regions.
NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the Central-West Orana REZ will play a pivotal role in the state’s plans to deliver a cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy sector as the state transitions from coal-fired power.
“Combining generation and storage with poles and wires, the REZ will capitalise on economies of scale to deliver energy to homes and businesses in NSW,” he said.
“Once complete this REZ will provide at least 3,000 MW of cheap, reliable electricity, enough to power 1.4 million homes. It will also drive $5.2 billion in private investment into the central west by 2030, supporting around 3,900 construction jobs.”
A call for registrations of interest process conducted in 2020 attracted more than 100 registrations, totalling 27 GW of renewable energy capacity, valued at an estimated $38 billion.
EnergyCo said it will now host a series of information sessions to support the release of the scoping report. EnergyCo will also start preparing the EIS for the REZ transmission project which is planned for public exhibition in mid-2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/13/flexible-roll-to-roll-printed-perovskite-solar-cell-hits-16-7-efficiency/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",MARK HUTCHINS,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022","Flexible, roll-to-roll printed perovskite solar cell hits 16.7% efficiency","While perovskite solar cells have made impressive achievements in the laboratory setting, translating these to processes so they can be used in large-scale manufacturing is a very different story. Perovksites also bring the potential for higher efficiency flexible solar cells, which could open many new applications for solar energy.
The roll-to-roll process, which involves a roll of plastic or other flexible material, is a potential low-cost approach to manufacturing for flexible perovskites. However, adding the electrode layer in a process compatible with the roll-to-roll setup has proven to be a particular challenge.
This was the focus of scientists at Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who sought to develop a process that could see the electrode layer deposited without the need for solvents or heat treatments that potentially damage the perovskite layer as well.
“Replacement of the thermally evaporated metal electrode is a major challenge to be overcome and is a key to realizing flexible fully printed PSCs,” the group said. “This is particularly important because the metal electrode used almost exclusively in the record-breaking PSCs is vacuum evaporated gold, which accounts for about 70% of the cost of a PSC module.”

The group developed a process in which an electrode made from carbon and silver is first fabricated on a detachable plastic (PET) substrate, and then pressed onto the top of the perovskite solar cell. The PET layer is then removed and can be reused. The scientists described the process and the resulting solar cell in “Vacuum-Free and Solvent-Free Deposition of Electrodes for Roll-to-Roll Fabricated Perovskite Solar Cells,” which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
Since the step of pre-treating the electrode layer before it is applied to the cell eliminates solvents in the pastes used, the process can be called “solvent free,” and scientists may be able to work with printing pastes not otherwise suitable for perovskite materials. The rest of the cell was assembled using more established roll-to-roll techniques, and then put through a series of tests.
The best of the cells fabricated achieved an efficiency of 16.7%, which the group claims as a record for such a device. In further testing, the cells were encapsulated with another flexible plastic material, saw no significant performance loss after 24 hours under constant one-sun illumination in ambient, indoor atmosphere. The flexible cells, this time without the encapsulant, were also subject to a series of bending tests, retaining better than 90% of its initial performance after 3,000 convex bends, and falling just below 80% after 3,000 concave bends.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/13/solar-in-the-u-s-forecast-to-triple-in-five-years/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2022",US poised to hit 336 GW of solar by 2027,"After a hampered start to the year, the United States is set to grow its solar capacity at unprecedented rates. Now that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been passed, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie have lifted the forecast for solar deployment by 40% above prior projections through 2027.
According to the two organisations in the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2022, installed and operational solar capacity may increase threefold in five short years, skyrocketing from 129 GW today to 335 GW by 2027.
Despite this rapid growth, projections for this year have been trimmed to 15.7 GW due to lingering effects of the Department of Commerce’s investigation into antidumping violations by major international solar panel providers. Ongoing international trade and labor concerns, including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) may continue to challenge supply and limit deployment in 2023. Full benefits of the IRA may not be reflected in deployment until 2024 at earliest, said the report.
Solar accounted for 39% of all new electric generating capacity additions in the first half of 2022. The U.S. solar market now represents about 4.5% of the nation’s electricity mix. Perhaps the most significant development in the Inflation Reduction Act for the solar industry was the long-term extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) at 30%.
“The Inflation Reduction Act has given the solar industry the most long-term certainty it has ever had,” said Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “Ten years of investment tax credits stands in stark contrast to the one-, two-, or five-year extensions that the industry has experienced in the last decade. It’s not an overstatement to say that the IRA will lead to a new era for the U.S. solar industry.”
For the fifth quarter in a row, residential solar had record deployment with 1.36 GW installed, a 37% increase over Q2 2021. This represents nearly 180,000 residential customers installing solar in one quarter. The report said customer demand was strong due in part to power outages and to power price increases. Residential solar installations may drop slightly next year as California’s NEM 3.0 policy takes effect.
Commercial solar installed 336 MW in Q2, down 7% year-over-year, while 2.7 GW of utility-scale solar was deployed in Q2, a 25% decrease from Q2 2021. The extension and expansion of the ITC and other provisions in the IRA boosted Wood Mackenzie’s five-year outlook by 52 GW (47%) over previous projections.
Community solar deployment projects were lifted by 18% compared to the previous outlook. President Biden’s Executive Order has brought relief to the industry, but most of the additions come from Maine and New York. The two states accounted for 72% of the community solar capacity additions in the first half of 2022. In Maine, Net Energy Billing (NEB) projects that are not wrapped up in the state’s interconnection studies are coming online at a fast pace. In New York, Community Adder projects continue to come online, with a healthy pipeline remaining.
System prices continued to climb in Q2 2022 across market segments, mostly due to module price increases. System pricing increased year-over-year by 9% for residential, 8% for commercial, 8% for utility fixed-tilt, and 13% for utility single-axis tracking solar projects.
