This includes an interim target to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by the end of the decade.
AGL told an investor briefing in Melbourne on Friday the 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery to be built alongside the Tomago smelter, which is the biggest consumer of electricity in NSW, accounting for more than 10% of electricity use in the state, is part of a renewables development pipeline that has swelled from 3.2 GW to 5.3 GW in the past four months.
AGL also revealed an unidentified 400 MW battery project in NSW and a 500 MW project in Queensland have formally entered its growing pipeline of renewable generation and storage developments. The power giant also revealed plans for a 200 MW solar farm to be developed in NSW.
AGL Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Damien Nicks said the addition of the new projects means the company is “well positioned” to achieve its decarbonisation strategy which requires it to increase its development portfolio of renewable energy generation from 1.7 GW to 8 GW of wind and solar by 2035. It will also seek to grow its firming capacity, including grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro, from 1.4 GW to 7.3 GW over that period.

The company has previously announced plans to exit coal-fired generation by 2035 and on Friday reaffirmed its commitment to close down its Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley between 2030 and 2033 while the Loy Yang A power plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley will be shuttered in 2035.
“This is the biggest transition that this market has ever seen in terms of what we are doing over the next 12 years,” Nicks said. “Today we are sharing with the market how we will deliver on our strategy to connect our customers to a sustainable future and transition our energy portfolio.”
“I’m very pleased to say we have positive momentum in terms of operational performance, continued customer growth and progress against the delivery of our strategy, including advancing our development pipeline with the Torrens Island and Broken Hill batteries, which will be operational later this year.”
AGL is in the final stages of bringing the 250 MW/250 MWh battery at South Australia’s Torrens Island online with the 50 MW/50 MWh battery being developed near the outback NSW city of Broken Hill expected to switch on in the next three months.
Investors were told AGL is on target to deliver 850 MW of grid-scale batteries by the end of 2025 with the utility planning to fact track the development of a 500 MW/2 GWh big battery at the site of the now-shuttered Liddell coal-fired power plant in the Hunter Valley.

AGL said the final investment decision on the Liddell battery has been brought forward to the end of this year, with the first 250 MW stage expected to receive funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
AGL said it expected to fund 5.5 GW of its targeted 12 GW of new firmed renewables capacity from its own balance sheet, while the other 6.5 GW would be procured via joint ventures, partnerships, third-party offtakes and distributed energy resources including rooftop solar.
The company expects to outlay between $8 billion (USD 5.5 billion) to $10 billion to deliver the 5.5 GW with the majority of that spend to occur in the first half of next decade.
Also on Friday AGL announced upgraded full-year profit targets, with the company putting underlying profit after tax at $255 million to $285 million. Previous guidance was $200 million to $280 million.
Next year it expects to double its underlying profit after tax to $580 million to $780 million.

The donated system comprises Risen’s 415 W Titan S solar panels, GoodWe’s ET 3-phase high voltage inverter, and Lynx F Series high voltage battery, and was made possible through the facilitation and installation expertise of OSW and Solenergy.
The solar and storage system is powering the state-of-the-art bio bank facility, an initiative spearheaded by not-for-profit Great Barrier Reef Legacy which aims to collect living specimens of hundreds of coral species from the Great Barrier Reef and preserve them in a living ‘coral ark’, protecting them from mass bleaching events and extinction.
It is hoped the facility, housed at the Cairns Aquarium in far north Queensland, will eventually be home to live specimens of all 400-or-so coral species on the reef, which can be transplanted back onto the reef should it be needed to restore damaged or impacted areas.
Great Barrier Reef Legacy Managing Director Dean Miller said the donated PV and storage system, which goes beyond carbon neutrality to achieve carbon positivity by generating more energy than it consumes, will not only power the coral bio bank but also contributes to the organisation’s objectives to combat the effects of climate change.

“We are truly thankful to Risen, GoodWe, OSW, and Solenergy for their generous donation,” he said. “Their support is invaluable in enabling us to run this facility effectively and sustainably while minimising our impact on climate change.”
In a statement, Risen said its collaboration with GoodWe, OSW, and Solenergy “set a powerful example of how corporations can come together to drive positive change.”
“The companies understand that solar offers more than just sustainability,” Risen said. “This joint effort showcases the boundless potential of solar energy in mitigating climate change and preserving precious biodiversity.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/19/china-polysilicon-prices-in-freefall/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 19, 2023",China polysilicon prices in freefall,"From pv magazine Global
The Global Polysilicon Marker (GPM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for polysilicon outside China, held steady this week at USD 30 per kg ($43/kg), with the market seeing limited transactions and fewer price quotes, according to OPIS Solar.
Ex-China polysilicon prices remained the same for a second week running, with most players offering no new price points during OPIS’ market survey. Instead, and extending the pattern from last week, multiple sources gestured at how prices in China’s polysilicon market remain in freefall.

Prices for polysilicon in China, assessed by OPIS as China Mono Grade, continued to break records, diving even further to CNY78 ($16)/kg, its lowest figure in almost three years, which also leaves the hitherto-much-discussed, psychologically significant figure of CNY100/kg in the dust. This 27.44% plummet takes the crown from last week’s already-dramatic percentage plunge, and is now 2023’s largest percentage drop in China polysilicon prices.
This precipitous decline comes as China’s market fundamentals also remain unchanged, with polysilicon output continuing to exceed demand, as one source reiterated. Transactions take place in reality at 10% below the figures quoted by large and small factories alike, and wafer producers now have a rather strong negotiating position when placing purchasing orders with polysilicon businesses, the source added.
With the exception of a few prominent manufacturers, many polysilicon producers can currently no longer break even at prices between CNY70/kg and CNY80/kg, and a brutal pricing war is currently in full swing, according to a source. These major producers are expected to continue waging a price war, taking advantage of their lower production costs and larger production scale this and next year to deny small and newer players market share, the source added. In this way, they can maintain their high ground in polysilicon when the segment faces significant oversupply.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/19/solaredge-unveils-bidirectional-ev-charger/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,ISRAEL,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 19, 2023",SolarEdge unveils bidirectional EV charger,"From pv magazine Global
SolarEdge has unveiled a bidirectional DC-coupled electric vehicle (EV) charger at Intersolar Europe, taking place this week in Munich, Germany.
The Israel-based inverter manufacturer’s DC-coupled architecture allows for simultaneous EV charging directly from solar, home battery storage, and the grid. The charger is connected to single- or three-phase inverters through a DC bus circuit which can be oversized by up to 200%, enabling charging the EV with excess PV. The charger has a charge/discharge rate of 12/24 kW and a peak efficiency of DC to DC of 99%.
The new charger will enable solar-powered vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. It will become commercially available in the second half of 2024.
V2G applications allow automatic charging and discharging of the EV battery based on dynamic utility prices. This enables homeowners to receive payments from their electricity supplier by discharging stored EV battery power back to the grid during demand response events.
Additionally, users can use the EV battery to back up their homes during outages, demonstrating a V2H application. The battery has a capacity of up to 50 kWh.
“The charger will be compatible with both 400V and 800V EV powertrains via a standard CSS connector,” Solar Edge said in a statement.
The device measures 620 mm x 340 mm x 200 mm, weighs 22 kg, and features a 7-meter cable. It can operate in temperatures ranging from -30 C to 50 C and features an IP-65 rated enclosure for indoor and outdoor use.
