AEMO today published its Draft 2022 Integrated System Plan (ISP), outlining five scenarios encompassing a range of plausible trends and events in the energy sector’s transformation and proposing a 30-year ‘optimal development path’ for the efficient development of the NEM.
The favoured Step Change scenario forecasts a rapid consumer-led transformation of the energy sector with major investment in renewable generation, energy storage, back-up generation and transmission with coal-fired power generators expected to shut down nearly three times faster than previously anticipated, exiting the NEM entirely by 2043.
AEMO chief executive Daniel Westerman said the significant changes already underway in the NEM have continued to accelerate in recent years, considerably exceeding forecasts in the Central scenario which was favoured in the 2020 ISP.
“The Step Change scenario forecasts a rapid transformation in Australia’s National Electricity Market, consisting of a significant investment in renewable generation, storage and firming generation as coal plants exit, and improvements to transmission,” he said.
“In this scenario, the NEM will operate without coal generation by 2043. This requires a substantial increase in battery and pumped-hydro storage, hydrogen or gas-fired generation for peak demand, all complemented by a market that incentivises energy users to adjust demand based on system conditions.”
Under the Step Change scenario, the amount of energy delivered to customers in the NEM will nearly double by 2050, up from 180 TWh to about 330 TWh per year as transport, heating, cooking and industrial processes are electrified. This energy will be delivered almost solely by renewables with large-scale wind and solar capacity projected to triple by 2030.
The ISP forecasts that utility-scale VRE capacity will increase from 15 GW currently to nearly 140 GW by 2050 to meet demand as coal-fired generation withdraws.
Current announcements by thermal plant owners suggest that about 5 GW of the current 23 GW of coal capacity will withdraw by 2030. However, modelling suggests that 14 GW of coal generation is likely to leave the market by the end of the decade. AEMO anticipates coal capacity is likely to close as early as 2040 and the NEM will operate without it by 2043.

“Over the past decade, coal-fired generators have withdrawn from the market before their announced dates, and competitive and operational pressures will intensify with the ever-increasing penetration of cheap renewable generation,” AEMO said.
The Step Change scenario modelling suggest that nearly half of all Australian homes will have rooftop PV by 2030, rising to 65% with 69 GW capacity by 2050, with most systems coupled with battery energy storage. These units would produce approximately 90 GWh of electricity, satisfying nearly 20% of the NEM’s total demand.
To firm that VRE and DER, major investment in storage will be required, with 45 GW/620 GWh of dispatchable generation, including utility-scale batteries, hydro storage, and smart behind-the-meter batteries or “virtual power plants” (VPPs) needed.
Networks and markets will also need to be adapted for two-way electricity flow and to provide essential power system assets and services with more than 10,000 km of new transmission required to connect geographically and technologically diverse, low-cost generation and firming with the consumers who rely on it.
Westerman said the changes anticipated in the draft plan would deliver “secure, reliable and affordable electricity” while also reducing emissions, but warned there would need to be a co-operative approach.
“It is essential that communities, governments and industry collaborate to meet the aspirations of consumers and the communities that will host new infrastructure,” he said.
AEMO said the enabling the NEM transition is forecast to deliver $29 billion in net market benefits, returning 2.5 times the investment value.

Clean Energy Council (CEC) chief executive officer Kane Thornton said it was apparent that significant investment will be required to make the transition happen safely and smoothly.
“Already, we have seen the most ambitious, aggressive forecasts from the previous ISP becoming the base case. It’s happening now, and it’s happening fast,” he said. “So, this is not about what we might achieve by 2050. The focus needs to be very much on what needs to be done this decade.
“This Draft 2022 ISP is a call to arms that we must leave no stone unturned in getting the renewable energy transition done right and getting it done fast.”
The ISP is published biennially but AEMO said over the past four years the NEM’s transformation has outpaced this cycle.
AEMO said VRE and rooftop PV development is accelerating faster than assumed likely in the previous ISP, and new technology and business models are driving consumer adoption faster than anticipated.
In the past two years, despite the challenges triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, VRE development has accelerated with 40% more large-scale renewable now committed or anticipated to be connected to the grid by 2023-24 than was forecast in the 2020 ISP.
By May 2021, a surge of renewable generation set a record, delivering 57% of the total generation in the NEM for one trading interval. That record rose twice in September 2021, first to 59% and then again to 61%. AEMO now forecasts periods of 100% renewable generation in some periods as early as 2025, across the NEM rather than in significant parts of it.
Modelling for the Draft ISP forecasts that this rate of transformation will continue to accelerate, with state and federal governments announcing significant new policies to support a lower emissions power system.
AEMO’s final plan is expected in June with the market operator planning further consultation “to ensure the final version provides appropriate signals for investment”.
“Without meaningful community consultation, projects will be delayed and become more expensive. Efficient delivery is also critical,” Westerman said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/10/swiss-trader-plans-750-million-green-hydrogen-plant-in-south-australia/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Swiss trader plans $750 million green hydrogen plant in South Australia,"The world’s largest private metals trader Trafigura has teamed with metals manufacturer Nyrstar to progress plans to construct a commercial-scale green hydrogen manufacturing facility capable of producing 100 tonnes of green hydrogen per day in South Australia to target both domestic and export markets.
Trafigura said the project is to be developed in a phased manner with an 85 MW electrolyser to be installed in the first stage. It is expected it would produce about 20 tonnes per day of green hydrogen which would be converted to ammonia for export and use by shipping, domestic transport and supporting the proposed Port Pirie Industrial Precinct.
The second stage would deliver a 440 MW electrolyser which at full capacity would be capable of producing 100 tonnes of green hydrogen per day, enabling it to meet both export and domestic supply needs.
Nystar, which operates the lead and zinc smelter at Port Pirie, would use the oxygen produced from the electrolyser process in its smelting operations.
Trafigura announced this week that a $5 million Front End Engineering Design study for the Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project would commence immediately. The engineering will be jointly funded by Trafigura and the South Australia Government.
A final investment decision on the Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project will be made by the end of 2022 and if approved, construction of the facility will commence in 2023.
Dale Webb, vice-president of Nyrstar’s Australian operations, said the project will be powered entirely by renewable energy, helping to decarbonising the existing smelter’s power supply and improving the operation’s competitiveness in the international market.
“As a leading multi-metals manufacturer, producing and recycling vital metals required for the energy transition, Nyrstar Australia needs to remain competitive on the global stage, on cost and in terms of carbon intensity,” he said.
“The Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project will meet this challenge head on by delivering renewable energy and oxygen to prove that we can decarbonise a heavy industrial facility and at the same time ensure more efficient and cost-effective production of low carbon metals for the world.
“This will create a positive differentiator for our products with international customers, and help underpin a stronger, more secure, more sustainable future for Nyrstar Australia.”

Trafigura Australia general manager Tim Rogers said the project will form the cornerstone of a new green hydrogen precinct in Port Pirie and created a unique opportunity for businesses in the wider Spencer Gulf region to participate in the growth of a new energy industry.
“The Port Pirie Green Hydrogen Project has the potential to be a catalyst for new jobs and economic growth in the region,” he said.
“We are expecting significant early interest in becoming a part of the green hydrogen precinct with early potential for the region’s heavy vehicle transport industry to investigate hydrogen refuelling options. In time, it is also expected that Trafigura will be working with mining and other energy-intensive industries across the state to explore the opportunities the precinct creates for them to decarbonise through the use of green hydrogen.”
South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said the government’s vision is for the project to be part of a renewable energy industrial precinct in the Spencer Gulf – incorporating Port Pirie, Port Augusta and Whyalla.
“This $750 million project is part of the ongoing transformation of South Australia into a producer of green hydrogen of global significance based on our outstanding renewable energy resources,” he said.
The project joins a list of hydrogen projects in the state, including H2U’s Eyre Peninsula Gateway project, and Australia’s largest operating green hydrogen facility, AGIG’s 1.25 MW facility at Tonsley which is blending hydrogen into the existing gas network in nearby Mitchell Park.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/10/enel-x-unveils-first-australian-battery-storage-project/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Enel X unveils first Australian battery storage project,"Enel X, the innovations spinoff of Italian energy utility Enel, said it has agreed to finance, manage and optimise more than 8 MW of battery energy storage systems (BESS) across Central Irrigation Trust (CIT) water irrigation sites in South Australia’s Riverland region.
The first stage of the project will see BESS with 4.4 MW of combined power output and 7.4 MWh of energy capacity installed across four CIT sites in the first half of 2022.
Enel X, which operates Australia’s largest Virtual Power Plant (VPP) with more than 350 MW under management, said it will own and operate the battery systems and share the electricity cost reduction benefits with the irrigation trust. Central to this proposition will be Enel X’s Distributed Energy Resources Optimisation Software (DER.OS).
DER.OS uses machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyse data sets that include the sites’ energy demand, weather forecast inputs and electricity grid conditions.
Jeff Renaud, head of Enel X Asia and Oceania, said the platform then optimises the BESS’ charging and discharging strategy, reducing the demand charges the customer is levied for its use of peak-time electricity.
It can also play into various revenue-generating market opportunities, including integration with Enel X’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform to access demand response programs which support the grid and allow CIT, which pumps water from the River Murray to an estimated 1,600 growers who irrigate about 14,000 hectares of crops in the Riverland region, to reduce its energy costs.
Renaud said the BESS project demonstrates the viability of large, distributed batteries hosted on commercial and industrial (C&I) sites and will “intelligently manage the Trust’s energy use”.
“Our customised, turnkey solution will help CIT optimise its energy usage and costs, allowing the sites to run more efficiently while increasing resiliency,” he said. “Our DER.OS platform will allow the batteries to ‘value stack’ across our demand response programs including energy market arbitrage, frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), and access the upcoming wholesale demand response mechanism (DRM).”
CIT chief executive officer Greg McCarron said the project, described by Enel X as Australia’s biggest C&I energy storage system, would reduce the organisation’s energy costs and help it achieve its sustainability goals.
“The BESS will allow us to significantly lower our carbon footprint while supporting the grid, the community and our customers, at no cost to us,” he said. “This will contribute to the reliability of the energy system, enable more renewables, help avoid power outages, and reduce our energy expense.”
Enel X, which has been operating in the Australian C&I energy market since 2011, said it plans to expand its BESS offering as it looks to broaden its participation in the market.

In October, Enel X became the first registered provider for Australia’s new DRM, which for the first time gave organisations the capacity to trade their flexible electricity loads on the wholesale electricity market.
Assets including Enel X’s VPP will be aggregated to allow the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to better manage supply and demand on the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Earlier this month, parent company Enel Group launched a ‘green energy retailer’ business after receiving approval from the Australian Energy Regulator (AER). Initially serving C&I customers, the retail operation will combine Enel X’s technology platforms, including its VPP, behind-the-meter battery storage assets and electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions with clean energy division Enel Green Power’s renewable energy generation assets.
Enel Green Power currently holds 310 MW of combined generation capacity through three solar plants, including Bungala One and Two, which together have a capacity of 275 MW, as well as the 34 MW Cohuna Solar Farm in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/10/tesla-signs-offtake-deal-with-genex-for-bouldercombe-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 10, 2021",Tesla signs offtake deal with Genex for Bouldercombe battery,"Sydney-based developer Genex Power has struck a deal with the Australian arm of United States-based electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla that will provide a minimum amount of contracted revenue for the Bouldercombe Battery Project (BBP).
The two-hour-duration BBP, which will feature Tesla’s Megapack technology integrated with the company’s Autobidder machine learning program for automated energy trading, will be built on land leased from transmission provider Powerlink beside its Bouldercombe substation, 20 kilometres south of Rockhampton.
The offtake agreement announced on Thursday ensures a minimum amount of contracted revenue that will enable Genex to secure financing for the large-scale battery energy storage system, while retaining the ability to capture revenue upside beyond a fixed guaranteed amount.
Genex said the deal provides a fixed and floating revenue share structure that extends cash flow certainty to project lenders and allows the company to retain upside revenue exposure to merchant cash flows from the energy arbitrage and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) markets.
Genex chief executive officer James Harding said the integration of Tesla Megapack and revenue support arrangements via Autobidder would help streamline the development, construction and operations phases of the project.
“The unique integration of Tesla’s Megapack battery technology and a revenue sharing arrangement utilising Autobidder will reduce the complexity of the project,” he said.
“Importantly the structure of the agreement provides a minimum level of contracted revenues to support project funding, while allowing Genex to retain significant merchant upside.”
Under the offtake agreement, Tesla will operate the project using its proprietary algorithm-based bidding system, Autobidder. At the completion of the eight-year deal, Genex will enter into a license agreement with Tesla to operate Autobidder on the project.

Already deployed on more than 1 GWh of projects globally, including the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, Autobidder is a real-time trading and control platform that uses a machine-learning algorithm to reportedly optimise dispatch behaviour while adapting to new markets and services. It is hoped it will maximise the revenue of the project.
“The agreement … represents a key milestone for the project as we move forward to financial close,” Harding said.
The offtake agreement comes after Genex signed a supply agreement in October that will see Tesla provide the project with 40 Tesla Megapacks, an all-in-one utility-scale energy storage system.
Bouldcercombe is Genex’s first battery investment. The developer is also  building the 250 MW/2000 MWh Kidston Pumped Hydro Project in north Queensland, and operates the 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm and the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Farm in New South Wales.
The Bouldercombe battery is expected to commence operation in early 2023.

Chinese polysilicon manufacturer Daqo New Energy has announced the start of pilot production at its 35,000-tonne-per-year ‘phase 4B’ polysilicon fab.
The company on Monday announced the production lines had been constructed ahead of schedule and had begun producing poly.
Daqo said the plant would be ramped up to full output by the end of March, at which point the manufacturer would have a total annual poly production capacity of 105,000 metric tonnes.
The company did not specify where the new production lines have been developed but Daqo’s main production facility is in Shihezi, in Xinjiang province and the previous, Phase 3B expansion in capacity took place in Xinjiang.
Despite talk of a future glut of polysilicon production facilities, Daqo CEO Longgen Zhang reiterated the company’s plan to have 270,000 tonnes of annual poly capacity in 2024, and said the new facilities would “be market-ready for” the production of higher-efficiency n-type solar modules.
Quoted in a Daqo press release published on Monday on the Cision PR platform, Zhang said: “With the rising prices of fossil fuels, solar PV is becoming more competitive and its economic value is being increasingly recognised by the market, as reflected by the increased prices of solar products this year, a rare occurrence in … solar PV history.
“We believe we are just at the beginning of a new era in which solar PV will play an increasingly critical role as one of the cleanest, most sustainable, and most cost-effective sources of energy. We expect to see accelerating growth in solar demand in the foreseeable future.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/10/new-solution-to-store-residential-commercial-pv-electricity-as-green-hydrogen/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"DECEMBER 10, 2021","New solution to store residential, commercial PV electricity as green hydrogen","From pv magazine Germany
Home Power Solutions (HPS), a German residential hydrogen storage system manufacturer, has expanded its product range to include a new hydrogen storage solution for commercial properties and apartment buildings.
Its new Förster solution features a control and energy management unit that can interconnect up to 10 of the company’s hydrogen-based storage Picea systems. In this way, a cumulative electrical storage capacity of 15,000 kWh can be achieved.
The Picea system stores excess electricity from rooftop PV systems in the form of green hydrogen. In addition to an electrolyser and the fuel cell, the system also includes a 20 kWh battery for short-term storage. Waste heat is also used, if necessary. According to the manufacturer, the system cannot cover the power supply all year round, but it is able to reduce heating costs.
The development of the Förster control unit opens up the possibility for new customers to be supplied year-round with solar power from their own rooftops. But it also enables the manufacturer to better benefit from economies of scale in the production of storage systems in the future. The systems can easily be cascaded and different customer requirements can be met by interconnecting identical systems. In this way, the manufacturing processes can be standardised.

“With Multi-Picea we have responded to great demand and developed a solution that offers higher storage capacities and performance in the building sector,” said HPS Managing Director Zeyad Abul-Ellla. “In commercial real estate and multi-family houses, consumers are able to use their solar power fully, even in winter, thanks to the flexible scaling of our tested year-round electricity storage system.”
The name “Förster,” which means “forester” in German, is derived from the name of the storage system. Picea is the Latin term for spruce and a Picea system saves three tons of CO2 a year, or as much as 130 spruce trees. As the control unit is able to manage up to 10 Picea at the same time, it takes care of an entire “forest,” so to speak.
The first Förster unit is already in operation. The headquarters of Josef Küpper Söhne GmbH near Bonn, Germany, is the first commercial property in the country to host the hydrogen storage system. The electricity for it comes from a 98 kW solar array spanning the rooftop and on the building’s facade.
“We pursue an independent and clean energy supply for our customers and ourselves, because the time is ripe for the entry into a CO2-free society,” said Josef Küpper Söhne Managing Director Peter Küpper. “That is why we decided in favor of the Multi-Picea long-term storage system from HPS when designing the new company location.”
