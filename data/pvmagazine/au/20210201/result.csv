Since launching in May 2019, OpenSolar’s digital toolkit for generating professional, installer-branded quotes that detail solar system size, optimal orientation and design, and savings on current bills, has attracted 3,500 industry users.
Damien Zwiersen a director for the SEM Group of solar installers was involved in beta testing of the app with his two teams of installers in South Australia, and says OpenSolar has acted on his suggestion that having a loans facility would further enhance the utility of the app for industry operators.
“We’re not here to sell the finance,” Zwiersen told pv magazine Australia, “We’re here to sell solar.”
Until today, he says solar installers were frequently required to transfer customer and quote details to a finance portal in order to smooth the path for clients who wanted or needed a loan to complete their solar purchase. 
Integration of Plenti services, means the OpenSolar app now generates loan terms based on the system options provided by installers: “The customer gets the quote, selects which solar system they want to look at in detail, whether it’s, say, 6.6 kW or 10.56 kW and then they can click for terms, whether that’s an upfront payment, or various finance options,”  explains Zwiersen.

Loan terms and repayments are shown in the context of savings the customer will make on their energy bills by reducing their reliance on the grid, and they can click through to the Plenti portal if they want to proceed with a loan application.
Louis Edwards, Head of Renewable Energy Finance at Plenti, said in a statement today, “This partnership goes a long way to removing the barriers many Aussie families have with investing in green energy for their home.”
That is, it provides all the data they need to make an informed decision.
In January this year Plenti reported that 2020 fourth-quarter lending for renewable energy systems (commercial and residential) was up 19% on the previous quarter, indicating strong demand for PV and for financing.
The fintech’s renewable lending business has funded more than 11,000 loans for solar-power purchases since its inception at the end of 2014.
Plenti is also a delivery partner for the South Australian government’s $100 million battery scheme, and is working with the NSW Government on its Empowering Homes Program, which provides zero interest loans of up to $14,000 for households to install rooftop solar and battery storage. 
The OpenSolar platform works with several partners to deliver on its promise of streamlining solar rollout, including premium solar panel, battery and inverter manufacturers; Solar Outlet online wholesaler; Solar Analytics  advanced solar metering equipment, and NearMap, which provides current and historical aerial imagery to assist in designing and visualising solar systems for clients.
One of the first capabilities to be integrated with the OpenSolar app, NearMap allows solar installers to provide customers with clear bird’s-eye and oblique views of their rooftop and surrounding shade, incorporating superimposed representations of an optimised solar array, or more than one option.
This “prospecting” tool, allows installers to generate quotes, supported with visuals, from a smartphone, tablet or internet-connected laptop, or from home without even visiting a client’s site — a bonus when working through Covid-19 restrictions.
“It definitely saves us time,” says Zwiersen, who is about to roll out OpenSolar to SEM solar teams in Queensland and the Northern Territory. 
He adds, “It’s very quick to do panel arrays. We use the free imagery software before it goes across to the customer. It keeps costs down.”
The shared goal of all OpenSolar participants is to accelerate the uptake of rooftop solar, by supporting the solar industry and reliably informing consumers.
Zwiersen says the Plenti integration with OpenSolar represents “one less thing for sales reps to be worried about”, allowing them to focus more on the customer and perhaps “close a couple more deals because they have more time”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/01/victorian-government-aims-to-claim-the-worlds-first-carbon-neutral-dairy-farm/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"FEBRUARY 1, 2021",Victorian Government aims to claim the world’s first carbon-neutral dairy farm,"If Ellinbank SmartFarm in Gippsland weren’t a research and demonstration facility, it might just install a 400 kW rooftop solar system to reduce its costs and carbon footprint, and achieve the shortest period to payback on investment.
As it is, the long-established agricultural research facility will demonstrate the use cases of no fewer than three solar systems, and deploy wind energy and electricity generated through biodigestion of manure, as part of its mission to help farmers access and understand the benefits of renewables, and at the same time become what may be the world’s first carbon-neutral dairy farm within the next five years.
Around 70% of the carbon emissions of dairy farms are in the form of enteric methane produced by cows as they go about their ruminant way of digesting cellulose.
Professor Joe Jacobs, Research Director with the Victorian Government Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, estimates that Ellinbank, with its herd of 450-500 milkers, emits the equivalent of just over 2,600 tonnes of CO2 a year, with enteric methane, energy use and manure generating the vast majority of that output.
“We know we can never completely eliminate methane from dairy farming,” he tells pv magazine Australia, “but solar energy offers us the ability to head towards a net-zero emissions target.”
The infrastructure required to make Ellinbank carbon neutral is partly funded through the Victorian Government’s Smarter, Safer Farms initiative.
And the farm will this year become the base of the Agriculture Energy Demonstration and Education program, which is supported via the state Labor Government’s $30 million Agriculture Energy Investment plan, and aims to help farmers increase energy efficiencies and reduce energy costs.
“Farmers are generally some of the most innovative people around,” says Jacobs. “What I think we can do,” he continues, “is demonstrate different technologies so they can identify the potential fit for their farm.”
Ellinbank last year installed a 98 kW solar system on the roof of its dairy shed, coupled with a 100 kWh battery.
Jacobs estimates that this system provides 20-25% of the farm’s energy needs.
Just as commercial and residential building owners are advised to implement efficiency measures before installing renewable energy systems, Ellinbank sought to reduce its energy use before laying on the solar. 
For example, it upgraded the chiller system used to cool the milk on its journey from cows — that have a body temperature of 38-39 degrees Celsius — to the storage vat, where it must be held at 4 degrees.
“Many older dairy systems have the milk arriving at the vat at a high temperature, where it requires a lot of excess energy to chill that volume of milk,” says Jacobs. Ellinbank’s new system more effectively reduces milk temperature en route, so that it’s almost at 4 degrees by the time it reaches the vat.
Ellinbank will also demonstrate the use of a solar array and battery (capacities are yet to be calculated) to power its water treatment plant.
The farm and research institute are not on mains water, but use water from a spring-fed dam to serve both animals and human needs on the combined properties: water is pumped to the highest point on the farm before being treated and flowing down under gravity to provide a clean, pressurised supply.
In addition to its battery supported solar arrays, Ellinbank will demonstrate a solar-powered pumped hydro system using the farm’s naturally undulating topography.
With storage tanks already on hill tops, Jacobs says, “We’re looking to utilise one of those falls to run a small pumped hydro system.”
And a wind turbine or two will soon capture the Gippsland breeze to demonstrate the costs and returns to farmers of wind energy.
Jacobs says that some generation and storage options may be on the verge of viability for farmers, but in seeing how they can be integrated with new farming efficiency methods, businesses can plan such investments for the near future. 
To fulfill its own aspirations for carbon neutrality, Ellinbank will seek to reduce methane emissions by trialling different pasture treatments; adjusting livestock feed mixes and systems of feed delivery; processing manure to capture methane as biogas for energy generation; and use solar PV to generate more clean energy than it needs, to offset its remaining methane emissions.
“We have plenty of scope to increase the solar capacity on the farm,” says Jacobs. Excess energy could feed into the grid or potentially power the offices of the onsite Ellinbank Dairy Research Institute. 
As a demonstration facility, this SmartFarm will offer farmers a broad spectrum of renewable energy systems that may suit the topography or business case of their own agricultural properties and processes. 
When launching the joint funding initiatives for Ellinbank, Victoria’s Minister for Agriculture, Mary-Anne Thomas, said “An important part of the work being done here is making it accessible to industry so that knowledge can immediately be put to use.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/01/australian-wide-network-of-13-clusters-to-spur-hydrogen-economy-established/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 1, 2021",Australian-wide network of 13 clusters to spur hydrogen economy established,"Australia is keen to corner the hydrogen market. As a nation Australia has excessive natural resources of wind and solar that will generate the green hydrogen set to become the fuel of the century. Australia also has the non-renewable resources which can generate hydrogen of the grey and blue variety, however, the sheer cost advantage of solar and wind is expected to out-compete grey and blue hydrogen by as soon as 2030.
This is why Goldman Sachs has called green hydrogen a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” and estimated that green hydrogen alone (not including grey and blue) “could give rise to a €10 trillion addressable market globally by 2050 for the utilities industry alone.”
So it is no surprise that National Energy Resources Australia (NERA), an industry-led not-for-profit organisation set up in 2015 as part of the federal government’s Industry Growth Centre initiative, is investing in an Australian-wide network of regional hydrogen technology clusters. According to a statement from NERA: “Technology Clusters are geographic concentrations of interconnected businesses and organisations in a particular field, that both collaborate and compete to increase productivity and innovation.”
NERA is investing an initial $1.75 million in 13 clusters of industry experts, universities, energy companies, renewables hubs and development committees across all states and territories that will work together to establish Australia’s global identity in the hydrogen economy and foster billions of dollars in growth.
According to the 2019 National Hydrogen Strategy: “A key element of Australia’s approach will be to create hydrogen hubs – clusters of large-scale demand.”
Combined, the various regional clusters form a national cluster that will operate as a virtual network spearheaded by NERA. The goal of the network is to establish Australian hydrogen technology and expertise as a recognised global brand. Which is to say that the goal is to establish as a global norm that if you want to know about hydrogen, look to Australia.
Moreover, these hydrogen clusters will also help in the development of hydrogen supply chains, deployment, identify developmental missteps, and the commercialisation of new hydrogen tech.
NERA CEO Miranda Taylor said that these 13 regional clusters are a crucial step in building the skills, capacities, and commercialisation opportunities necessary to unlock Australia’s enormous potential to create a globally competitive hydrogen industry that, according to a 2019 Deloitte report, could increase Australia’s GDP up to $26 billion.
“Today marks a great step forward in Australia’s capability in developing hydrogen technologies,” said Taylor. “These regional clusters, all of which have the support of their state and territory governments, have been established around key, existing hydrogen projects and technology supply chains in strategic locations that have a demonstrated capacity to support them.”
The announcement is a direct result of action accorded in the National Hydrogen Strategy which instructed NERA to “support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to take advantage of opportunities in the hydrogen industry by forming an industry-led hydrogen cluster…This will maximise economic benefits by ensuring Australian companies are well placed to supply new technology, products and services to Australia’s hydrogen industry and export markets.”
According to Taylor this national cluster “will ensure long-term local cohesion and sustainable capability across the emerging hydrogen value chain.”
The clusters are as follows:

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/01/new-data-sunny-outlook-modified-and-coal-as-australias-transition-fuel/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"FEBRUARY 1, 2021","New data: Sunny outlook modified, and coal as Australia’s transition fuel?","Australia’s energy transition is a complex, heaving beast. Predictions about the role and performance of renewable energy are rightly sunny, but we can’t always foresee how the beast, when seared by solar, or poked by wind turbines, or reined in by market conditions, will behave in the short to medium term. Analysis of the recent past lets the industry recalibrate, adjust expectations, and correct without over-correcting on the road to a renewable National Electricity Market (NEM).
Global-Roam and Greenview Strategic Consulting’s Generator Statistical Digest (GSD2020) is today available in its second annual iteration — an update to the benchmark Generator Report Card 2018.
According primarily to daily data made available by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), it shows how different generators performed in the NEM in 2020, and up to 10 years previously — depending how long they’ve been in operation.
The GSD2020, a trove of information that also correlates data from the Bureau of Meteorology and other sources, can be downloaded for a fee, but energy market analysts also publish insights from the data on Global-Roam’s industry-facing website, WattClarity.
For them, last year’s data highlighted at least two important contradictions:
Last year was the biggest yet for utility-scale variable renewable energy (VRE), with around 3.5 GW of new renewable projects added to the NEM, which, writes ITK power market analyst Ben Willacy, boosted fully operational renewable capacity over the 10 GW mark.
The GSD2020 allows comparison of each generator’s annual average capacity factor — the amount of energy produced as a percentage of its full-capacity potential if it were to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year — with its actual output. 
So it’s never going to be 100%, but when Global-Roam published the Generator Report Card 2018, Willacy made informed assumptions of a solar capacity factor of around 30% for Queensland and 26-28% in other states.
“It’s clear this hasn’t happened,” he writes, citing GSD2020 data on Edify’s Whitsunday Solar Farm near Collinsville in North Queensland, which produced 110,000 MWh from 56 MW capacity in 2020 — a capacity factor of a mere 22%.
Image: Global Roam and Greenview Strategic Consulting
Overall, Willacy calculates from the data that solar farms in the NEM achieved an average 23% capacity factor in 2020.
Given that Queensland has around 1.5 GW of fully operational utility-scale solar, the 7% loss on an expected 30% capacity factor equals almost 1 TWh per year, or the equivalent of a 450 MW solar project.
“That’s an entire Western Downs Solar Farm that’s gone missing,” he writes.
Remarkably, this puts the federal Renewable Energy Target — which pundits were sure would be shoo in given the capacity installed in 2020 — in a tight spot!
Willacy says there are a variety of reasons for the shortfall on expectations. He posits that two of the main culprits are curtailment: that’s economic curtailment, self imposed by generators when the market price for energy drops below zero; and restrictions on output imposed by AEMO in response to technical constraints of the grid.
“We expect system constraints to ease over time, as transmission investments are made,” he writes, “But economic curtailment may become more prevalent as the number of negative price intervals increases, at least over the near term.”
Although widespread integration of storage assets is likely to “help with both issues”, says Willacy, solar will continue to be disproportionately affected by negative pricing.
He believes the renewables industry “may need to stick with a more conservative set of capacity factor assumptions”, until the storage cavalry arrives, with its ability to distribute generation over the energy demands of any day day. 
Solar farms that bucked the lower-than-expected output trend: Kidston solar farm in Queensland hit the mark with a 30% capacity factor; and in New South Wales, Griffith and Parkes Solar Farms, among Neoen’s first developments in Australia, scored 29% and 28% respectively. 
There’s nothing like data for exposing truth, and ambiguities. Although crystal ballers around the year 2000 revved up gas as a “transition fuel”, and Prime Minister Morrison has more recently also hit the gas with support for the industry and statements such as, “there is no credible energy transition plan for an economy like Australia that does not involve the greater use of gas …” GSD2020 shows that investments in gas generation may have peaked too early.
On WattClarity independent energy markets consultant Allan O’Neil analyses the generation over time of seven gas-powered generators located across the NEM states, focusing on those using the more efficient combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT), and excluding open-cycle gas turbines.
Although three quarters of the 5.7 GW of gas fuelled generation commissioned in the NEM since 2007 has been the less efficient open-cycle technology, CCGT “was the technology principally expected to mitigate emissions under that early view of the energy transition” writes O’Neil, and as such warrants a closer look.
The trend has been for most of those power stations — Darling Downs and Swanbank in Queensland, Tallawarra in NSW, Newport (the closest thing Victoria has to CCGT generation), and Torrens Island B in Adelaide — to become much less consistent in their running schedules, showing lower utilisation over the past five or six years as renewable generation increased its penetration of the NEM. 
Image: Global Roam and Greenview Strategic Consulting
Changes in overall NEM generation output show that since 2015 annual brown coal generation has significantly decreased, while black coal generation has barely changed, renewables have shown a leap in contribution with solar up 262% (more than half of which is attributable to small-scale rooftop generation) and wind is up 95.2%. But natural gas generation has declined by more than 27%. 

In short, although output lost from brown-coal-fuelled power stations has been more than replaced by renewables, gas has made no indent in black coal.
Writes O’Neil, “This probably isn’t the outcome expected by participants who invested in new gas-fired stations from the early 2000s onwards, expecting to benefit from gas’s ‘transition fuel’ status.”
He pins the blame for depressed utilisation of gas-fired stations on the sharp rise in natural gas prices from mid 2016, and says, “In the absence of any emissions pricing mechanism, coal-fired stations maintain a significant short-run cost advantage over gas.”
Although gas-fired reserve will continue to be called on to generate at peak times in a grid increasingly powered by renewables; and if coal-fired stations are retired ahead of schedule, gas may be expected to step up, O’Neil concludes, “It’s very hard to foresee a scenario where gas replaces coal as the NEM’s ‘workhorse’ primary energy source.”
The market will continue to steer this aspect of the transition, with gas tending to be squeezed out of the dispatch stack when renewable output runs high or demand for grid energy slumps.
In the meantime, many more analysts will mine the Generator Statistical Digest 2020 for insights and corrections. Watch this information ecosystem.
