On Thursday, Professor Andrew Macintosh, chair of the Integrity Committee of the Emissions Reduction Fund for six-and-a-half years until 2020, and Associate Dean at the Australian National University’s (ANU) College of Law, called the fund and the carbon credits generated within a “fraud.”
“The available data suggests 70 to 80% of the ACCUs issued to these projects are devoid of integrity – they do not represent real and additional abatement,” Professor Macintosh said.
“Unfortunately, Australia’s carbon market currently suffers from a distinct lack of environmental integrity. All of the major emission reduction methods have serious integrity issues, either in their design or the way they are being administered,” he added.
The revelation prompted federal Greens leader, MP Adam Bandt, to refer the allegations to Australia’s Auditor General, calling for an independent inquiry into the claims.
“When the former head of the government’s Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee reveals that the carbon credits scheme is ‘largely a scam’, we need an open transparent inquiry with powers to get to the bottom of it,” Bandt said.
“This is a critical issue. Both the Morrison Government and Labor are claiming to take climate seriously while planning to open up 114 new coal and gas projects, relying on permits and offsets to cover up their duplicity. If carbon credits are fraudulent too, then Australia will definitely blow its climate targets.”
Among this chorus, thinktank the Australia Institute has also published findings from Freedom of Information documents this week. It says the documents show that when designing the Emissions Reduction Fund, which includes come carbon capture and storage methods among its 38 project “methods” or types, the Commonwealth’s Clean Energy Regulator consulted “almost exclusively” with fossil fuel companies and big emitters.
In a statement, the federal energy and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylors defended the scheme, implying the Australia Institute’s report was politically motivated, and questioning why Andrew Macintosh had not raised the alarm while he was chairing the fund’s integrity commission. 
This is all unfolding on the backdrop of Australia’s carbon credit units (ACCU) prices plunging, following Taylor’s announcement he would give carbon credit creators the option of stepping away from their government contracts on March 4. 
Core Markets
On Wednesday, 15 of the most significant carbon market participants sent an open letter to Taylor calling for a deferral of changes to the fund until midyear. It said Taylor’s announcement was made “without consultation or warning” to industry.
The signatories are calling for changes – like the release clause option to be deferred until July 1 so land managers and the wider carbon farming industry can properly prepare. “There’s quite a lot of administration for this process to be done properly and for people to make informed decisions about whether they should deliver to the government or choose to sell,” Climate Friendly CEO Skye Glenday told pv magazine Australia.
“Right now, there’s a live exit window with no actual operational rules,” she added. “That’s just creating a lot of uncertainly for all participants.”
By putting the voluntary carbon credit market into free fall, Glenday said the minister’s decision had disincentivised new carbon abatement projects. Australia is home to around 77,000 agricultural properties, but the scheme has only 890 projects land sector projects – not even reaching 1% of those landholders.
The market prices being collected for these projects will certainly not be helped by the accusation that the majority of the abatement projects are not scientifically credible. Climate Friendly says the six methods of projects with which it works are science based.
Compounding this, is the potential flooding of the market of carbon credits should project owners opt to take up Taylor’s option of stepping away from their government contracts.
Last year, for instance, the federal government purchased around 12 million tonnes of carbon abatement. This could theoretically now enter the voluntary market, even though the Clean Energy Regulator’s quarterly report released last Friday posited that there is only demand in the voluntary market for about one million tonnes of abatement projects.
Earlier this week, research company RepuTex released analysis saying the minister’s decision could increase the number of carbon credits on the voluntary market by 7 million during the June quarter alone, and by as many as 112 million by 2033.
Such numbers would near guarantee the price of carbon credits would remain suppressed in Australia, with RepuTex executive director saying the market now had a “mountain of supply to overcome.”
Low prices for ACCUs are primarily (perhaps solely) beneficial for big emitters, because it gives them access to cheap, abundant supply of carbon credits with which they can use to “offset” their emissions. 
Higher prices on ACCUs, on the other hard, would be beneficial to carbon farmers, and also makes carbon farming a more attractive option in Australia.
Taylor has said the contract release clause will stimulate more abatement projects, though it remains unclear why an oversupply would stimulate a surge in demand when economically the mechanism is used to drive down prices. 
“One of our suggestions was that they only release a portion of the contracts that is aligned with the demand in the marketplace based on analytics,” Glenday said.
According to the public carbon abatement register, around half of the government’s contracts from land sector carbon abatement projects are held by large aggregators like Greencollar and AgriProve, both of which have signalled support for Taylor’s decision. 
The other half are held directly by landowners, with whom Climate Friendly says it works to support their land sector projects. 
Part of the issue is that while landholders have contracts with the government, they often only sell some of the resulting ACCUs to it, opting to save a portion to sell on the voluntary market. So for many of these landholders, they would have been better off under that route – delivering some to the government at, say, a fixed price of $12 an ACCU, and then collecting a higher voluntary carbon price for the remaining ACCUs.
Before Taylor announced the changes, ACCUs were worth $50. Since March 4, ACCUs have lost almost half of their value, with prices now sitting around $30.
On Wednesday, Wood Mackenzie said the global prices of carbon needed to rise seven fold to properly facilitate and incentivise low emissions technology development and adoption. It expects the “global carbon price to rise seven-fold from an average of US$25 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent today to US$175/t CO2e by 2050 in developed economies and US$127/t CO2e in emerging economies.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/25/rise-of-the-machines-the-increasing-role-of-auto-bidding-and-self-forecasting-in-the-modern-day-nem/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 25, 2022",Rise of the Machines – the increasing role of auto-bidding and self-forecasting in the modern-day NEM,"In the past three years, we have seen the number of auto-bidding deployments move from the coal-gas fired generation space (where it was predominately used for FCAS/Energy optimisation) to BESS and now wind/solar, to help mitigate a range of increasingly complex operational challenges such as low price, high raise FCAS prices and constraint conditions.
Having been around long enough, the genesis of the self-forecasting project run by AEMO and ARENA was seen as a great step forward for the industry, as we firmly believed the power station SCADA systems should have better information than a generic, albeit tuned, algorithm of AEMO for each specific wind site.  This has certainly been the case in most cases, with improved accuracy of wind farm dispatch forecasts occurring much of the time.
The part that concerns us though is what appears to be purposeful deviations being added by some solar and wind self-forecasting solutions, to help achieve ‘net zero’ Causer Pays Factors (CPF) for their clients.  As mentioned several times here on WattClarity:
This has created a significant incentive to get the dispatch bidding and self-forecasting right.
AEMO is expecting all generation, not just wind and solar, to transition from each dispatch target in a linear fashion, to ensure all elements in the power system transition in a similarly controlled and steady fashion.
In order to measure this deviation every four seconds, the NEM has the CPF methodology:
Since the NEM is rich in high fidelity 4sec frequency and generation data, perhaps the data scientists saw an opportunity to predict, with reasonable certainty, when frequency was going to be high (and low).
Of course, the final key elements of the 5-min dispatch target that the linear trajectory is based upon are:
For wind and solar units (i.e. given most are bid below $0/MWh and often down at -$1,000/MWh), whatever the availability bid is for a site will generally determine the dispatch target.  For instance, if a site has all MW’s in Price Band 2 at -$80/MWh when the RRP is around $50/MWh, and the availability is 78MW, the unit will receive a dispatch target of 78MW and be asked to linearly ramp to that target from wherever it is at the start of the dispatch interval.
However, for Semi-Scheduled units alone (this does not apply to Scheduled units), if a self-forecast has passed AEMO’s Assessment Procedure, it effectively becomes the source of that Availability figure for each Dispatch Interval for the site.  This has resulted in improvements in accuracy compared to AWEFS (and ASEFS for solar), but it has also appears to have introduced a new outcome that was not expected: purposeful over and under forecasting.
Using the predicted frequency response (particularly in the morning and afternoon periods when 8000MW rooftop PV is ramping in or out), it appears that:
Step 1 = some self-forecasting algorithms are now predicting when frequency is likely to be high or low,
Step 2 = then adding a positive or negative offset, to create a positive deviation (on a Causer Pays Factor basis) to offset the cumulative negative deviations that have historically occurred.
Therefore, accurate forecasting goes out the window at times because the offsets are added – with the intention apparently being to improve the site’s Causer Pays Factor.
There may also be further implications under Semi Dispatch Cap (SDC) conditions, where these under-forecasts would lead to a situation whereby output could be ‘constrained down’ lower than might otherwise be the case – representing foregone generation for the site …

Real-World Example: Low frequency without Semi-Dispatch Cap = Over-generation
The above example shows a period when frequency tends to be low (e.g. an afternoon period as rooftop PV decreases and grid demand increases), with what appears to be a purposeful under-forecast in place.
Under these conditions, without a semi-dispatch cap, the CPF methodology indicates the generation is high (while the frequency is low), hence a positive LNEF/RNEF accrues, which contributes to a lower Causer Pays Factor.
This is what appears to be the objective behind the purposeful under-forecasting in situations like this.
Of course, if frequency deviates from the average and is high, then a negative LNEF/RNEF accrues.  This is one of the reasons this method cannot be used all the time and is generally applied across set periods.

Real-World Example: Low frequency with Semi-Dispatch Cap = Lost Generation
However, when a semi-dispatch cap is applied (SDC = 1), AEMO require the unit to run to the under forecast level and the generation will decrease (readers might recall the AEMC Rule Change from March 2021 that clarified these obligations for Semi-Scheduled generators), as is shown in the above example with the red area of lost generation.
It appears that some self-forecasters may be aware of this, and are applying suppression algorithms on their (possibly biased) forecasts, thereby running back to the AWEFS forecast for 1 or 2 (or more) dispatch intervals after detecting this condition.
Another concerning aspect we have seen at times (and not necessarily with our clients), is that generation volume may be lost in this process – and it may also be that some site owners are not being informed this is the case.  Improving the CPF is great, but we strongly suspect there are cases where more generation is being lost (hence revenue decreased) than is being saved by CPF improvements.
So we asked this question at the CEC’s Wind Industry Forum:
Are you aware of any lost revenue due to CPF under forecasting?
As well as the rise of self-forecasting algorithms, we have also seen the widescale deployment of auto-bidding solutions.
We define auto-bidding solutions as autonomous determination and submission of bids, but there are many definitions and capabilities associated with ‘auto-bidding’: no two auto-bidding solutions are the same!
We see some really sophisticated products in the market, and some we might classify more as automatic template submitters.  Each end of the spectrum can be useful, but it is important to understand what they do and what they do not do!

National Electricity Rules Clause 4.9.2(d) and 4.11.3
Autobidding Software is not a person, and therefore despite what some may tell you, just because a site has auto-bidding, it does not satisfy NER clause 4.9.2(d).  This clause requires generators to have appropriate personnel available at all times to respond immediately to dispatch instructions issued by AEMO (be they electronic, written or oral), while clause 4.11.3 requires generators to provide contact details for those personnel.
Similarly, although it again seems silly to have to say this, it is not acceptable to have operations and trading contacts who cannot speak English.  Several Registered Participants appear to be risking non-compliance with overseas control rooms that have a poor grasp of English, presumably to try to save costs.
Here at Overwatch Energy, we are big supporters and enablers of auto-bidding and self forecasting, and the role AI and ML in the trading experience – but it is not Auto-Bidding OR human oversight: it has to be human oversight and auto-bidding.  Not just from a perspective of following the rules, but also for risk mitigation.
There are many conditions that auto-bidding cannot yet correct for, and although things will continue to improve in time, this is likely to be the case for a long time.
One such example (which is quite topical, given the increased latency the market has been experiencing in AEMO’s publication of P5 predispatch data on some occasions) is understanding whether the auto-bid has been submitted with the most correct and complete data set possible within the bidding window before ‘Gate Closure’ in each dispatch interval.  If any rebid (automated or not) has been submitted without considering the latest P5MIN forecasts published by the AEMO, how can it be the best bid possible for that asset?
To use a commercial aviation example, auto-pilot rarely lands and (to the best of my knowledge) never does the take-offs – there are simply too many variables.  And whilst auto-pilot may be good 80-90% of the journey, it is not designed to cover all scenarios, hence why we have two pilots in most modern commercial airlines.
We know this space will continue to change, and we look forward to seeing the enhancements that occur.  We look forward to working with our clients to enhance their deployment of some of the most sophisticated dispatch and trading software in any electricity market in the NEM.
Therefore, when planning your approach to software selection and deployment:
As always, there will still be a need for careful oversight and monitoring of the solutions that are deployed to ensure the most optimal, consistent, and rules-based deployment of the software and hardware solutions.
Even as the software gets smarter, owners and operators need to remember  … there will always be a need for some form of human oversight, even with ‘the rise of the machines’.

The Blind Creek project includes a 300MW solar farm coupled with a battery energy storage system. The solar farm is expected to produce 735,000MWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power more than 124,000 houses per year. The storage capacity has not been revealed, beyond Octopus describing it as “large scale”.
Octopus said in a statement the project is “uniquely positioned on a strong part of the existing transmission network”, about eight kilometres northwest of Bungendore, between the major load centres of Sydney and Canberra.
Octopus Australia head of investment and development Sonia Teitel said the project would make a significant contribution to the NSW energy transition without requiring major transmission works.
“We are very excited as we see this as a huge opportunity in large-scale storage in NSW as we grow our renewables portfolio and continue to support the NSW energy transition,” she said. “We are delighted to work alongside the founders to turn their vision into reality.”

The Blind Creek project has evolved from the Capital Solar Farm which was approved by NSW Planning in 2013. Originally developed by Infigen Energy, it was taken over by a group of local farmers when Infigen’s agreements lapsed. The project has been designed, with technical support
from Stride Renewables, NGH and Axcentium, so solar energy production can co-exist with farming activity which is to continue under and around the panels for the life of the project.
“From the outset our goal was to co-locate renewable energy with regenerative agriculture and carbon sequestration while maintaining sheep production,” project founder and landowner Dominic Osborne said.
“We also had a clear vision of how we wanted to involve our local community in the project. Our relationship with Octopus and the CEFC means our commitment to create a more sustainable future for our family farm and positive outcomes for our community has taken an exciting step forward.”
Monique Miller, executive director of the CEFC, which will contribute up to $5 million in funding to the project, said he Blind Creek development would help fill the gap left by the impending retirement of the state’s biggest coal-fired power stations.
“The development at Blind Creek is a significant opportunity for solar and storage generation between two major load centres and in a state which will see some coal-fired generation retiring in the short term, requiring significant new generation to support security and reliability,” she said.

Octopus, which is joint owner of the 275MW Darlington Point Solar Farm in western NSW, said it will now look to move the Blind Creek project into the next stage of development and accelerate its ultimate delivery.
Octopus entered Australia in 2018 and is currently managing over $1billion of renewable assets domestically. Most notably, this includes being the owner of the 333MWdc Darlington Point Solar Farm, currently the largest solar farm generating into the National Electricity Market and also the 180MW Dulacca Wind Farm in QLD, which is currently under construction
The Blind Creek project is the latest for the Octopus Australia and CEFC joint venture (JV) which was first announced in August 2021 with the two teaming up to develop the proposed 44MW Perry Bridge Solar and the nearby 80MW Fulham Solar Farm in regional Victoria.
Earlier this month the JV announced it was advancing plans for a multibillion-dollar solar, battery storage, wind and potentially green hydrogen project in Victoria’s Gippsland region.

Endeavour said the solar-storage microgrid, which will replace an existing 1MW diesel-fuelled generator, will connect to the main electricity grid, but will be able to operate independently during outages, providing a reliable, renewable and stand-alone power supply during network outages.
The Bawley Point and Kioloa communities are among those that were affected by the Black Summer Bushfires of 2019-20 that devastated much of the state. More than 3,600 properties across NSW were damaged or destroyed during those fires.
Endeavour chief executive Guy Chalkley said the microgrid project, funded with support of the NSW Government’s Bushfire Local Economic Recovery Fund, would help deliver a more resilient energy supply in the face of “increasingly frequent and extreme weather events”. He said it would also cater for peaks in energy demand that coincide with the arrival of holiday makers to the popular coastal area.
“This is an exciting opportunity to … pioneer innovative customer-focused energy solutions that future proof our communities, now and beyond,” Chalkley said.
Endeavour, which owns, maintains and operates the electrical distribution network supplying 2.6 million people in households and businesses across Sydney’s Greater West, Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands the Illawarra and the South Coast, said it expects to add a number of microgrids to its network, saying they “will create a more modular grid that is customised to suit the needs of the local community”.
“Microgrids are an exciting technology that really provide clever ways to localise power to the needs of the people in the area,” the network operator said. “It will help us better use localised renewable energy, which is cost efficient, and create better reliability too.”
“Microgrids eliminate the need for large substations so in time these savings, will be passed on to customers. It’s a win for them, the network and the environment as our network creates the kind of sustainable benefits that we all want.”
Chalkley said Friday’s announcement marks the start of a program of consultation which will involve the community and other stakeholders, including the Shoalhaven City Council which has supplied the site for the new grid battery.

ARENA confirmed on Friday it will provide a $14.84 million grant to enable the construction of the 50MW/50MWh lithium-ion battery which will be equipped with advanced inverter technology designed to improve system strength and support increased levels of renewable energy generation in the area.
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the project is another step forward for the energy utility which has ambitions to become “a leading orchestrator of batteries in Australia”.
“As Australia moves forward with its energy transition, we know that firming technologies like batteries play an important role in energy storage and supporting renewable energy supply,” he said.
“Broken Hill’s unique edge-of-grid environment provides an ideal location for this advanced inverter technology to demonstrate how it can facilitate further penetration of renewable energy generation and add to the stability of the wider electricity network.”

AGL has engaged energy storage provider Fluence and its consortium partner Valmec to supply the battery for the Broken Hill project which has been designed to be compatible with the 53MW Broken Hill Solar Farm and the nearby 200MW Silverton Wind Farm, both of which AGL operates.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said he expects the Broken Hill battery to demonstrate the ability of large-scale batteries to be equipped with grid-forming inverters to improve system strength and facilitate higher penetrations of variable renewable energy generation at the lowest cost.
“Big batteries are already becoming critical to our electricity system, but we know with grid-forming inverters they can provide system strength services traditionally provided by thermal generation,” he said.
“We are particularly interested in seeing how AGL’s Broken Hill battery will utilise and demonstrate advanced inverter technology in a weaker section of the energy grid.”
Fluence Australia general manager Aaron McCann said the Broken Hill battery, the first project the company is delivering to AGL after signing a framework agreement in 2021 to supply up to 1GW of grid-scale battery storage, will offer “market-leading functionality with advanced grid-forming inverters”.

The battery is expected to benefit AGL’s Broken Hill Solar Farm.The project, which will use Fluence’s Gridstack product, will start and remain in grid-forming mode with all inverters operating as a voltage source. The company said the system will inherently resist changes in voltage and frequency on the grid and provide synthetic inertia.
“Broken Hill battery’s full power occurs instantaneously to quickly respond to large changes in voltage and or frequency, which is the fastest response of all battery energy storage systems currently available in the market,” McCann said.
The Broken Hill battery is to be built on industrial land about six kilometres southeast of the city centre. The project, which will connect to TransGrid’s Broken Hill substation, is expected to be completed by early 2023.
The final investment decision for the Broken Hill project comes just days after AGL secured planning approval for a 500MW/2GWh grid-connected utility scale battery to be developed at the site of its coal-fired Liddell power plant in the NSW Hunter Valley.
The projects are part of the power producer’s plan to establish a large-scale battery storage portfolio. The energy giant has already commenced construction of a 250MW/1GWh battery at the site of its Torrens Island power station in South Australia, has unveiled plans to build a large-scale battery at Loy Yang A power station in Victoria (200MW/800MWh), and has announced support for battery projects at Wandoan (100MW) in Queensland and Maoneng (4 x 50MW) in NSW. It is already operating the 30 MW/8MWh BESS at Dalrymple in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/03/25/invasion-of-ukraine-an-inadvertent-boost-for-green-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 25, 2022",Invasion of Ukraine an inadvertent boost for green hydrogen,"From pv magazine Global
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having widespread geopolitical and economic impacts, not the least of which can be seen in the price spike of gas-powered grey hydrogen and ammonia compared to green versions of the fuels. 
Earlier this month, BloombergNEF published a report suggesting “a delivered hydrogen price of US$6.59/kg (AU$8.8/kg) is now sufficient to make green ammonia cheaper than ‘grey’ ammonia, made from unabated natural gas on a short-run, marginal cost basis. This is just enough for a green ammonia facility in Germany to be competitive.” Of course, Bloomberg pointed out that prices in countries like Spain, India and China would be even more competitive. 
This week, Rystad Energy similarly predicted that a surging cost of blue and grey hydrogen in line with fossil fuel hikes increased the growing feasibility “of green hydrogen as an affordable and secure source of renewable energy in Europe”. 
According to Rystad, the war in Ukraine has “turbocharged” the green hydrogen production sector, which was already set to experience a boom year as it passed the 1GW milestone. Thanks to a 70% increase, Rystad predicts the cost of fossil fuel-linked blue and grey hydrogen could reach from US$8/kg to US$14/kg (AU$10-$18) “in a matter of days”. For green hydrogen, however, since the invasion of Ukraine Rystad is predicting lower production costs of US$4/kg (A$5.3/kg), particularly in Spain, which looking to produce more than 4GW of green hydrogen by 2030. 
The market is well and truly swinging, and to add weight to that swing the EU has already announced plans for a €300 million (AU$440 million) funding package for hydrogen, as well as REPowerEU’s Hydrogen Accelerator initiative to unhook the region from its dependence on Russian gas. 
Rystad Energy’s head of hydrogen research Minh Khoi Le said “While industry and governments are heading in the right direction, their challenge is to lower the risks for green hydrogen investors and create incentives necessary to scale up quickly both the demand and supply. Fundamentally, a world where green hydrogen fulfils the role currently played by oil, gas and coal will look very different,” Le continued.
To realise that world green hydrogen production needs to increase to more than 10 million tons worldwide by 2030 and see its costs cut to at least US$1.5/kg (AU$2/kg). 10 million tonnes might sound like a lot, but according to Rystad if green hydrogen and its derivatives were to replace gas and coal in Europe’s power mix base case by 2030 it would need 54 million tonnes. 
Currently, Europe is working to produce 3 million tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030, while RePower Europe has set a target of 15 million tons per annum. Clearly, there remains an enormous gap, but the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may just have swung the economics in green hydrogen’s favour.

A group of scientists from the Technical University of Madrid has fabricated a latent heat thermophotovoltaic (LHTPV) battery that is able to store electricity in the form of latent heat at temperatures of over 1,000 degrees Celsius and then convert the stored heat to electricity on demand using a thermophotovoltaic system consisting of a thermal emitter and a photovoltaic diode cell.
“We have built a small, laboratory scale prototype of less than 1kWh of storage capacity,” the research’s corresponding author, Alejandro Datas, told pv magazine. “To reach commercial maturity, we need to build a system with several megawatt-hours of energy capacity, which may require some time and a large amount of funds. However, we are already working on that and, hopefully, we can speed things up if we find the right partners to scale the technology.”
The proposed system uses renewable electricity to melt, at temperatures over 1,000 degrees Celsius, low-cost metals such as silicon or ferrosilicon alloys, which are able to store energy during their fusion process, thus producing the so-called “latent heat.” According to the research team, a litre of silicon material is able to store more than 1kWh of latent heat, which corresponds to the energy contained in a litre of hydrogen pressurised at 500 bar. “However, unlike hydrogen, silicon can be stored at atmospheric pressure, making the system potentially cheaper and safer,” it further explained.
The thermophovoltaic generator used for the device is described by the researchers as a miniature photovoltaic system that can generate up to 100 times more energy than a conventional PV installation. According to the researchers’ calculations, if a square meter of a conventional PV array produces 200W, a square meter of thermophotovoltaic system may generate up to 20kW. “The efficiency of thermophotovoltaic cells ranges between 30 and 40% depending on the temperature of the heat source,” they emphasised. “Furthermore, the use of thermophotovoltaic generators, instead of conventional heat engines, avoids the use of moving parts, fluids, and complex heat exchangers.”
The silicon and ferrosilicon alloys can store energy at a cost of less than €4 (AU$5.8) per kWh, although its commercial costs may be higher as the system currently does not integrate a container and thermal insulation. “It would be possible to reach costs of around €10 (AU$14.6) per kilowatt-hour if the system is large enough, typically more than 10MWh, since the cost of thermal insulation would be a small fraction of the total cost of the system,” the Spanish group emphasised, noting that if costs will be further reduced, it may be enough to recover only 30-40% of the energy in the form of electricity, to make these devices more profitable than lithium-ion batteries. “Additionally, the remaining 60-70% of the heat that is not converted to electricity can be delivered directly to buildings, factories, or cities, reducing your natural gas consumption.”
The battery was presented in the paper “Latent heat thermophotovoltaic batteries,” which was recently published in Joule. “If the price of stationary lithium-ion batteries remains high, it will be necessary to combine them with other, cheaper technologies, such as thermophotovoltaic batteries, which allow larger amounts of electricity to be stored,” Datas concluded.
*The article was updated on March 28 to reflect that the figure €4 per kWh refers to the cost at which silicon and ferrosilicon alloys can store energy, and not to the cost at which the device stores energy.
