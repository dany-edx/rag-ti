The NT government said the two-year agreement with Larrakia Energy, a joint venture initiative between Larrakia Development Corporation and Perth-based resource and renewables company Progressive Green Solutions, and Komipo would see the parties “work in co-operation to achieve the rapid, efficient and effective development of the 300 MW Green Energy Project.”
Larrakia Development Corporation Chief Executive Officer Nigel Browne said the MoU is a crucial step to building the Territory’s renewables future and will help advance the project to the next stage.
“We are bringing together the resources and goodwill needed to lower emissions and care for Country, on Larrakia Country,” he said.

The project includes scoping, construction and operation of the 300 MW solar plant at Bladin Point near the Middle Arm precinct site.
While no further details about the Green Energy Project have been made available, it is expected that the developers will look to construct a dedicated transmission line direct to the Middle Arm precinct.
The industrial area currently houses the Santos and Ichthys gas export terminals and in June the NT government awarded land in the precinct to Fortescue Future Industries and French renewables major Total Eren, both of which are pursuing green hydrogen projects in the Territory.
Other awardees are minerals company Tivan, which plans to build a facility at the Middle Arm precinct to process vanadium for products such as batteries, and fellow Perth-based battery minerals producer Avenira, which is focused on developing a plant to process minerals for lithium phosphate batteries. Tamboran Resources, which plans to build a gas export plant at the site, has also been awarded land.

NT Infrastructure Minister Eva Lawler said the Green Energy Project has the potential to create “thousands of jobs and increase our sustainable energy production for countless years to come.”
The announcement caps a big week for Progressive Green Solutions and Komipo with the parties, in partnership with Samsung C&T, entering into negotiations with the Western Australian (WA) government to establish a green ammonia production and export plant near Geraldton.
The WA government has secured land at the Narngulu Industrial Estate for the proposed facility which is expected to produce up to 1 million tonnes of green ammonia per annum using renewable hydrogen.
The project is expected to help support the decarbonisation of power generation assets in South Korea, with first shipments of green ammonia expected in 2027.

This projected growth, if confirmed by final figures, will indicate a substantial 33% increase from 2022.
The research firm predicts a 1% year-on-year expansion in the global solar market for 2024, followed by a 5% increase in 2025. However, a potential decline of 1% is anticipated in 2026. Notably, the Asia-Pacific region, including China, is poised to dominate PV deployment until 2032.

Wood Mackenzie said that the remarkable escalation in China’s manufacturing capacity is driving new solar installations to unprecedented heights.
“Massive expansion of manufacturing capacity in China is pushing solar installations to record levels,” WoodMackenzie said. “Developers are taking advantage of plummeting polysilicon prices to rapidly expand utility-scale solar plants despite increased curtailment risks.”
The report notes China’s significant influence in the PV manufacturing landscape, and suggests that the nation might transition from exporting modules to focusing on upstream cells and wafers. The research notes that policy incentives for local PV manufacturing in the United States, Europe, and India are unlikely to significantly erode China’s market share in the near future.

(Halead) has developed a PVC knife-scratch coated fabric that can be used as a reflective material for ground-mounted bifacial PV projects.
“The fabric has a reflectivity of up to 84.54%,” a spokesperson from the company told pv magazine, noting this percentage surpasses by far the 70-75% reflectivity offered by snow, which is the best form of albedo surface. “Reasonable paving of reflective materials on the ground can enhance the light efficiency of the backplane of the module, thereby improving the overall power generation efficiency of the modules.”
Called Sunpuls, the reflective fabric has a thickness of 4 mm and consists of an anti-ultraviolet (UV) protective coating, a reflection factor coating, a precision coating, a functional framework, and a textile protective layer.
The manufacturer claims the product can be deployed in different environments, due to its physical strength, bending resistance, and temperature resistance. It mentions deserts, wastelands, rooftops, hay landforms, rolling hills, agricultural land, and even water.
The spokesperson said the solution can ensure a 9.03% gain in annual power generation and an 8.88% increase in power output per W compared to bifacial projects without the fabric, adding that these results were confirmed by Germany’s TÜV SÜD.
The certification body also certified that the material can retain 68.55% of its reflectivity after 10,000 hours, with the material surface showing no cracks or delamination.
“The product has passed many environmental protection regulations such as Europe SVHC / RoHS 2.0 / California 65,” the spokesperson added.
The company has already sold its solution for several large-scale PV projects in Oman, India, Japan, and China.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/04/limitless-energy-floating-solar-near-equator-could-power-future-population-hotspots/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",,"AUGUST 4, 2023",‘Limitless’ energy: floating solar near equator could power future population hotspots,"Our new research shows offshore solar in Indonesia alone could generate about 35,000 TWh of solar energy a year, which is similar to current global electricity production (30,000TWh per year).
And while most of the world’s oceans experience storms, some regions at the Equator are relatively still and peaceful. So relatively inexpensive engineering structures could suffice to protect offshore floating solar panels.
Our high-resolution global heat maps show the Indonesian archipelago and equatorial West Africa near Nigeria have the greatest potential for offshore floating solar arrays.

On current trends, the global economy will be largely decarbonised and electrified by 2050, supported by vast amounts of solar and wind energy.
About 70 square kilometres of solar panels can provide all the energy requirements of a million affluent people in a zero-carbon economy. The panels can be placed on rooftops, in arid areas, collocated with agriculture, or floated on water bodies.
But countries with high population densities, such as Nigeria and Indonesia, will have limited space for solar energy harvesting.
Their tropical location in the so-called “doldrum” latitudes also means wind resources are poor. Fortunately, these countries – and their neighbours – can harvest effectively unlimited energy from solar panels floating on calm equatorial seas.
Floating solar panels can also be placed on inland lakes and reservoirs. Inland floating solar has large potential and is already growing rapidly.
Our recently released paper surveys the global oceans to find regions that didn’t experience large waves or strong winds over the past 40 years. Floating solar panels in such regions do not require strong and expensive engineering defences.
Regions that don’t experience waves larger than six metres nor winds stronger than 15m per second could generate up to one million TWh per year. That’s about five times more annual energy than is needed for a fully decarbonised global economy supporting 10 billion affluent people.
Most of the good sites are close to the Equator, in and around Indonesia and equatorial west Africa. These are regions of high population growth and high environmental values. Marine floating solar panels could help resolve land use conflict.
Indonesia is a densely populated country, particularly on the islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra. By mid-century, Indonesia’s population may exceed 315 million people.
Fortunately, Indonesia has vast solar energy potential and also vast pumped hydro energy storage potential to store the solar energy overnight.
About 25,000 square km of solar panels would be required to support an affluent Indonesia after full decarbonisation of the economy using solar power.
Indonesia has the option of floating vast numbers of solar panels on its calm inland seas. The region has about 140,000 square km of seascape that has not experienced waves larger than 4m – nor winds stronger than 10m per second – in the past 40 years.
Indonesia’s maritime area of 6.4 million square km is 200 times larger than required if Indonesia’s entire future energy needs were met from offshore floating solar panels.

Most of the global seascape experiences waves larger than 10m and winds stronger than 20m per second. Several companies are working to develop engineering defences so offshore floating panels can tolerate storms. In contrast, benign maritime environments along the equator require much less robust and expensive defences.
We have found the most suitable regions cluster within 5–12 degrees of latitude of the Equator, principally in and around the Indonesian archipelago and in the Gulf of Guinea near Nigeria. These regions have low potential for wind generation, high population density, rapid growth (in both population and energy consumption) and substantial intact ecosystems that should not be cleared for solar farms. Tropical storms rarely impact equatorial regions.
The offshore floating solar industry is in its infancy. Offshore solar panels do have downsides compared with onshore panels, including salt corrosion and marine fouling. Shallow seas are preferred for anchoring the panels to the seabed. And careful attention must be paid to minimising damage to the marine environment and fishing. Global warming may also alter wind and wave patterns.
Despite these challenges, we believe offshore floating panels will provide a large component of the energy mix for countries with access to calm equatorial seas. By mid-century, about a billion people in these countries will rely mostly on solar energy, which is causing the fastest energy change in history.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/04/report-tips-138-billion-to-keep-australia-in-manufacturing-race/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,FINANCE,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Report tips $138 billion to keep Australia in manufacturing race,"A new report published by independent public policy think tank the Australia Institute warns Australia must respond urgently to powerful new incentives on offer for clean energy-related manufacturing in the United States and several other industrial countries, or risk losing its chance to leverage its renewable energy resources into lasting, diversified industrial development.
The 74-page report, released by the Canberra-based Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work, notes there is an overseas manufacturing boom in the production of solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, renewable energy generation and transmission equipment, and other renewable energy products.
Jim Stanford, Director of the Centre for Future Work and co-author of the report, said the boom is being driven by incentives provided by the U.S. government’s $500 billion (USD 369 billion) Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and similar supports in the European Union, China, Japan, Korea, and Canada.
“The extraordinary response by industry to the U.S. measures confirms that these policies are having an outsized effect on the volume and location of sustainable manufacturing investment,” Stanford said.
“It also confirms that Australia must move quickly with its response to this new industrial landscape, or risk losing its chance to leverage our renewable energy resources into lasting, diversified industrial growth.”

The Australian government has rolled out a raft of incentives aimed at taking advantage of the new renewable energy industrial revolution. These include the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund, the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, and the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative which offers grant funding of up to 20 million to domestic manufacturing projects on a matched funding basis.
The Capacity Investment Scheme is another new initiative, first announced in December 2022 and funded in the 2023 budget. It aims to facilitate $10 billion in public and private sector investments in clean energy generation and storage. The 2023 budget also allocated $2 billion to the establishment of the Hydrogen Headstart program, an initiative to support investment in green hydrogen projects.
The report however suggests the federal government’s funding commitments are just a drop in the bucket and estimates Australia would need to commit $83 to $138 billion over 10 years in fiscal supports and incentives to match U.S. benchmarks for domestic renewable industry. This does not include the direct capital cost of renewable energy projects themselves.
Charlie Joyce, a research fellow at the Centre for Future Work and co-author of the report, said Australia has many advantages in the race for sustainable manufacturing, including an “unmatched endowment” of primary renewable energy sources, and ample deposits of critical minerals that are essential to production of renewable energy equipment.
While this would seem to give Australia a head-start in the race to grab a share of the lucrative new markets for manufactured products linked to renewable energy systems, Joyce said “decades of policy neglect for domestic manufacturing has left Australia’s industrial base in poor shape to seize the opportunities being opened up by the global energy transition.”

“The global race for clean technology manufacturing is well underway, and Australia is barely on the track,” Joyce said.
“If we don’t support domestic manufacturing to quickly enhance its production, skills, and technological capabilities, all that will happen is we will replace one set of unprocessed minerals: coal, oil and gas; with another: raw lithium and related critical minerals.”
“Without action, most of the spin-off benefits of the renewable energy revolution for industry, technology, value-added and diversification will pass us by.”
The authors acknowledged that the figures outlined in the report represent a major fiscal commitment, but said it is not out of reach for Australia.
“The common claim that Australia cannot afford to undertake measures that are proportionately equivalent to the IRA is not convincing,” they said.
“Enhancing Australia’s capability to produce the manufactured products required by the renewable energy revolution, and to position other manufacturing to take advantage of growing supplies of clean energy (such as green steel and aluminium production), would pay off in stronger economic and employment growth, less vulnerability to volatility in global fossil fuel markets, and a stronger political constituency to support the renewable energy transition.”
The report also lists several qualitative best practices that should be incorporated in the Australian response to the IRA, to generate maximum economic, social and environmental impact. These include these include strong labour and environmental standards attached to subsidised projects, public equity participation, and parallel investments in training for workers.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/04/trina-solar-gets-all-clear-from-clean-energy-regulator/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",TRISTAN RAYNER,"AUGUST 4, 2023",Trina Solar gets all-clear from Clean Energy Regulator,"The CER said this week in a press release that it was now satisfied that Trina Solar panels meet Australian standards for safety and quality, more than three years after finding the company had made a solar panel certification mistake that raised questions over manufacturing standards.
It’s a conclusion to a process started on May 7, 2020, when the CER accepted an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) offered by Trina Solar in Australia.
The CER had found that Trina had PV panels in the country that were considered ineligible, as they “were either built in facilities that did not have the required certification or were manufactured to an outdated standard.” 
The consequence of this meant that the panels weren’t part of the Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) approved PV module list, and the systems installed became ineligible for Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES).
As part of the agreed EU, Trina Solar removed and replaced all the solar panels on over 100 systems across Australia. In addition, it transported at least one panel from each system to a testing facility, and had each panel extensively tested for safety and performance to provide assurance of a quality product.
The CER said that based on the results obtained from testing, it was satisfied that the panels were up to scratch. At the time of the initial reporting in 2020, it was suggested that the problem was a mistake with documentation of the factory provenance, rather than a case of using uncertified facilities.
That said, the various incentives offered rely on the installation of high-quality panels backed by warranties and meeting Australian standards, providing installers and consumers with some level of assurance.
Trina Solar had been required, from May 2020 to August 2021, to provide required additional evidence supporting its panel provenance to the Solar Panel Validation initiative, before that requirement was relaxed.
Further clearance from the CER provides Trina with a potential boost for its panel uptake in Australia. The company has been popular globally, and locally, for its mix of well-priced panels delivering overall more robust reliability and performance.
