The refuelling station will support the introduction of zero emission hydrogen fuel cell trucks to the south coast region of Illawarra-Shoalhaven. The development will stand as one of the front-runners in the transition to hydrogen powered fleet vehicles around Australia. 
The steel city of Wollongong, which has long been a hub for coal and, obviously, steel, is looking to refashion itself as the ideal location for large-scale green hydrogen production. An ambition backed by NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean who has also identified Port Kembla as a critical site for a Hydrogen Hub.

This is also the general ambition of the Federal Government too, as one of the five priorities of its Technology Investment Roadmap: First Low Emissions Technology Statement 2020, was getting low emissions steel production at under AUD$900 per tonne. Also, the $74.5 million in funding for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency for electric vehicle refuelling infrastructure can also be spent on hydrogen refuelling. And of course, none of this is to mention the nearby Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government’s Renewable Hydrogen Refuelling Pilot set to be operational before the end of March 2021. 
Steel giant BlueScope has already announced it will invest $20 million in a new BlueScope Renewable Manufacturing Zone (BRMZ) and it is at the site of the BlueScope Port Kembla Steelworks that Coregas’ refuelling facility will be located.

Transport is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, especially heavy-vehicles which find it difficult to run effectively on electric vehicle battery systems. Coregas is not alone in thinking hydrogen fuel cells could be the technology to help the trucking, shipping, and even aviation, decarbonise over the coming decades. According to Coregas, the refuelling station will be able to deliver 50% emissions reductions immediately to vehicles that utilise it. 
“Coregas is committed to initiatives that drive innovation for cleaner energy with hydrogen a priority” said Coregas executive general manager, Alan Watkins. “This project marks an important step in our hydrogen strategy, and we appreciate the assistance of the NSW Government in supporting our vision for a hydrogen ecosystem at Port Kembla…and enabling the development of a new zero emission transport solution for the region and greater NSW.” 
“We believe this project is a game changer for Australia and forms part of Coregas’ commitment to develop the Australian hydrogen sector” continued Watkins, “complementing our work on the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project creating a liquid hydrogen supply chain between Australia and Japan and our many years of supporting the hydrogen fuel needs of automotive companies, including Hyandai Australia.” 
Coregas expects the hydrogen refuelling station to be operational by late 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/19/supermarket-giant-commits-to-bring-emissions-down-down-down/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 19, 2021","Supermarket giant commits to bring emissions down, down, down","Supermarket behemoth Coles announced on Friday it will be entirely powered by renewable electricity by the end of 2025, will cut its combined scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by more than 75% by the end of 2030 and will deliver net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The emission targets commit Coles, one of Australia’s biggest energy users, to a greenhouse gas reduction strategy that “exceeds climate change ambitions of the Paris Agreement”, chief executive Steven Cain said in a statement.
“We have already reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 36.5% since 2009 and have been a leader in securing renewable energy,” Cain said.
“Our new targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions commit us to an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that exceed the climate change ambitions of the Paris Agreement and will help sustain Australia for generations to come by working together with our customers, suppliers and members of the community.”
The move means all three of Australia’s major supermarkets, including Woolworths and Aldi, will be sourcing all their electricity from renewables by 2025 at the latest. Aldi has boldly declared it will achieve the 100% renewable electricity target by the end of 2021.
Coles said it would continue to build on the progress already made towards the 100% renewable electricity target through renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs), onsite solar PV and agreements with renewable electricity generators.
Coles, Australia’s 12th biggest energy user and responsible for 1% of the country’s total electricity consumption with more than 2500 stores and support centres across the nation, already sources 10% of its electricity in New South Wales from three solar farms.
In September 2020 Coles signed a PPA with state government-owned energy generator CleanCo which will allow it to source more than 90% of its Queensland electricity requirements from renewable sources from mid 2022.

Coles continued its push towards the freshly announced 100% renewable electricity target on Friday, confirming it has signed a 10-year PPA with Lal Lal Wind Farms near Ballarat, which has been exporting renewable electricity at full capacity to the Victorian grid since December 2020.
Under the agreement, Coles will purchase enough large-scale generation certificates from Lal Lal Wind Farms to increase the group’s renewable electricity to 45% of total consumption by 2023.
REenergise campaign director Lindsay Soutar, from Greenpeace Australia Pacific, welcomed Coles’ announcement and said the group’s commitment to clean energy has far-reaching implications.
“Coles making the clean energy switch will put a big dent in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, inspiring confidence in towns and cities across the country that even the biggest and most complex businesses can run on renewable energy,” she said.
“All three of Australia’s biggest supermarkets have now committed to 100% clean electricity, meaning the goods and services Australians use every day will soon be brought to us by the wind and sun.
“The momentum behind Australia’s business energy transition is undeniable, as company after company commits to 100% renewable electricity, and concrete action from companies like Coles puts them in front of the pack.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/19/pv-thermal-technology-earns-tick-of-approval-from-iea/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 19, 2021",PV-thermal technology earns tick of approval from IEA,"The International Energy Agency (IEA) this week released a paper highlighting the merits of PVT, declaring the production of solar PV energy combined with energy from the heat transfer provides an increased yield per square metre.
Glen Ryan, co-founder of Perth-based solar PV innovator Sunovate, is among those who participated in the preparation of the Technology Position Paper on PVT and said the hybrid technology has the potential to improve conversion efficiency by diverting the heat away from the modules while utilising the heat for an alternative purpose.
“Globally, heating typically accounts for more than 50% of final energy consumption, very little of which is powered by renewable energy,” Ryan said.
“PVT allows us to harness clean solar energy, improve PV panel output, and convert the heat removed for application directly such as space heating or enhancing it by combining it with heating appliances such as heat pumps.
“It’s a remarkable combination of technologies that is improving efficiency, output and longevity of PV modules and allowing more applications to access clean energy.”
The IEA said by combining electricity and heat generation within the same component, the technologies can reach a higher overall seasonal efficiency than PV or solar thermal alone.
By day the solar PV modules convert sunlight into electricity. With PVT, a solar thermal collector is added to transfer the otherwise unused excess heat from the PV module to a heat transfer fluid. By night, the technology transforms into a large heat radiative surface that can provide renewable cooling.
The IEA said the solar electricity production of an uncovered PVT module is not less than that of a PV-only module and can even be slightly higher if the collector is operated at temperatures below those of a PV-only module thanks to the thermal energy extracted and used.
PVT collectors can be uncovered, glazed or concentrating. Depending on their type, PVT collectors can produce heat at temperatures from about -20° to +150°C and serve a wide range of applications.

PVT systems are already being used in residential, agricultural and industrial settings with the IEA saying payback times as low as four years have been observed in hotel case studies in Spain.
The Australian Photovoltaics Institute (APVI) said tests, including those conducted by Sunovate, found yields can more than double compared to PV or solar thermal alone. The efficiency is however dependent on the temperature of the heating application, with pool heating more efficient than space heating, and both are more efficient that hot water heating.
The APVI said the potential for PVT is particularly strong for commercial businesses where heating requirements are elevated during the day, such as agro-industrial processes (greenhouses, dairies) and solar water desalination operations.
The IEA report also indicated PVT provided increased solar PV efficiency due to removal of heat from the modules while the lifespan of the cells was increased due to less thermally induced degradation.
The IEA said PVT can also help address the emerging issues of space and network constraints, noting the hybrid technology uses the same area as a PV or thermal module to provide both electricity and heat, and in some cases cooling.
“PVT systems deliver high-yielding solutions per unit of area and maximize the existing electrical infrastructure through their distributed application,” the IEA said in the report.
The APVI said Australia is already home to a number of PVT technology manufacturers, as well as international distributors, but with 2 million m2 of PVT, that is 270 MW PV and 1.400 GW solar thermal installed worldwide over the past five years, the country has some catching up to do.
Australia had only 547 m2 of installed PVT capacity in 2019, well adrift of pacesetters France (485,000 m2), South Korea (281,000 m2), China (133,000 m2) and Germany (112,000 m2).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/19/new-report-identifies-digitalization-as-renewable-energy-driver/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 19, 2021",New report identifies digitalization as renewable energy driver,"A report released by Spanish software company RatedPower suggests digitalization has the potential to transform the entire energy supply chain with solar PV set to lead a renewable energy charge to record levels in 2021.
The report, released on Thursday, shows there was an unexpected surge in renewable energy growth globally in 2020 with wind and solar power generation rising to record levels. This expansion is forecast to continue in 2021 with the International Energy Agency (IEA) projecting a 10% increase in renewable capacity additions to almost 218 GW globally.
Australia, which the report ranks among the top five nations with the most potential for renewable energy growth, is among those countries set to contribute to this surge.
After a record 7 GW of new renewable energy capacity was installed in 2020, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) confirmed earlier this month Australia is on track for another record year, forecasting that between 3 GW and 4 GW of rooftop solar PV will be installed in 2021 while the rollout of large-scale solar PV projects is also expected to continue at pace.
RatedPower CEO Andrea Barber said digitilization and innovation would be crucial for the ongoing expansion of the renewable energy industry.
“Digitalization has the power to transform the entire energy supply chain, from generation to transport, distribution and consumption,” she said.
“Digital technologies can advance the next stage of development by integrating renewables into energy systems in a way that provides a flexible demand-side response, increasing efficiency and sustainability.”
RatedPower surveyed more than 100 industry representatives from around the globe and an overwhelming 86% agreed with Barber, saying digitalization will play a substantial role in the continued development of renewables, enabling more efficient and flexible projects that generate a higher return on investment.

The report also highlights the trend towards maximising efficiency of renewable installations and keeping down costs with solutions such as bifacial panels – which research shows were the cheapest option for 93.1% of global solar sites on a levelized cost basis – thin-film PV, and AI tools to increase visibility into the operation.
Battery storage is also expected to play a key role into the future, affording grid operators increased flexibility in the distribution of power generated by solar and wind sites.
“Storage is the key to using renewable energy more effectively, minimizing carbon emissions and ensuring grid stabilization,” Barber said.
“One of the challenges in the widespread adoption of wind and solar power has been that generation is dependent on weather conditions. Battery storage gives grid operators another tool to balance peaks in electricity generation and consumption, storing power for when it is most needed.”
The report indicates solar PV will lead the way for the renewable energy sector with 80% of respondents expecting a record 130 GW of new capacity to be installed globally this year.
Green hydrogen was also identified as a high-growth area with projects expected to more than double in 2021. Respondents also said that hydrogen (44%) has the potential to rival wind energy (43%).

“Hydrogen can bring the renewable sector a step further towards a greener future and revolutionize the transportation industry,” Barber said.
“Green hydrogen produced using renewables has the potential to complement batteries in providing fuel for zero-emission means of transport, especially in ‘hard-to-decarbonise’ such as trucks, aviation, shipping, and other energy-intensive ones. It can also displace fossil fuels to meet the energy needs of sectors like manufacturing, shipping and construction.”
While the report points to a bright future for the renewable energy sector, those who took part in the survey did warn the industry faces some major challenges with the lack of clear government policy chief among them.
Half of all who took part in the survey identified government policy as the biggest challenge confronting the industry while a lack of incentives and well-targeted public investments are also of concern.
The industry’s long-term sustainability is also an issue with 37% of respondents highlighting the lack of infrastructure for recycling equipment solar panels and wind turbines as a real concern.
Grid infrastructure, transmission capacity, and energy storage were also areas of concern and Barber said they would need to be addressed moving forward.
“If we are to mitigate the impact of climate change, renewables must become the predominant source of electricity supply around the world,” she said.
“Even without incentives for green infrastructure development, renewable technologies have progressed to become competitive enough to displace fossil fuels, accelerating the energy transition in new ways. I’m certain that the year ahead will be an exciting period of change for the industry. A change led by what I consider to be some of the most promising trends: digitalization, energy storage, new technologies and the hydrogen revolution.”

Andrew Blakers from ANU’s School of Engineering argues that if we double the average rate of solar and wind deployment, Australia could reach 80% emissions reduction by 2040 at a negligible or even negative cost. 
“Around 7 GW of new solar and wind was added in 2020,” said Blakers, “which was deployed four times faster per capita than in Europe, China, Japan or the United States. Gas energy is declining because it cannot compete with solar and wind.”


Blakers believes Australia can be much more ambitious with its zero emissions targets given the ‘golden opportunity’ it has with its renewable resources. Of course, this would also require significant decarbonisation in sectors outside of power, notably transport. 
“Australia can reduce emissions quickly by enabling a ‘big new market’ for electric vehicles,” said Blakers, “through a range of government measures,” such as “a rapid shift in government fleets to electric vehicles, short-term tax exemptions for electric vehicles and ramping up the number of charging stations on country roads and elsewhere to give people confidence to invest in EVs.” 
“While there is a move toward electric vehicles,” concluded Blakers, “it’s too gradual, like a charging snail rather than a red kangaroo.”
According to the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, Australia’s carbon emissions dropped 4.4% in the first nine months of 2020, a reduction put down to the rise of renewables and decline of fossil fuels.

“Fossil fuel energy causes 80% of Australia’s emissions,” continued Blakers, who was seconded by Ken Baldwin, Director of Energy at the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions. Baldwin puts the halving of wholesale electricity prices in the last year coincides with high levels of new solar and wind, and the relation is causal. 

A third voice, also from ANU’s School of Engineering, Matthew Stocks, added that the key enabling factors for governments to ensure falling emissions is investment in electricity transmission and energy storage. 
“Balancing variable solar and wind is straightforward using off-the-shelf techniques” said Stocks, “for example, stronger long-distance transmission to smooth out variable local weather, as well as pumped-hydro, battery storage and demand management.”
“Australia has 4,000 potential pumped hydro sites with combined energy storage potential of 180 TWh,” continued Stocks, “which is about 300 times more than required to support 100% renewable electricity.”

The world needs to have hit 14 TW of solar generation capacity by 2050 if the global temperature rise is to be capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius this century.
While the estimate made by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) this week is bound to be welcomed by the solar industry, it was offered in a publication which spelled out the plans currently announced by the world’s governments have us on track for 36.5 gigatonnes of carbon emissions in 2050–rather than the zero required.
IRENA on Tuesday published a preview of its forthcoming World Energy Transition Outlook report, to mark the two-day Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue event which closed in the German capital yesterday.
With renewables connected to 90% of the measures needed to avoid catastrophic global heating–carbon capture and removal and bioenergy are slated to complete the picture–the $115 billion per year invested in solar from 2017 to 2019 will need to rise to $237 billion annually from now until 2050 to attain the 1.5C aspiration, IRENA warned.
That is based on the estimate the world will need to add 840 GW of clean energy capacity annually to hit a cumulative 27.7 TW in mid century, up from 2.5 TW today. Solar is set to lead the charge, in generation capacity terms, with wind power needing to contribute 8.1 TW in 29 years’ time.
A significant chunk of the electricity generated by all that solar and wind capacity will power green hydrogen–30%, according to IRENA, with the clean form of the energy-storage gas requiring almost 21 PWh of electricity in 2050, almost as much as the world’s total electricity demand today. That will drive a need for an average 160 GW of electrolyser capacity annually to 2050, although the slow start envisaged will see the biggest ramp up after 2030, with 400 GW of electrolysers to be built in 2050, according to the report.
In terms of costs, IRENA said the $98 trillion governments intend to spend on the energy system to mid century needs to be buttressed by a further $33 trillion to achieve 1.5C. Of that $131 trillion, $116 trillion–$4 trillion per year–must be spent on energy transition technology, and around $24 trillion of the cash earmarked for fossil fuels needs to be redirected into clean energy which, as IRENA constantly reminds us, reportedly generates three times as many jobs as the fossil fuel industry, for each $1 million invested.
The international agency’s view that natural gas can continue to play a part in the global energy mix in 2050–not to mention nuclear and even coal–is bound to cause disquiet in some quarters. IRENA said gas consumption in a 1.5C world could peak in 2025 but still supply 2.2 trillion m3 in 2050, down from 4.2 trillion m3 today, mainly for heat, balancing the energy system, and generating blue hydrogen. Oil could decline 80% from 2018 levels to just over 11 million barrels per day in mid century, for petrochemicals, aviation and shipping; and there would be residual coal use–with carbon capture and storage–in the steel and chemical industries.
Offering a hint to the potential geopolitical rifts that could be opened up by the energy transition, IRENA wrote of the need for “transparent, secure, sustainable and fair supply chains” for copper, lithium, cobalt, platinum and rare earth metals, and added: “These transformative changes cannot be left to markets alone.”

The U.S. Solar Market Insight 2020 Year-in-Review report, released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, found that the industry installed a record 19.2 GW of capacity last year. That was a 43% increase from 2019 and bested the market’s previous annual record of 15.1 GW set in 2016.
California, Texas, and Florida were the top three states for annual solar capacity additions for the second straight year. In 2020, 27 states installed over 100 MW of new solar capacity, a record.

Annual residential solar deployment rose 11% from 2019, reaching a record 3.1 GW. However, the report said this was lower than the 18% annual growth in 2019, as residential installations were impacted by the pandemic in the first half of 2020.
Annual non-residential installations fell 4% from 2019, with 2 GW installed in 2020. The report said the pandemic impacted this segment, too, through delayed project interconnections and prolonged development timelines.
For the second year in a row, solar led all technologies in new U.S. electric-generating capacity added, accounting for 43% in 2020.

The U.S. solar industry also saw its biggest quarterly gain ever in the fourth quarter, adding 8 GW of new capacity. For perspective, the market added 7.5 GW of capacity in all of 2015.
The report said there was a historic 6.3 GW of utility-scale projects installed in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual total just shy of 14 GW. The report said that 5 GW of new utility solar power purchase agreements were announced during the quarter. That brought the volume of project announcements in 2020 to 30.6 GW and the full utility-scale contracted pipeline to 69 GW.
For the first time, Wood Mackenzie also released a long-term forecast as part of the U.S. Solar Market Insight report series. By 2030, it expects that the total operating U.S. solar fleet will more than quadruple, installing a cumulative 324 GW of new capacity to reach a total of 419 GW.
Michelle Davis, senior analyst from Wood Mackenzie, said the two-year extension of the investment tax credit at the end of 2020 will drive greater solar adoption and led to a 17% increase in deployment in the report’s 2021-2025 forecast.

“After a slowdown in Q2 due to the pandemic, the solar industry innovated and came roaring back,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. She said that the forecast shows that by 2030 the equivalent of one in eight American homes will have solar.
