The idea that solar panels would one day be available for €0.10 ($0.17)/Wp of generation capacity would have seemed ludicrous a few years ago. But that was the European Union spot price published by retailer pvXchange for low-cost panels in December 2023.
No matter which price graph you consider, there is a clear, slippery-slope trend. Solar manufacturing has been through a boom, with module demand way beyond supply in what was very much a seller’s market but it’s no secret that the road ahead for solar manufacturing is likely to be rocky. Analysts are predicting a downturn, with crystalline silicon-based manufacturers set to struggle to break even. The consequent casualties may affect solar project warranties.
For manufacturers to maintain margins, or even just to survive, something has to give. Typically, that raises questions about materials supply and manufacturing quality. Similarities to the wind industry spring to mind.
Numerous factors can affect manufacturing processes but the strong association between quality and profitability cannot be ignored.
This might raise an important question for PV project owners. What measures will future-proof projects against issues of module quality?
Quality testing is important to protect revenue, extend product lifetimes, and eliminate warranty-claim inefficiency. Two levers are available to project owners.
Certified third parties can be contracted to test PV modules at manufacturer factories or ISO 17025-accredited laboratories.
Sample testing is typically based on ISO 2859-1 standards that use the acceptable quality limit (AQL) methodology. AQL determines whether an order has met client specifications. It defines defects that mean test failure so project owners can reject any given sample.
Additional tests or inspections during construction might also be utilized, including electroluminescence (EL) testing after delivery or installation, via an independent third party.
If a project owner opts against quality control, they face the danger of receiving a batch that another owner has rejected.
Engineer Skyray and consultant Everoze have devised a set of employer’s requirements for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts. These include the technical requirements for EPC work, commissioning, and quality testing.
For PV module quality control, a five-step process is required.
A certified inspector should examine manufacturer facilities, reviewing manufacturing-process quality systems, as well as the procedures for raw material procurement, storage, and component traceability. The production process should also be reviewed. Product quality control should include EL and wet leakage current testing, as well as a pre-shipping visual inspection.
The inspection should include at least a visual inspection and measurement of power output. The following details should be checked or tested on a defined sample of panels: serial number, module type, package number, open circuit voltage, short-circuit current, power at the maximum power point, maximum power point voltage, current at maximum power point, fill factor, test date, record date, and EL testing carried out according to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) criteria.
A mechanical data inspection should be carried out to an inspection level based on AQL methodology and should include module and component dimensions, as well as label marking and weight conformity.
Manufacturer testing results can be verified by sending random batch samples to a lab for visual inspection, electrical insulation, and EL testing. The latter should detect hot burns, inactive parts, cracks, and micro-cracks, according to criteria agreed with the manufacturer, and maximum power measurement.
A small selection of modules should be subject to potential-induced degradation testing, according to the IEC 62804 standard.
For positively-doped, “p-type” cell technology, such as passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) solar, additional testing may be required to determine susceptibility to light-induced degradation or light-elevated temperature induced degradation.
Post-shipping tests determine whether transport conditions are aligned with manufacturer guidelines and can reveal module defects.
Samples should be randomly selected, in accordance with AQL, and IEC 61215-aligned visual inspections performed as well as in situ EL testing to detect defects such as unproductive areas or cell micro-cracks.
This stage primarily confirms that construction conditions are aligned with the manufacturer’s guidelines and that modules are free from defects. Similar testing (visual inspection and EL tests) can be carried out on a sample. This is important when determining where defects may have arisen, such as during transportation or installation, and where contractual responsibility lies.
Finally, a thermographic survey by drone is recommended to evaluate defects such as bypass diode issues, disconnected strings, or breakages during construction. Solutions are now available for post-treatment data, artificial intelligence-based detection, geolocation of anomalies, and automatic reporting.
The cost of these services has dramatically reduced due to a highly competitive market and rapid technological improvement. Such inspections enable project owners to have a global view of their plant after commissioning and offer many positive benefits.
Although solar development is a technical industry, commercial feasibility underpins its success. Clients not only want to develop technically sound projects but also financially sustainable ones that provide value to shareholders.
With a potentially rocky road ahead, project owners must consider the avenues available to help future-proof their projects. Everoze highlights the fact that thorough module testing can help illuminate the road ahead.

Located in the New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), the Dungowan PHES is proposed to have a capacity of 300 MW for up to 10 hours duration and will be located downstream of the existing Dungowan Dam.
EDF Australia Chief Executive Officer James Katsikas said the acquisition and joint development of the project demonstrates the company’s commitment to develop critical, clean energy infrastructure in Australia and to work with local communities in doing so.
“We intend to work very closely with the local community,” he said.
“Our goal is not only to facilitate clean, renewable energy for the region, but also to foster economic growth and create new opportunities for local businesses and residents.”
The Dungowan PHES project has been in development since 2014 and was awarded pre-investment studies funding by the NSW government under the emerging energy program in 2019.
Mirus Energy founder Mark Waring said the project is indeally located and will help facilitate new wind and solar projects and provide firming and grid support services at a critical point on the Australian National Electricity Market.
“We carefully selected the site for the Dungowan PHES so it could support the development of the wind and solar renewable energy resources in the New England region,” he said.
“It is strategically located between retiring coal capacity to the south and wind and solar capacity to the east, west and north. The project is located so it can connect to new transmission infrastructure being developed by EnergyCo or the existing transmission lines.”
Energy Estate co-founder Simon Currie said EDF is the ideal partner to drive the development of the project, noting that it “understands the complexities of developing large-scale pumped hydro projects and we are able to leverage their global resources, capacity and access global supply chains.”
“An accelerated transition of the energy sector in NSW requires new entrants with a track record of successful delivery and a long-term commitment,” he said.
EDF’s acquisition of the project forms part of its long-term plans for Australia with Katsikas saying the company is aiming to develop a portfolio of clean energy projects across multiple states.
“We have rapidly built a development team on the ground in Australia through the first half of 2023 and will continue to grow the team as we accelerate,” he said.

Under the non-exclusive agreement, Idemitsu will market, sell and deliver vanadium flow batteries to Australian customers using Sumitomo battery hardware and Vecco’s electrolyte made from vanadium mined at its Debella Critical Minerals Project near Julia Creek in the state’s west.
The electrolyte will be manufactured at Vecco’s production facility in the north Queensland city of Townsville with final assembly of the batteries completed at customer sites.
Vecco is already operating a 35 MWh vanadium electrolyte manufacturing facility in Townsville but is now planning to deliver a 300 MWh commercial production plant. The company said it has secured a 3.2-hectare site in the Townsville State Development Area for the facility and the detailed design of the plant is underway.
It is anticipated that the complete manufacturing supply chain will be operational in 2026 with the companies looking to cater for “rapidly” growing global demand for the battery energy storage technology.
Vecco Group Managing Director Tom Northcott said vanadium flow batteries, which are emerging as an alternative to the lithium-ion batteries that currently dominate the stationary energy storage sector, are set to be a key part of the future energy storage mix.
“Demand for vanadium flow batteries is rapidly increasing to meet the world’s energy storage demands,” he said.
“Over 7.4 GWh of vanadium flow battery projects globally are currently under construction or have been announced in the last 12 months.”
“The decision for Idemitsu to market and deploy vanadium flow batteries using Sumitomo and Vecco products acknowledges the scale of the opportunity.”
Idemitsu Australia Chief Executive Officer Steve Kovac said the company’s involvement with the venture is part of its broader renewable and clean energy projects strategy.
“We believe that our participation in the complete vanadium flow battery manufacturing supply chain will create opportunities for Australia and serves the growing global demand for renewable energy storage,” he said.

The announcement comes as state government-owned utility Energy Queensland finalises the installation of a vanadium flow battery in the state’s south-east as part of a trial of the technology.
The 250 kW / 750 kWh battery, supplied by Vecco and Sumitomo, is being installed at Energy Queensland’s depot at Berrinba in Brisbane’s south, and will be used to test the viability of the technology to provide the medium- and long-duration storage required for the state to meet its renewable energy commitments.
Energy Queensland said construction of the battery is in full swing with the commissioning of it expected in the final quarter this year.
“We look forward to the outcome of this trial as part of our wider mix of battery technology we have on, and building into, the grid,” it said.

Speaking in Port Augusta on the third day of the government’s “state prosperity project”, South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas said it is critical the state pushes ahead with its renewables ambitions.
“The world is demanding that economies decarbonise to avoid the risk of catastrophic climate change,” he said. “Our bountiful resources of wind and solar energy provide us the opportunity to seize the moment and produce what the world demands.”
South Australia is aiming for net 100% renewables in 2027 which means that the state will export surplus production when required and import when needed. While the ambition is for renewables to meet the state’s annual demand, gas-fired power generation will still be used.
“We still believe that gas-fired power generation will have a role to play over the immediate future and the medium term,” Malinauskas said.
“Gas-fired generation can be an important firming service to actually unlock more renewable investment.”
“But even though we’ve got gas filling the market, we know that we’ve got more renewables that will be produced that will be exported outside the state.”
South Australia is already leading the way in the shift to renewables with the share of renewables in the mix surging from zero prior to 2007 to above 70% today, according to the state’s grid operator.
In its latest transmission planning report, ElectraNet said wind and solar contributed 71% of the state’s electricity needs in 2022-23. At times, rooftop solar output alone exceeds the state’s power demand.
“There is no doubt we will get to net 100% renewables before 2030,” South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis said. “So we are doubling down on our ambition. We want to get there even sooner.”
Koutsantonis rejected suggestions that bringing forward the target would threaten grid stability, highlighting that the government intervention since the 2016 state-wide blackout had made the electricity grid “resilient, stable and rigorous”.
“We’ve got an energy market operator that is now paying a lot more attention,” he said.
“We’ve got a lot more grid-scale batteries that can respond very, very quickly to any disturbance in the system, and we have a lot more controls.”

Data centres are notoriously energy intensive and Equinix, which has more than 240 centres in 27 countries, is determined to deploy clean energy where possible as it works towards achieving 100% renewable energy coverage in its operations by 2030.
Equinix Australia Managing Director Guy Danskine said the installation of rooftop solar at the company’s facilities is an important part of an overarching strategy to help foster a more sustainable future for data centres.
The Melbourne rooftop system is the largest yet rolled out by Equinix in Australia and adds to systems deployed at seven other data centres in Brisbane, Canberra, and Sydney which collectively provide a total of approximately 1.8 MW of clean energy to the grid.
“In Australia, we have invested millions of dollars in solar systems and have plans to expand this further,” Danskine said.
“We are constantly exploring ways to deliver our digital infrastructure in the most sustainable way to address surging digital needs of businesses and support the development of the country’s digital economy,” he said.
To help fund the Melbourne rooftop solar system, Equinix claimed Victorian Energy Efficiency Certificates (VEECs) through the Victorian Energy Upgrades (VEU) program that was established by the state government to reduce power bills and greenhouse gas emissions.
VEECs are created when eligible energy efficiency activities, such as rooftop solar, are undertaken. Each certificate represents one tonne of greenhouse gas emissions reduction.
Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio, who attended the unveiling of the Melbourne rooftop system, said the initiative has helped more than 2 million households and 150,000 businesses lower their energy bills.
“Data centres are energy intensive, but through the VEU program Equinix has been able to install a large-scale solar system that reduces their operating costs and helps to lower their emissions,” she said.
The unveiling of the rooftop PV system comes after Equinix earlier in the month signed a clean energy power purchase agreement with TagEnergy.
Once operational in 2029, the agreement, for 151 MW of renewable energy sourced from the Golden Plains East Wind Farm, is expected to supply enough energy to the grid to cover Equinix’s 17 Australian data centres.

Spain’s minister of ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, said this week that the government has submitted a new incentive scheme to public consultation. It is designed to support the development of a clean energy technology supply chain in the country.
The authorities have launched the project for the first call for subsidies for energy transition equipment production, with a budget of $1.24 billion (EUR 750 million), said Ribera.
“Let’s consider that it’s not enough just to change the color of the molecules or electrons; the industries that have been abandoned, the services that have been abandoned, are, precisely, the great opportunity to reindustrialize and modernize our productive industry,” she said.
Backed by funds from the Plan for Recovery, Transformation and Resilience (PRTR), the scheme is expected to support the production of equipment and essential components of photovoltaic panels, batteries, wind turbines, heat pumps, and electrolysers.
The Institute for Diversificación y Ahorro de la Energía (IDAE) will manage the funds, which will be implemented under a competitive regime.
