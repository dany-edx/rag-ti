https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/02/compressed-green-hydrogen-ship-for-aussie-exports-deemed-highly-competitive/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 2, 2021",Compressed green hydrogen ship for Aussie exports deemed ‘highly competitive’,"Describing itself as “delighted” with the study’s results, Global Energy Ventures (GEV) says it now has the confidence to “rapidly progress” the development of its compressed hydrogen C-H2 Ship to the next phase. The “world first” ship design, which has already been patented, can transport 2,000 tonnes of compressed hydrogen. It aims to be ready for the windfall expected to follow the billions of dollars invested in developing the hydrogen industry worldwide.
GEV, a marine transportation company headquartered in Western Australia, says the study confirms it can deliver not only the ship itself, but a full zero-emissions compressed hydrogen (C-H2) supply chain with minimal barriers.  It expects commercialisation in the next five years, aiming to meet both demand and the timelines of Australian export projects.
“The idea is that the C-H2 supply chain will be commercially available before the alternative proposals of large-scale liquefaction of hydrogen or ammonia,” GEV’s statement, released on Monday, said.
This would mark a significant achievement as delivering green hydrogen through zero-emissions transport options have been front of mind for many potential importers, according to Smart Energy Council consultant Scott Hamilton.
Focussing squarely on Australia and its aspiration of becoming a leading global exporter of green hydrogen, GEV’s Executive Director Martin Carolan said: “C-H2 can become a game-changing solution for the hydrogen economy and deliver a timely and energy efficient ‘port to port’ zero emission supply chain for green hydrogen to be produced in Australia for markets in the AsiaPacific region.
Global Energy Ventures
The study looked at exporting green hydrogen at volumes of 50,000; 200,000; and 400,000 tonnes per year at distances of between 2,000 and 6,000 nautical miles, comparing compressed hydrogen with the other possible supply chains, liquified hydrogen and ammonia.
“When compared to liquefaction and ammonia, we have demonstrated C-H2 is the simplest, with minimal technical barriers to achieve commercialisation in timelines for large-scale projects seeking a transport solution.”
“GEV will now accelerate its plan to address key markets for green hydrogen, alongside advancing the C-H2 Ship approvals from American Bureau of Shipping expected in [the first half of] 2021 and define our own green hydrogen export project in Australia to support the construction of a pilot scale C-H2 Ship.”
The C-H2 Ship can carry up to 2,000 tonnes of hydrogen in its containment system made up of two 20 metre diameter tanks in the hull of the ship. The company says its design “eliminates the requirement for onsite storage, as the C-H2 Ship is itself the storage.”
The company described its move to develop a compressed hydrogen ship as a “natural progression to meet a market requirement for the storage and marine transportation of hydrogen,” as it draws on decades of experience in the design and engineering of pressure vessels, previously envisioned for compressed natural gas.
GEV says the scoping study shows its compressed hydrogen supply chain is economically “very competitive” compared to shipping liquefied hydrogen or ammonia at distances of 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 kms). As the company notes, that is roughly the distance between northern tips of Australia and Singapore.
It’s C-H2 shipping remains competitive to 4,500 nautical miles (8,300 kms) – opportunely, the distance from Australia to Japan, South Korea and China.
Global Energy Ventures
With this in mind, the company says it will focus on exporting from project locations in the mid-west of Western Australia, such as Geraldton, across to Queensland. Both of these states have recently seen considerable funds allocated to the development of green hydrogen industries.
As the company notes, its plan will require massive renewable energy generation, such as that from the Asian Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Approved by government last October, GEV is relying on the promise that the hub will become a top green hydrogen production point.
The ultimately goal is to get the green hydrogen produced in Australia to markets expected to be hydrogen demand centres, including South Korea, Japan, and parts of China. 
Europe is also expected to be a importer of Australia’s green hydrogen, but given that GEV’s ship only appears competitive at ranges under 8,300 kms, the company is understandably focussing on South-East Asian markets at present.
With a US Patent application already filed for GEV’s C-H2 ship in December 2020, the company now plans to undertake a detailed marketing plan for the C-H2 supply chain as a “competitive and viable alternative for the ‘port to port’ export of green hydrogen from Australia,” as shown below.
Global Energy Ventures
The company’s 2021 will also see the development of its own green hydrogen export project to support the construction of a pilot scale C-H2 Ship.
The only material barrier, according to GEV, is the company achieving American Bureau of Shipping C-H2 Ship approvals. However, the company says it expects an Approval in Principle in the first half of 2021.
If all goes according to plan on the approvals front, the company is confident it will reach its target of Final Class Approval in 2022.
In terms of technical risk, the scoping study found GEV’s compressed hydrogen supply chain to have a lower technical risk compared to liquified hydrogen and ammonia. “The C-H2 supply chain consists of compressors, pipework, loading infrastructure and C-H2 Ship Fleet. Hydrogen compressors (designed for pressure as high as 700 bar) have been in operation for decades with the associated piping and loading equipment having already been developed for various onshore applications,” the company noted.
Global Energy Ventures
Just last month, GEV announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Canadian-headquartered fuel-cell manufacturer Ballard Power Systems to design and develop a hydrogen fuel cell system for its C-H2 Ship.
Ballard will be responsible for the design of the fuel cell system, using its trademarked FC Wave Technology, and will assist GEV with the integration of the system into the design of the ship. “During 2021-2022, both parties will work collaboratively to complete a final design and procure all necessary approvals, and full costing for the C-H2 Ship, utilising a Ballard FC System,” GEV’s statement said.
Important to note, GEV’s scoping study was premised on the notion that it would be provided a constant supply of green hydrogen by a third party at a price of US$2/kg (AU$2.6/kg) at a pressure of 20 bar. It also assumed port facilities at both the supply and customer points were made available at no cost for all three supply chains.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/02/ge-chooses-australia-to-launch-its-solar-inverter-range/,"INVERTERS,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 2, 2021",GE chooses Australia to launch its solar inverter range,"The General Electric, or GE as its perhaps better known, branded inverters are actually being manufactured by Chinese company, GoodWe, under the name ‘GE Solar Inverter’.
The range includes three inverter solutions, the first of which is the residential-aimed GEP 3 –5 kW single-phase inverter, which has 2 MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking). The second is also for rooftop solar systems, but is larger – a GEP 5 –10 kW single-phase inverter with 3 MPPT.
The third caters towards commercial and industrial sector – the GEP 29.9 – 60 kW has up to 6 MPPT and is a three-phase inverter.
All three of the products are backed by a 10 year warranty, and can be purchased from GE Solar Inverter’s nominated partners, One Stop Warehouse and MMEM Greentech. 
Exactly how much the inverters cost is not yet clear. However, in its statement announcing the product launch on Monday, GE Licensing’s Senior Managing Director, Thomas Buccellato, mentions targeting “the high end of the market,” but further down the statement GE labels the products cost-effective, which i slightly confusing.
As for choosing GoodWe to produce its inverter range, GE says the Chinese company was selected as its licensed partner in 2020 as it moved into renewable energy (established 130 years ago, GE has previously been involved in making aircraft engines, oil and gas production equipment, medical imaging, and a suit of industrial products).
“As part of the rigid licensed partner selection process, solar inverter manufacturers were carefully scrutinised in every minute detail and assessed against a list of carefully drafted selection criteria put together by a group of elite researchers and scientists,” GE’s statement reads.
“GoodWe is the right choice,” Buccellato adds.
With the suite of new inverters available (at least for now) in Australia only, GE says its goal is to be “major technological innovator in the ever-growing Australian solar industry.”

According to Infrastructure Australia’s Chair, Julieanne Alroe, the list “provides a $59 billion pipeline of investments ready for delivery and nationally significant priorities for Australia’s governments to progress in the near, medium and longer term.”
Of the projects added to the list this year, many relate to transitioning Australia to a low-carbon future. “Investing in new sources of energy is a priority for the nation,” Alroe said in the report’s foreword. “We are committed to providing timely, transparent and evidence-based investment advice for governments at all levels.”
Infrastructure Australia is proposing distributed batteries, large-scale battery energy storage systems and utility-scale pumped hydro to support the National Energy Market’s (NEM) growing renewable energy generation and phase out of coal-fired generators.
“It is likely that a diverse mix of technologies will be required to support the NEM,” the report notes.
It wants to see these changes rollout in the next five to 15 years.
The expansion of Australia’s Renewable Energy Zones (REZ), either by enlarging existing zones or starting new ones, was deemed by the body to be on the High Priority list nationally, with Infrastructure Australia listing a timeframe of between now and 15 years for the government to get cracking.
It suggests the infrastructure within these REZs could include new large-scale wind, solar and hydro, saying co-locating investments is key to reducing overall investment costs.
Echoing broadly held hopes that Australia will become a world-leading green hydrogen exporter, the infrastructure advisor wants to either see upgrades or new infrastructure for electricity and gas networks, water supply networks, refuelling stations, roads, rail and ports. It hopes this will ultimately put Australia’s ducks in a row when green hydrogen production begins here in earnest.
Over the next five years, the body is calling for the development of a network of fast-charging EV stations near national highways.  It also wants to see policies and regulation developed to support charging technology adoption. It notes complementary investment in network infrastructure may be required to ensure Australia’s notoriously rickety grids can keep up with demand.
“By 2040, electric vehicles (EVs) are projected to account for 70% to 100% of new vehicle sales and at least 30% of the vehicle fleet in Australia. According to the Electric Vehicle Council, more than 19,500 EVs have been sold in Australia since 2011. In 2019, sales increased by 200%, with over 6,700 EVs sold,” the report noted.
Sun Cable’s ambitious 13 GW Australia-ASEAN Power Link, which would be the world’s biggest solar farm, continues to shine bright, with the Australian government including the mega-project on its Priority Initiative List.
“The Northern Territory has a comparative advantage in producing renewable energy, due to its vast land mass, low population density, solar resource and proximity to energy-intense markets in the Indo-Pacific region,” the report noted.
It is proposing a large-scale solar generation and storage project, coupled with appropriate transmission infrastructure, to service domestic and potentially overseas markets – noting that such an undertaking is contingent on market testing.
The proposed timeline for the project is in the next five to ten years.
Following in the footsteps of Western Australia’s stand-alone power system (SAPS or SPS) rollout, the group is proposing similar steps for remote towns in the NT. Additionally, the body is advocating Western Australia continue its investment in off-grid systems for remote communities, noting the South West Interconnected System, which powers the state, is in need for transformation.
Given the boom in demand for lithium, Infrastructure Australia is calling for the port in West Australia’s Pilbara region to be expanded.
“Growing general cargo demand will strain capacity at existing Pilbara ports, such as the ports of Port Hedland and Dampier.
“This growth is driven by the development of several spodumene (lithium) projects in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, responding to increasing demand for renewable energy, lithium and other metals from the consumer electronics, electric vehicles and energy storage industries,” the report noted.

Publicity was helped by the fact that FMG Chairman Andrew ‘ Twiggy’ Forrest and his executives have spent much of the pandemic on a private green journey, putting serious miles on the engine of the FMG jet in a four-month global effort to secure green energy partnerships. 
Clearly, FFI is looking to put its name on the map as much as criss-cross it. So it is no surprise that Forrest wanted some big names to head the team. This week, FMG announced those names, former Director-General of the Office of National Intelligence, Nick Warner, who joins FFI as a Special Advisor International Affairs, and former Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who is to join as Australian Fortescue Future Industries (AFFI) Chairman, effective immediately. 
Turnbull has been an outspoken advocate of renewable energy since his days as Environment Minister over a decade ago, and as Forrest put it in a letter to the Australian Stock Exchange, “Mr Turnbull has been involved in key policy decisions that have not only altered Australian society but also have international implications for other countries facing similar issues including the environmental conservation and energy crises.” 
Turnbull has not been shy of criticising his former party since he left office either, particularly when it comes to climate and energy. “He will bring a level of vital experience as we continue our journey to bring FFI to a global audience,” Forrest continued. 
It is hoped that Turnbull, who has both lamented and been a victim of the sycophantic polarisation in Australian politics over the last decade, particularly on the climate issue, will have more success in pushing renewable energy through the private sector. 
Similarly, Nick Warner, a highly experienced Australian diplomat and intelligence official with a long history of regional partnership will, says Forrest, bring his expertise on global intelligence, and critical experience understanding foreign Governments to the fore as FFI explores green hydrogen opportunities. 
FMG has already agreed to partner South Korean steelmaker Posco in a cooperative green hydrogen business. 
FMG’s share price has more than doubled in the last year, making it Australia’s fourth-biggest listed company. Of course, much of this surge has to do with the rising iron ore price during the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is clear that Forrest himself is not sitting back and enjoying his mining billions. The magnate is on a mission to transform his empire into a global green force.

An international group of researchers has replaced graphite with a new compound as porous-negative-anode material in lithium-ion batteries for household appliances from smartphones to electric vehicles.
The novel material is composed of porous nanostructured microspheres made of copper, iron, and iron oxide with the formula Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4.
The microspheres were synthesised through a one-step spray pyrolysis method, which is a technique used for temperature decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen. This process is known for providing excellent rate capability and high cycling stability and is used in the chemical industry to produce ethylene, carbon, and chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, as well as to produce coke from coal.
An aqueous solution with ions of the special metals was converted into fog through an ultrasound technique and the water was evaporated at 1200 degrees Celsius, which decomposed the original metal salts. The process enabled the formation of micron or submicron spheres with the levels of porosity that are required for lithium-ion storage.
The new anode material is claimed to provide three times more capacity than current commercially available batteries and increase the number of charge-discharge cycles by five times compared to other promising alternatives to graphite. “This improvement is achieved due to a synergistic effect with a combination of a special nanostructure and the composition of used elements,” said researcher Evgeny Kolesnikov.
“The synergistic effect among the different cations, as well as the nano-dimension coupled with a hollow interior and surface porosity of the electrode materials, not only facilitate li-ion and electron transportation kinetics but also accommodate large volume expansion,” the research team explained. No information was provided on the cost of the novel material and the manufacturing process.
The new material was presented in the study Hollow-structured Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 as a novel negative electrode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries, published in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds. The members of the research team came from Russia’s National University of Science and Technology (NUST), the Seoul National University of Science and Technology in Korea, India’s SRM Institute of Science and Technology, and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

A research group from the Zuyd University of Applied Sciences and the Maastricht University in the Netherlands have sought to define the profiles of homeowners that could be interested in installing solar power generators on their roofs.
In the study Not all homeowners are alike: a segmentation model based on a quantitative analysis of Dutch adopters of residential photovoltaics, published in Social Sciences, the Dutch group explained that, according to the so-called Diffusion of Innovation theory, which examines how ideas are spread among groups of people, homeowners tend to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a rooftop solar array in relation to their personal situation and the perceived characteristics of the technology.
The scientists developed a segmentation model that is claimed to better assess the heterogeneity of potential new adopters compared to previous methods, as it takes into account the homeowners’ educational background and profession and their environmental commitment. They collected their data from 1,325 PV system owners located in the city region of Parkstad Limburg in the Netherlands. Statistical descriptive analyses and nonparametric tests were used to analyze the data and five segmentation groups were identified.
The first group identified by the academics is represented by environmentally motivated persons with no technical or financial-economic backgrounds. This homeowner typology tends to be influenced by the experiences of other prosumers and can be targeted through existing social networks for the promotion of the PV technology. The most trusted sources for them are neighbours, family and friends.
The second group is made of environmentally motivated persons with technical backgrounds and no financial-economic backgrounds. These are more attracted by the technical characteristics of a PV installation and usually have previous experience with energy matters. “This group can be used and facilitated by policymakers and companies as an ambassador for energy renovation measures such as residential PV,” the study notes.
Environmentally motivated persons with technical and financial-economic backgrounds are those forming the third group, which the researchers defined as very similar to the third group, with the advantage of showing more ability to assess the economic viability of a project.
The fourth group is composed of environmentally motivated persons with financial-economic backgrounds and no technical backgrounds, which are said to be those with lower environmental commitment. “In addition, this group finds inclusivity (everyone can join) in a project less important,” the research group explained.  “Consequently, these two aspects can be highlighted less in communication and marketing to target this group more effectively.”
The last group, made of less environmentally motivated people, comprises all homeowners that do not show interest in improving their “identity expression” when they deploy a rooftop array. “In addition, they trust their system less, which can be countered by a clear explanation of both the RPV system and the conditions of joining the project,” the scientists affirmed.
The findings of the study show that the differences between the five categories are significant. These substantial differences are related to the level of environmental concern, the level of influence of their social network, previous experience with energy or the perceived characteristics of a PV system, such as complexity and aesthetics.
“These insights can be used by policymakers and the public and private sectors to promote RPV more effectively by targeting them more adequately,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/02/perovskite-solar-cell-with-cesium-titanium-dioxide-nanotubes/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA,PAKISTAN,SAUDI ARABIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 2, 2021",Perovskite solar cell with cesium-titanium dioxide nanotubes,"From pv magazine Global. 
An international research group has developed a perovskite solar cell with strong thermal stability and enhanced electron injection by using special nanotubes made of cesium-titanium dioxide (Cs-TiO2).
The scientists used titanium sheets with 99.4% purity, 1 mm thickness, and a length of 50 mm. The cell was fabricated with a two-step electrochemical anodization process and was then encapsulated with Cs nanoparticles, after being doped with a Cs-based solution. The C2-TiO2 nanotubes were then annealed at 450 C. The solar cell is based on methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3),  which is a perovskite with high photoluminescence quantum yield.
The researchers fabricated the nanotubes with a regular, ordered structure, which they say is necessary to achieve high levels of power conversion efficiency in the solar cell. This efficiency is proportional to the length of the nanotubes themselves.
“If the nanotube length is in between 1 micrometer (μm) to 20 μm then the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) increases and reaches up to 80% at 20 μm length resulting in an increase in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells,” they said, adding that 20 μm is a reasonable distance for an electron to travel and to achieve higher efficiency.
The academics said that the metal ions of the dopant material they used to produce the nanotubes have a better ability to accept electrons.
“The doped metal can easily trap the conduction electrons enabling the reduction in electron-hole pair recombination,” they said.
They used ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) to compare the performance of their solar cell with a similar cell designed with TiO2 nanotubes without Cs doping. The thermal performance of the two devices was measured through thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The thermal assessment showed that the doped nanotubes have excellent thermal stability under temperatures ranging up to 800 C. They also found that they lose roughly 1% of their weight at around 150 C.
The analysis showed that cesium atom doping effectively facilitates electron transport by reducing recombination reactions. The researchers said that the Cs-TiO2 based perovskite solar cell exhibited superior performance, resulting in an 18.67% jump in short-circuit current and a 22.28% increase in power conversion efficiency from the reference cell. “The doping process can be performed at a low cost, as we used an optimized concentration of cesium of only 0.05 M,” research principal author, H.M. Asif Javed, told pv magazine.
“The improvement in solar cell parameters can be attributed to enhanced extraction of the photo-generated charge carriers in the device,” the researchers concluded.
They described the cell in “Encapsulation of TiO2 nanotubes with Cs nanoparticles to enhance electron injection and thermal stability of perovskite solar cells,” which was recently published in Surfaces and Interfaces. The research team included scientists from Pakistan’s University of Agriculture Faisalabad and the National University of Sciences and Technology, China’s Xi’an Jiao Tong University and Jiangsu University, and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia.
