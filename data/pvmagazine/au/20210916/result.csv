ACE Power co-founder and director of development Koovashni Reddy told pv magazine Australia four of the company’s solar projects – the 140 MW Kerang and 52 MW Tatura East solar farms in Victoria, and the 129 MW Burdekin and 72 MW Mareeba solar farms in Queensland – have already been approved.
“Four of the projects have planning approval and we’re progressing the planning approvals on the others,” she said. “And we’re progressing the network connections on all of the projects.”
The projects, including the 108 MW Yabula Solar Farm in Queensland, the 71 MW Red Cliffs Solar Farm in Victoria, and the 150 MW Narrabri and Forbes solar farms and 150 MW Jones Creek wind farm in New South Wales, are set for completion between 2024 and 2025. All of will include battery energy storage systems with size and duration yet to be determined.

Reddy said the solar and wind portfolio, purchased from Australian renewable energy developer CleanGen Projects, will help to strengthen and stabilise the NEM and is expected to produce more than 2,700 GWh of clean energy each year, equivalent to powering more than 450,000 homes or removing 624,000 cars off the road.
Reddy, who founded CleanGen in 2012 and teamed up with former Wirsol Energy executives Mark Hogan and Andy Scullion to establish ACE Power, said the company will develop, build, own and operate the renewable energy assets.
“It’s a new model where we perform all of the functions as opposed to just parts of it and then sell it off,” she said.
“We are well placed in the renewable energy market with our access to projects, funding and proven delivery team, aiming to achieve nothing short of excellence.”
Scullion, who has been appointed director of operations at ACE Power, is a former managing director of Wirsol where he delivered more than 575 MW of solar and battery storage projects across Australia.
“I am looking forward to deploying our industry knowledge and technical experience to deliver clean, reliable and economic renewable energy solutions for the Australian community,” he said.
The launch of ACE Power comes despite a slowdown in Australia’s large-scale renewable energy market and Reddy said the federal government’s lack of clear policy shouldered much of the blame.

“For solar and renewables to grow we need clear policy, and the government policy is sadly lacking,” she said.
“We don’t need government intervention, we need government leadership which means emissions targets and that will translate into the market, building business confidence.”
Reddy, whose resume includes time at Pacific Power, AGL, Energy Australia and Integral Energy, said in the absence of clear federal government policy, the state governments have stepped up, pointing to the grid strengthening and renewable incentives rolled out in NSW, Victoria and Queensland.
“The biggest issue in the market at the moment is the lack of grid strength,” she said.
“The market has stagnated over the past two to three years because of the issues with system strength but we see that changing with all of the new investment from state governments.
“The new transmission lines coming through will really help us get connected sooner rather than later.”
The launch of ACE Power marks Pelion’s entry into the Australian market and founding partner Jeremias Henrich said he excited by the prospects.
“We are very excited to make our debut in the Australian market and look forward to supporting ACE Power’s growth,” he said.
“Renewables is the key sector for Pelion globally and Australia is one the most promising markets based on its fundamentals.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/16/australian-generator-teams-with-japanese-players-on-3-gw-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",Australian generator teams with Japanese players on 3 GW green hydrogen project,"Queensland generator Stanwell and Japan’s largest hydrogen supplier Iwatani Corporation will lead a $10.4 million feasibility study to investigate the commercial viability of developing a 3 GW electrolysis plant at Gladstone with the view to producing green hydrogen for export to Japan and use in local industry.
When built, the proposed green hydrogen project would be the largest in Queensland – commencing production in the mid-2020s, the project would scale up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity by the early 2030s.
The project aims to produce up to 36,500 tonnes per annum of renewable hydrogen and export to Japan from 2026, scaling up to 328,500 tonnes per annum in 2031 to meet forecast demand.
Stanwell and Iwatani, which supplies 70%  of Japan’s hydrogen market, have already completed a planning study for the project and will now commence a detailed feasibility study to examine the commercial viability of the project.
The study is being supported by investment from a broader consortium including Sydney-based energy infrastructure business APA Group and Japanese companies Kansai Electric Power Corporation, Marubeni Corporation and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.
The consortium partners, which have expertise across the hydrogen supply chain – including renewable energy, hydrogen production, liquefaction, shipping and offtake – will provide in-kind and financial contributions towards the feasibility study.

Stanwell acting CEO Adam Aspinall said the involvement of international and Australian counterparts would be critical in developing the state’s emerging hydrogen industry.
“While there’s still a way to go for hydrogen to be commercial, collaboration with key partners across all parts of the supply chain is critical to helping drive down the cost of hydrogen technologies and supporting the development of the industry,” he said.
Stanwell has already secured a 236-hectare site at Aldoga, west of Gladstone, for the hydrogen production base and a ~100-hectare site is to be acquired at the Port of Gladstone to serve as a hydrogen liquefaction and loading base.
The project aims ultimately to export green hydrogen in liquid form to Japan, as well as supply large industrial customers in the Central Queensland region.
APA chief executive and managing director Rob Wheals said the region is ideally suited for the renewable energy project, experiencing favourable weather conditions for more than 300 days a year.
“Queensland has some of the best sun and wind resources in Australia, making it well placed to not only develop an export hydrogen supply chain, but demonstrate the benefits of unlocking green hydrogen in our regions,” he said.
“Australia’s advantages in hydrogen are enormous and this project could be a game-changer in helping Queensland develop a hydrogen industry at scale.”
The project has attracted financial support from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) which this week announced it has awarded the project up to $2.17 million in funding.
The feasibility study will examine production technology, the construction of hydrogen liquefaction plants and liquefied hydrogen carriers, associated finance and environmental assessments, and commercialisation models.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said the study presents a “significant opportunity” to accelerate the development of export opportunities for renewable hydrogen in Australia.
“Australia’s vast solar and wind resources and our proven ability to export energy products mean we are well placed to build a large-scale competitive hydrogen export industry in the future,” he said.
“Feasibility studies like this are a necessary and crucial step to build the case to attract the finance required for large, impactful projects.”

The study marks another step in the transition of the Central Queensland region from a  traditional coal and gas hub to a green hydrogen hotspot.
Earlier this year, London-based Eco Energy World announced plans for a 200 MW green hydrogen plant with 100 MW of energy storage in Gladstone while Japanese trading giant Sumitomo also plans to build a hydrogen production plant in the region.
Spanish renewable energy developer Acciona Energía is also eyeing the region, last month revealing it had received approval to expand its Aldoga Solar Farm from 250 MW to 600 MWp to support the development of Gladstone’s green hydrogen hub.
Gladstone also recently joined the National Energy Resources Australia (NERA) network of hydrogen technology clusters, which seeks to seed innovation and productivity by interconnecting players in the hydrogen field.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/16/price-increases-hit-us-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2021",Price increases hit US solar,"From pv magazine USA
Solar prices rose quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in every U.S. market segment, according to the Q2 U.S. Solar Market Insight report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
The trifecta of price increases was a first since Wood Mackenzie began modelling system price data in 2014. In the latest report, prices were found to have risen the most for the utility-scale segment, about 6% year-over-year. Many solar developers have sufficient inventory for 2021, but will likely begin to see price increases in 2022, the report said.
“Price increases, supply chain disruptions, and a series of trade risks are threatening our ability to decarbonize the electric grid,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in releasing the report.
Headwinds included recent import enforcement actions on Xinjiang metallurgical-grade silicon and two new tariff petitions that allege dumping by Chinese producers. Taken together, these actions could “significantly exacerbate supply chain constraints and increase solar system prices,” the report said.

The price increases and renewed trade uncertainty come at a critical time for the solar industry. Earlier in September, the U.S. Department of Energy released its Solar Futures Study examining solar’s role in decarbonising the nation’s electric power grid. It said that by 2035 the U.S. would need to quadruple its yearly solar capacity additions and provide 40% of the electricity on the grid, on the order of 1,000 GW.
By mid-century, solar energy would need to provide 1,600 GW on what by then would be a zero-carbon grid, the study said. Decarbonising the entire energy system could result in as much as 3,000 GW of solar by 2050 as result of increased electrification in the transportation, buildings, and industrial sectors.
But new forecasts from Wood Mackenzie showed that the U.S. on track to average just over 29 GW of new annual solar capacity additions through 2026. It said that pace “is far short” of what is needed to reach 2035 clean energy targets. To reach those targets, the solar industry must install more than 80 GW of solar annually from 2022 through 2035, the firm said.
In June, a “Withhold Release Order” was issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). The order targeted a company called Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., which is located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The government order instructed personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
Price increases, supply chain disruptions, and a series of trade risks are threatening our ability to decarbonize the electric grid,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in releasing the report. The order was issued in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labor in the solar supply chain originating in the Xinjiang region of China.
By mid-August, reports began to surface that solar module shipments to the U.S. were already being detained by CBP agents. Reports said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents, and that the manufacturer may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
Canadian Solar also was said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar may have had six testing samples detained in July.
Sources said that while the volume of equipment that appears to have been detained is small, concern is rippling through the solar sector that the risk is potentially much larger. A problem is being able to prove to CPB agents that a solar module’s supply chain is free of forced labor input.
But obtaining that evidence is difficult because China so far is prohibiting most second- and third-tier suppliers from cooperating with the supply chain audits that are needed to prove to customs agents that no forced labor was used in the supply chain.
To a degree, it’s a matter of semantics. Chinese officials vigorously deny that forced labor even exists in the country. Terms like worker relocation are preferred instead, and don’t suggest that any alleged coercion was involved. As a result, Chinese officials are barring companies from taking part in audits that are premised on Western allegations of forced labor.
Without a clear audit trail, it’s difficult to know how much product from Hoshine is included in refined polysilicon.
The risk facing the solar industry is that more than 90% of the world’s silicon-based ingot and wafer manufacturing takes place in China, creating a supply chain choke point that may prove more vulnerable to customs enforcement than was first thought. Without a clear audit trail, it’s difficult to know how much product from Hoshine is included in refined polysilicon.
An even larger challenge may come from the antidumping challenge lodged with the U.S. Department of Commerce in August.
In that action, a group of companies (that declined to be named but claimed to be players in the U.S. solar industry) asked Commerce to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Data from the Energy Department showed that in 2020, Vietnam was the leading exporter to the United States, followed by Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand. The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
The department is expected to make a preliminary determination in the case in early October. Trade experts suggest that the complaint may have merit. If Commerce does agree to take up the case, it could pose a problem for the U.S. solar sector. That’s because although it would have until next summer to issue a finding, any tariffs that result would be retroactive to when the Commerce Department investigation began. Sources said that few projects could weather the impact of what could be a sizeable tariff on any affected imported components.
Michelle Davis, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the second quarter market report, said that the industry is “bumping up against multiple challenges” that range from elevated equipment prices to complex interconnection processes. She said that addressing these issues “will be critical to expanding the industry’s growth and meeting clean energy targets.”
The second quarter report said that the solar industry will likely continue to set annual installation records until the solar Investment Tax Credit fully phases down in 2024. Industry growth is expected to flatline in 2025 and 2026. These forecasts do not account for additional trade actions, which represent what Wood Mackenzie call “a substantial downside risk” to its outlooks.
