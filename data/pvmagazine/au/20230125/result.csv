The company says the tool will be able to offer a personalised digital solar quote in less than three minutes, provide estimated carbon and energy savings, and even give a rooftop solar panel layout.
The feature will first be launched in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, before being expanded to other states.
In its announcement, Acacia pointed to surveys from consumer advocacy group Choice, which found one third of solar panel owners had bad experiences during sales and installation. It says its tool will afford customers knowledge without subjecting them to aggressive sales tactics, for which the solar industry has unfortunately become notorious. 
To access the feature, users will upload their energy bill to the Acacia app and receive their solar quotes. Then, when they are ready to begin talking to an installer, they can use the platform to connect with a curated list of local businesses – something the company says it will vet for quality.
“We are putting the decision and control in the hands of consumers,” Anil Sagaram, Acacia Founder and CEO, said. “The previous process was heavily sales driven with far too much friction. One of the biggest challenges in getting solar is having to dodge calls from multiple sales people, and not knowing who to trust.”
“Australian’s want to embrace solar and now with Acacia they have a digital experience that allows them to take the first step without the pressure of dealing with the worst parts of the process,” he added.
The new solar feature will work alongside Acacia’s energy offering, which has integrated the data and research behind Greenpeace’s Green Energy Guide, allowing users to easily compare their current energy plan against an open menu of electricity providers.
Acacia says its platform is independent and not associated with solar product product providers.
Solar sales tactics have come under increasing scrutiny, with the Victorian government in 2021 introducing new rules for solar businesses and energy retailers banning on door-to-door sales of products, among other things.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/25/queensland-to-build-75m-vanadium-rare-earth-processing-facility/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 25, 2023","Queensland to build $75m vanadium, rare earth processing facility for burgeoning battery industries","Originally intended for the processing of vanadium, the Queensland government has expanded its ambition for a critical minerals demonstration facility in Townsville, northern Queensland, broadening its scope to include processing for cobalt, high purity alumina, and rare earth elements.
Speaking from the Sun Metals green industrial precinct in Townsville, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the $75 million facility – more than seven times the original investment – will be located at Cleveland Bay Industrial Park between the existing Sun Metals zinc refinery and Glencore Copper refinery.
“This facility will prove up the commerciality of critical minerals in Queensland,” she said. “The opportunities in North Queensland include mining and processing the minerals for vanadium, zinc bromine and iron flow batteries, cobalt and nickel used in lithium-ion batteries, high-purity alumina for LEDs, batteries and semiconductors, rare earth elements used in electronics and silicon for solar panels and semiconductors.”
The plant is expected to commence operations by the first half of 2025.

The move was welcomed by Queensland community group Solar Citizens, who have long advocated for Townsville to become a renewable manufacturing precinct. “Our research found that turning Townsville into a hub for renewable-powered manufacturing and renewable hydrogen production would create more than 5,350 ongoing jobs and 19,600 construction job years by 2030,” the group said.
To that end, Australia’s federal Albanese government last week unveiled a $70 million investment towards developing a green hydrogen hub in Townsville.
Coming back to the critical minerals processing facility, Queensland Minister for Resources Scott Stewart said materials like vanadium have the potential to be “the Eureka moment” for north Queensland.
“Global demand for vanadium in batteries and high-quality steel is expected to outpace supply before the end of the decade,” Stewart said. “Queensland has world class, highly economic deposits of vanadium located in accessible marine shale.”
“There is already interest from companies in using the facility and once the market sees the quality of Queensland’s valuable resources for themselves, they will have confidence to invest in commercial scale facilities and downstream manufacturing infrastructure.”

The announcement builds on a broader strategy by the Queensland government to become the a hub for battery-related industries (a position it will likely share with West Australia – home to massive lithium deposits). 
Earlier this month, the Queensland government published its Battery Industry Opportunities for Queensland discussion paper, delivered by consultancy Accenture. It concluded Queensland’s battery industry has the potential to contribute $1.3 billion in gross value added (GVA) to the state.
Accenture also found Queensland has significant competitive advantages entering the battery materials industries, afforded through its natural resources, existing capabilities in mining, refining to chemicals and active materials and low future energy costs from renewable energy. Moreover, it has the ability to position itself as a “reliable participant” in global battery value chains.

This reliability is increasingly being understood as a serious drawcard in Australia, where momentum is growing across the country to develop battery industries.
There is some debate around whether Australia could take this as far as battery manufacturing itself, but there appears to be fairly uniform consensus that ‘value adding’ capacity for batteries, which includes things like refining, processing, and manufacturing materials onshore, would greatly add to the economy. 
In the Queensland discussion paper, Accenture forecast domestic battery demand will total 90 GWh to 2030, while global battery demand is expected to reach 2,045 GWh by that time – an 11 fold growth rate from 2020.
While there is little doubt this would bring both huge revenues and jobs, such industries carry with them considerable environmental impacts. 
Speaking at a media briefing last November, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners co-founder and Managing Partner David Scaysbrook, noted President Biden’s recent Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to supercharge Australia’s critical mineral position. “The question is, do we have the stomach for that?” 
For nearly 20 years from 1998 to 2017, China mined essentially all of the world's rare earth elements.
The U.S., Australia, and Myanmar have notably reduced this % since 2018. But China still overwhelmingly dominates refining and manufacturing.

Until now, the vast majority of critical materials processing has been done in China, which has been willing to embrace some of the more impactful processes on the environment – processes Australia has historically baulked at.
Tim Buckley, director of Climate Energy Finance, agrees public opposition has the potential to seriously undercut the burgeoning critical materials industries. 
He thinks unless governments, namely the federal government, enforce “sensible regulations” around the whole ecosystem early, including thinking about recycling, processing facility efficiency and carbon standards and pollution, the backlash could be a “constant battle.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/25/construction-begins-on-93-mw-victorian-solar-farm-as-owner-plans-first-hybrid-venture/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 25, 2023",Construction begins on 93 MW Victorian solar farm as owner plans first hybrid venture,"The $130 million solar farm is expected to take around 18 months to construct and will produce around 200 GWh of energy per annum once operational. It will see 167,000 PV modules deployed alongside civil and electrical infrastructure.
While the 93 MW project was sold to Enel Green Power, the Australian renewable energy platform of Italian utilities giant Enel Group, it appears Leeson Group has maintained some level of involvement – with the news of start of construction announced through Leeson Group’s LinkedIn.
The Girgarre Solar Farm appears to have been something of a pet project for Peter Leeson, who discovered the site through a local real estate agent, picking it up from a diary farmer selling due to drought conditions, according an article on Leeson’s website. There are conflicting versions of exactly when this happened, with Leeson’s website saying it was 2015, and the LinkedIn post citing 2017.
Either way, it appears that after Enel Green Power purchased the site, Peter Leeson personally began an involved process of community engagement, which begun with hosting a lunch on-site with neighbours. This dedicated process apparently led to the Girgarre Solar Farm progressing through the planning and permitting stages with zero objections from the local community.

The project also apparently donated the revenues from a crop which sprang up on the site to the community. The unnamed crop generated $70,000 which was given to the Girgarre Development Group, who used it to upgrade shared facilities in town.
In mid 2022, it was widely reported Enel Group was looking to sell a substantial share in Enel Green Power to help fund an estimated 3.6 GW development pipeline in the country.
Swiss bank Credit Suisse was engaged to launch an auction for Enel Green Power’s Australian assets in August, and the Australian Financial Review reported Enel was looking to sell down 50% to 80% of the portfolio, preferring to remain involved as the asset manager.
Reports of bids emerged in August and ran through to September, but after that news of the sale died out. It isn’t clear if a major stake Enel Green Power’s portfolio was eventually sold.
Either way, just last week Enel Green Power announced it had received initial approvals from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for its first hybrid project in Australia – a 96 MW solar farm and 20 MW battery in the Central West and Orana Region of New South Wales.
The company is hoping to start construction on that project – located in one of the state’s first Renewable Energy Zones – by the middle of the year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/25/saltwater-flow-battery-for-large-scale-storage-unveiled-from-us-startup/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 25, 2023",Saltwater flow battery for large-scale storage unveiled from US startup,"From pv magazine Global
US-based tech startup Salgenx has unveiled a scalable saltwater flow battery for applications in renewable energy, telecommunication towers, oil well pumps, agriculture irrigation pumps, and greenhouse irrigation or lighting. The batteries are suitable for standalone storage or with solar or wind power.
“It is very suitable for solar power storage, with the added benefit of solar thermal storage in the salt water electrolyte tank,” CEO Gregory Giese told pv magazine.
The manufacturer said the new battery has an energy density of 125.7 Wh/L. It requires two large tanks filled with fluid electrolytes, one of which is saltwater and the other a proprietary electrolyte. The fluids are circulated through electrodes, which regulate the input and output of electricity from the battery.
The solution can be scaled by adding more electrodes and additional electrolyte tanks. Salgenx also offers the solution in 250 kW, 3 MWh, 6 MWh, 12 MWh, and 18 MWh configurations. The flow battery is membrane-free, unlike most redox flow batteries.
“The absence of the membrane saves huge upfront purchase costs, maintenance, and consumable expenses,” Salgenx says on its website.
The company claims that material costs of USD 5/kWh ($7.1), USD 257/kWh ($366) for system infrastructure, and a total system cost of USD 500,000, or USD 166/kW for the 3,000 kWh battery. The technology purportedly has a life expectancy of more than 25 years and a roundtrip efficiency of 91% at 10 mA/square centimetre.
The saltwater tank can be used simultaneously for thermal storage, in combination with a heat pump using carbon dioxide as a refrigerant.
“Typically the thermal savings using a heat pump and higher COP (coefficient of performance), may double that of electricity rate savings,” the company claims.
Salgenx develops the technology and sells licenses to third-party manufacturers to commercialise the solutions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/25/key-takeaways-from-abu-dhabis-world-future-energy-summit/,"EVENTS,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,POLICY,MIDDLE EAST",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 25, 2023",Key takeaways from Abu Dhabi’s World Future Energy Summit,"From pv magazine Global
The 2023 edition of the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi attracted most of the heavyweights of the Middle Eastern renewables industry, as well as all big manufacturers of solar modules and inverters from China. The event showed that pandemic disruptions and supply chain issues are not slowing down demand in the region’s markets.
Official figures on the numbers of exhibitors and attendants were not released prior to publication, but the size of the event has increased from years past, with some some observers estimating that it may have grown by up to 50%. The nature of attendees has also changed, with more professionals participating to search for business opportunities.
Several projects in the Middle East have been delayed in recent years, but now they are being resumed and are slowly going online. New projects are also being announced and big pipelines are consolidating in markets such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
However, local analysts are calling for a conservative approach to these markets, as they are driven by very low bids in energy auctions, with strong pressure on prices. However, the market is trying to find a balance between low prices and the volatility of the supply chain.
“We always considered the WFES the develop our strategy for the region in terms of products and technology,” Mohammed Saadi, head of technical services and product management at Chinese module maker JinkoSolar told pv magazine. “This is our second edition and we saw significant improvements. There are more global players and we also see consultants and media.”
Saadi said demand is increasing across the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
“For this and next year, we should ship up to 8 GW of solar modules in these markets,” he added, noting that the hottest markets for the utility-scale business might be Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Egypt, and Morocco. “For the distributed generation segments, the most interesting markets should be Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen, where last year we shipped more than 100 MW.”
Marwan Al Jaber, JA Solar‘s sales director for the Middle East, told pv magazine that the Chinese company received a lot of serious inquiries at the Abu Dhabi event.
“Demand is increasing even in some of those Middle East regions where there is no regulation and something is also now moving in the residential business,” he said. “The most active market right now is Saudi Arabia, especially for the utility scale segment, as well as for commercial and industrial projects.”
He said Lebanon is also growing, despite its deep financial crisis, due to chronic energy shortages.
“Solar energy is the most reliable source of electricity right now,” Al Jaber stated. “At this regard, Yemen is also an interesting market.”
Bright Sun, the chief marketing officer MEA&CA for China’s Longi, told pv magazine that the module manufacturer met new and old customers at the Abu Dhabi event.
“We see the market accelerating in MENA and we also see companies from Central Asia and Africa joining the event here,” added Sun, who claimed that regional demand will more than triple year on year for Longi in 2023.
“We already signed a deal for a big project in Saudi Arabia and also in the UAE and Qatar,” he said.
Mohit Shrimal, marketing director for Huawei, told pv magazine that this year was the fifth consecutive year that the inverter manufacturer has a presence at the Abu Dhabi event.
“It offers easy market access not only to the Middle East but also to Africa,” said Shrimal. “Inverter demand here is increasing despite the technology challenges and chip shortages and we expect a very fruitful five-year period.”
Mohammad Youssef, a spokesperson for Chinese inverter maker Sungrow, said the success of the Abu Dhabi event underscores the “prosperity” of the market.
The market will see strong growth in the utility-scale segment this year, but we also expect impressive growth in the distributed generation business,” he told pv magazine. “We also started to make first shipments for storage energy systems but, compared with more mature markets such as the United States and Europe, their economical viability remains challenging.
Ray Luiz, regional director of MENA for inverter maker TBEA, said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the most promising markets. He noted that both string and central inverters are gaining acceptance throughout the Middle East. “It depends on the client’s request, but we tend to offer both solutions in all these markets,” he said.
A spokesperson for Austrian inverter manufacturer Fronius said the Abu Dhabi event was well attended by PV product distributors.
“We keep seeing strong demand in the C&I business, although the residential segment remains limited in volumes,” the Fronius spokesperson said. “It will likely become a big market likely in the next couple of years. Jordan are Saudi Arabia probably the most promising markets in this regard, as well as Yemen and Lebanon.”
Given UAE’s green hydrogen ambitions, it is no surprise that Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ABSW), which also took place last week, gave pride of place to its Green Hydrogen Summit (GHS).
Executive Director Masdar Clean Energy Fawaz Al Muharrami told pv magazine that the company is aiming for 100 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. He said approximately 25% of this will be devoted to green hydrogen production (or its derivatives), with the target of producing 1 million tons of green hydrogen per annum by 2050.
But while green hydrogen is verging on becoming a buzzword before it becomes a booming market, at least one speaker at the ADSW Green Hydrogen Summit didn’t forget the key word – sustainable. Wale Shonibare – the African Development Bank’s director of energy financial solutions, policy and regulations – said that when it comes to green hydrogen project development in Africa, “we don’t want to repeat the mistakes of fossil fuels,” He added that “local communities” also deserve consideration.
“Africa’s No. 1 problem is energy access, so we need to integrate local communities into the value chain,” continued Shonibare, who noted that green hydrogen offers African nations an export market in hard currency which can be used to develop local infrastructure.
In the midst of entertaining the enormous scope of the green hydrogen future and how it can help hard to abate industries and fossil fuel dependent economies transition away from carbon-intensive resources, it was interesting to note the concept of “additionality” was also on the lips of attendees.
A tangential concern in green hydrogen development in developing regions like sub-Saharan African is the water intensity of inherent processes and how they might affect already water scarce areas. However, Masdar’s head of business development for green hydrogen, Dr. Faye Al Hersh, told pv magazine that the amount of water required for electrolysis is not as significant as some people might think.
“The majority of the water required for the green hydrogen production process is actually for cooling, and this does not need to be desalinated water, it can be seawater for example,” said Al Hersh.
