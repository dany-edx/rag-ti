After five engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors expressed interest in its Bristol Springs project, Frontier announced it has now narrowed the contest down to two.
The company plans to announce the contract in the fourth quarter, it says.
Frontier has not released the names of either of the two contenders, though Executive Chairman Grant Davey said both have “significant experience in the development of industrial solar development projects in Australia.”
Importantly, the current selection is only for Stage One of the project – the 114 MW solar farm on around 195 hectares near Waroona south of Perth.
The current EPC selection does not relate to the Stage Two 36.6 MW alkaline electrolyser for the hydrogen facility.

Frontier is hoping Bristol Springs will be one of the first commercial green hydrogen projects in Australia after it released news in June of a better than expected preliminarily study into the project.
Frontier recommenced trading on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in March after a strongly supported $8 million capital raising that the company said has validated its new clean energy strategy.
The Bristol Springs Solar Project is to built near the Worsley alumina refinery about 120 kilometres south of Perth, would have an initial generation capacity of 114 MW (DC) but Frontier said additional land acquisition opportunities are available that could allow for an increase up to 500 MW.
Frontier’s Managing Director Mike Young has said the company remains on track to commence construction in 2023, though it remains to be determined when the hydrogen element will be introduced.

“These are projects of national significance on a scale not seen since the construction of Snowy Hydro — bigger than Snowy Hydro,” the Premier said in her address on the plan.
The 2 GW Borumba Pumped Hydro project near Brisbane has been on the cards for some time and is slated for completion by 2030. 
The scale of the bigger facility, called the Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro project, has only been revealed today.
Dubbing it the “battery of the north,” Premier Palaszczuk said: “it will be the largest pumped hydro energy storage in the world, with 5 gigawatts of 24-hour storage and the potential for stage 1 to be completed by 2032.”
She said the preferred site for the project is 70 kilometres west of Mackay, north of Gladstone.
The world’s largest pumped hydro at Pioneer Burdekin, west of Mackay, will power half of our state. I like to call it ""The Battery of the North"". It will be bigger than Snowy Hydro, generating 2.5 times the electricity.
— Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) September 28, 2022

Palaszczuk emphasised the need for storage in the transition to a renewable energy system. “With climate change there will be more unseasonal rain and other weather events that impact on the reliability of renewables,” she said.
“These events can last for days… that’s why more pumped hydro energy storage is needed.”
“We will maintain majority public ownership of generation and 100% public ownership of transmission and distribution,” Queensland’s Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Mick de Brenni added.
As part of the $62 billion plan, the Queensland government is now aiming for 70% of the state’s energy supply to come from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035. These targets will be legislated, the Premier said.
For reference, currently less than a quarter of Queensland’s electricity comes from renewables.
Our Energy Workers Charter and Jobs Security Guarantee ensures workers will have the opportunity to continue careers with publicly-owned energy businesses or elsewhere in the public sector. We will sign this charter immediately following this address today. #StateofQLD #qldjobs
— Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) September 28, 2022

On top of the massive project slate, the Queensland government plans to convert its publicly owned coal power stations to clean energy hubs from 2027, reworking infrastructure and providing guarantees for workers.
“Infrastructure at the clean energy hubs will include: continuing to use the large spinning turbines at the power stations to provide strength for the energy system to take more renewables; grid scale batteries; gas and then later hydrogen power stations; and maintenance hubs for nearby government-owned renewable wind and solar farms,” Palaszczuk said.
Queensland community group Solar Citizens today welcomed the plan. “Our existing coal-fired power stations have strong grid connections so it’s clever to turn them into renewable energy hubs to save on infrastructure costs,” Solar Citizen’s Deputy Director Stephanie Gray said. “It’s also great news for local communities that jobs will be replaced onsite.”
“The Queensland Government’s ongoing commitment to maintaining majority public ownership of our electricity generation, and the additional $2.5 billion announced today for building new publicly-owned renewable plants, means that we can transform our energy system in a planned way that stimulates jobs in communities that need it,” Gray added.
The plan also includes a vision for a “Queensland SuperGrid” to connect solar, wind, battery and hydrogen generators across the state.
This new transmission, the government says, will unlock 22 GW of new renewable capacity – giving the state eight times its current level.

The vast majority of the government’s investment, 95%, will be made in regional Queensland.
“It is about turbo-charging new investment in new minerals, batteries and manufacturing,” Palaszczuk said.
Kane Thornton, CEO of the Clean Energy Council, praised the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan. “This is a bold and transformational plan that will set Queensland up to be a world leader on clean energy,” he said.

Something of a “demonstration” vehicle, the first release Warrego features a 60 kW fuel cell, a 260 kW electric engine and a range of more than 450 kilometres. The company says the model will be available to customers over the coming nine months “in line with availability of hydrogen.”
The ute is now undergoing final validation and verification testing procedures in the Netherlands, one of H2X’s first markets to take off, ahead of European and global certification. The company says Australian certification testing, including right hand drive models, will commence soon.
“It is true that we have had some frustrating delays over the past nine months, however, we are now well on track with our roll out plans,” H2X Global CEO and founder, Brendan Norman, said. The delays, Norman added, came down to supply chain issues which have affected manufacturing worldwide.

Based on the Ford Ranger, the company’s press officer Tony Blackie previously told pv magazine Australia the startup was seeking to establish the viability of hydrogen in light vehicles through the Warrego model – something oft considered dubious. 
Be that as it may, H2X said it clocked $50 million in order requests within four days of the Warrego Ute announcement last September. How much that figure grew over the last year isn’t known.
In terms of the nitty-gritty of the car, the Warrego’s fuel cell connects to a hybrid battery/supercapacitor electric drive system, with H2X’s launch video listing 416V, 8kW, 90K amps supercapacitor pack.
“This is connected to a 700-bar type 4 hydrogen tank system constructed of an advanced polymer and carbon fibre base,” the company outlined, noting the design delivers safety “with very long standards of operation.”
“While this will allow the car to work at the lower 350 bar compression it has the capability to run at much higher compression rates which will double the range per tank.”
The ute will be produced in both Europe and at H2X’s facility in Victoria.

“The Warrego is essentially a demonstration vehicle which we are able to offer to several customers in order to accelerate the availability of an AWD light commercial vehicles to customers,” Norman said.
“This application will be applied in a more optimised form in the Darling Delivery Van and Taxi/MPV targeted for release by the end of 2024 to support the large number of cities in Europe which will be closed off from diesel and petrol vehicles from 2025.”
Europe is really where the company is focussing its attention in terms of vehicles. Norman said this was for a number of reasons, though mainly because hydrogen is available at customer level in several cities where order status has been high and governments are keen to develop their hydrogen economy.
Australia has just a handful of hydrogen refuelling stations operating today, though there are more in the works. The limited supply, however, would put something of a dampener on the Warrego’s market, if it sticks to its timelines.
In the longer term, H2X is eyeing Australia’s agricultural sector. Earlier this month, it launched the first of its hydrogen-powered generators to the Australian market – built to replace traditional fossil-fuel fired gensets and provide green electricity for emergency supply and off-grid operations.

Ahead of the launch, the Premier tweeted the state would up its renewable energy targets from 50% by 2030 to now 70% by 2032.
“We’re taking real action on climate change, now,” she said on Twitter.

Palaszczuk described the plan, a year in the making, as “all about a future of cheaper, cleaner and secure energy for Queenslanders.” 
Around 95% of the state’s investment will be in regional Queensland, Palaszczuk says.
The announcement follows a suite of energy news from the state government, including an $776 million public investment in the proposed Tarong West Wind Farm in the state’s South Burnett region. It will make the project Australia’s largest state-owned wind farm.
Alongside this, the Premier announced on Monday the state had “flicked the switch” on four network or grid connected batteries, with the intention of soaking up the massive generation from rooftop solar systems in the state.

The first terawatt of solar PV installed globally took some 70 years to achieve, while the second will likely take only three. This was the observation made by Pierre Verlinden, the former chief scientist at Trina Solar and now the managing director of consultancy Amrock. Verlinden, when chairing a panel discussion on how the next terawatt of installed PV capacity can be accelerated.
The session rounded out the morning proceedings at the WCPEC-8, which saw the industry-shaping research of the UNSW’s Martin Green recognised through his receipt of the WCPEC Prize which, like the event, occurs only every four years. Marko Topič, from the Ljubljana Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Colorado State University was awarded the Becquerel Prize for his work in PV device and system measurement and simulation at the event
The mood on the first morning of the WCPEC-8 was high, with researchers clearly pleased to be meeting once again in person, after three years of disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, some disruptions did occur, with Marko Topič unable to attend in person having contracted the illness last week.
The opening proceedings of WCPEC-8 were further energised by “truly the first global energy crisis” – in the words of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Paolo Frankl, who spoke via video link. He argued that there is a pressing need for the “diversification” of PV manufacturing “to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities,” if solar is to rapidly scale.
Peter Fath, from manufacturing consultancy RCT Solutions delivered an invigorating presentation in which he suggested that vertical integration of PV production can not only deliver more stable industry growth but also a leveling of the playing field in terms of production cost – with his company’s analysis concluding the when subsidies, capital costs, and profit are removed from the analysis, European, US, Indian, and Chinese solar manufacturing would have similar cost structures.
“Don’t be afraid of the manufacturing cost … we are very, very close [between countries],” said Fath, who is the chairman of the PV division of the German Engineering Federation (VDMA) and the former CTO of equipment supplier centrotherm.
Fath argued that countries with large PV installations should target 50% of the PV modules installed to be domestically produced and that vertical integration presents many advantages and opportunities. He noted that all of the major Chinese PV producers were vertically integrated across ingot, wafer, cell and module, to varying degrees, in a model he
described as vertical integration 1.0. For 2.0, Fath includes the production of glass and polysilicon and pointed to six such highly integrated manufacturing projects underway currently in India.
“In this terawatt era we have to focus on the full supply chain,” said Fath. “Shortages [of certain materials] cannot continue if we are head towards TW scale.”
Fath noted he is speaking from experience, having spent the past three years working on the planning, design, and execution of the 2 GW Kalyon PV facility – which includes ingot, wafer, cell, and module capacity on the same site outside of the Turkish capital of Ankara.
Alongside technologists such as Fath, and researchers, the opening of WCPEC-8 featured a video address from Longi’s Li Zhenguo and panel comments from Enel Green Power’s Massimiliano Francone, with both companies sponsors of the event.
The WCPEC-8 continues through to Friday, Sept. 30.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/28/super-fast-long-life-aqueous-rechargeable-zinc-battery/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,IRAN,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2022","Super-fast, long-life aqueous rechargeable zinc battery","From pv magazine Global
As demand for battery energy storage systems grows, so does the realisation that not everything can hinge on single chemistry. Concerns around raw material cost and availability but also environmental footprint and safety of ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries are making room for alternative chemistries to be considered and advanced to commercialisation.
Aqueous rechargeable zinc-based batteries have been explored as a promising alternative due to their low cost, safety, environmental friendliness, and intrinsic non-flammable nature. However, their widespread adoption has been held back by their low Coulombic efficiency and the notorious dendritic growth at the zinc-based anodes, along with the fast capacity fading of the cathodes.
Now, an international group of researchers led by scientists from Tarbiat Modares University (TMU) in Iran have reported a high-performance and super-long-life rechargeable zinc battery. Their device features a mixed ZnCO3 and MnCO3 grafted onto a graphene aerogel (ZMG) negative electrode and a nanotubular sulfidated Ni-Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDHS) positive electrode.
“The input energy required to charge the battery can be provided by renewable energy sources. Note that the voltage of the solar panel should exceed 20-30% of the working voltage of the battery for efficient charging,” Abolhassan Noori, assistant professor at the TMU Department of Analytical Chemistry, told pv magazine.
By virtue of the improved conductivity and boosted electroactivity of the developed electrode active materials, the alkaline ZMG||LDHS supercapacitor-battery hybrid device has displayed excellent performance on a variety of criteria.
It delivered excellent capacity (356 mA h g−1 cathode at 12 A g−1) and rate capability (108 mA h g−1 cathode at 300 A g−1), extremely high specific energy (568 W h kg−1 cathode), and specific power (429 kW kg−1 cathode), along with a high output voltage (1.8 V).
In addition, the device exhibited what is termed as “unprecedented cycling stability” with 99.2% capacity retention after 17,000 cycles at 100% depth of discharge, thanks to an electrochemical pulse-driven regenerative mechanism.
The outstanding high energy and high-power performances are attributed to the favourable structural features of the electrode active materials and the synergistic effects among the constituent elements as well as the pseudocapacitive character of the negative electrode, resulting in an energy storage device that “outperforms most previously reported Zn-based energy storage devices,” the researchers said in “Super-Fast and Super-Long-Life Rechargeable Zinc Battery,”which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials.
