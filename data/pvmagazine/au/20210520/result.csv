Dubai’s first green hydrogen project has come into operation two years and a half after work on the facility began.
The plant is owned and operated by the Dubai Water and Electricity Authority (DEWA) and is linked to its Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, a 5 GW solar project combining PV and CSP that is being constructed in several phases.
The hydrogen plant was built by Siemens Energy Middle East, a unit of German industrial conglomerate Siemens, and is the first solar-powered green hydrogen facility in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
“This is a system that allows for buffering renewable energy production, both for fast response applications, as well as for long-term storage,” said DEWA CEO, Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer. “The plant has been built to accommodate future applications and test platforms for the different uses of hydrogen, including potential mobility and industrial uses.”
The company did not reveal further technical and financial details on the project. The plant is located at outdoor testing facilities in the Research and Development Centre of the giant solar park. “The hydrogen produced at the facility will be stored and deployed for re-electrification, transportation and other uses,” said Al Tayer in February 2019.
The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is now on the verge of entering phase V, is currently also hosting a pilot storage project based on NGK’s NAS Batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/20/lack-of-renewable-investment-a-missed-opportunity/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 20, 2021",Lack of renewable investment a missed opportunity,"The federal government has long pledged that technology, not taxes, will put Australia on the path to net zero. The good news is we have the technology we need to decarbonise, from solar panels (which Aussies helped to invent) and wind turbines to batteries and electric vehicles which require critical minerals that Australia has in abundance. What is needed is government support to accelerate the deployment of these technologies. Yet, such support was notably absent from the 2021 budget.
If the 2020 budget could be characterised as having pro-renewables investments exceeding $1bn announced under the guise of pro-gas rhetoric, Tuesday’s budget doubled down on gas not just in rhetoric but in over half-a-billion dollars in funding commitments. Given we have more leeway in this year’s budget to invest in the country’s future as we seek to rebuild post-pandemic, it is a missed opportunity to put Australia on the path to become a renewable superpower.
It is also somewhat baffling given the events of the last 12 months; increasing severity of extreme weather events and our 2019-20 bushfire season signalling what we face if climate change goes unchecked, COVID-19 creating an urgent need to shore up jobs, and the election of Joe Biden presaging the most ambitious pro-climate commitments of any developed country.
The new Biden administration has tabled its American Jobs Plan (also known as the Infrastructure Plan), which sets a new bar. It represents an investment of around 5.65% of America’s GDP in clean recovery stimulus measures. Other leading countries are committing between 1-2% of GDP over the next decade. Meanwhile, Australia’s current pledges equate to a mere 0.14% of GDP.
There are some positive steps. Investments in hydrogen generation – provided it is powered by renewables – and green steel are much needed to decarbonise our energy-intensive heavy industries. And funding to support Australian businesses with the uptake of more energy efficient industrial equipment and business practices is welcome.
But the comparative lack of investment will not serve Australia well in the long-term. Indeed, the consequences of inaction may be felt sooner than we think. Not only will we miss out on new jobs and economic windfalls, we also risk exposing Australian exports to corrective measures by more climate-minded trading partners as they seek to level the playing field.
The European Parliament voted in favour of such a levy earlier this year, with its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This would see tariffs imposed on the emissions involved in
the production and shipping of goods being traded. The US, Japan and Korea are considering similar measures.
There are signs, however, that the tide is turning in Australia. WWF-Australia recently released its Renewable Superpower Scorecard, which presents a snapshot of how states, territories and the federal government are performing in the race to become a renewable superpower. ACT and Victoria are pledging investments more akin to leading countries, as a proportion of their GDP. South Australia and Tasmania are thinking beyond “100%” renewables, recognising the opportunity to export. And projects like Sonnen’s battery assembly plant in South Australia and the Kidston solar and pumped hydro project in Queensland show what is possible, when political foresight and investment align.
But the states should not have to do the heavy lifting on renewables without adequate federal investment and leadership, for it slows our nation’s stride. Just imagine how fast we could move, and what we could achieve as a nation if our federal government stepped up and led from the front on this critical agenda.
As global action on climate change gathers pace, the UN Climate Change Conference in November is a notable milestone. It is a point at which Australia will be judged by our international allies and trading partners. We have a five-month window to act and secure our place at the leaders’ table. The alternative is we squander the economic opportunity of a century.

The $6 million Karratha project, comprising more than 6,100 panels, is one of the largest installed across Vicinity Centres’ retail property portfolio and is capable of generating more than 3,900 MWh per year.
Vicinity has also flicked the switch on a 1.3 MW solar PV rooftop system at the Runaway Bay shopping centre in Queensland. The $2 million project can generate more than 2,100 MWh per year from its 2,900 panels.
“The clean, renewable energy we’re generating at both centres not only helps to power them while making a positive environmental impact, it also reduces our reliance on the national grid, improving power reliability,” the company said.
Australia’s second largest retail property company, with $23 billion in retail assets under management across 62 shopping centres, Vicinity is targeting a whopping 48,500 MWh of clean energy each year spread across 22 shopping centres in Queensland, WA, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia.
The two latest additions takes the tally to 20 shopping centres with a combined total of more than 25.2 MW.
Vicinity chief innovation and information officer Justin Mills said the program is one of the largest of its kind in Australia.

“We know our centres have a considerable footprint in our communities which is why we’ve committed more than $73 million towards stage one and stage two of our solar project,” he said.
“We’re committed to energy leadership targeting renewable energy, combined with battery and other storage technology and creating efficiencies across our portfolio, as part of Vicinity’s Integrated Energy Strategy. The program supports our focus to create sustainable, market-leading shopping, dining and entertainment destinations.”
Vicinity said it is on track to reach a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030 across it 32 wholly-owned assets.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/20/roseworthy-solar-farm-looms-as-high-achiever-for-adelaide-university/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 20, 2021",Roseworthy solar farm looms as high achiever for Adelaide university,"The University of Adelaide has officially powered up its 1.2 MW Roseworthy Solar and Energy Storage Project which is forecast to generate an average of 42% of the campus’ energy needs but it has already surpassed expectations, delivering up to 90% of the Roseworthy campus’ daily energy requirement.
“We were excited when, on its first full day of operation, the solar farm offset nearly 90% of the Roseworthy campus’ electrical load,” project manager Rob Newcombe said.
“In the simplest of terms, this meant powering up the animal hospitals, teaching labs, our lecture theatres and offices, research facilities, all our computers and devices, the dining hall, swimming pool, the lights on the oval, the gym and student housing, all off the back of renewable energy.
“Although this outstanding first-day result occurred during mid-semester break, when the campus was quieter than usual, it was still an extraordinary achievement on day one.”
The Roseworthy Solar and Energy Storage Project comprises 3,200 solar modules coupled with a 400 kW/1600 kWh hybrid battery storage solution featuring a combination of Tesla lithium-ion batteries (300 kW/1,200 kWh) and UniEnergy Technologies (UET) Vanadium flow batteries (100 kW/400 kWh).
Sydney-based TEC-C Investments was responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction of the project and said the large amount of new generation capacity had necessitated an upgrade of the campus’ existing low voltage network to an internal high voltage 11 kV network.
TEC-C chief development officer Felipe Kovacic said they had also established a state-of-the-art sophisticated microgrid capable of managing the various electrical generation sources. The microgrid and HV network allows the campus to operate, if required, for periods of time independently from the grid running entirely off renewable energy.
The system has been fully operational since late April but was only officially unveiled on Thursday with South Australian Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan among those on hand.
“This solar and energy storage project is one of many supported by the $150m Renewable Technology Fund which is supporting next generation, renewable energy storage projects across the state,” van Holst Pellekaan said.
“The project is another step on the path to reach 100% net renewable energy by 2030, which will help us meet both our energy needs and Australia’s Paris climate emission agreements.”

While the solar farm will serve to reduce energy costs and increase the resilience of energy supply to the Roseworthy campus, it will also provide research and learning opportunities for researchers and students.
“The innovative component of what we have here at Roseworthy is the ability to combine a renewable source with conventional grid supply of electricity and that will be very fertile ground for future experimentation and trial work,” Roseworthy campus dean Professor Wayne Hein said.
“The project will be a living laboratory, providing our researchers with opportunities for projects in areas including energy management, grid segregation, low-cost fault detection systems, system resilience, and cybersecurity.
“There will also be opportunities for students to learn, with plenty of scope to incorporate different aspects of the facility into university courses and projects for students studying everything from engineering, cybersecurity and space, through to environmental science.”
University of Adelaide chief operating officer Bruce Lines said the Roseworthy solar farm is the largest solar project in the university’s history and a key element of the Campus Sustainability Plan.
“Managing and responding to climate change is one of the most important challenges of our time. As the leading research and education institution in the state and one of its biggest employers, the community would justifiably expect the University of Adelaide to lead by example,” he said.
“The research and learning opportunities associated with the project will also filter out to benefit industry and the wider community, including testing the performance and reliability of battery storage technology in hot, dry conditions.”
Image: ANU
The unveiling of the University of Adelaide’s new solar farm coincides with the Australian National University (ANU) announcing it has become the first university in the country to commit to reducing carbon emissions to below zero by 2030.
ANU Vice-Chancellor Brian Schmidt said ANU is “walking the walk” to tackle climate change by not only reducing emissions but offsetting any emissions the university cannot avoid.
“Climate change is already here. The past decade includes nine of the 10 hottest years on record around the world – 2019 was Australia’s hottest year ever,” he said.
Under the Paris Agreement, governments around the world have committed to limit global warming to well-below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and, if possible, to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
“Unfortunately, the world is on track to warm by between 2.8 and 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century,” Schmidt said.
“Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible is essential, but this alone won’t be enough to meet our global goals.”
The commitment is part of what the ANU is calling its Below Zero Initiative. The ANU has also set an interim target of net-zero emissions by 2025, as a stepping stone to achieving negative emissions.
“Achieving below zero is ambitious and it will involve big changes to the way we do things – but as the national university, we must show leadership in driving a societal transformation to address climate change,” Schmidt said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/20/victorian-councils-commit-to-renewable-energy-future/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 20, 2021",Victorian councils commit to renewable energy future,"The Victorian Energy Collaboration (VECO) will see 46 of Victoria’s 79 local councils powered by renewable energy with Melbourne-based energy retailer Red Energy, an offshoot of the Federal Government-owned Snowy Hydro, signing an agreement to supply the councils with a combined 240 GWh of renewable energy each year until the end of 2030.
Spearheaded by Darebin City Council, in Melbourne’s north, and facilitated by the Victorian Greenhouse Alliances, VECO will deliver enough renewable energy to power the participating councils’ energy needs.
The energy will be provided by Tilt Renewables’ 336 MW Dundonnell Wind Farm near Mortlake, which started exporting power to the grid in March 2020, and the Murra Warra II Wind Farm near Horsham.
The 209 MW Murra Warra II Wind Farm, owned by Swiss investment manager Partners Group, is currently under construction and is expected to be fully operational by June 2022. Snowy Hydro has already signed off-take agreements with both wind farms.
“This is a bold, visionary project that pushes the boundaries of what was thought possible for local government,” Darebin Mayor Lina Messina said.
“There is no box this project doesn’t tick – it tackles climate change, cuts energy bills, invests in Victorian businesses, and grows jobs in regional Victoria.
“By powering our council buildings and streetlights with affordable renewable energy, we’re making ratepayers’ dollars go further. Every dollar we save on energy bills is a dollar we can put towards improving our roads, footpaths, libraries or community programs.”
While savings will vary across councils based on their individual energy needs, VECO is expected to save councils up to 35% on their electricity bills.
The 240 GWh of clean power will deliver 45% of the state’s annual local government electricity demand, equivalent to powering 48,000 homes with renewables. The project is expected to save 260,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year.
The majority of the councils will make the switch to renewable energy by July 1 with the initial contract to run for 9.5 years.
Greater Geelong Council is Victoria’s largest council and is among those participating in the initiative.
Mayor Stephanie Asher said by joining VECO, the city would use renewables for 100% of its energy use, saving up to 22% on its electricity bills.
“This long-term deal will power our street lights, libraries and council facilities while reducing emissions and keeping costs low,” she said.
Jenny O’Connor, mayor of Indigo Shire in the state’s north east, said the project sends a strong message that local government is serious about tackling climate change.
“This is a fantastic initiative that will have far reaching benefits, not just for the environment, but also in cost savings for our community,” she said.
Red Energy CEO Iain Graham said the retailer is excited to be part of the project.
“Our owner Snowy Hydro has been a leader in renewable generation for decades and Red Energy is delighted to partner with Victorian councils to provide a long-term energy contract that will enable councils to purchase renewable energy at a competitive price,” he said.

For the Surf Coast Council, the launch of the VECO initiative came just days after it had announced it would expand its rollout of solar modules across council buildings.
Surf Coast Councillor Kate Gazzard said rooftop systems would be added to another nine sites as part of the Solar Installations On Council Buildings Project.
“Council has a strong record of installing solar at its facility to reduce its costs, and our corporate greenhouse gas emissions,” she said.
“It’s fantastic to expand this program to include further community buildings which have incredible capacity to feature this kind of green technology.”
Solar PV systems will be installed on nine facilities including the Torquay and Winchelsea Senior Citizens centre, Moriac Community Centre and Anglesea Kinder.
They will increase the council’s solar PV capacity to more than 570 kW.
Victorian councils are not the only local governments turning increasingly to renewables with Orange City and Broken Hill councils in New South Wales both making announcements in recent days regarding their renewable energy commitments.
Kidd the council had pledged to ensure best-practice use of renewable energy options in its Community Strategic Plan 2018-2028.
“Through consultation, we found the community felt strongly about being more sustainable by promoting renewable energy,” he said.
“Installing solar panels on council assets was one of the strategies chosen to achieve this goal and funding of $500,000 towards renewable projects was allocated in the budget every year for three years, starting in the current financial year.”

The Orange City Pound will be fitted with a 15.9kW system at a cost of $20,500, a 99 kW system, priced at $89,500, will be installed atop the Civic Centre, while the existing system at the Orange Aquatic Centre will be doubled in size, receiving a further 99 kW system at a cost of $143,800.
Broken Hill Council is also pursuing solar PV, recently adopting a Renewable Energy Action Plan with an aim to increase the use and availability of sustainable energy.
Councillor Kathy Graham said council is looking to construct a medium-scale solar array to increase renewable energy in the city, and commit to a long-term goal of the city being 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030.
“Companies are moving ahead with plans to create large energy storage facilities around Broken Hill, and if we had our own means of producing renewable energy we could leverage off these projects,” she said.
“The goal is to take council’s entire operation off the grid.”
Council has set aside $50,000 in the draft 2021-22 budget to establish the array’s potential size and prepare a shortlist of viable locations.
“Obviously we’re extremely early in the initial planning stages for this project, but it has the potential to make Broken Hill a national leader in the utilisation of renewable energy,” Graham said.
Broken Hill Council will hold information sessions at the Civic Centre on Friday, May 21.
The 46 VECO councils are: Alpine Shire, Ararat Rural City, Ballarat City, Banyule City, Bass Coast Shire, Borough of Queenscliffe, Brimbank City, Buloke Shire, Cardinia Shire, Campaspe Shire, Central Goldfields Shire, City of Greater Dandenong, City of Greater Geelong, Darebin City, East Gippsland Shire, Glen Eira City,  Golden Plains Shire, Greater Shepparton City, Hepburn Shire Council, Greater Bendigo City, Horsham Rural City, Indigo Shire Council, Loddon Shire, Macedon Ranges Shire Council, Manningham City, Maribyrnong City, Maroondah City, Melton City, Mildura Rural City, Moira Shire Council, Monash City, Moonee Valley City, Mount Alexander Shire, Pyrenees Shire, South Gippsland Shire, Stonnington City, Surf Coast Shire, Strathbogie Shire, Swan Hill Rural City, Warrnambool City, Wellington Shire, Whitehorse City, Whittlesea City, Wodonga City, Wyndham City, and Yarra Ranges Shire.

The world has a viable pathway to building a global energy sector with net-zero emissions in 2050, but it is narrow and requires an “unprecedented transformation” of how energy is produced, transported, and used globally. Those are the key findings in a report from the International Energy Agency.
Climate pledges by governments to date – even if fully achieved – would fall “well short” of what is needed to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 2050, according to the report, Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector.
The report sets what it described as a “cost-effective and economically productive” pathway resulting in an energy economy “dominated by renewables like solar and wind.”
The pathway calls for annual additions of solar PV to reach 630 GW by 2030, and those of wind power to reach 390 GW. The report said this combined capacity is four times what was installed in 2020, a record year. For solar PV, it is equivalent to installing the world’s current largest solar parks–around 1,000 MW–roughly every day.
“The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal… make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.
The roadmap sets out more than 400 milestones to guide the transition to net zero by 2050. These include no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment for new coal plants without some form of carbon capture technology. By 2035, the roadmap calls for no sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars, and by 2040, completion of a shift by the global electricity sector to net-zero emissions.
The report said that a worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is an essential part of these efforts. It said that such a push would result in the global rate of energy efficiency improvements averaging 4% a year through 2030, or about three times the average over the last two decades.
Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 would come from technologies available today. But in 2050, almost half the reductions would come from technologies that are currently only at the demonstration or prototype phase.
The IEA report said this demands that governments “quickly increase and reprioritise” spending on research and development. Progress in advanced batteries, electrolysers for hydrogen, and direct air capture and storage could be impactful, the report said.
The IEA report said that total annual energy investment would grow to $5 trillion by 2030 in the net zero pathway, adding an extra 0.4 percentage points a year to global GDP growth, based on a joint analysis with the International Monetary Fund. The increase in private and government spending would create clean energy jobs, including energy efficiency, as well as in the engineering, manufacturing, and construction industries. All of this would put global GDP 4% higher in 2030 than it would be based on current trends, the report said.
By 2050, global energy demand would be around 8% smaller than today, but able to serve an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people. The report said that by that date, almost 90% of electricity generation would come from renewable sources, with solar PV and wind together accounting for almost 70%. Most of the remainder would come from nuclear power.

HyP SA, located south of Adelaide at the Tonsley Innovation District, came online on Wednesday and is now delivering a blend of approximately 5% renewable hydrogen and natural gas to 700 homes in the Adelaide suburb of Mitchell Park.
AGIG chief executive officer Ben Wilson labelled HyP SA the largest renewable gas project in Australia and said the successful completion of the facility is an important milestone in South Australia’s renewable energy journey.
“HyP SA is an Australian first and one of only a few projects in the world to deliver a renewable gas blend to homes connected to an existing gas network,” he said.
“The hydrogen produced at HyP SA shows how we can use the state’s abundant solar and wind resources to deliver carbon-free gas to homes and businesses.”
HyP SA features a 1.25 MW Siemens proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser. AGN, which is part of Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG), said it is the largest electrolyser in Australia and is capable of producing up to 480kg of hydrogen per day or approximately 175 tonnes of hydrogen per annum, equal to the total gas use of around 1,500 South Australian homes.

The HyP SA facility also includes tube-trailer refilling infrastructure which will allow renewable hydrogen to be transported by road to industrial customers via an agreement with project partner BOC.
“HyP SA (provides) the template for the conversion of our entire gas network to safely and efficiently distribute renewable hydrogen to our customers. We are now focused on developing plans to deliver a complete carbon-free gas supply for our customers,” Wilson said.
Minister for Energy Dan van Holst Pellekaan said the project, which received a $4.9 million grant from the SA Government’s Renewable Technology Fund, aligns with the government’s plans to deliver cleaner, more affordable energy to South Australian households and businesses.
“Green hydrogen is a fuel of the future and will play an important role in helping achieve our goals of 100% net renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% in South Australia by 2030,’’ he said.
“The outcomes of this project are part of the State Government’s ambition to blend up to 10% renewable hydrogen in South Australia helping to drive domestic demand and consumption.
“Importantly, there is no additional cost to customers who will receive the blended 5% renewable gas as part of this project and the change will not impact any arrangements they have with their existing natural gas retailer.
Image: AGEG
HyP SA is one of several renewable hydrogen projects AGIG is developing.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) earlier this month announced AGIG would receive up to $32.1 million in funding for a 10 MW electrolyser at the Murray Valley Hydrogen Park – which it is developing in partnership with Engie – in Wodonga, Victoria.
AGIG also secured up to $28.7 million towards a 10 MW electrolyser at its Clean Energy Innovation Park in Warradarge, Western Australia, a project it is developing with partnership with ATCO Australia.
AGIG has also announced plans to develop a plant similar to HyP SA in Gladstone, Queensland and is also assessing how hydrogen can be introduced into the Dampier to Bunbury natural gas transmission pipeline in Western Australia.
“AGIG is leading the way in renewable hydrogen across the energy value chain in Australia, with a number of major projects across all mainland states,” Wilson said.

The SA Government followed up the launch of HyP SA by calling for national and international expressions of interest (EoI) to develop land at Port Bonython near Whyalla.
Port Bonython was identified as one of three potential export hubs for both green and blue hydrogen in the state’s Hydrogen Export Prospectus which was launched late last year. The proposed $240 million project will see the installation of a 75 MW electrolyser.
Treasurer Rob Lucas said the government is now targeting EoIs for projects which complement and strategically align with existing and future land uses in the Port Bonython precinct.
“Having a hydrogen hub exporting to Australian and international markets will leverage the $20 billion pipeline of large-scale renewable energy projects under development in South Australia,” he said.
“We are committed to becoming a national and international exporter of clean power.
“Our expectation is that during the 2030s we will generate more clean power than is required for local use, setting us up to become a national and global force in clean energy export.”
Lucas said EOIs will be rated on their ability to develop projects that have the potential to create economic growth and regional development for the state, and contribute to Port Bonython as a multi-user, export-focused precinct to leverage the state’s advantages in renewable energy, fuels and minerals.

Scientists at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have developed a prototype of a rechargeable battery based on cement with an average energy density of 7 Wh/m2.
Although the new storage technology is described as being at a very early stage of development, its creators are convinced that the device has the technical potential to be utilised in multiple applications. “This technology is perfectly suitable for large-scale storage of wind and solar energy,” researcher Luping Tan told pv magazine. “It is also perfect for rooftop PV and our primary idea was to produce roof elements with battery functions for storage of energy from PV.”
The storage system consists of a cement-based mixture in which a commercially available metal-coated carbon fibre (CF) mesh was embedded. Iron (Fe) was used for the anode and nickel-based (Ni) oxides for the cathode. “When CFs are used as additional filler in cement-based materials, they can increase electrical conductivity, decrease drying shrinkage, and increase flexural toughness,” the researchers explained.
The spacing of the meshes was 10 mm by 8 mm with a thickness of 1 mm and an ion exchange resin was added to the mixture of the cement-based electrolyte separator. “The structural battery was constructed as an anode layer, a separator layer, and a cathode layer, where the electrolyte is the cement-based separator,” the Swedish group said.
In the testing phase, the academics used a commercial charger for rechargeable nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries. The charging periods were approximately 12–16 h and the discharging periods around 8–12 h. “The cement-based electrodes with iron powder and nickel hydroxide (Ni (OH)2) powder are rechargeable in liquid electrolytes and can make a small LED lamp shine for several hours,” they stated. adding that its energy density reached just 0.5 Wh/m2.
The same electrodes with a coating of metal Ni and Fe, respectively, reached a maximum energy density of 7 Wh/m2 during six charge/discharge cycles. “The energy density is still low in comparison to commercial batteries, but this limitation could be overcome thanks to the huge volume at which the battery could be constructed when used in buildings,” the scientists said. “We have a vision that in the future this technology could allow for whole sections of multi-storey buildings made of functional concrete.”
A cost assessment of the storage technology was not conducted yet. “At the present stage it is difficult to compare the costs between different approaches,” Tan explained.
The experimental battery was described in the paper Rechargeable Concrete Battery, recently published in the scientific journal Buildings.

A research group from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has created a sensor system to detect fire risk in lithium-ion storage systems.
“The system is designed for lithium-ion storage, as that is the chemistry that presents the greatest risk, and, in particular, for outdoor cabinet-type enclosures where the batteries are accessed from the exterior,” PNNL scientist, Matt Paiss, told pv magazine, noting that it is applicable from 50kW to multi-megawatt cabinets.
According to fellow researcher Allan Tuan the system uses commercially available components and is easy to install on new installations or retrofits. “Cost depends on the size of the battery and an end user or operator can obtain the system for their particular site/facility through a low-cost, fixed-fee license from PNNL,” he told pv magazine.
Dubbed IntelliVent, the sensor system is described as a deflagration-prevention technique that combines automatically controlled door locks with a smart controller that manages signals from fire safety inputs such as smoke, heat, or gas detectors.
The sensor can reportedly detect the toxic flammable gases released by a lithium-ion battery when its liquid electrolyte vapourizes and pushes it to reach critical temperatures. “Depending on the size of the cell, these gases can come out at very high volume, very quickly, and can lead to fire or even an explosion,” Paiss continued.
The system is able to make all cabinet doors open before gas buildup and creates the conditions for a safer incident, while also avoiding the task of opening the doors of a battery under critical situations to O&M workers.
The technology will now be tested by the Arlington Microgrid and Clean Energy Centre in Everett, Washington, which will retrofit an existing 1.2 MW battery with the proposed system.
