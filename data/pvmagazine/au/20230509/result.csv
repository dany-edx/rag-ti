During the Smart Energy Conference held in Sydney’s Convention Centre on May 3 – 4, Energy Synapse founder Marija Petkovic highlighted some key takeaways since the connection of the Torrens Island and Hazelwood batteries rounded out the country’s first gigawatt.
Perhaps the most interesting is the fact that what experts presumed to be very shallow markets, namely the Frequency Control Ancillary Services or FCAS, have in fact proven much deeper than expected. The last seven years have seen numerous predictions about new large-scale batteries collapsing these markets but Petkovic said “we’re just not seeing that play out in the numbers.”
Of course, the markets’ depth varies across years, but FCAS has consistently provided the lion’s share of battery revenue and is yet to fall in a heap. Interestingly, how much of a battery project’s revenue stack came from the FCAS markets varies massively depending on the battery’s duration.

For batteries with less than 1.5 hours of duration, it usually accounted for well over 80% of the revenue stream. But for batteries with over 1.5 hours duration, FCAS sometimes provided less than half of their average revenue.
It is also worth noting that with every passing day, both new contracts and new markets are being developed to reward battery project’s value. Perhaps the most significant of those will be the federal government’s Capacity Investment Scheme, which has taken notes from the NSW government’s Long-Term Energy Service Agreements or LTESA scheme. Key big battery players like Neoen are also negotiating increasingly novel private contracts for their storage projects.
Today, energy arbitrage is unsurprisingly battery project’s second biggest revenue stream. Petkovic pointed out that it is not actually average wholesale energy prices that are important, but rather the price spread of these spot markets. 
During the energy crisis in 2022, these spreads increased massively – sending a strong market signal for storage, which has always been something of an issue for Australia. Victoria and South Australia both have low average wholesale prices, but big pricing spreads – making them attractive locations for big batteries.

On average, Australia’s big batteries do 0.8 cycles per day – though Petkovic points out this figure is highly dependant on whether the projects are chasing FCAS markets (in which case they cycle less) or energy arbitrage. 
Australia may 40-fold its big battery installations over the coming decades with over 40 GW in the pipeline. This, however, includes all battery plans from the earliest stages – some of which inevitably won’t reach realisation. The growth projects are far from out of line though, with the Smart Energy Council expecting Australia to be home to 78 big batteries by 2025, with 14.5 GWh of capacity.
In terms of battery chemistries, Petkovic described herself as “very interested” in flow batteries, which are probably the most developed alternative to lithium chemistries today.

The project, which involves a 2.03 MW solar farm and 5.504 MWh battery system in stage one, used technology from Sungrow.
Having collaborated since 2020, the two companies are seeking to together deploy 500 MWh of DC-coupled big batteries, in the form of both hybrid and standalone projects, in the next three years. The pair signed the official Memorandum to Collaborate at the Smart Energy Conference held in Sydney on May 4.
DC-coupled utility-scale batteries remain fairly novel in Australia, with one of the first grid-connected projects coming online just two months ago, in April.

In DC-coupled hybrid projects, the solar system and battery share the same inverter, meaning projects involve less power conversions and have less complexity overall. Henry Liu, Sungrow Australia’s Grid Connection and Product Manager, told pv magazine Australia this pathway boosts projects’ overall efficiency and makes them more cost effective. The projects are also able to harvest more energy from the solar farm when panels are generating more than the project’s nameplate capacity, or when grid curtailment depresses export potential. DC-coupled projects are also thought to have an easier path in the notoriously difficult grid-connection process, though it is a little early to really quantify this.
Since DC-coupled batteries only just started entering Australia’s utility-scale landscape, they have yet be given the green light to trade on what has proven to be the most lucrative revenue stream for big batteries here: the Frequency Control Ancillary Services, better known as FCAS, markets.
This is set to change on June 3, 2024, however, as a result of the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in December 2021 requesting a rule change from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to allow DC-coupled batteries to participate in these markets, among other amendments.

This upcoming change has given both Green Gold Energy and Sungrow confidence to invest in DC-coupled projects for Australia – which they say can offer greater flexibility for projects to communicate with and respond to the electricity network, alongside the benefits mentioned above.
Green Gold Energy is expecting another one of its hybrid projects to come into operations this year, the Elwomple project located south east of Adelaide. Elwomple involves 4 MW of solar and a 4.6 MWh battery system, and is expected to be commissioned in Q3 or Q4. The company has completed around 20 projects to date and has focussed its energies on a specific niche – sub-5 MW projects located in and around South Australia. With over 1.1 GW and 1.2 GWh of projects in its pipeline, the company intends to stay true to its formula – which it says has low connection and planning risk, quicker development and EPC turnaround times, and provides better opportunities to deploy newer technology like DC-coupled batteries.

Green Gold does, however, also have some standalone DC-coupled batteries on the horizon, as well as a number of larger-scale projects, like the Morgan Project, with 131 MW (DC) of solar and a 30 MW / 60 MWh battery. The company is also looking to potentially expand to Queensland.
Sungrow too is stepping up its supply agreements in Australia, signing a distribution agreement to provide 500 MWh of energy storage systems (ESS) to Sydney-based wholesaler Solar Juice during the conference last week. Sungrow has also signed a new contract with Brisbane-headquartered wholesaler Raystech Group to supply another 250 MW of its inverters and 50 MWh of its ESS solutions.
Under its agreement with Green Gold Energy, Sungrow will provide its energy storage systems, PV inverters, and power conditioning systems (PCS) to the developer’s upcoming renewable energy projects.

In November last year, Chinese module maker Longi announced that an unspecified heterojunction (HJT) solar cell based on a full-size silicon wafer achieved a world record-breaking power conversion efficiency of 26.81% in mass production, claiming the result had been confirmed by Germany’s Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH).
This result reportedly beat the record achieved by Japanese chemical company Kaneka. Its 180 mm² crystalline silicon device, which featured heterojunction and back-contact technology, achieved 26.63% efficiency.
“We cannot disclose if the cell is n-type or p-type at this stage,” a Longi’s spokesperson told pv magazine at the time. Now, however, an international research group led by Longi Central R&D Institute has decided to present the solar cell in the paper “Silicon heterojunction solar cells with up to 26.81% efficiency achieved by electrically optimised nanocrystalline-silicon hole contact layers,” published in nature energy.
The group built the M6-sized cell with a transparent conductive oxides (TCO) contact, a p-type amorphous silicon hydrogenated (p-nc-Si:H) layer, a nanocrystalline silicon layer, a p-a-Si:H layer, an n-type crystalline silicon absorber, an i-a-Si:H layer, passivating contacts (CSPCs) made of hydrogenated silicon monoxide (SiOx:H), silver (Ag) top electrodes, and an anti-reflective coating based on magnesium fluoride (MgF2).
The device achieved a power conversion efficiency of 26.81%, an open-circuit voltage of 751.4 mV, a short-circuit current of of 41.45 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 86.07%.
“The implementation of p-nc-Si:H together with matched TCO leads to a dramatic reduction in the contact resistivity at the rear side, resulting in an efficiency increase,” they further explained, noting that this cell configuration also increased the charge carrier transport and a low contact resistivity. “The cells endowed with these electrical improvements easily trigger band-to-band tunnelling (BTBT) transport behaviour and induce a sharp band bending, enhancing hole extraction efficiency.”
The researchers attributed the cell efficiency improvement to the implementation of p-nc-Si:H together with a modified TCO, which they said greatly reduces the cell contact resistivity. “The total series resistance of the solar cell is reduced from the original 0.37 to 0.2 Ω cm2, yielding a record fill factor for a single-junction silicon solar cell,” they stated.
The research team included scientists from the Delft University of Technology, which recently developed new passivating contacts (CSPCs) made of polysilicon and silicon monoxide (poly-SiOx) and the Sun Yat-sen University in China, which recently built a perovskite solar cell based on a nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (TiOxNy) electron transport layer that achieved a record fill factor.
In September, Longi said it had achieved an efficiency of 26.12% for a gallium-doped, p-type heterojunction (HJT) solar cell based on an M6 wafer. The company also achieved an efficiency of 25.47% for the same solar cell in March.
In addition, the Chinese manufacturer recorded an efficiency of 26.5% for an n-type HJT solar cell in June and a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021. In June 2021, it achieved a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon PV cell.

École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) researchers have developed a thermally integrated photoelectrochemical device to generate hydrogen through concentrated solar irradiation. The 7m-diameter parabolic dish concentrates sunlight into a 144 cm^2 reactor where water is pumped, achieving a solar-to-hydrogen device-level efficiency of greater than 20% at an H2 production rate of >2.0 kW. The scientists published their findings from the project, which is first system-level demonstration of solar hydrogen generation, in a recent edition of Nature Energy. Heat and oxygen are recovered and used, and an EPFL start-up, SoHHytec, is commercialising the system to scale up the technology.
Sapienza University of Rome scientists have collaborated with Sorbonne University, CNRS, and SISSA to create a phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium at high pressures and low temperatures. They discovered that the atomic metallic hydrogen phase forms at 577(4) GPa, and the molecular hydrogen transforms from a metallic phase to another molecular structure (phase VI) at 410(20) GPa. The researchers said in a recent paper in Nature Physics that anharmonic vibrations of nuclei can make the metallic hydrogen phase stable at much larger pressures than previously estimated.
Plug Power has delivered three containerized electrolysers to Hungary-based Ganzair for two projects. One is the Bukkabrany Solar PV Park project, which will generate 850 kg of hydrogen daily to be mixed with the local gas pipeline to heat homes and businesses. The other project, Aquamarine, will test the use of hydrogen for storage purposes. The New York-based company said that this will demonstrate the long-duration energy storage potential of green hydrogen. The 3 1 MW containerized electrolyser systems will be installed later this year. These are Plug’s first electrolyzer systems delivered in the EU and are expected to be the first in operation.
Glenfarne and Samsung Engineering have launched a collaboration agreement to complete feasibility studies for multiple green hydrogen and ammonia projects in Chile, as part of Glenfarne’s recently announced Hydrogen Fuels Initiative. “Green Pegasus, the first project being developed as part of the agreement, will have up to two gigawatts of solar PV installed capacity and is estimated to produce 459 kilotons (kton) of green ammonia and 89 kton of green hydrogen annually. Green Pegasus will primarily focus on export to Asia, particularly South Korea, and Europe, where Glenfarne maintains several business and commercial partners,” said Glenfarne.
