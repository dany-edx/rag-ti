 The Polaris is tailored primarily for carports and shade rooftops, the company says. “The products effectively overcome significant limitations found in conventional panels for similar applications,” Head of GoodWe Australia’s BIPV Marketing, Apollo Chai, said. “It adapts to diverse application scenarios, including carports, flat-to-pitched roof conversions, and sun sheds.”

In terms of the barriers traditional panels face for carports and solar shading applications, GoodWe says they originate in water drainage and wiring. For example, the company points to safety hazards such as ‘acing,’ which can arise from yearly-exposed wiring in traditional modules.
It says the Polaris Series addresses these in its design that includes water protective grooves where wiring is contained. GoodWe also says the Polaris panels are capable of withstanding static loads of up to 5400 Pa on the front side and 2400 Pa on the back, making them equipped for extreme weather conditions, including hurricanes.

The Polaris panels have a power output of 550 W and an efficiency of 20.4%. It is certified by Germany’s TÜV and has been included in the Clean Energy Council’s approved product list.
GoodWe introduced two other BIPV products to the Australian market in the last year, including the ultra lightweight Galaxy panel designed for low load-bearing rooftops, and a solar tile known as Sunshine Tiles.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/20/first-5-billion-transferred-to-national-reconstruction-fund-proposals-so-far-dominated-by-renewables/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023","First $5 billion transferred to manufacturing fund, proposals so far dominated by renewables","Initiated last year, the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund is a government-supported finance corporation similar to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, although it has a wider investment scope. 
The intention of the National Reconstruction Fund (NRF) scheme is to boost investment in onshore manufacturing, including in clean energy technologies like batteries, solar panels, hydrogen electrolysers, and components for wind turbines.
On Tuesday, Federal Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic posted: “the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation is officially up and running – with the board meeting for the first time yesterday.”
The government has transferred the fund’s first $5 billion, with another $10 billion expected to be provided in instalments over the rest of the decade.

Following the launch, where Minister Husic attended the first board meeting as a guest, he gave an interview to the Sydney Morning Herald where it was reported that the NRF fund had already received around 100 proposals, mostly for advanced technology within renewable energy industries.
The priority areas for the fund include agriculture, medical science, energy, advanced technology manufacturing, defence and transport.
The government previously said up to $3 billion of the NRF’s $15 billion would be earmarked to support renewables and low-emission technologies.
How the National Reconstruction Fund works
The NRF is administered by an independent board, operating under a government mandate. It will provide multiple investment avenues including loans, guarantees and equity and it is expected to operate commercially, delivering returns on its investments.
The NRF board is chaired by Martijn Wilder, who also headed up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation when it started in 2012. Also on the board is former national secretary of the Australian Workers’ Union, Daniel Walton. Before departing his role at the union, Walton pushed for a “significant, punitive tax” on the export of unprocessed critical materials like lithium, cobalt and rare earths, saying the revenue could go towards subsidising more processing and manufacturing within our borders.
Other members include the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) Non-Executive Independent Director of its Board of Directors, Kathryn Presser; venture capitalist and Airtree cofounder, Daniel Petre; Brandon Capital Partners’ venture partner and CEO of medical device company OncoRes Medica, Katharine Giles; former Liberal Minister for Industrial Relations of Australia, Kelly O’Dwyer; former Australia Post chief; Ahmed Fahour; and company director Karen Smith-Pomeroy.
Like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the NRF will work on a ‘co-investment’ model, seeking to partner with businesses and superannuation funds to unlock additional private investment.
In April, shortly after the NRF passed through parliament, the University of Sydney’s Jarryd Daymond published an article saying the fund would be improved by greater transparency standards, including the public sharing of the board’s investment decisions; retaining flexibility with its investment areas; and making investments that support the entire manufacturing ecosystem rather than solely individual projects.

In the first and second parts of this series, pv magazine reviewed the productive lifespan of residential solar panels and inverters. Here, we examine home batteries, how well they perform over time, and how long they last.
Residential energy storage has become an increasingly popular feature of home solar. A recent SunPower survey of more than 1,500 households found that about 40% of Americans worry about power outages on a regular basis. Of the survey respondents actively considering solar for their homes, 70% said they planned to include a battery energy storage system.
Besides providing backup power during outages, many batteries are integrated with technology that allows for intelligent scheduling of the import and export of energy. The goal is to maximise the value of the home’s solar system. And, some batteries are optimised to integrate an electric vehicle charger.
The report noted a steep uptick to consumers showing interest in storage in order to self-supply solar generation, suggesting that lowered net metering rates are discouraging export of local, clean electricity. Nearly 40% of consumers reported self-supply as a reason for getting a storage quote, up from less than 20% in 2022. Backup power for outages and savings on utility rates were also listed as top reasons for including energy storage in a quote.
Attachment rates of batteries in residential solar projects have climbed steadily in 2020 8.1% of residential solar systems attached batteries, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and in 2022 that rate climbed over 17%.
Warranty periods can offer a look in installer and manufacturer expectations of the life of a battery. Common warranty periods are typically around 10 years. The warranty for the Enphase IQ Battery, for instance, ends at 10 years or 7,300 cycles, whatever occurs first.
Solar installer Sunrun said batteries can last anywhere between five to 15 years. That means a replacement likely will be needed during the 20 to 30 year life of a solar system.
Battery life expectancy is mostly driven by usage cycles. As demonstrated by the LG and Tesla product warranties, thresholds of 60% or 70% capacity are warranted through a certain number of charge cycles.
Two use-scenarios drive this degradation: over charge and trickle charge, said the Faraday Institute. Overcharge is the act of pushing current into a battery that is fully charged. Doing this can cause it to overheat, or even potentially catch fire.
Trickle charge involves a process in which the battery is continually charged up to 100%, and inevitably losses take place. The bounce between 100% and just under 100% can elevate internal temperatures, diminishing capacity and lifetime.
Another cause of degradation over time is the loss of mobile lithium-ions in the battery, said Faraday. Side reactions in the battery can trap free usable lithium, thereby lowering capacity gradually.
While cold temperatures can halt a lithium-ion battery from performing, they do not actually degrade the battery or shorten its effective life. Overall battery lifetime is, however, diminished at high temperatures, said Faraday. This is because the electrolyte that sits between the electrodes breaks down at elevated temperatures, causing the battery to lose its capacity for Li-ion shuttling. This can reduce the number of Li-ions the electrode can accept into its structure, depleting the lithium-ion battery capacity.
It is recommended by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to install a battery in a cool, dry place, preferably a garage, where the impact of a fire (a small, but non-zero threat) may be minimised. Batteries and components around them should have proper spacing to allow cooling, and regular maintenance check-ups can be helpful in ensuring optimal operation.
NREL said that whenever possible, avoid repeated deep discharging of batteries, as the more it is discharged, the shorter the lifetime. If the home battery is discharged deeply every day, it may be time to increase the battery bank’s size.
Batteries in series should be kept at the same charge, said NREL. Though the entire battery bank may display an overall charge of 24 volts, there can be varied voltage among the batteries, which is less beneficial to protecting the entire system over the long run. Additionally, NREL recommended that the correct voltage set points are set for chargers and charge controllers, as determined by the manufacturer.
Inspections should occur frequently, too, said NREL. Some things to look for include leakage (buildup on the outside of the battery), appropriate fluid levels, and equal voltage. NREL said each battery manufacturer may have additional recommendations, so checking maintenance and data sheets on a battery is a best practice.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/20/pv-near-railway-tracks-is-technically-feasible-researchers-claim/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,BANGLADESH",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2023","PV near railway tracks is technically feasible, researchers claim","From pv magazine Global
An international team has conducted a technical and economic analysis to assess if deploying PV systems between or close to railway tracks is a viable option for rural applications and has found that this heavily criticised project typology may not only be technically feasible but also commercially attractive.
The main criticisms made of this approach relate, in particular, to two primary issues that may affect the performance of the solar panels – hard soiling and strong mechanical stress caused by the passage of the trains above the modules – two factors that could significantly reduce the system’s lifecycle and performance.
The scientists were aware of these risks and said that in Bangladesh, however, rail tracks are commonly built on soft alluvial soils that generally attenuate the vibration amplitude created by passing rolling stocks.
The scientists investigated, in particular, the feasibility of a net-meter-supported mini-grid solar photovoltaic power plant located near the nearside of the railway track in Bangladesh. They assumed a 128 kW array to be deployed alongside the rail track in the Bonomala region of Tongi in Gazipur, Bangladesh, with the distance between the rail track and the panel-bearing racking system pole being 3–4 meters.
The surrounding area has potential loads such as an 18.4 kW deep-tube well, two 5 kW shallow machines, a 35 KVA-driven poultry farm, and a 50 KVA-driven dairy farm. “Furthermore, a village market is surrounded by over a hundred families,” the researchers stated. “So, more than 100 kW of load demand exists.”
For the modelling, which considered solar panels, inverters, meters, wires, power requirement, output power, performance ratio estimation, meteorological data for the selected area, and tilt angle optimisation, the scientists used the PVsyst software.
“The 128 kW power plant requires 342 solar panels racking on two or three rows of mounting systems alongside the railway track; thus, a total of 623 m2 of state-owned railway land is required that would be utilised both for transportation as well as renewable power generation,” they explained. “Furthermore, as the dimensions of the module are 1,755 mm x 1,038 mm x 35 mm, a 1.821 m2 area is required for racking every single module.”
For the PV system, the group assumed a tilt angle of 20.8 decrease, a module output of 375 W, three 33 kW string inverters, and a southern orientation. Their analysis also took into account a 1% array soiling loss, a 2% module mismatch loss, a 1% light-induced degradation loss, and other loss fractions such as string mismatch loss, module degradation loss, and DC wiring loss. Capex was estimated at USD 124,688 and opex for annual O&M activities was estimated at USD 4,748.
The scientists found that the system has a performance ratio (PR) of 77.3% and a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of USD 0.052 ($0.080). They also found that its net present value (NPV) and payback time are USD 196,894 and 8.4 years, respectively. “Putting in place PV power plants next to the railway track might, all things considered, be a game-changing solution for Bangladesh’s rural areas, supplying reliable, affordable, and clean power to boost employment prospects, raise living standards, and lessen the effects of climate change,” they concluded.
Their findings can be found in the study “Techno-economic study of a photovoltaic power plant besides the railway track for rural uses in Bangladesh,” published in e-Prime – Advances in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Energy. The research group comprises academics from the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR), as well as from the RMIT University in Australia and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Basically the program brings startups together with network company Endeavour Energy and wholesale electricity provider Amber, as well as investors and mentors. The ambition is to initiate collaborations and develop initiatives to fast-track decarbonisation.
The full 2023 EnergyLab cohort includes: Accurassi, ALD Technical Solutions, Alternative Energy Innovations, Energy Synapse, Enerza, IND Technology, My Solar Manager, Plexigrid, PowerPlay, and Oaktree Power. 
Energy Synapse is already a well-known name in Australia’s renewable landscape, having been on the scene as a renewable consultancy since 2016. Nearly two years ago, the company launched its Energy Synapse Platform, describing it as a “one-stop-shop for energy market intelligence.”
Energy Synapse’s Founder and Managing Director, Marija Petkovic, says with the software platform successfully received in Australia, the company is now readying to launch in the US.

“The Energy Synapse Platform crunches data from hundreds of sources to help project developers understand the energy market and find the best spots in the grid for utility-scale wind, solar, battery, and pumped hydro projects,” Petkovic tells pv magazine Australia.
“For example, the Energy Synapse Platform gives developers a clear picture of where the constraints are happening the grid, how MLFs [marginal loss factors] are evolving, the value of the shape of generation, the evolving value stack in wholesale energy and FCAS markets.”
“Making informed investment decisions requires consideration of a vast number of factors coming from disparate sources. It is far more complex than just finding an area with strong solar irradiation or wind speed,” she adds.

Describing the company’s progression from consulting to offering market and revenue modelling for large-scale renewables and storage, Petkovic says: “By working closely with our project developer clients, we found that they had a number of common challenges when it came to understanding the opportunities and risks in wholesale energy markets.”
“For example, some wind farms are more than four times as valuable as others. That makes a massive difference in the ROI [return on investment] for a project that costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars. We wanted to build a scalable solution to help our clients understand the factors that are driving these difference in value.”
Also selected to for the program is PowerPlay, which is described by founder and CEO, Aaron Hilton, as a Web3-led energy retailer which aims to reward customers for increasing their use of renewable energy, with a special focus on Australians who can’t access rooftop solar.
Renters and people in apartments, Hilton says, “could be motivated to change habits to save money and who are being largely ignored as a demographic.”
PowerPlay isn’t retailing energy yet though, and when that side of the business will launch “depends on our conversations with existing retailers,” Hilton says.
“Our model is to offer an off-the-shelf gamified demand management platform to retailers,” he tells pv magazine, noting the company is currently in number of conversations that are progressing well.
“We will also offer this service to DNSP’s [distributed network service providers] so that can reward consumers for using energy in a way the better suits grid constraints in a way that is retailer agnostic.”
“At this point we hope to commence a number of trials in Q4 this year.”
PowerPlay also monitors at the household level. “At the bare minimum we need to be able to measure energy usage at the time it is occurring, but in some cases we can still deliver an outcome with no hardware required,” Hilton says of how that is done.
“For example EV’s [electric vehicles] like Tesla allow API commands for scheduling charging times meaning we can optimise charging for solar soaking without any need for hardware on site which is good for renters who may be unable to install hardware. 
“Lots of appliances now have smart control, we can incorporate smart relays in a switch board as well. The thing is our real time incentive model gives consumers a good reason to go through the trouble to setup a ‘smart home.’”
“In time we will incorporate solar and battery systems with a focus on VPP [virtual power plant] and V2G [vehicle-to-grid].”
