The Pottinger Energy Park project, being developed near Booroorban about 60 kilometres south of Hay in NSW’s South West Renewable Energy Zone, is expected to comprise a 300 MW solar farm, a 1.2 GW wind farm, and a 500 MW / 2,000 MWh battery energy storage system.
Sydney-based Someva, which is leading the design and regulatory approval process for the project, said it is still in the early stages of development with preliminary community engagement and planning application underway. Scoping reports for both the wind and solar farms have been submitted to the NSW state planning authority for assessment.
Someva Managing Director Jamie Chivers said he expects the facility to play an important role in NSW’s energy transition, providing reliable renewable energy for up to 830,000 average homes while also delivering an economic boost to the Riverina.
“We’ve been buoyed by the support the Pottinger Energy Park has received from local landowners, Traditional Owners, local businesses, local councils and the broader community,” he said. “We’re excited to be working with AGL on this project and look forward to delivering an industry leading renewable energy project for NSW.”
If approved, construction of the Pottinger Energy Park could commence in 2026, potentially creating up to 800 construction jobs and 60 ongoing jobs through operation.
AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said the project and partnership with Someva would represent a significant development in the company’s renewable and firming portfolio buildout as the company transitions to a renewable future.
“We are exploring the development of a significant wind, solar and battery project at the Pottinger Energy Park as we seek to accelerate options to develop projects that will contribute to our ambition of adding 12 GW of new renewable generation and firming capacity to our portfolio by the end of 2035,” he said.

The offer represents a total valuation of approximately $380 million.
J-Power has already amassed a 7.72% stake in the Sydney-headquartered company and is a 50% joint development partner of Genex for its multi-staged Bulli Creek solar and battery storage project and its 150 MW Kidston Stage 3 Wind project, both in north Queensland. J-Power also extended a $35 million corporate loan facility to Genex in 2023.
The company is now seeking to acquire Genex in toto.
J-Power’s offer is by way of a non-binding scheme arrangement pitched at 27.5c per share with a 50.1% minimum acceptance condition. The offer also contains an alternative conventional takeover at 27c per share which J-Power proposes to make if Genex shareholders reject the scheme offer.
Genex said in a statement that its current intention is to unanimously recommend that its shareholders vote in favour of the scheme and, if the takeover offer is made by J-Power, accept it.
The revised offer comes after J-Power initially proposed a 24c per share scheme offer with a 23.5c alternative takeover in early February.
Genex, which listed in July 2015, said it has a committed portfolio of 400 MW and about 2.3 GW of renewable energy and storage projects in the development pipeline, including the flagship Kidston Clean Energy Hub in north Queensland.
The hub includes an operational 50 MW solar farm and 258 MW of wind power and the 250 MW / 2 GWh Kidston pumped hydro project that is currently under construction. There is also potential for further multi-stage wind and solar projects to be deployed at the site.
Genex also owns the 50 MW Jemalong Solar Project in New South Wales and the 50 MW / 100 MWh Bouldercombe battery energy storage system in central Queensland.
J-Power has said that it is committed to continuing its renewable expansion with the company targeting 1,500 MW or more of new renewable energy capacity by fiscal 2025.
The J-Power offer comes after Skip Capital and infrastructure investor Stonepeak Partners walked away from a joint 25c a share takeover bid for Genex in December 2022.

The state government said the Queensland Microgrid Pilot Fund will enable regional grid-connected communities to boost connection resilience, and support the transition to cleaner, more reliable renewable options for electricity supply.
The storm-prone community of Yarrabah, about 55 kilometres east of Cairns in tropical Queensland, has secured $720,000 to finance a feasibility study that will investigate installing a solar and battery microgrid as an option for a more secure, cleaner and more resilient electricity supply.
Yarrabah Mayor Ross Andrews said the community, one of the largest Aboriginal communities in Australia, is often left without power during severe weather events and its remote location can mean extended outages before repair crews can get into the area.
“As a fringe-of-grid community, Yarrabah is susceptible to long and frequent power outages due to storm damage,” he said. “They are an added and unwanted strain during extreme weather events and on cost-of-living pressures.”
Andrews said by generating electricity locally and utilising renewable energy sources, the town will be able to reduce its vulnerability to disruptions from the main grid.
“A cleaner, more resilient electricity network could also save Yarrabah hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, money that can be better spent elsewhere,” he said.
Yarrabah is one of five Queensland towns that has secured funding as part of the microgrid pilot initiative. Microgrid feasibility studies will also be conducted at Woorabinda in central Queensland and Thargomindah in the state’s remote southwest.
The state government has also committed almost $2.65 million to build a microgrid at Mossman Gorge, about 80 kilometres north of Cairns, and $1.35 million to deploy another at Junbun, about halfway between Cairns and Townsville.
Details of the individual projects has not yet been made available but the state said power for the microgrids may be supplied by a mix of the existing electricity grid, local generation and battery storage, and may be combined with behind-the-meter generation and storage.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the microgrids will not only help the communities boost energy resilience but will also reduce the need for diesel generation as a back-up energy source and contribute to the decarbonisation of the community.
 
“We are committed to doing all we can to mitigate the impact of climate change for all Queenslanders, and those living in these remote communities are no different,” he said.
“While we are working to pass legislation through parliament, Queensland’s publicly owned energy companies are working hard to improve network resilience across the state.”
“Having a microgrid enables remote communities to maintain their essential services until crews can safely restore connection to the grid provided it is electrically safe to do so.”
Queensland is aiming to supply 50% of the state’s energy demands from renewables by 2030, and 80% by 2035.

G-Store, founded in 2007, was placed into administration on 2 February 2024 with Newscorp outlets reporting that the company’s sole director had been diagnosed with cancer.
PCI Partners said the employment of the majority of the company’s workers was terminated on 7 February 2024 with the remaining staff dismissed by close of business on 13 February.
In a statutory report lodged to the corporate regulator, PCI Partners said G-Store had total liabilities of $3.8 million and more than 100 creditors.
The administrator said the company owes 139 unsecured creditors $2.2 million, while secured lenders are owed the remainder of the $3.8 million debt.
The list of unsecured creditors includes customers who have paid for solar systems to be installed, but those installations have not occurred.
“The company did not complete a number of works for which it had received deposits from customers,” the report reads. “Unfortunately, these customers will now rank as unsecured creditors for the deposits paid to the company.”
G-Store, which had a head office was in the Melbourne suburb of Malvern East and another showroom at Warragul in southeast Victoria, specialised in installing solar systems and associated renewables technologies for residential and commercial customers throughout Victoria.

Chinese PV manufacturer Sunova Solar has unveiled a new 9 GW cell production facility in Yibin, China’s Sichuan province.
The factory, which was inaugurated at the start of this year, covers an area of 107,000 square meters, with 67,000 square meters taken up by a cell production workshop. It focuses on the production of 182 mm, 199 mm and 210 mm TOPCon cells.
The fully automated facility currently employs 560 people and 420 front-line workers in the workshop. The site features a 5G-automated guided vehicle (AGV) based transport system of mobile robots and is paired with a fifth-generation mobile network. Cell production is powered by a rooftop PV system and was designed with a concentrated water recycling system.
Sunova Sun is currently ramping up production to its final volume of 9 GW per year, which is equivalent to approximately 36,000 high-efficiency modules per day. It said cell quality is ensured through a range of different tests, such as color and appearance sorting, EL testing, and IV electrical performance tests, as well as additional reliability tests, including tension and light decay testing.
“Investing in our own cell manufacturing line is a key milestone in our long-term strategy and will decrease our dependency on other suppliers, thereby securing consistent quality cell input for our high efficiency modules,” said Sunova Solar Chairman Mike Song. “It enables us to serve our customers with advanced technology that we continuously develop.”
Sunova Solar currently operates three manufacturing factories in China and Vietnam. The company said that as of December 2023, it had shipped more than 4 GW of cumulative modules throughout the world.
Last year, Sunova Solar released a series of its n-type TOPCon solar modules, featuring bifacial dual-glass solar panels with power outputs ranging from 585 W to 605 W.  Shortly after it was listed as a tier-1 module manufacturer by BloombergNEF, after completing eight projects of more than 1.5 MW with non-recourse financing from at least six different banks.
