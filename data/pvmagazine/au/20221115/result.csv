The $9.3 million (USD 6.2 million) Denham Hydrogen Demonstration Plant will test the technological and commercial viability of green hydrogen as a baseload power source.
The  integrated system includes a 704 kW solar farm, a 348 kW hydrogen electrolyser with accompanying hydrogen compression and storage system, and a 100 kW fuel cell which can be used to deliver electricity when it is needed.
Designed and built by Hybrid Systems Australia in partnership with fellow Pacific Energy subsidiary ENGV, the plant is connected to the Denham hybrid power station system which has been powered by a combination of diesel and wind.
The Denham Hydrogen Demonstration Plant, launched on Friday, has already produced enough hydrogen to fill the 13,230-litre storage system.

The next stage of the project is to test the integration of the green hydrogen plant with the solar farm, battery and the conventional diesel power station to make sure these parts operate together as expected.
“The demonstration in Denham is extending knowledge of hydrogen technology and systems in practice and considers how this technology can be used in other remote power systems,” WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said. “The plant will show how renewable hydrogen can be used to replace diesel and other fossil fuels to propel WA to net zero emissions by 2050.”
Once fully operational, planned for early next year, the Denham Hydrogen Demonstration Plant is expected to produce enough renewable energy to power the average demands of 100 households or 20% of Denham’s residences and businesses.
It will also offset 140,000 litres of diesel annually and provide a decarbonisation pathway for future energy systems in regional WA, and throughout the rest of the country.
Horizon Power chief executive officer Stephanie Unwin said the hybrid solar and hydrogen power system will test the technical capability of hydrogen as a dispatchable power source in remote microgrids, in anticipation of the technology becoming cost competitive in the future.
“It is very exciting to be officially opening a project that is leading the country in the demonstration of hydrogen as a base-load fuel source,” she said, before adding that the demonstration project could provide valuable learnings toward the commercialisation of renewable hydrogen power generation.

In addition to providing valuable learnings for future applications of renewable hydrogen across the power generation sector, the system aims to demonstrate the efficiency of the hydrogen equipment such as the electrolyser and fuel cell, the ramp rate of hydrogen in response to a decline in solar generation, and the efficiency and storage capability of hydrogen fuel cells versus batteries.
The project is backed by both the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the WA state government which provided $5.7 million of funding for the project, with $1 million through its Renewable Hydrogen Fund.
WA’s Hydrogen Industry Minister Alannah MacTiernan said the project demonstrates the state government’s determination to ensure WA reaches its potential as a renewable hydrogen powerhouse.
“Once fully operational the plant will show how renewable hydrogen can be used to replace diesel and other fossil fuels to propel WA to net zero emissions by 2050,” she said. “This project is the first step towards rolling out renewable hydrogen domestically and has helped us build critical skills and understanding to move us along as a producer and user of renewable hydrogen.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/15/brisbane-airport-lands-clean-energy-deal-on-path-to-100-renewables/,"INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 15, 2022",Brisbane Airport lands clean energy deal on path to 100% renewables,"Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Queensland government-owned energy generator Stanwell which will supply up to 185 GWh of renewable energy a year to help power the airport’s operations.
The renewable energy will be contracted from the 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm being developed near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region by Spanish renewables company X-Elio.
Stanwell will also source renewable energy from the 800 MW Clarke Creek wind project being built by Windlab northwest of Rockhampton in central Queensland. The project is part of a larger 1.2 GW project which will also comprise 400 MW of solar power and battery energy storage.
Stanwell will take 346.5 MW from the 450 MW first stage generation of the wind farm and has signed an agreement with X-Elio for 49 MW of the output from the Blue Grass Solar Farm.
Brisbane Airport Corporate chief executive Gert-Jan de Graaff said the six-year PPA would dramatically accelerate BAC’s sustainability target, allowing it to meet its commitment to be net zero for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025, 25 years earlier than originally planned.
“This clean energy deal delivers on Brisbane Airport Corporation’s commitment to be a sustainable world-leading airport city,” he said.
BAC, which operates its own electricity distribution network across Brisbane Airport, supplying more than 500 businesses with power, has also announced plans to install another 5 MW solar system at the airport.

BAC is already producing solar energy from a 5.725 MW solar system which was installed in 2019. The existing system generates close to 18% of the company’s annual energy consumption.
“But this is just the beginning,” de Graaff said. “Soon we will transition the rest of our fleet vehicles to electric and continue to look at new opportunities to decrease our carbon emissions and that includes researching the development of an on-site blue carbon removal project within our 285-hectare biodiversity zone.”
The BAC offtake deal is the first renewable energy contract signed by Stanwell, which has historically been known for its coal-fired energy generation, but chief executive officer Michael O’Rourke said the deal would be the first of many for the company’s retail arm, Stanwell Energy.
“This is the first of many renewable energy options Stanwell Energy will be offering to support our commercial and industrial customers meet their decarbonisation requirements,” he said, before adding that the evolving market and consumer expectations make it imperative to diversify one’s generation portfolio.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the deal marked a major milestone towards cutting energy emissions in the sunshine state by 90% by 2035.
“From small businesses to big corporate companies like Brisbane Airport, they all have one thing in common – they want access to cleaner, cheaper energy,” de Brenni said. “I am confident this will be the first of many renewable energy contracts made by Stanwell, as they and our other government-owned generators and retailers play their role in the state’s energy transformation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/15/ffi-plans-10-gw-renewables-super-hub-to-power-green-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 15, 2022",FFI plans 10 GW renewables ‘super hub’ to power green hydrogen,"Northwest Queensland is set to become home to one of the state’s largest renewable energy projects with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) teaming with Windlab to develop the North Queensland Super Hub . The goal is to unlock more than 10 GW of wind and solar energy within the next 10 years and support large-scale green hydrogen production.
Canberra-based Windlab, which is partly owned by FFI Founder Andrew Forrest’s Squadron Energy, said the Super Hub, to be developed on pastoral land around Hughenden, 380 kilometres southwest of Townsville, will comprise a number of individual utility-scale projects.
The first projects announced for the Super Hub include the 800 MW Prairie Wind Farm and the 1 GW Wongalee wind project. When complete, the entire hub is expected to have a staggering 10 GW of clean energy capacity.
Windlab said the first stage of the proposed project is currently in detailed planning, with land agreements in place and the application for development approval for the Prairie Wind Farm planned for submission in the coming months.
Subject to approvals, construction on the first stage projects is expected to commence in 2025 with the projects anticipated to begin producing power by 2027.
FFI, which has repeatedly declared its intent to build a global portfolio of renewable projects to produce 15 million tons per year of green hydrogen by 2030, rising to 50 million tons per year in the decade thereafter, said energy generated from the Super Hub will be used to produce green hydrogen as well as feed renewable power to the grid.

FFI CEO Mark Hutchinson said the opportunity was a “game-changer” for Queensland that will accelerate decarbonisation of the grid and help make green hydrogen a reality at an industrial scale.
“Australia’s natural resources, including its wind, sun and landmass, are unrivalled in terms of their potential for the production of green energy – green hydrogen in particular – and that is no truer than in the sunshine state,” he said, before adding that both Queensland and Australia have the potential to play a leading role in the production and supply of green hydrogen globally.
Green hydrogen has been highlighted as a solution for decarbonisation across a range of sectors, including, transport, industrial and energy storage. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) forecast that demand for hydrogen exported from Australia could be over three million tonnes per year by 2040, injecting up to $10 billion (USD 6.7 billion) into the economy annually.
However, industrial-scale green hydrogen has so far been constrained by the lack of renewable supply to power the process of extracting hydrogen from water through electrification.
“For the first time, the North Queensland Super Hub will provide the quantity of renewable energy we need to support large-scale green hydrogen production right here in Queensland,” Hutchinson said. “The environmental and economic opportunities that can stem from this are significant, both in terms of lowering emissions and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and in terms of local job creation.”
John Martin, chief executive of Windlab, which is behind the much-delayed Kennedy Energy Park project near Hughenden, said the North Queensland Super Hub presents a high-yield, complementary wind and solar resource in a region ideally suited for multiple offtake opportunities.
“This facility marks a big step towards realising our strategic, scalable development plan that leverages the region’s untapped renewable energy base to transform Australia’s electricity market and drive the nation’s clean energy transition,” he said.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the plans for the Super Hub, saying it would accelerate the development of Northern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) and sit at the heart of the state’s SuperGrid.
“Building the SuperGrid is a key part of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, which we released in September this year,” she said. “The plan represents $62 billion of public and private investment in the energy system by 2035.”
According to Palaszczuk, the Super Hub will create 100,000 jobs by 2040 and further push Queensland toward its goal of reaching 70% renewable energy by 2032.
The Prairie Wind Farm alone is expected to support up to 240 jobs during construction, and 10 to 15 permanent, full-time jobs during operation. Construction is expected to commence on the first stage by 2025, with the projects operational by 2027.
The announcement of the North Queensland Super Hub comes on the back of FFI’s investment to establish a 2 GW renewable energy infrastructure-manufacturing plant near Gladstone in central Queensland and a separate 50,000 tonne green hydrogen production facility at Gibson Island in the state’s southeast.
FFI’s announcement comes after Queensland-based Ark Energy, a subsidiary of Korea Zinc, the world’s largest producer of zinc, announced its Collinsville Green Energy Hub. That proposal is for a 3 GW renewable energy hub that would develop a supply chain to export more than one million tonnes of green ammonia from north Queensland to Korea by 2032.

The short-circuit current is between 13.66 A and 13.84 A, with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V.
The Chinese module manufacturer said the new modules measure 2,279 mm x 1,134 mm x 32 mm and weigh 29 kg. They feature 3.2 mm anti-reflective glass and an IP68 enclosure, with a temperature coefficient of -0.35% per degree Celsius. The operational temperature of the panels ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 2% and the 25-year power output is guaranteed to be no less than 84.80% of the nominal output power.
“The module has a beautiful appearance and does not accumulate water or dust,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine, in reference to the frameless frontside, which allows rain to wash away dust.
DAH Solar says the design improves the PV module’s drainage function, so the rain washes away the dust and reduces dust sedimentation. This feature can reportedly reduce the frequency of cleaning operations and maintenance activities and also help avoid hotspots.
“The new module perfectly suits steel rooftops with small installation angles,” the spokesperson went on to say. “In the actual application of distributed PV installation, the smaller the installation angle, the more the dust shading at the bottom of the regular PV modules.”
DAH Solar is based in Hefei, Anhui province. It currently operates a 2 GW solar panel factory.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/15/floating-artificial-leaf-for-solar-to-hydrogen-production/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 15, 2022",Floating ‘artificial leaf’ for solar-to-hydrogen production,"Researchers from the United Kingdom’s University of Cambridge have designed ultra-thin, leaf-like devices that produce green hydrogen from water splitting.  The floating photoelectrochemical devices showed a 0.58% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.
“With further development, we expect the floating leaves to match the performance of state-of-the-art artificial leaf prototypes, which is about 5-10% for solar to hydrogen production,” researcher Virgil Andrei told pv magazine.
The scientists assembled the 1.7 cm2 lightweight artificial leaves by attaching perovskite photocathodes to bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes with a contact adhesive. They deposited the lead halide perovskite photocathodes onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films. They then covered the resulting perovskite-BiVO4 photoelectrochemical devices with micrometer-thin, water-repellent carbon-based layers to prevent moisture degradation and water infiltration.
The artificial leaves can split water into hydrogen and oxygen or reduce CO2 to syngas.
“The current leaves can either develop hydrogen or syngas, depending on the catalyst choice,” Andrei said. “The devices are quite versatile, allowing us to easily integrate different catalysts for a range of products.”
The leaves produced visible carbon monoxide and hydrogen bubbles in a symmetric design during operation, which was key to maintaining balance while floating, the scientists said. Outside of the lab, lightweight reactors facilitated gas collection to aid floating during outdoor testing.
The devices show the potential to be scaled, noted the scientists. They said they produced larger-scale 100 cm2 samples with a comparable performance and stability to their 1.7 cm2 counterparts.
“We showed that the lightweight devices are compatible with modern, large-scale fabrication techniques. However, specialized equipment will be required to prepare these leaves on a square-meter scale,” Andrei said. “Acquiring such equipment and optimizing the deposition may take 5 years. Once these large-scale prototypes are manufactured and pass certain stability and performance standards, commercial products can become available within a few years.”
The scientists introduced the new hydrogen tech in “Floating perovskite-BiVO4 devices for scalable solar fuel production,” which was recently published in Nature.
