In the latest development on the global marketplace, U.S. authorities have prevented some modules from being imported into the country as they are under the suspicion of having been produced, at least in some part, through coercive labor programs in the Xingjiang region of China.
Something very similar could occur in Australia, warns Maxeon’s O’Brien, who points to the progress of the Modern Slavery Bill (2018) moving through the legislative process of federal parliament as indicative of action being taken. He argues that the legislation will see solar supply chains come under much more scrutiny.
“What we will see is that there will be a lot more of a focus on it,” says O’Brien.
In the United States, the focus on potential slave labor in manufacturing has moved right to the very start of the solar supply chain – metallurgical grade polysilicon. The feedstock for PV ingots and cells, there are significant operations in the Xinjiang region, and it is difficult for PV cell and module makers to prove that the silicon in their modules is entirely free from forced labor.
“We go through a process, and have been for some time, of auditing our suppliers, our suppliers’ suppliers, and tracing all the way down to the origin of the raw material,” says O’Brien. “And we don’t have any breaches of our own policies.”
O’Brien reports that this is important for PV project investors and financiers, who do not want to put their money behind projects that use modules which could potentially be tainted by suspect labor practices.
“We are dealing with financiers in Australia on utility scale projects and their key priority is sustainability. You can imagine one of the big utilities coming back six or twelve months later and asking, ‘are our panels ok in terms of sustainability of forced labor?’ People are wanting to get in front of it now,” he elaborates.

Earlier this year Maxeon published its first Sustainability Report – “it was good timing having that report come out,” says O’Brien.
Maxeon spun off from SunPower a little over a year ago. The company has its headquarters in Singapore and is making the APAC region a strategic priority. It supplies its modules through the former company’s manufacturing facilities in Southeast Asia, along with the JV production facility – for its shingled P-Series modules – is in China.
“One of the key messages is the growth of APAC,” says O’Brien. “Bloomberg are talking APAC doing 34 GW [of PV] this year and 77 GW in 2030. If 77 GW comes to pass over the next 10 years, it will be a massive growth of the importance of APAC in the global PV market. And that’s APAC without China I’m talking about.”

SFDR and NFDR, EU taxonomy, Green New Deal, COP15 and COP26, Equator Principles, TCFD and TNFD – keeping track of the whirlwind of ecological sustainability regulations and recommendations can be a real challenge. One thing is clear, though – the application of the do-no-significant-harm principle of the EU taxonomy means that, while solar PV significantly contributes to at least three of its six environmental objectives, it still needs to prove no significant harm to the other three. Given the scale and demand for land resources, a particular focus for PV is likely to be the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Since publishing the “PV for Future” article in the January 2021 edition of pv magazine, which argued that putting ecological sustainability at the heart of PV project planning and operation should become the new industry standard, the situation has already changed.
Given that the first EU Taxonomy disclosures are due by the end of 2021 and throughout 2022, it is key to start aligning with its rather complex and extensive framework. In the near term, the financial industry will allocate capital predominantly toward the best of the best in terms of biodiversity and wider ESG aspects (environmental and social governance).
PV projects have been recognised by multiple studies as a contributor to improved biodiversity outcomes, when done right. Aside from the German and Spanish solar industry associations BNE and UNEF – both of which have published best practice checklists for PV developers and owners to incorporate environmental benefits – further industry guidelines have followed. In May 2021, Everoze co-authored the sustainable agrisolar best practices guidelines and the sustainability best practices benchmark, published by SolarPower Europe. Both emphasise biodiversity measures and environmental and ecosystem services of solar parks.
So what can solar investors and lenders do to provide evidence of their biodiversity actions? What will the “best of the best” projects be doing for biodiversity?
To start with, there is low-hanging fruit at low cost and small effort. On the other side, there are big impact measures that may require a painful cut to installed capacity, and hence revenues. With a current lack of revenues attributed to necessary biodiversity measures, the decision is complex. On the one side it depends on the level of commitment of the investor or lender, but on the other, the decision may be influenced by the potential need to make up for a more harmful impacts across the portfolio.
Which measures actually enhance the biodiversity of a solar park, going beyond the mitigation requirements from the environmental impact assessment?
Studies have shown the clear benefits of less frequent grass cutting, mowing later in the year or changing the mowing techniques to more insect -friendly methods, for example, by leaving the clippings or using specialised machines. It has also been shown that not using fertiliser and pesticides, as well as planting and maintaining wildflower and nectar seed meadows (with local seeds), are beneficial to fauna and flora. Clear commitments to not using toxic and only environmentally degradable cleaning products are clearly linked to biodiversity and ecosystem enhancement. Allowing safe wildlife corridors for crossing animals to connect habitats are also in the range of easily implementable measures. Other cheap and easy measures include installing and maintaining animal shelters such as bird houses, ponds, bat boxes, insect hotels or stone piles for lizards.
A detailed understanding of the local environmental conditions is critical to ensure that a given measure delivers maximum ecological benefit, and even to mitigate against potential harm from badly designed or implemented interventions.
Some of the big impact measures, however, such as more panel row spacing or the reduction of ground cover ratio, stir up heated debates, since these have a direct impact on the installed capacity of the plant. How much light is required to spur biodiversity, and what about differing climates? The benchmark of 1 hectare for 1 MWp installed PV, as recommended by the German BNE guidelines, seems unambitious. The recommendation from the Spanish solar association UNEF of 2.5 hectares per MWp installed on flat terrain takes into account the use of tracking and bifacial technology and higher irradiation angles. It also allows for more sunlight to hit the ground. Or should the limitations be related to the module cover, as outlined in the SolarPower Europe agrisolar guideline, of 50% for south-north and of 60% for east-west facing ground-mounted systems? And what does this cover include, exactly?
In light of competitive PV tenders, cutthroat negotiations around corporate PPA terms, and a lack of compensation for biodiversity and ecosystem protection measures, efforts to reduce the installed capacity for biodiversity measures are clearly hot potato issues.
With the “EU sustainable finance disclosure regulations” coming into force last March, new transparency rules on sustainability risks in financial investment products and adverse effects have been established. With the recent publication of the “biodiversity target-setting” guide as part of the UN principles for responsible banking, it is recommended to assess and improve all solar PV projects to ensure that they are truly sustainable across the spectrum of ecological objectives and financeable into the future. Simply relying on the belief that solar is “green” enough because of the zero-carbon emissions from its generation is no longer enough.
A holistic techno-commercial-ecological approach is required. With the help of a recently developed biodiversity decision management support tool, Everoze can add ecological perspective to the technical due diligence scope of reviewing technologies, production, contracts, permits, financial models, or business cases, aided by external experts where required.
This is the first step for solar in minimising damage or regenerating the depleted environments of a world in climatic and ecological crisis. Moreover, further action is required around wider ESG aspects, such as carbon footprint accounting, supply chain tracking and lifecycle assessment. The key is looking ahead and a holistic mindset.
