Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen announced the new Net Zero Authority on Friday during a visit to the now-defunct coal-fired Liddell power plant near Muswellbrook in the Upper Hunter region of New South Wales.
Bowen – who also announced that $400 million (USD 269.5 million) will be made available under the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund to help industries in Australia’s regions to decarbonise – said the new authority will help maximise the benefits and minimise the risks of Australia’s energy transition, driving the creation of good jobs in new industries and ensuring no worker or community is left behind.
“The global transformation to a net-zero economy is a massive source of economic opportunity for Australia, its regions, industries and workers,” he said.
“The authority will have responsibility for promoting the orderly and positive economic transformation associated with achieving net-zero emissions.”
The legislated body will be tasked with coordinating Australia’s energy transition – from fossil-fuel-generated power to renewable alternatives – by providing advice to governments on policy and regulations, setting national plans and targets, and supporting regions and communities to attract and take advantage of new clean energy industries.
It will also support workers in emissions-intensive sectors to access new employment opportunities as the net-zero transformation continues and help investors and companies to engage with new renewable energy opportunities.

“The authority will have the job of assisting regions like the Hunter, like Central Queensland, like Collie in Western Australia and regions just like it around Australia who are at the core of our energy and our industry in this transformation,” Bowen said.
The new authority will be shadowed by the $400 million Industrial Transformation Stream, to be administered by Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which will be made available to support existing industry – such as rail and aviation – and new clean energy industries.
“Decarbonisation is absolutely essential, but it also takes investment. And we know it’s in the nation’s interests for Australian industries in the regions to be investing in decarbonisation and, therefore, it is in the interests of the government to help,” Bowen said.
Climate Council Chief Executive Officer Amanda McKenzie said the new Net Zero Authority will be crucial to ensure everyone gets to share in Australia’s next era of prosperity as a renewables superpower.
“Australia’s global allies and trading partners are forging ahead with the transition to net zero and it makes perfect sense for Australia to get in the game,” she said. “Taking strong action now is the best way to ensure Australia captures growing markets for clean energy and low-emissions products, to power the next era of our national prosperity.”
“There is no doubt Australia’s path to net zero requires transformative change. Last week the Liddell coal-fired power station went offline. The Victorian and Queensland governments have announced their plans to fully exit coal power generation. It won’t be long before all coal is retired for good.
“Communities in regions where fossil fuels are being phased out and those in Renewable Energy Zones need a voice, clear plans and strong investment to guide the transformation of their local economies and industries.”
The federal government said a new agency will be established in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet from 1 July 2023 to initiate the Net Zero Authority’s responsibilities and help inform government on the final design and establishment of body.
It is expected funding for the authority will be included in Tuesday’s Budget with Treasurer Jim Chalmers saying it would show “a substantial effort to grab the opportunities of the net-zero transformation”.
“This budget will be very focused on the industrial and economic opportunities of the clean energy transformation,” he said.
The announcement of the Net Zero Authority has won broad support across the business, environmental and renewable energy sectors with the Clean Energy Council (CEC) Chief Executive Kane Thornton saying the national body is a “vital piece of the puzzle as we shift towards a cleaner, more prosperous economic future for all Australians.”
“To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Australia will require critical transformations over three decades, and establishing a Net Zero Authority will allow Australians to work toward a cleaner future,” he said.
Thornton said the shift to clean energy could be transformative for Australia’s regional communities, “providing low-cost, renewable energy to consumers and long-term employment pathways in the clean energy sector.”
“A Net Zero Authority with dedicated funding and a long-term mandate will ensure the appropriate level of coordination, durability, and leadership necessary to achieve a genuinely just energy transition,” he said.
Australian Services Union (ASU) National Secretary Robert Potter described the government’s announcement as a “life-changing event” for workers in emissions-intensive industries, saying the authority will ensure those workers have access to employment opportunities and can play a part in the energy transition.
“We do not have to choose between the environment and jobs – it is our responsibility to act on both to the benefit of all communities,” he said. “For thousands of workers, the transition to clean energy affects their employment, the lives of their families and the viability of their communities.”
“Federal leadership has been urgently needed to plan and manage the transition so workers, families and communities are not left behind and benefit with new jobs in growth industries. The new body will deliver federal funding and coordination under a structured plan, with workers voices at the heart of this effort.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/05/amec-targets-social-licence-with-transmission-planning-reform/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 5, 2023",AMEC targets social licence with transmission planning reform,"The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has released its final recommendations designed to improve the regulatory frameworks for transmission investment and planning to support efficient investment in and timely delivery of major transmission infrastructure needed to deliver new, renewable generation into the system.
The commission has recommended changes to improve the regulatory process for the major transmission projects identified in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO’s) Integrated System Plan (ISP) in three areas, including encouraging transmission network service providers to undertake more extensive planning for major projects earlier in the development cycle.
AEMC Chair Anna Collyer said the changes will enable transmission businesses to identify potential issues in the project earlier, which will help safeguard the long-term interests of consumers during the transition to renewable energy.
“Enabling them to complete planning work earlier means they can further engage and build social licence with communities, which is vitally important to enabling the energy transformation,” Collyer said.
“Social licence activities that may be carried out sooner as a result of these recommendations include stakeholder engagement, land-use mapping, social, cultural environmental and economic risk assessments and engineering design.”
The AEMC also considers there may be opportunities to improve how the ISP and the regulatory investment test for transmission (RIT-T) process, that regulates major network investments, work with regard to projects.
In addition, the report proposes rule changes that will more explicitly consider emissions reduction in transmission planning. The AEMC is recommending a ‘harmonising’ rule change to align the national energy rules with the energy objectives once they have been revised.
Collyer said transmission plays a crucial role in enabling the transition to a low-carbon economy and the “inclusion of emissions reduction targets within national energy objectives lays the foundation for the transformation towards a carbon-neutral energy sector.”
Collyer said all of the final recommendations in the review are designed to support efficient investment in and timely delivery of large transmission infrastructure, that will be required to unlock gigawatts of renewable energy as the sector transforms.
The AEMC will host a virtual public forum on 16 May 2023 when it will set out the key findings and final recommendations of the final report.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/05/its-the-liddell-things-that-matter/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",,"MAY 5, 2023",It’s the Liddell things that matter,"Australia’s oldest coal-fired power plant Liddell retired completely in the last week of April 2023 after 52 years. This giant of AGL, which had a total registered capacity of 2,000 MW, operationally acted as a 1600 MW station and 1200 MW after the closure of its third unit. Australia’s transition to clean energy is in progress.
How did the National Electricity Market (NEM) cope in the aftermath of such a large unit going offline? Here we look closer at what compensated for the void of Liddell in New South Wales (NSW), the trends in imports and electricity prices of NSW, and the impact on neighbouring states.
Image: Cornwall Insight Australia
The green bar in the chart above indicates the gradual decrease in the energy from the Liddell power station from 23to 28 April 2023. The fourth unit of Liddell (LD04) was closed on 24 April, supplying 1972 MWh during its last day. The closure of LD02 took place on 26 April, and LD01 on 28 April.
When the Liddell power station was decommissioned, we saw an increase in the output of other local generators and NSW’s imports. The blue stack in the chart shows Bayswater’s generation (which is close to Liddell) over Liddell’s closure week. Hydro generation also increased.
NSW’s daily import level has also increased over the last week as Queensland and Victoria increased output from their local power stations due to the increased flow through their interconnectors to NSW. The power stations in Queensland (Gladstone and Kogan Creek) only produced 33048 MWh/day on 23 April, which rose to 35869 MWh/day on 28 April. This almost shows an 8.5% increase in the total generation. Similarly, the power stations in Victoria (Yallourn W, Loy Yang B and Loy Yang A) generated a total of 84,662 MWh/day on 23 April. This has raised to 92209 MWh/day on 28 April, which shows an increase of 8.9% of overall generation from brown coal. Hence, the wholesale prices have increased in these states as well.
In conclusion, the state has managed the closure of Liddell with hydro generation and imports. However, considering the future coal retirements and NSW’s dependency on this generation type, further development in renewable energy and batteries is important for the state. Otherwise, the impact on the state and the neighbouring states may deteriorate when the upcoming closure of Eraring occurs in August 2025.
Nevertheless, programs such as the recently announced tenders for allocating Long-Term Energy Service Agreements (LTESAs) to new renewable and battery projects to support the energy transition in NSW are a good initiative, providing additional capacity to replace the upcoming coal retirements in the state.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/05/australia-edged-by-china-with-cost-of-capital-for-utility-scale-pv/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"MAY 5, 2023",Australia edged by China with cost of capital for utility scale PV,"The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has published a first-of-its-kind report on the cost of financing for renewable power, covering solar PV, onshore, and offshore wind technologies across all major global markets.
The agency obtained the data from 172 survey answers from 56 experts as well as 33 interviews. The responses provide the cost of capital (CoC) data from 45 countries for at least one of the three renewable technologies across six continents.
The cost of capital expresses the expected financial return, or the minimum required rate, for investing in a company or a project. It is calculated as the weighted average between the costs of debt and equity, where the cost of debt is the interest rate that a project secures from lenders, and the cost of equity is the financial return expected by shareholders in exchange for providing capital.
The cost of capital is a major determinant of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar PV and other renewables. According to IRENA, the total cost of electricity for a representative PV project increases by 80% if the CoC is 10% rather than 2%.
“Even small differences in CoC that are not properly accounted for between countries and technologies can result in significant misrepresentations of renewable energy costs and lead to poor policy making,” IRENA says in the report. “Reliable data and an enhanced understanding of the composition of the CoC and its drivers are therefore critical to developing tailored support mechanisms and market designs that take different technology and country risks into account.”
Results show that for all the locations surveyed the cost of capital for utility-scale PV is lowest in Germany and the Netherlands, both at 2.2%. In Europe, Sweden follows at 3%, with Denmark and the United Kingdom at 3.3%. The CoC in Spain, France, and Italy is 5.1%, 3.4%, and 4.3%, respectively. Ireland, Portugal, and Ukraine show the worst results, at 9.9%, 10%, and 12.2%, respectively.
China tops the Asia Pacific region with one of the best global results at 3.9%, with Australia following closely at 4.6%, and then Malaysia at 5.6%. Vietnam is at 6.9% while India has the worst result of the African countries surveyed at 7.1%.
In North America, the United States has a CoC of 5.4% and Mexico of 8.7%. Chile beats Brazil in South America, with 5.7% against Brazil’s 7.6%. The best results in Africa are from South Africa and Kenya at 6.9%, whereas Tunisia has a CoC of 10.7%.
The good results of China, North America, and Western Europe are underlined by a mature PV market, according to IRENA.
“In these locations, renewable energy financing is underwriting the deployment of renewable power generation capacity,” it said in the report.
The agency also noted that the share of debt in the CoC is low in both North America and Western Europe but for different reasons. In the United States, the debt share is typically low, between 35% and 65%, because “the tax credits used to accelerate solar and wind deployment incentivize the use of equity,” whose costs are nevertheless low due to tax credits, IRENA explained. On the other hand, debt share is typically larger in Europe, at 80% or more, but the cost of debt is very low due to low base rates from the banking sector.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/05/construction-begins-on-solar-cycling-path-in-netherlands/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NETHERLANDS",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 5, 2023",Construction begins on solar cycling path in Netherlands,"From pv magazine Global
The Dutch province of North Brabant has announced the start of construction of a 500-meter-long, ground-mounted solar cycle path along the provincial N285 road near Wagenberg.
The PV system will be integrated into the asphalt top layer and will consist of 600 solar panels of an unspecified type. “This project is mainly intended to gain more experience with the deployment of solar cells on bicycle paths,” the provincial government said, noting that two similar systems have already been deployed along the N395 road near Oirschot and along the N324 road near Grave, in North Brabant itself. 
During a 5-year period, provincial government experts will assess, in particular, the resistance of the solar modules to the mechanical stress applied by the presence of pedestrians and bikers, the costs for their maintenance, and the PV system energy yield.
Solar roads in the Netherlands are not an unfamiliar concept. A bike path near Amsterdam was equipped with solar panels in 2016 and another one was built in 2020 in the province of Utrecht. The feasibility and economic viability of solar roads, however, still remains controversial.
The provincial government said construction of the solar bike lane in Wagenberg is part of a larger project called “Zon op Infra,” a Dutch government plan to test the viability of solar power production on road infrastructure. The plan includes the deployment of solar installations along highways and on noise barriers. 
The Dutch authorities are struggling to identify surfaces on which to deploy large-scale PV plants due to the scarcity of land. In recent years, research institutes and private companies have tried to prove the feasibility of solar projects on non-agricultural land, including dikes, rooftops, onshore and offshore water surfaces.
