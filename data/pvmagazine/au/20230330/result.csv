The company has set up what it describes as a “marketplace” for willing landholders and developers, working to facilitate between the disparate spheres of farming and renewable energy. 
In a way, the model is an inversion of the business-as-usual approach. That is, interested landowners approach Rela, it then assesses the viability of their property as a developer would – considering things like grid connection points and capacity, solar and wind resources. If the property is suitable, Rela approaches developers in a closed tender format, iterating the requirements of the landholder, be they timing constraints or the need to continue grazing animals. If a match is made, Rela continues to work with the landowner to assess proposals, table lease contracts and manage the process. 
“We bring the same skillset as the developer, but to the benefit of the landowner,” Rela cofounder and director Michael Katz tells pv magazine. “For the marketplace to function, landowners need to be equipped with same resources and knowledge as the developers have.”
Broadly speaking, the philosophy behind the company centres on the idea that by better informing landowners, greater confidence and trust can be developed and this ultimately helps realise superior projects more smoothly.
This same sentiment was largely borne out in a review published by the New South Wales government in March into the renewable sector’s land use conflicts with agriculture. In the review, the government said far more effort needs to go into providing “accessible” information to landholders and their communities. It suggested both governments and the renewable energy sector should publish standard agreement ‘templates’ as well as timely indicative lease prices to boost transparency.
Both Katz and his cofounder and co-director Eren Rimmer have backgrounds in renewables, and saw their industry knowledge could be leveraged to make projects happen in a different way. Rela, they say, has “struck a cord” with landowners, but developers have also been excited by the concept since it cuts the notoriously tricky human aspect of their workload.
In the three years since its inception, Rela has done preliminary work on around 100 projects, and 20 in detail. Most of that time though, Katz and Rimmer point out, has gone into setting up the legal structure which underpins the model. It has also taken considerable time to build the company’s database of “reputable” developers to take part in these closed tenders.
The other component of Rela’s business buying out solar leases on preexisting projects. Again, Rela’s role here is primarily as facilitator, though this time between host landowners and superannuation funds eager to increase their renewable holdings. This set up is quite straight forward: hosts get a lump sum payment from the superfund calculated according to their contract, the superfund then gets the project’s ongoing lease payments redirected to them, and Rela takes a 4% cut. 
Queensland farmer Belinda Saal recently completed this process for the 103 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm hosted on her property. Saal was initially approached by a different solar lease buyout company, LDC Infrastructure, but under its model she had to pay capital gains tax upfront. 
Instead, Saal opted to go with the scheme where that tax was averaged over the 30 year lease term and paid incrementally – an option offered by Rela, a product of work its done with the tax office. 
As is normally the case with renewable leases (though often surprising to landowners), Saal was keenly aware her contract allowed Yarranlea’s owner, Risen, to give 12 months notice should it want to decommission the solar farm. Looking at interest rate rises and general global instability, Saal tells pv magazine Australia, “there was just no guarantee that we would have that income for the next 28 years of our lease.”
For her, having that money in the pocket today seemed better. “It just takes the risk out of it, from our point of view.”
Superannuation funds, Rimmer says, are mostly happy to take on this risk since they generally have a mandate to invest in 200 or so projects. Spread across a big portfolio, of course, risk softens.
Risen Australia’s CEO Archie Chen says both Rela and the buyout concept was initially new to them, but he now sees it as a “win win.” In fact, Chen told pv magazine Australia the buyout slightly improved the bankability of Yarranlea.
“It fundamentally doesn’t change anything for us,” Chen said, in regard to where the lease payment is sent, so for Risen there was no downside, a slight upside and a content host. 
This type of financial rearrangement on preexisting projects generally takes about two months, according to Rimmer.

Ameresco, which specialises in designing renewable energy solutions for C&I customers, said it plans to deploy Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow batteries as part of a “flexible and modular” integrated solar and storage solution to meet the increasing need in the market for medium- and long-duration systems.
Ameresco Chief Financial Officer Doran Hole said the partnership with Redflow aligns with the company’s “pursuit of best-fit solutions for our customers, both in project design and technology fit.”
“The demand for longer-duration energy storage is a critical and rapidly growing market opportunity that can unlock our customers’ ability to cost-effectively meet an increasing amount of their energy needs through renewable sources,” he said.
Brisbane-based Redflow said it is already working with Ameresco to deploy a commercial demonstration system incorporating one of the company’s 40 kWh four-battery enclosures at one of Ameresco’s existing customer sites.
Redflow Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Tim Harris said the four-battery enclosure is a compact, scalable energy storage solution for smaller C&I customers and allows Ameresco to look beyond conventional lithium technologies.
Harris said the integrated system delivers a fire-safe, rugged, and sustainable solution that is economically competitive with lithium-ion and offers operational advantages in a wide range of environments and operating conditions.
“Our zinc-bromine flow battery offers a non-lithium solution that is fire safe, has an innovative hibernation feature, and suits a wide range of environments and use cases,” he said.
Ameresco and Redflow said they are also planning to build upon Redflow’s existing enclosure system to offer a utility-scale solution that is scalable into the hundreds of MWh.
Harris said he expects the collaboration with Ameresco, which comes just months after Redflow signed a deal to work with US-based renewables developer Empower Energies, will pave the way for greater expansion in the North American market.
“We hope our partnering with Ameresco will initiate other exciting opportunities for our business pipeline and, over time, new markets globally,” he said.

The EnergyConnect project, a joint venture between Transgrid and South Australian (SA) network operator ElectraNet, will link Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW to Robertstown in SA via Buronga, with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria.
The high-voltage interconnector will provide 800 MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions and is forecast to unlock some 5.3 GW of new renewable energy projects.
Transgrid and its construction partner SecureEnergy, a 50/50 joint venture between Perth-based engineering and construction company Clough Group and Spanish infrastructure giant Elecnor, are building the 700km NSW section of the project from Wagga Wagga to the South Australian border, and the connection to Red Cliffs.
Construction crews have erected the first guyed transmission towers at Buronga. Unlike conventional self-supporting towers, which stand on four legs, guyed towers comprise a central mast held in place by four steel cables. The technology requires about 15% less steel and 25% less concrete in construction than traditional towers.
Transgrid Chief Executive Officer Brett Redman said the raising of the first transmission towers is a “significant milestone in building the energy superhighway to accelerate the nation’s clean energy future.”
“We are getting on with the job of delivering the critical infrastructure needed to provide Australian households and businesses with cheaper, more reliable and sustainable energy,” he said.

Transgrid said works are also progressing well on the expansion of the Buronga substation, which will become the main hub for energy sharing between the three states. The substation will eventually house two 120 MVA capacity synchronous condensers, five phase-shifting transformers, three power transformers and four shunt reactors.
Redman said earthworks on the substation bench are now complete, with concrete foundations being poured to hold the synchronous condensers and transformers.
“The 16-hectare expansion of the Buronga substation is the equivalent of 20 football fields and, once operational, it will be one of the largest and most complex substations in the Southern Hemisphere,” he said.
Transgird expects the EnergyConnect project will generate up to 1,500 jobs, primarily in regional NSW, and contribute $4 billion in net economic benefits.
ElectraNet is also progressing works on the SA section of the EnergyConnect project, having commenced construction of an estimated 380 transmission towers that will be erected as part of its section of the project, in early 2022.
The SA component of the project will also include the construction of a new substation at Bundey and upgrades to existing substations at Robertstown and Tungkillo.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/30/sunwiz-reports-residential-battery-installs-reach-record-high/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 30, 2023",SunWiz reports residential battery installs at record high,"Australian solar analyst SunWiz has released it Australian Battery Market Report for 2022 charting phenomenal growth in the residential storage segment. The report shows installations of residential batteries linked to solar systems in 2022 grew by 55% when compared to the previous year’s installations.
SunWiz said analysis of government, industry, and energy market operator data sources shows 47,100 residential energy storage systems were installed throughout the country in 2022, delivering a combined total of 589 MWh of energy storage and boosting the cumulative national tally of home energy storage systems grew to 1,920 MWh.
The number of solar arrays being installed with a battery is also becoming more commonplace, with SunWiz noting that one battery was installed for every seven solar systems added to the network last year, compared with one for every 12 new solar installations in 2021.
SunWiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston said about 180,000 Australian homes and businesses now have a battery system, noting that it is “still a long way off the 3 million homes with solar panels.”
“But many solar households are seeing the light, with one third of battery installations being retrofitted to existing solar systems,” he said.
Johnston attributed the surge in installation numbers to a range of factors including sharply rising energy prices, a desire to store excess solar energy and self-sufficiency reasons.
He said householders were installing home solar systems linked to batteries “in an effort to increase their energy independence, resilience and self-reliance.”
“This data shows Australian households and businesses are taking back power from the energy system by turning to cheaper, renewable sources of energy,” he said.
SunWiz said all states and territories had increases of battery installations in 2022, led by Victoria and New South Wales, each accounting for 27% of the market, followed by South Australia (16%) and Queensland (14%).
Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory were the highest growth markets in Australia last year, installing four times more batteries in 2022 than in 2021.
SunWiz expects the number of home energy storage systems will continue to rise in the coming years with “most manufacturers” expecting prices to hold steady or even decline.
For 2023, SunWiz is forecasting 10% growth for home energy storage systems totalling 650 MWh.
Despite that prediction, SunWiz acknowledged the return on investment for energy storage has progressively increased in the past 12 months. SunWiz analysis shows that the time required for households to recoup the costs of installing both solar panels and batteries has lengthened out to more than 11 years. By contrast, the payback period for customers installing solar alone was just 6.3 years at the end of 2022.

A German consortium led by Fraunhofer ISE, inverter manufacturer Kaco New Energy, and semiconductor supplier Infineon Technologies AG plans to develop grid-forming (GFM) synchronous inverters for solar plants.
The “Stabil” research project aims to investigate the potential load scenarios to which grid-forming inverters could be exposed in the future.
“Based on these investigations, conclusions will be drawn about the optimal and cost-efficient dimensioning, especially with regard to the power semiconductors,” said Fraunhofer ISE.
The consortium will measure the performance of the first grid-forming inverter prototypes at a PV plant in Dürbheim, Germany. The aim of these first tests is to examine the performance of the devices under real operating conditions, stress factors, and typical stress profiles.
After these tests are finalised, experts from the three entities will be able to develop so-called “mission profiles,” which define values such as global horizontal, direct, and diffuse irradiances and ambient temperature.
“These will be analyzed in the laboratory in combination with the identified future loads,” they said. “From this feedback, recommendations of an optimized design for durable devices and their components with long lifetimes are to be derived and presented to the public.”
Kaco New Energy will participate in the project by integrating the grid-forming control for PV into its devices. Infineon Technologies will provide optimised semiconductor modules for the inverters.
“In the energy system of the future, which will be largely built without the grid-forming synchronous machines in today’s must-run conventional power plants, grid-forming inverters must provide grid stability not only during normal operation, but also during severe grid faults,” said Fraunhofer ISE.

India’s cumulative PV installations hit 64.38 GW at the end of February, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The total includes ground-mount, rooftop, hybrid solar component, and off-grid installations.
The state of Rajasthan led in terms of PV capacity additions, accounting for 16.4 GW of the cumulative installations, or 26% of the total. Gujarat ranks second with 8.9 GW of PV, followed by Karnataka with 8.1 GW. The three states together account for more than 50% of India’s cumulative installed solar capacity.
The MNRE is implementing a range of schemes to promote solar energy in the country, including the Rooftop Solar Programme Phase-II, PM-KUSUM scheme for farmers, and the Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Scheme Phase-II for grid-connected solar power projects by the government producers. It is also promoting the Solar Park Scheme, Green Energy Corridor Scheme (for development of intra-state transmission system for RE projects), and the production-linked incentive scheme for high-efficiency solar modules.
The PM-KUSUM scheme is demand-driven and open for all farmers for implementation, in line with guidelines issued for the scheme. The nation had installed 1,140 MW of cumulative solar capacity under this scheme by Feb. 28.
