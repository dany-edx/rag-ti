The dairy, owned by John and Rochelle Pekin, has a 100 kW transformer which overloaded and failed 315 times last year – nearly everyday.
The frequent “brownouts” experienced on the farm, John says, have damaged his gear and can interrupt commercial operations. 
“We were in a situation where we needed to do something,” John tells pv magazine Australia.
That something has taken the form of a 250 kW solar system coupled with 520 kWh of lithium-ion storage. On top of stopping the farm’s electrical instability, John Pekin says the renewable system will help the dairy fetch a higher price for its milk, slash power bills and ultimately bring the farm closer to its goal of carbon neutrality.
John also wants the system to act as a kind of ‘proof of concept’, illustrating  renewable power can reliably and affordably work on Australian farms.

The Pekins started their sustainability journey around five years ago, when they were approached to take part in a pilot program assessing the carbon footprints of Victorian farms. Building on that audit, John said “solar stood out” as something they could install affordably today.
The issues is the Nikep Dairy Farm uses almost all of its power in the darkness – starting milking at 4am and then again at 10pm. So the solar power produced on site needs to be shifted, making the battery installation “a bit of a no brainer,” John says. At the property, he’s used New South Wales startup Energy Renaissance’s superRack battery – installing enough capacity to take the farm close to being off-grid.
This major investment in a renewable system is, John says, fairly unusual among his peers. “I’m not hearing any discussions about carbon from other farmers,” he says. In part, it is because the industry has just, as John puts it, “come out of a hole” but also because farmers tend to be “conservative by nature.”
He thinks most farmers will remain hesitant to venture down the renewables path “until they can see it working up the road.”

The skyrocketing cost of grid electricity, John expects will hasten the switch though. Last year, the Pekin’s power bill was $80,000 – but John says had he not installed the system, it would probably be closer to $110,000 in 2022. While Nikep Dairy Farm – with its 900 cows producing eight million litres of milk per year – is larger than the average, the pressure from the raising electricity prices will impact the profitability of all commercial farms.
With the renewable system, John also expects to be able to fetch higher prices for his milk – especially once he gets his farm to be carbon neutral. “Clearly there’s a bit of a push,” he says, noting that both Coles and Woolworths are looking to get sustainability up. The farm is currently looking at solutions to reduce the methane associated with cows, but that journey is still in the early stages.
While John feels sustainability is only just emerging as a key area of concern among his peers, the system’s installer Nick d’Avoine, general manager of agribusiness solar and storage integrator Farming the Sky (Commpower Industrial), says he is already seeing big shifts.
“Taking farms of off diesel – there’s huge huge huge interest in that,” he tells pv magazine Australia. In terms of what that takes, he says step one is all about gathering good data and lots of it. “Deep diving into as much data as possible and tailoring design to meet that.”
Another thing to take into account here is the fact agricultural properties tend to have lots of electricity meters – the Pekins’ have 13, but Nick has worked on properties with as many as 33 meters – which he says results in customers paying more because of the complexity of their energy systems.

The Pekin’s opted for Energy Renaissance batteries at installer d’Avoine’s behest – though John noted the batteries pricing was very competitive, which suited him.
d’Avoine said for him the New South Wales storage company were the top pick because of the local support team and Australia-made products. Secondly, the batteries are suited for Australian conditions and can handle extended heat. Finally, because of the nature of the dairy – which has a small window to get power in but long draw – he needed batteries which could be fitted in parallel, like Energy Renaissance’s. 
The company’s founder, Brian Craighead, said he was “delighted” by the installation – one of its most major to date. “Working with CSIRO, we spent years perfecting our batteries for challenging environments like this, and it’s fantastic to see all that effort translate into lower costs, lower emissions and a more sustainable operation,” Craighead said.
Energy Renaissance is currently finishing off its lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility in Tomago in the Hunter Region.
The installation at the Nikep Dairy Farm system was supported by the Victorian government’s Business Recovery Energy Efficiency Fund, co-funded by the Agriculture Victoria Agriculture Energy Investment Plan.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/05/bristol-springs-study-paves-way-for-low-cost-green-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 5, 2022",Bristol Springs study paves way for low-cost green hydrogen,"Aspiring renewables developer Frontier Energy said results from a prefeasibility study (PFS) into its proposed Bristol Springs Solar (BSS) project in Western Australia’s South West region show the development has the potential to be an early mover, low-cost green hydrogen producer.
Frontier on Thursday said the PFS, conducted by Perth-based consultancy firm Xodus Group, is based on the development of a large-scale green hydrogen production facility at Bristol Springs with power sourced from the company’s planned first stage 114 MWdc solar farm.
The solar would power a 36.6 MW alkaline electrolyser, producing an estimated 4.4 million kilograms of green hydrogen per annum. The capital cost estimate for the solar farm is $166.3 million, while establishing the electrolyser is expected to cost about $69.9 million.
Including the estimated capital outlay, the study forecasts a total unit cost of $2.83 per kilogram of hydrogen produced which Frontier said “places the project as one of Australia’s lowest cost green hydrogen producers”.
The projected cost of production also places the project within reach of the economic goal of producing green hydrogen for $2 per kg at which price it is expected to be cost competitive with gas produced using fossil fuels.

Frontier said the projected unit cost of $2.83 per kg is also far lower than the Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) current green hydrogen production cost forecast of between $6 to $9 per kg based on current electrolyser and renewable energy costs.
Frontier executive chair Grant Davey said the low cost is due in part to the project’s location near Waroona, about 120 kilometres south of Perth. To be built on a 195-hectare site next to the Worsley alumina refinery, the project is able to access existing infrastructure, including the Landwehr Terminal power line, allowing for excess solar energy to be sold via WA’s main energy grid. The company said there are also several established water sources in the area, meaning there is no requirement for capital-intensive infrastructure like desalination.
“Green hydrogen is a unique opportunity to store, move and distribute renewable energy and is set to play a huge role in helping humanity in decarbonising the energy we need,” Davey said.
“The Frontier Energy green hydrogen project is strategically located with suitable land, abundant water, South West Interconnected System (SWIS) access, gas pipeline access and transport infrastructure so as to be an Australian leader in ensuring that green hydrogen production and distribution becomes a near-term reality.”
The release of the initial PFS results comes just 48 hours after Frontier announced it had to secured exclusive options to acquire an additional 651 hectares adjacent to the existing BSS project site.

Davey said securing the land will allow the company to pursue its long-term ambitions to expand the size of the solar asset.
“By securing this ground we now have clear sight in increasing our energy production to approximately 500 MW of green energy that can be used to power our green hydrogen production as well as provide green energy onto the energy grid,” he said.
Frontier has previously said construction on the initial stage of the Bristol Springs Solar project is expected to commence in 2023 and it is close to finalising the expansion study that assesses the long-term growth potential of the project and outlines its long-term roadmap through the various stages of hydrogen production.
It also intends to soon commence front-end engineering and design for the hydrogen facility, which will include developing a phasing plan for the staged buildout to 150 MW electrolyser capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/05/cleanco-strikes-renewables-deal-with-scentre-group/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 5, 2022",CleanCo strikes renewables deal with Scentre Group,"Scentre Group, which owns 42 Westfield shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand, has signed a renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) with CleanCo as it looks to cut emissions from its electricity use by 50% by 2025.
Renewable electricity will be sourced from a series of assets including the 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub being developed by French renewables giant Neoen on Queensland’s Darling Downs. CleanCo already has an agreement in place for 320 MW of its capacity. The 157 MW Kaban Green Power Hub being developed by Neoen in north Queensland will also play a part as will the 180 MW Dulacca Wind Farm. CleanCo has PPAs in place for both projects.
Scentre chief financial officer and chief executive officer-elect Elliott Rusanow said the agreement is consistent with the group’s plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.
“We consider responsible, sustainable business a key part of our strategy and ambition to grow,” he said. “We have a strong track record on sustainability, having already reduced our emissions by 30% since Scentre Group was established in 2014. This agreement will help us deliver our interim emission reduction target of 50% by 2025.”
Rusanow said renewable electricity PPAs is one of the ways the group will deliver on its net zero target alongside optimising asset efficiency and the generation of onsite renewable energy.

The group has already rolled out solar across five of its Westfield sites, including a 2.3 MW install atop the Coomera centre in Queensland, and a 1.6 MW rooftop system at Katora in New South Wales and a 1 MW system at Carousel in Western Australia. The company said collectively, the installations generated 7,931 MWh of clean electricity last year and there is more to come.
The group is planning to deploy additional solar at another two Victorian sites this year which will generate an additional 6,200 MWh per annum, increasing the group’s total portfolio solar generation capacity by more than 75%.
“We will continue to evaluate and roll out onsite solar opportunities as well as continue to assess off-site renewable energy procurement opportunities,” the company said.
The signing of the PPA with Scentre follows a similarly large deal struck by CleanCo in March with Australian retail giant Wesfarmers, to provide renewable energy to Kmart, Target, Bunnings and Officeworks.
CleanCo chief executive officer Tom Metcalfe said the government-owned generator was proud to be supporting businesses to achieve their net zero aspirations.
“This deal is another example of how businesses are leading the way to help the state reach net zero, and how CleanCo is supporting businesses meet their own targets,” he said.
“Agreements like this one with Scentre Group underpin our own target of bringing 1,400 MW of new renewable energy into the market by 2025, while supporting the Queensland government’s 50% renewable energy by 2030 target.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/05/recent-events-push-nem-turnover-to-new-heights/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 5, 2022",Recent events push NEM turnover to new heights,"As discussed repeatedly, elevated fuel costs for gas and supply constraints in the market have sent National Electricity Market (NEM) turnover to uncharted territory. By NEM turnover, we refer to the total costs earned by generators for their dispatch into the energy market, effectively the cost of energy in the market.
In the past three months (May 2022 to July 2022), the total wholesale market cost for energy has hit about $18.3 billion, moderating between $5 billion and $6.8 billion per month. This is around a 5x increase in standard monthly NEM turnover (~$1.2 billion per month).
To put recent months into perspective, the total NEM turnover for the entire calendar year of 2021 was $13.7 billion, which shows how fundamentally different recent times are from historical observations. Total NEM turnover in 2022 YTD is already at $25.9 billion with five months remaining in the year, almost double energy costs in 2021.
The increase in wholesale prices was not insulated to just one region but to all regions, which is a rare occurrence. In the past, sharp increases in monthly NEM turnover have been in response to a specific event. However, the last few months have signified an event where all NEM regions are above historical performance due to supply factors.
In fact, on a state basis, each state has surpassed its previous five-year highs for monthly energy turnover in June and July 2022, exceeding previous market highs during distinct events such as Victoria and South Australia during the separation event in January 2019 and Queensland and NSW in June-July 2021 after the Callide incident.

Interestingly, wind and solar generation have been among their highest aggregate monthly levels at around 2.9 TWh per month. However, as higher-priced gas and hydro were still required in dispatched, VRE could not sufficiently dampen price outcomes in general.
The increase in wholesale prices across each hour of the day signifies the increased requirement for higher-priced gas and hydro offers to meet NEM demand. We illustrated this in a previous Chart of the Week published on 15 July, which corresponded to increased price setting by gas and hydro across the NEM at a much higher price point than coal. This is important as the overall level of generation in the NEM was only around 2% higher than the same time last year.
While the events of the previous three months (and near future) are more the result of a temporal shift in fuel costs, it does provide a vision into future NEM pricing dynamics where coal does not set the price as often. Once coal exits, prices will likely show more volatility as periods with lower VRE output will be settled closer to the Short Run Marginal Cost (SRMC) of gas generation.
As the NEM clearing price depends on the marginal MW bid, the effective suppression of the price setting power of gas and hydro requires increased levels of lower cost generation, e.g. increased renewable generation or increased comparatively lower cost coal generation. Diversifying the supply mix with lower-cost generation dilutes the price-setting potential of higher merit order generators.
The other solution that would impact market prices is a decline in fuel costs, directly influencing the gas SRMC. The ACCC netback forward curve as of 29 July 2022 still shows international gas prices at or above $40/GJ until January 2024, which could indicate domestic gas prices remaining elevated into the near future.
However, from the start of August, domestic gas markets are showing some relief from past prices (to around $20/GJ), which would likely help lower the marginal cost of supply for these units. This decline in gas price coincides with the latest ACCC gas report, which forecasts a 56PJ shortfall on the east coast in 2023 and the prospect of the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism being invoked to secure lower cost supply to the domestic market.
It remains to be seen whether the gas price reduction will be sustained however, as the NEM moves towards spring and comparatively lower NEM demand, the market may be in for a period of relief from the currently elevated winter prices.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/05/greenspot-gets-green-light-for-1000-mwh-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 5, 2022","Greenspot gets green light for 1,000 MWh battery","Privately owned development company Greenspot has confirmed that the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) has approved the 500 MW/1,000 MWh Wallerawang 9 Battery energy storage project to be built near Lithgow in the state’s Central Tablelands region.
The estimated $400 million project is to be developed across a 40-hectare plot at the site of the shuttered Wallerawang power plant which has sat idle since it was decommissioned in 2014. The battery, which has an approved dispatch capacity of 500 MW, providing firming capacity to power up to 187,000 homes, will connect to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via Transgrid’s existing 330 kV Wallerawang Substation which is adjacent to the site.
In announcing its decision, the Department of Planning said the battery would be constructed over approximately 12 to 24 months. Construction is expected to be staged with the first stage likely to comprise 300 MW of storage capacity with the second 200 MW to be constructed within five years.
Greenspot chief executive officer Brett Hawkins said securing development approval is an important milestone not only for the project but for NSW’s energy future with the battery to play a “critical role” in supporting the transition of the state’s energy sector away from coal-fired power to renewable energy generation such as wind and solar.
Hawkins said there is an increasing need for battery storage to firm renewable energy sources and the battery’s location, on the southeast border of the planned Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) and adjacent to the main transmission line linking the zone with the major load centres in Sydney, would help unlock new wind and solar capacity and stabilise the electricity grid.
“The Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone is expected to unlock 3 GW of wind and solar generation by the mid-2020s,” he said. “We have secured an approval for a major energy storage project here at Wallerawang which can play a role in making that a reality.
“We intend to team up with leading energy market players to move through the grid connection, financing and construction phases and ultimately to operation in the National Electricity Market.”
Greenspot has previously said it expects the battery to be operational by summer 2023/24 with a final investment decision anticipated later this year.
The Wallerawang 9 Battery project is the first project to be approved as part of Greenspot’s plans to transform the 620-hectare Wallerawang power plant site into a multi-use precinct including an employment enterprise area for a range of industries.
“The greater Lithgow region has contributed to powering NSW for nearly 70 years. The Wallerawang 9 Battery is a signal of the significance of the area’s potential contribution in the future,” Hawkins said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/05/act-details-plan-to-ditch-gas-in-shift-to-electric-future/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 5, 2022",ACT details plan to ditch gas in shift to electric future,"The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government has announced plans to ditch fossil gas with the release of a paper modelling the transition to the full electrification of homes and businesses in the territory by 2045.
The ACT government’s Powering Canberra: Our Pathway to Electrification position paper outlines the decision to transition away from gas as part of a phased shift from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives over the coming two decades.
ACT Climate Change Minister Shane Rattenbury said fossil fuel gas currently accounts for 20% of the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions and reducing Canberra’s gas reliance is a critical part of achieving the ACT’s commitment of net zero emissions by 2045.
“With a 100% renewable electricity supply, electrifying Canberra makes sense and offers the most efficient and reliable zero-emissions option for our future,” he said.
“This is a big transition, and we will ensure it happens in an orderly way. That’s why we’re making this announcement early and allowing two decades for our community to make the necessary changes.”
As part of the initial phase of the transition, new “greenfields” suburbs will no longer be connected to gas mains, and from 2023 new gas connections will cease for future infill developments.
The government is also developing an Integrated Energy Plan for release by 2024 which will establish the foundations for the transition and also consider the use of renewable gas in niche applications.

ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the plan will ensure the territory maintains a “secure, reliable, and increasingly sustainable energy system” into the future and helps the community to plan their switch at a time that is right for them.
“We know there will be costs associated with the transition away from gas, which is why we are giving people certainty now so that the transition can happen gently over the next two decades.” he said.
“This is a long-term and gentle transition and we’re not switching off the gas network overnight … this will be a staged and managed transition.”
Barr said there are government supports and incentives available now for those ready to upgrade from gas to efficient electric appliances including the Sustainable Household Scheme, Home Energy Support Program and Business Water and Energy Program.
The move to ditch gas comes after the ACT last month announced plans to phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles with the government announcing plans to put the brakes on the sale of new petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles from 2035.
Rattenbury said the ban will initially apply to new light vehicles, including passenger cars, motorcycles, and small trucks. It will also be backed up by an EV sales target, with between 80 to 90% of new vehicle sales in 2030 to be zero-emission models.
The ACT government’s plan to move away from fossil gas follows a similar move by the Victorian state government which last month unveiled plans designed to end the state’s reliance on the fossil fuel.

Aces Delta, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Power Americas and Magnum Development LLC, plans to build an underground storage project with a capacity of 300 GWh in Delta, Utah.
Advanced Clean Energy Storage I, LLC recently won a US$504.4 million (AU$725 million) loan guarantee from US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office for the construction of the storage facility. The project will store hydrogen generated by the Intermountain Power Agency’s IPP Renewed Project – an 840 MW hydrogen-capable gas turbine combined cycle power plant located in the area.
“The plant will initially run on a blend of 30% green hydrogen and 70% natural gas starting in 2025 and incrementally expand to 100% green hydrogen by 2045,” Aces Delta said in a statement.
US-based contractor WSP USA has secured an engineering, procurement and construction management contract (EPCM) to build the two underground hydrogen storage caverns, each with a capacity of 150 GWh.
“This stored green hydrogen becomes an energy reserve that can be released to produce fuel for electric power generation at any time,” said WSP USA.
The storage caverns and the power plant will form the Advanced Clean Energy Storage hub, which Aces Delta says will convert renewable energy via 220 MW of electrolysers to produce up to 100 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. The development of the project began in May 2019.
“Central Utah is the ideal location for this project, and Utah is a business-friendly state for projects like this,” said Craig Broussard, CEO of Magnum. “Magnum’s site adjacent to the Intermountain Power Project is positioned to take full advantage of existing regional electricity grid connections, fully developed transportation infrastructure, ample solar and wind development capacity, a skilled workforce currently transitioning away from coal, and, of course, the unique salt dome opportunity.”
Magnum Development also owns a domal-quality salt formation in the western United States and five operational salt caverns for liquid fuel storage.

Sodium-ion batteries continue to edge toward commercialisation as a viable alternative to lithium-ion technology. And researchers from Russia’s Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) and Lomonosov Moscow State University have developed a new cathode material that promises higher energy storage capacity in sodium-ion batteries.
They developed a powder of sodium-vanadium phosphate fluoride (NaVPO4F). It has a particular crystal structure that could ensure 10% to 15% higher energy density than current sodium-ion batteries.
“Our material also compares well with the class of layered materials for cathodes. It provides roughly the same battery capacity and greater stability, which translates into longer life and higher cost-efficiency of the battery,” said Stanislav Fedotov, an assistant professor at Skoltech. “Remarkably, even the theoretical predictions for the competing materials fall short of the practical performance of ours, and this is far from trivial, because the theoretical potential is never fully realised.”
The researchers confirmed the material’s superior characteristics through an experiment, after determining that the crystal structure could unlock the high energy storage potential of NaVPO4F. The one they chose is known as the KTP-type framework and comes from nonlinear optics, which is not common in battery engineering. By combining a NaVPO4F composition and KTiOPO4-type framework via a low-temperature (e.g., 190 C) ion-exchange synthesis approach, the researchers managed to develop a high-capacity and high-voltage positive electrode active material.
When tested in a coin cell configuration in combination with a Na metal negative electrode and a NaPF6-based non-aqueous electrolyte solution, the cathode active material enabled a discharge capacity of 136 mAh g−1 at 14.3 mA g−1, with an average cell discharge voltage of about 4.0 V. The scientists also reported a specific discharge capacity of 123 mAh g−1 at 5.7 A g−1 for the same cell configuration.
They described their research findings in “Development of vanadium-based polyanion positive electrode active materials for high-voltage sodium-based batteries,” which was recently published in Nature Communications.
“Higher energy storage capacity is just one of the advantages of this material,” said Fedotov. “It also enables the cathode to operate at lower ambient temperatures, which is particularly relevant for Russia.”
As lithium prices continue to surge, the need for batteries based on cheap and abundant materials, such as alkali metal sodium, is pressing. The Russian scientists said that efficient materials for sodium-ion batteries could eventually supersede lithium-ion batteries in heavy electric vehicles, such as buses and trucks, as well as in stationary energy storage applications.
