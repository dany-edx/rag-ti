The Energy Bill Buster program, which is to replace the Empowering Homes initiative, will allow eligible households to receive the equivalent of up to 10 years’ worth of rebates in an upfront lump sum contribution of approximately $2,850 towards a solar system or home appliance upgrade.
About one-third of NSW households who have a pensioner concession cardholder already receive a low-income energy rebate to help with bills but the Energy Bill Buster program will allow eligible households to apply for an upfront payment instead of the annual $285 subsidy.
Eligible households will be able to use the money to install a 3kW solar system. The state government estimates the array could save a household up to $600 a year, instead of the annual $285 low-income household rebate.
If the household has access to gas, they will receive an additional $110 subsidy. For those homes not able to install solar, the government is offering access to $4,000 in home appliance upgrades.
NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said the package would help ease cost-of-living pressures as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and supply chain disruptions push up energy prices.
“People living in apartments or renting who can’t have solar installed may be eligible to swap their rebate for a suite of energy saving appliance upgrades, helping to reduce demand on the grid and lower power prices for everyone,” he said.
These appliances include energy-efficient fridges, dryers, air conditioners and hot water systems, as well as energy efficiency upgrades such as window shading and draught sealing.

Climate Council campaigner Louis Brailsford welcomed what he said was a sensible policy, saying it will provide practical help to households to create a sustained reduction in power bills while cutting emissions at the same time.
“The surge in gas prices this year should spur governments around the country to speed up the phase out of fossil fuels in favour of affordable renewables. Replacing inefficient gas appliances in homes with electric alternatives is one of the easiest ways to do this,” he said.
“The quickest and cheapest way to increase Australia’s supply of clean affordable energy is to replace fossil fuels with renewables and electrify our households and businesses.”
The NSW government said it will initially provide funding in the budget for 30,000 households to access the upfront payments, at a cost of $128 million, but will consider further spending if there is strong uptake. The NSW 2022-23 budget is to be announced on June 21.
The Energy Bill Buster program replaces the NSW government’s Empowering Homes initiative which provided eligible homeowners with access to interest-free loans for battery and solar-battery systems. The program promised interest-free loans of up to $9,000 for a battery system or up to $14,000 for a solar and battery system. Applications for the Empowering Homes pilot will close on 31 July, 2022.
The NSW government’s unveiling of the Energy Bill Buster program comes just days after its South Australia counterpart axed a string of renewable energy initiatives introduced to help homeowners access solar, battery energy storage systems and electric vehicle charging solutions.
The South Australian government last week announced it would abandon the $100 million Home Battery Scheme, the Electric Vehicle Smart Charging Subsidy, and the $4.25 million Switch for Solar program.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/08/irena-reveals-stark-reality-of-electricity-access-for-all-by-2030/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,OCEANIA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"JUNE 8, 2022",IRENA reveals stark reality of electricity access for all by 2030,"Solar’s central importance to the energy transition has again been highlighted, this time in a report into the progress of UN sustainable development goal (SDG) number seven.
Set in 2015, SDG 7 calls for “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030 and includes the goals of providing universal access to electricity and clean cooking, of improving energy efficiency and accelerating clean power deployment, and of financing those ambitions.
The latest annual update on the progress of SDG 7 was published last week by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The 266-page document showed funds for SDG 7 slowed in all global regions except Oceania in 2019.
In that region, the rise in funding from $77 million to $132 million was mostly devoted to solar generation capacity, the report stated.
Funding for solar more than halved in western Asia and North Africa in 2019, from $1 billion a year earlier to $460 million, helping drive a 22% total year on year reduction in SDG 7 funding in the region, from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion.

Sub-Saharan Africa saw only a 1.7% reduction in SDG 7 funding from 2018 to 2019, Irena calculated, with the $4 billion attracted amounting to 37% of global SDG 7 commitments to developing countries.
While a chunk of the cash was devoted to solar, the report noted PV funding was “no longer on the rise” in Africa in 2019.
Despite resilient funding for Africa, the study pointed out Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi, and Mozambique all saw the proportion of their populations without access to electricity rise, from 2018 to 2020.
The study added only 12% of people in Burundi had access to electricity in 2020, only 11% in Chad, and only 7% in South Sudan.
While Chad and East Timor received SDG 7 funding in 2019, after an absence the previous year, according to Irena, Sao Tome et Principe, Eritrea, and Kiribati received nothing to drive the development goal in 2019.
The document stated 21% of renewable energy funding in 2019 went to solar, down from 24% a year earlier, from 28% in 2012, and from a peak of 51% in 2016 which was driven largely by projects backed by the International Finance Corp private sector arm of the World Bank.
The $10.9 billion total funds directed toward SDG 7 goals in 2019 was lower than the $11.2 billion recorded in 2010, according to the study, and well short of the $24.7 billion observed in 2017.
That could be in part down to donor nations diverting cash to their Covid-19 spending, the report noted, adding 90% of the $710 billion of Covid spending relevant to SDG 7 went to advanced economies.
Rising energy prices saw 90 million people in Asia and Africa who previously had access to electricity become unable to afford power in 2021, the report said.
In terms of the outlook for SDG 7, attaining universal access to electricity will require 100 million new connections per year, with 80 million of them in Africa, according to Irena.
That will require $35 billion per year through to 2030, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) calculations, plus $6 billion per year for clean cooking.
Reaching a net zero carbon global economy by 2050 will require funding to hit $4 trillion per year by 2030, according to the body, and capping the average global temperature rise this century at 1.5 degrees Celsius will need almost $5 trillion per year through to 2030, according to Irena’s figures.
Renewables project funding alone needs to hit $1 trillion to $1.7 trillion annually, the IEA has estimated, with more effort needed in the heating and transport sectors to match the achievements to date in clean electricity generation.
As things stand, IRENA has predicted 670 million people will be without electricity at the end of the decade and 2.1 billion will lack access to clean cooking – which includes gas appliances.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/08/aemo-boss-backs-renewables-to-deliver-nations-energy-transition/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 8, 2022",AEMO boss backs renewables to deliver nation’s energy transition,"Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) chief executive officer Daniel Westerman told a Melbourne audience this week that with Australia needing “a heck of a lot more” energy to meet future demands, firmed renewables are the best option to drive down energy costs and to hit economy-wide net-zero targets.
“We know through the work that’s gone into developing the Integrated System Plan (ISP), that firmed renewables will provide the most economic form of electricity generation moving forward,” Westerman told the audience at the Australian Energy Week conference in Melbourne on Tuesday.
“The ISP that we will formally release later this month will contain an updated roadmap to integrate greater levels of cheap, clean, renewable generation, and the right firming capacity into the NEM.
“The sooner the nation can integrate higher levels of firmed renewables into the energy system, the sooner we can electrify more of the economy and the sooner we can decouple energy costs from international factors, the sooner we can reduce stress on Australian homes and businesses.”
AEMO estimates that by 2050 the amount of energy delivered to customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) will nearly double, up from 180TWh to about 330TWh per year as transport, heating, and industrial processes are electrified.
This energy will be delivered almost solely by renewables with large-scale wind and solar capacity projected to triple by 2030. The market operator’s latest ISP forecasts that utility-scale capacity will increase from 15GW currently to nearly 140GW by 2050 to meet demand as coal-fired generation withdraws.
Westerman is confident the generation requirements can be satisfied by renewables with an estimated 130GW of new large-scale wind, solar and storage projects in its current pipeline of potential connections.
“Of course, they won’t all come through, but you know, the ideas are there and the projects are there,” he said. “Right now, our National Connections team are managing grid connections for 189 new projects, mostly renewable generation and storage installations.

“In the past year, we connected 4GW in new renewable generation and storage projects. That’s up 40% on the previous year, and actually double the amount connected the year before. And if all goes to plan, at the end of the calendar year we’ll have connected nearly 5GW, so a 20% increase again.
“But 5GW per year is actually the minimum that we will need to connect every year for the remainder of the decade to replace the energy supplied by the retiring coal fleet.”
While investors continue to roll out new project proposals, Westerman said one major concern for the successful transition of Australia’s energy system to a renewables-dominated grid will be the delivery of sufficient firming capacity to ensure it remains functional.
“It is insufficient to have the energy there if it’s not there at the right time,” he said. “That firming capacity, including dispatchable storage, is absolutely critical and, to be frank, one of my worries is we’re not really seeing that investment in firming capacity in sufficient scale at the moment.”
AEMO estimates the grid will need a tripling of dispatchable firming capacity by 2050, from 20GW today to 60GW, which will come from a combination of technologies including big batteries, pumped hydro energy storage and demand response.
Westerman said the approvals process for transmission projects will also need an overhaul with new interconnectors needed to help alleviate network congestion and transport the electrons from areas of renewable generation to consumers.

“The approvals process for new transmission is a pain for everyone,” he said. “If you take the Western Victoria Transmission Network Project, the first transmission project in about 30 years, conceived to carry renewable energy from Western Victoria to Melbourne … we‘ve seen local communities upset that their concerns haven’t been heard during the RIT-T process.
“To build the transmission the whole industry and government must build the social licence with communities affected. And that needs a new approvals process that considers and evaluates their concerns at the start, not the end, of the process.
“For those of us in the energy industry, and I include AEMO here too, we all need to better sell the benefits of enabling the transition to a decarbonised energy future. It underpins the net-zero economy.”
Transgrid chief executive officer Brett Redman echoed Westerman’s transmission concerns, telling the audience “the policy initiatives we’re thinking about is how do we get on with it? How can we unlock the ability to build with confidence”.
“The more we can start to put in place more multi-year, five, six or seven-year programs rather than individual stages of projects, the more we can start to plan with suppliers and really lay out what is our build program, so they can get supply chains right and we can start to roll out in the most efficient manner we can,” he said.
“There is a lot of work ahead of us but transmission infrastructure is what will drive the transition to clean energy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/08/enphase-claims-new-safety-regulations-mean-more-aussie-installers-prefer-its-iq-microinverters/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 8, 2022",Enphase claims new safety regulations mean more Aussie installers prefer its IQ Microinverters,"US-based microinverter manufacturer Enphase Energy claims a growing number of Australian solar installers are now exclusively offering Enphase products after increased solar safety regulations and compliance standards came into effect in May. 
AS/NSS5033:2021 is an update to installation and safety requirements for PV arrays that came into effect across Australia in May 2022. The tightened regulations introduce new compliance measures for DC string-inverter-based solar systems, including restrictive cable runs, IEC 62930 compliant DC cables and warning signs for DC voltage. 
However, Enphase claims that its microinverters, which operate as AC decentralised inverter-based systems at extra-low voltage, are exempt from most new regulations. The company claims this exemption is prompting “some Australian solar installers” to “exclusively” push Enphase technology. 
One such installer, John Inglis, founder of Positronic Solar, said his company is “well known in the industry for testing solar system components to destruction before we include them in our designs, which is an important factor in our decision to drop DC string solar systems and exclusively offer Enphase technology.” 
“Our extensive experience witnessing the advantages Enphase systems offer our customers makes its microinverters a fundamental part of our uncompromising commitment to solar quality and safety,” Inglis said.
Aleksandar Arnautovic, director at Sydney Air and Solar, seconded Inglis. “Because each solar panel is fitted with its own inverter and there is never any high-voltage DC electricity in the system, Enphase microinverters provide AC reliability and safety as well as panel-level smarts,” said Arnautovic. “We chose to go 100% Enphase to offer both our residential and commercial customers a solar solution that would deliver long-term benefits, flexibility, and return-on-investment.” 
Similarly, Evo Solar’s Cameron Pike said “the rapid changes in Australia’s solar standards to address lagging safety issues have been negated by the intelligent design of the Enphase energy platform, and this gives us 100% confidence in the products we sell and the future-proofing benefits our customers receive.” 
Enphase says that its IQ Microinverters go through more than one million cumulative hours of power-on testing (in aggregate), to ensure the product is undaunted by heat, high humidity, salty air, extreme cold or harsh conditions. Enphase offers a 10-year warranty which can be extended up to 25 years with an additional fee. 
Enphase Energy’s chief commercial officer Dave Ranhoff, said, “given the huge role solar power plays in building a clean energy future, any compromises on electrical safety and component quality are the antithesis of sustainability.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/08/melbourne-homeowner-in-heritage-overlay-ordered-to-remove-rooftop-solar-panels/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 8, 2022",Melbourne homeowner in ‘heritage overlay’ ordered to remove rooftop solar panels,"A homeowner in the Melbourne suburb of Canterbury has been ordered to remove his recently installed solar panels by his local council. That very council, the City of Boroondara, formally declared a climate emergency in 2021 and called for a tripling of rooftop solar in its catchment.  
The reason? The home is within a heritage overlay, that zone long-dreaded by renovators and now also the frustration of people looking to reduce their emissions and excessive energy bills by installing rooftop solar. 
According to The Age, Richard Barnes installed the panels last year and challenged the notice from the City of Boroondara in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). However, Barnes was ordered to remove the panels by June 26. 
“We just think it’s crazy given the bigger picture,” Barnes said. “Somehow these anachronistic heritage guidelines defeated combating the climate crisis. I think it’s ridiculous.” 
Barnes, who already has solar hot water panels on his home’s north-facing roof, said the removal of panels from his street-facing roofs directed eastward and westward would reduce his total electricity generation by 40%. 
“It really brings it all to a head,” Barnes continued. “Are these things ugly? And do we still, in 2022, say ‘No, we don’t like them’? Or do we say ‘Well, actually there’s a climate crisis, and let’s forget all that stuff now’.” 
One VCAT member, Jane Tate, said the sustainability concerns raised by Barnes “are not contained in the relevant decision guidelines of the applicable heritage policies”. 
According to the ABC, the City of Boroondara says no request to install the panels was submitted, while Barnes himself says no permit would’ve been provided anyway. In light of the overarching climate crisis, it seems that Barnes assumed it would be easier to ask forgiveness rather than permission. 
However, the issue seems to be one of aesthetic heritage. Strange considering the solar panels were installed on a suburban rooftop and not on Uluru or the Opera House. 
Tate said that while the panels do not damage or alter the roof in any way, they do obscure a “sizeable proportion” of the western roof panel on the principal facade. “I consider this will detract from the heritage significance of the dwelling as it presents to the street,” she said. 
“Whilst the panels are obviously a modern feature that could be removed later, I consider this is unlikely given the shift towards use of renewable energy.”
Interestingly, the chief executive of the Victorian branch of heritage group the National Trust of Australia, Simon Ambrose, came out in support of Barnes and the installation of solar panels on heritage buildings. 
“The transition to solar energy needs to be balanced with the heritage values of individual places on a case-by-case basis, and in most places, it’s possible to integrate solar technology without compromising heritage significance,” Ambrose said.
However, Ambrose, like VCAT, suggested a compromise between solar installation and heritage properties is to install said panels on rear-sided roofs, which therefore won’t affect the streetscape aesthetic. 
Of course, where panels are best positioned depends on the roof layout of the house in relation to the arc of the sun, so this compromise is only feasible in heritage-listed properties whose rear-facing roofs are ideally positioned. 
Not the first time, not the last 
Barnes is not the first heritage-listed homeowner to be told to remove solar panels, similar notices have been given to residents in Bayside, Nillumbik, the City of Hobsons Bay and the City of Yarra. 
In 2019, a study produced by academics from Sweden’s Uppsala University and architectural consultancy Gitter Consult AB sought to establish when it is appropriate to install solar on historic buildings and how to do so with minimum visual impact.
In the paper Target-based visibility assessment on building envelopes: Applications to PV and cultural-heritage values – published in Energy and Buildings and on the ScienceDirect website – the authors recommended solar installed on historic buildings should take into account shading, visibility and cultural-heritage values.
In visibility terms, the impact on nearby residents should be the primary concern, wrote the authors of the study. They suggested PV arrays can be installed provided there is high integration with a building’s roof and no risk of damaging or distorting the fabric of the structure.
A more recent 2022 study from researchers at the University of Cambridge found that installing solar panels could help historic buildings beat the rising costs of energy. 
The study published in the journal Energy Science & Engineering found that the Grade I listed Bath Abbey could save around 10 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually while generating 45 MWh of clean solar energy.
“Not only does it make financial sense, but the installation of solar panels on Bath Abbey could inspire reinvigoration of solar PV deployment in the UK which has stagnated over the past five years,” said co-author Adam Urwick.
“It was exciting to contribute to work on such an iconic building in my hometown,” said co-author Alan Bowman, from Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory. “We’ve shown that it’s possible for historical buildings to reduce their carbon footprint without impacting how they look from the ground, demonstrating that almost everyone is able to help tackle the climate emergency. I’m hopeful our work will encourage other historical buildings to consider installing solar panels.” 
Famous heritage-listed buildings around the world are already sporting solar PV, including Edinburgh Castle and the Vatican.

BIPV opportunity? 
What is clear in this case is that the climate crisis, increasing energy bills and heritage preservation can sometimes be at odds. However, when it comes to PV that need not be the case. 
After all, when it comes to cases of heritage-listed buildings is this not the ideal market opportunity for custom designed building integrated PV (BIPV)? 
Of course, a copper-plated steampunk-inspired module or a more inconspicuous solar tile might be more expensive for the owners of heritage-listed properties, but perhaps the increasingly aesthetic capabilities in BIPV is the only solution to this problem that will satisfy all parties.

The coalition, whose 29 signatories include Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton, Rewiring Australia founder Saul Griffith and Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox, said a staged approach, including accelerating the transition to renewables will be key to addressing the crisis, warning short-term responses are unlikely to be sustainable for the long term.
“A staged response is essential because this crisis includes both acute price pain and the likelihood of chronic high prices thereafter,” the group said in a statement. “Only a handful of measures are likely to help in the short term and they are unlikely to be sustainable.
“A balanced response will address both the supply and the demand sides of this crisis.”
Residents in Australia’s eastern states are facing massive energy price hikes. The prices of coal and gas have surged in recent months and wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed. The Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) has reported that in the first quarter of 2022 wholesale prices went up 141% from last year.
The price spikes have been linked to challenging global environment triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine while extreme weather events in New South Wales and South-East Queensland have also contributed, as have unplanned outages at several of Australia’s ageing coal plants.
Australian Industry Group chief Willox said “all of Australia’s former energy strengths – our reliance on the legacy coal generation fleet, large gas resources and a deep entanglement with export energy markets – are working against us in the current circumstances”.
Willox called on the new federal government to act urgently on the current electricity price crisis, including having the Commonwealth re-engage with state governments on the energy transition.
“Apocalyptic rises in energy prices threaten chaos for industry and pain for households,” he said. “They demand a national, integrated and strategic response.”

Bowen, who will today meet with the state and territory energy ministers to discuss solutions as the federal government weighs up measures to take pressure off prices and ease the current supply situation, said that energy markets are facing a “geopolitical situation around the world”.
“We are facing some coal-fired power closure station outages and some flooding impacts on coal mines and an array of other factors,” he said. “The situation is serious, but it is being managed. The Albanese Labor government will take whatever action is necessary to ensure ongoing reliability and affordability for the energy markets … based on expert advice.”
The group of peak bodies, including business representatives, consumer advocates, farmers, investors, the property sector, and Australia’s energy and energy management sectors, said the ministers need to focus on neglected parts of the energy transition, including supporting improvements in energy efficiency and demand-side energy management, alongside ongoing support to increase the supply of low-cost and-low emissions energy.
“A long-standing lack of investment in energy efficiency, energy management and fuel switching has left Australians more vulnerable both to high prices and to extreme weather,” it said.
“Demand-side investments don’t just pay off through lower individual bills. They deliver improved health and higher energy productivity, reduce the need for new supply-side investment, and help us reach our emissions goals.”
“Accelerating our clean energy transition in a fair and inclusive way will ultimately deliver durable help, but while that requires immediate action it will largely impact the medium term.”
The group said a faster buildout of large-scale renewables and transmission “makes all the sense in the world”, as does accelerating the transition from natural gas to green hydrogen but warned making it work would require a collaborative approach.
“Actually making this acceleration work will be complex, requiring reforms and coordination across multiple jurisdictions and both public and private investments,” it said.

Mark Babcock: Very good interest. We just announced the product last week and we’re showing it for the first time here. As far as availability is concerned, we’re launching in Australia in Q3 and the first European countries in Q4. And the whole reason behind this is that we have a different channel than everybody else has. In many countries we sell direct to the installer, and even if we do sell through a wholesaler we maintain a relationship with the installer. We have an ‘Advantage Installer Program’ (for dealers who buy through installers) that allows us to communicate directly and we’re quite confident that they’ll be able to sell an integrated solution, one brand, it’s going to have a good appeal to the end consumer.
And why is Australia the launching pad for this solution?
MB: It’s really the fact that certifications are better and faster in Australia compared to anywhere else. And Australia, like every market that does storage, is hungry for product. So, given where availability is on storage, we should get good uptake, people will try it, and then assuming they like it they’ll come back. Especially among our stickier channels (we have a lot of partners who are 50%, 60%, 70% of all of their sales are SunPower products), the reception has been really positive so far.
Sustainability of supply chain is a big talking point here, is that something you’ve also noticed with partners and potential clients during the event?
MB: Absolutely, sustainability is a big talking point with a lot of companies in general, but notably utility-scale developers. I sat down with an Australian developer the other day and we had one of our lawyers with us to answer all the questions about how we document our supply chain and perform our traceability checks, and that’s not only for the US market but for Australia and others too. We really do have a commitment to sustainability, we get certifications from our entire supply chain, we audit them, we do everything to make sure our supply chain is compliant with ensuring no presence of forced labour.
Coming back to Australia, which has had enormous PV penetration for a long time but has now reached a pinch point where people are finally starting to incorporate more pieces to their home systems, such as storage and electric vehicles (EVs). Is this ideal timing for an integrated system offering? 
MB: Absolutely. I was in Australia last week doing partner meetings, presenting our solution, and already our partners are telling us that they’re seeing anywhere from 10-30% of new installations going in with battery storage. So, there is certainly interest in Australia, and the interest is two-fold. One is moving energy to the proper time, just as it is in Europe, but also there is the matter of backup capability and reliability, and that’s one of the reasons why we’ve incorporated backup capability as standard. So really in terms of spec and design the product is best suited to the Australian market to start with.
Australians certainly like to know that if the grid fails, they’re not going to get shafted.
MB: Exactly. And in the Australian residential market we see third-party sources that say the market will level out and drift down. But we’re not necessarily convinced because when you look at the penetration rates of EVs in Australia, it is still extremely low. We think that as the EV penetration rate continues to increase, you’re going to have to have more and more solar installations. And if you think about those installations 10-12 years ago, when you could get a kW for free, how many systems are that same old single kW? And how soon will we expect those consumers to be looking for more power, more production capability, and go in with an entirely new system. We think we’re especially well-positioned there due to efficiency and durability and everything else. In general, we see Australia being one of the markets that may well have the renewal of systems before others, simply due to the characteristics of what was put on the roofs 10-12 years ago.

The module’s conversion efficiency — currently the world’s highest, according to the company — bests that of a similar Sharp module developed under another NEDO project in 2016, which achieved an efficiency of 31.17%, at the time a world record.
The new prototype uses a triple-junction compound design that sandwiches the solar cell between layers of film. The module is expected to be used in a variety of vehicles, an application that demands high efficiency and lightweight construction. Modules measuring about 29 by 34 centimetres (for an area of 965 square cm), a size which is large enough to be commercially viable, weigh only about 56 grams (0.58 kilograms per square meter).
Sharp’s triple-junction compound solar cell adopts a proprietary structure that comprises three photo-absorption layers with indium gallium arsenide as the bottom layer so that sunlight can be efficiently converted into electricity. Smaller cells using this structure (with an area of 1.047 cm2) achieved a conversion efficiency of 37.9% in April 2013. In 2016, Sharp used practically sized cells (with an area of 27.86 cm2) to create a composite module (with an area of 968 cm2) to achieve a conversion efficiency of 31.17%, at the time the world’s highest.
In this current project, Sharp increased the average conversion efficiency of its triple-junction compound solar cells (with an area of 22.88 cm2) from the 2016 modules (from about 34.5% to about 36%) and improved the cell fill factor on each module to improve the conversion efficiency for a practically sized module (with an area of 965 scm2) to 32.65%.
Sharp said it would continue to conduct R&D into more efficient, lower-cost solar modules with a view to their use in such applications as electric vehicles (EVs) and aerospace.
Solar cells for EVs that provide direct electricity promise to make electric cars more convenient for users due to lower fuel costs and less time required for charging.
“Against this backdrop, Sharp has been developing high-efficiency, low-cost solar modules that can conform to the curved surfaces of vehicles for use in a broad range of vehicles, including in standard EV and aerospace applications, by 2050,” the company said.
