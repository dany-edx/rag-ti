The company’s iron ore operations in the Pilbara are on an islanded network with power currently supplied by its 190 MW Yarnima gas-fired power station. The miner also uses about 1,500 megalitres of diesel each year in more than 1,000 pieces of equipment.
BHP last year announced it planned to increase the volume of renewables powering its Western Australian operations and anticipated having up to 200 MW each of wind and solar and 150 MW of battery energy storage capacity installed by 2030.
The Australian Financial Review has now reported that the miner has issued a request for proposal (RFP) for renewables and storage at its Pilbara operations.
“If completed, the procurement process is expected to see hundreds of millions of dollars spent on new wind farms and battery storage systems for the region,” the AFR said.
BHP was contacted for comment but had not responded prior to publication.
The company has stated that it is aiming to reduce its operational emissions by 30% by the end of the decade, based on 2020 levels, and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. BHP has flagged spending about $6 billion (USD 4 billion) to achieve its medium and long-term emissions reduction targets.
The latest development follows BHP’s signing of a power purchase agreement (PPA) that will utilise solar, wind and pumped hydro to provide about 50% of the forecasted electricity demand of its central Queensland coal operations.
BHP has also inked a 70 MW baseload renewable energy contract with Neoen to meet half of the needs of its Olympic Dam mining operations in South Australia, and penned an agreement with developer TransAlta Renewables which has built a new 38 MW solar system and a 10.1 MW/5.4 MWh battery energy storage system to help power BHP’s Nickel West mining operation in WA’s Goldfields region.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/22/investor-group-warns-of-revenue-risk-for-solar-farms/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Investor group warns of revenue risk for solar farms,"The Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) has predicted that intra-regional loss factors for generation projects in southwest New South Wales (NSW) and northwest Victoria could decrease by up to 10% compared to the 2023-24 financial year after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) released its preliminary marginal loss factors (MLFs) for 2024-25.
“The preliminary MLFs will deliver a blow to solar farms who had finally been able to increase their output after Transgrid made some fixes to the transmission network in southwest NSW,” CEIG Policy Director Marilyne Crestias said.
AEMO said the MLFs outlined in the Preliminary Marginal Loss Factors: FY 2024-25 report are “indicative” and intended to provide an early indication to stakeholders of the potential direction and the extent of movement in MLFs across the National Electricity Market (NEM).
MLFs represent the transmission losses within each of the five regions of the NEM and depend on factors such as the amount of existing and new generation, electricity flows, and supply and demand. An MLF of 1.0 indicates that all of the output is credited, but an MLF of 0.75 means projects could potentially lose 25% of their revenue.
Crestias said because of the way they are calculated, MLFs can change materially year on year and any changes directly translate to the revenue that generators receive for their output.
“MLFs have a direct impact on the revenue received by generators, and this volatility and lack of predictability create risk for investors,” she said.
“This is not just an issue for generators and investors – lack of revenue predictability adds risk, which ultimately impacts the price and make-up of the electricity used by consumers.”
AEMO preliminary calculations show that MLFs in southwest NSW have decreased materially, driven by a notable increase in the generation capacity within this area and a reduction in the level of congestion within the area.
“Congestion has been less than that anticipated, which has resulted in increased production by impacted generation,” the market operator said. “This increase in generation has impacted MLF outcomes in two ways, by concentrating generation toward the middle of the day and increasing flows.”
AEMO said northwest Victoria has also seen notable reductions, due to an increase in local generation and a decrease in local load resulting in increased net exports from this area.
Some of the Victorian generation projects facing MLF cuts include the Bannerton Solar Farm which is set to have its intra-regional loss factor reduced from 0.8947 to 0.8349 while the Gannawarra Solar Farm faces a reduction from 0.9413 to 0.8965. The Kiamal Solar Farm is set to have its MLF reduced from 0.8755 to 0.8144 while the Karadoc Solar Farm faces a cut from 0.8877 to 0.8235.
In southwest NSW, the Sunraysia Solar Farm faces a reduction from 0.8255 to 0.7524, the Broken Hill Solar Farm is set to have its MLF cut from 0.8324 to 0.7467, and the Finley Solar Farm faces a cut from 0.9255 to 0.8738. The Limondale solar farms 1 and 2 also face reductions, from 0.8255 and 0.8310 to 0.7524 and 0.7585, respectively.
In contrast to southwest NSW and northern Victoria solar farms, generators in Queensland are forecasted to enjoy MLF increases, those Tasmania are also winners in this draft document while MLFs in South Australia have, on average, seen little variation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/22/navigating-the-renewable-space-in-2024-what-lessons-can-epcs-and-government-learn-from-2023/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 22, 2024",Navigating the renewable space in 2024: What lessons can EPCs and government learn from 2023?,"Government policies have played a pivotal role in nurturing a robust renewable industry and green economy in Australia but as we race toward our 2030 decarbonisation targets, the optimisation of tendering processes for developers will emerge as the next priority in the coming year. Achieving clean energy targets cannot be done effectively without collaboration between the government, developers and investors.
Last year was marked by unprecedented investments and substantial renewable market share growth within the National Electricity Market (NEM).
The questions that now loom large are whether this trajectory can be sustained in 2024, and how we can refine our approach to procurement and financing to ensure a greener tomorrow. It’s commendable that we can now say that Australia is approaching the midway point of its goal to achieve 82% renewables by 2030.
In fact, renewable energy sources contributed almost 40% to the total electricity demand last year. It’s a testament to the collaborative efforts of small-scale solar, wind, and large-scale solar projects across the nation. The proportion of coal in the NEM has also plummeted from 86% to 59%, signalling a definitive shift that is set to accelerate in the coming year.
This decline is not merely a fleeting trend but a precursor to the transformative changes positioned to unfold. So much so, that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) paints an ambitious vision, that by 2050 Australia is expected to require a staggering ninefold increase in utility-scale solar and wind generating capacity compared to current levels.
Amidst this promising landscape, the role of EPC firms has become increasingly vital. As we find ourselves charting our course towards 2030 decarbonisation targets, the support and empowerment of EPCs are non-negotiable. These firms are and will continue to be the architects of our renewable future, tasked with bringing to life the infrastructure that will shape the energy landscape for decades to come.
Late last December, the New South Wales (NSW) government made a bold move, injecting a substantial $4.2 billion into wind, solar, and storage projects. State Energy Minister Penny Sharpe announced that this shift places NSW nearly halfway towards its targeted 12,000 MW of new wind and solar capacity, a crucial step in phasing out aging coal generators.
Considering the challenges posed by the delayed closure of the Eraring Power Plant Station, there is a compelling case for the NSW government to invest additional capital into developing green projects. Such proactive measures will not only accelerate the shift towards renewable energy but also address community concerns.
At the Commonwealth level, the National Reconstruction Fund and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) will play integral roles, offering substantial financial and technical resources. In the 2022-23 financial year, ARENA achieved record funding approvals, totalling $544.1 million for 60 projects valued at over $3.5 billion. The anticipation of an expansion of this financial support aligns well with the government’s redefined 2030 net-zero emissions targets.
Even with additional funding challenges remain and it’s important to point out that the first half of 2023 presented noteworthy challenges, with the slowest pace of final approvals for new wind and solar farms in the Clean Energy Council’s six-year tracking history.
Concerns arose about Australia’s ability to meet the ambitious 2030 decarbonisation targets, despite robust governmental support. This setback serves as a valuable lesson for the government to work toward streamlining and ensuring the consistency of tendering and project approval processes throughout 2024.
As we navigate the upcoming year, a pivotal factor in assessing governmental progress will be the efficacy of changes in processes and approval timelines—a crucial consideration to address challenges experienced in Q1 and Q2 of last year.
Fortunately, signs point towards a positive trend, such as the NSW government’s investment of $128 million into communities hosting transmission lines and power plants last year, along with a pledged additional $800 million to expedite the connection of regional energy projects to the grid.
The anticipated 2024-25 budget will also determine the specific green areas into which the government will channel its investment efforts. This strategic allocation of funds will not only impact the overall growth of the renewable energy sector but will also serve as a catalyst for states and territories to benefit from a positive trickle-down effect.
As we embark on the journey into 2024, the call to action is clear. Developers, including EPCs, must persist in expanding and innovating, collaborating closely with communities and the government. In return, the support and empowerment of EPCs through government funding are no longer a nice to have, but rather a must have. 2024 will also be a year where the effectiveness of schemes and the prudent allocation of funds will face scrutiny.
Learning from the experiences of 2023, both governments and developers must engage in more meaningful conversations, allocate additional funding, and prioritise streamlined processes with nimble approval timelines.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/22/nz-developer-gets-go-ahead-for-three-new-solar-farms/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NEW ZEALAND",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 22, 2024",NZ developer gets go-ahead for three new solar farms,"Solar generation company Lodestone Energy announced it has been given the green light for three new solar farms to be constructed in the Canterbury and South Canterbury regions on New Zealand’s South Island.
The projects include the Clandeboye, the Mount Somers and the Dunsandel solar farms. Lodestone has been asked to detail the individual capacity of each of the projects but had not responded prior to publication. The company did say that construction for all three of the projects is planned from 2024 through to 2026.
Lodestone General Manager of Development, Daniel Cunningham, said the projects will adhere to agrivoltaic principles, allowing for productive farming activity to continue.
“This combined use of agricultural and solar productivity results in more efficient use of the land and creates new value for the nation,” he said.
The projects are part of the company’s second phase of growth and follow on from the initial stage that includes five large-scale solar farms with a combined generation capacity of more than 365 GWh per annum.
This includes New Zealand’s largest operating solar farm, the 39.4 MW Kaitaia Solar Farm which is now exporting clean energy to the grid at the far north of the North Island.
Lodestone’s phase one program also includes the 32 MW Edgecumbe Solar Farm which is being built in the Bay of Plenty Region on the North Island and is nearing completion. The company is also preparing to break ground on the Waiotahe solar project while construction of the Whitianga and Dargaville solar farms is expected to commence later this year.
The company said its phase two projects are planned to be larger in scale that those in the initial stage, and along with the three South Island sites, a number of additional projects are expected to be announced in 2024.
Loadstone’s developments are part of a growing list of large-scale solar projects in New Zealand, including two in the Waikato region on the upper North Island that have been recently approved under the government’s fast-tracking regulations.
The 146 MWp Rangiriri and 190 MWp Waerenga solar farms, being developed by United Kingdom-based Island Green Power, have been given the go-ahead by two independent consenting panels. Each project involves constructing a solar farm with associated 220 kV substation, transmission lines and cables. The two projects will also include a combined 520 MW of battery storage.
The projects received consent to build within six months of applying to the government, under the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Act 2020 which New Zealand Environment Minister David Parker said is set to become permanent.
“Fast-track was originally intended as a temporary measure, but its success means that the process will be soon become permanent,” he said. “The Natural and Built Environment Bill, to be passed this term, will provide a fast-track pathway for infrastructure and regionally significant housing projects.”
Two million solar panels in New Zealand have been fast tracked since the introduction of the scheme, including nine solar projects that Parker said will add more than 1.1 GW of power to the national grid at peak output.
The government’s goals are for New Zealand’s total electricity needs to be met 100% by renewable energy by 2030, and for the country to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The system includes more than 2,000 solar panels and 13 inverters and is expected to generate an estimated 21% of the park’s annual electricity usage. The panels will generate enough energy to power the equivalent of 198 houses for a year and will reduce the park’s carbon footprint by an estimated 920 tonnes in the first year.
Origin Zero General Manager of Business Development and Advisory Liam McWhirter said the company had collaborated with Dreamworld’s parent company, Coast Entertainment Holdings, formerly Ardent Leisure, to design a system that best satisfies the theme park’s energy requirements.
“Dreamworld’s energy use is heaviest during the day, which makes the theme park perfectly placed to reap the benefits of solar, particularly when you consider Queensland weather,” he said.
“We’ve worked closely with Dreamworld to understand their business and utilise data and insights to identify the right solutions to suit their energy needs and ambitions.”
Origin said the initial elements of the project are now fully installed with the system due to commence operation by April.
Coast Entertainment Director of Commercial and Facilities, Dwayne Clark, said the company had been exploring the best avenues to reduce its environmental footprint at Dreamworld and the new solar installation marks a significant step in that process.
“Given our location and the space we have on site to maximise solar solutions, it became a simple decision for our business as we identified the longer-term reduction in energy costs far outweighed the upfront installation cost of the solar panels, as well as having a significant environmental benefit,” he said.
Other Origin Zero national business projects currently in the pipeline include 25 solar system and smart energy dashboard installs at JB Hi-Fi east coast stores, offsetting more than 342 tonnes of carbon, and 20 MW of solar panels on 100 Coles supermarket stores, plus battery energy storage systems, connected to Origin’s in-house virtual power plant (VPP) to enable demand management.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/22/us-startup-developing-perovskite-silicon-tandem-panels-with-26-efficiency/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JANUARY 22, 2024",US startup developing perovskite-silicon tandem panels with 26% efficiency,"From pv magazine USA
California-based Tandem PV, a startup company developing mechanically-stacked, four-terminal, perovskite-silicon modules, announced a $9.09 million (USD 6 million) venture funding round. The company, which was founded in 2016, said it will use the funds to accelerate towards commercialisation, investing in research and development and plans for its first manufacturing facility.
The round was led by existing investor Planetary Technologies, an early-stage venture capital firm, joined by new compatriot investor Uncorrelated Ventures.
The new capital is a validation of the venture’s progress in terms of stability, power conversion efficiency, and module size, according to Tandem PV, CEO, Scott Wharton. “Everyone talks about durability and stability, but we are able to demonstrate it,” he told pv magazine.
“Our indoor tests are showing 80% performance after 25 years equivalent. The encapsulated tandem module’s power conversion efficiency is 26% with conventional PERC cells,” said Wharton, adding that the modules measure 100 cm2, with newer ones at 300 cm2.
The company did not provide more details about the module and cell technology.
Tandem PV is one of multiple teams using the US Department of Energy’s PV Accelerator for Commercialising Technologies (PACT) for independent performance and reliability testing for all varieties of perovskite PV modules and mini modules, including field testing.
To date, the company has raised $40.9 million in venture capital and government support. It expects the latest financing round to help bring in customer agreements and to begin building the first plant. The next steps for this year are third-party validation of the performance metrics, specifically efficiency and durability, and to take part in outdoor testing programs.
The performance tests are the latest step that seven-year-old Tandem PV is taking toward commercializing its mechanically stacked panels. It has fabricated 100 cm2 panels which have passed IEC 61215 accelerated tests with academic partners, and has received initial data on passing triple-length duration IEC 61215 tests, as Colin Bailie, CTO, told pv magazine in a 2023 interview.
The initial application Tandem PV will target is utility-scale PV.
