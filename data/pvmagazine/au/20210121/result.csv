Hailed as the nation’s largest geographical expansion of the NEM, the $1.5 billion transmission link would integrate the state’s isolated north-west power supply with North Queensland and the rest of the state’s electricity network.
The latest funding injection will allow for development activities to continue and help progress the project to final investment decision in 2021.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the funding, which builds on a $14.8 million boost from the State Government in 2020, will help deliver an “important energy project” for Queensland.
“Our support for CopperString is an investment in the future of Queensland that will bring power prices down, create 750 direct construction jobs and unlock the significant economic potential of the north west minerals province,” he said.
“Access to affordable and reliable energy supply will help drive new investment and new opportunities, providing a long-term future for families, businesses and local communities from Townsville to Mount Isa.”
The announcement was welcomed by community group Solar Citizens, with energy strategist Stephanie Gray saying the project will mean cheap solar and wind energy can power new industry in Queensland’s north.
Gray did however take the chance to criticise the Federal Government’s energy credentials, saying the Prime Minister is “misleading Queenslanders on the potential for new coal generation” with talk of a new coal plant in Collinsville, south of Townsville.
“It’s wonderful to see the Morrison Government investing in key infrastructure that will allow more solar and wind projects to come online and provide cheaper energy to Queensland’s industry,” she said.
“But while the government is backing cheap renewable energy for industry, the Prime Minister is still talking about a new coal generator that just doesn’t stack up.
“There’s a reason that no new coal-fired power stations have been built in Australia in the last 10 years. Solar and wind are the cheapest source of new electricity and that’s where investors are putting their money.”
Sydney-based Vast Solar is among those who have identified Queensland’s north west for investment with plans to develop a $600 million hybrid power plant in Mount Isa.
The project will combine solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with a 50 MW solar thermal facility.
Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said by extending the NEM from Townsville across the north to Mount Isa, CopperString will underpin thousands of mining and industrial manufacturing jobs and stimulate large-scale renewable energy investment.
“Connecting North Queensland with the National Electricity Market will help deliver lower cost, reliable power to our important job-creating and export-oriented regional industries and increase opportunities for the many other energy projects along the corridor,” he said.
CopperString will help the Queensland Government build out its Northern Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
Unveiled last year as part of a $145 million plan to establish three REZs across the state, the Northern REZ has significant potential for long-term renewable energy development with some of the strongest wind and solar resources in the state and country.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/21/act-includes-250-mw-big-battery-in-307m-budget-announcement/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 21, 2021",ACT includes 250 MW big battery in $307m budget announcement,"The ACT Government announced on Thursday that $100 million will be spent in the next five financial years to deliver one of the biggest renewable battery storage systems in Australia.
With the Big Canberra Battery set to provide at least 250 MW of battery storage it will far exceed the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia. Also known as the Tesla Big Battery, the world’s largest lithium-ion battery underwent a 50% expansion in 2020 to take its capacity to 150 MW.
While the budget announcement did not include specific details about the ACT battery storage system, the proposed network is already off to a decent start with French renewables giant Neoen, which operates the Hornsdale facility, having recently signed a 14-year contract with the ACT Government which includes the construction of a 50 MW (at least) energy storage facility in Canberra.
Global Power Generation (GPG) has also signed a contract with the ACT Government to deliver at least 10 MW of battery storage as part of a deal to supply the territory with wind farm-generated energy.
The Big Canberra Battery project is just one of a suite of initiatives included in the $307 million five-year package announced on Thursday ahead of the upcoming ACT budget.
Interest-free loans for household solar modules and battery storage, registration fees waived for electric vehicles and $50 million to improve building efficiency and sustainability were among the initiatives unveiled by the ACT government as part of a raft of climate change initiatives.
The largest of the measures is a $150 million Sustainable Household Scheme fund which will provide loans of up to $15,000 for households to meet upfront costs of rooftop solar modules, household battery storage, efficient electric appliances or zero-emission vehicles.
Registration fees will also be waived on zero-emission vehicles from May 2021 for the first two years of registration.
ACT’s Energy and Emissions Reductions Minister Shane Rattenbury said the initiatives will build on the ACT’s achievement of 100% renewable electricity and are the next steps to ensuring the territory meets its target of net-zero emissions by 2045.
“This budget commits major new investment to help Canberrans live more comfortably and sustainably, tacking the biggest pieces in our emissions puzzle with a focus on phasing out fossil-fuel gas and transforming ACT transport to be zero emissions,” he said.
“We’re aiming for an EV revolution over the next decade, with the ACT leading the transition to zero emissions transport. Free registration and no-interest loans for zero emissions vehicles, along with a new network of 50 public charging stations for electric vehicles will make EV’s a real option for Canberrans who may have been hesitant until now.”
A further $50 million has been allocated to improve building efficiency and sustainability for social and public housing, along with low-income owner-occupiers and low-performing rental properties.
Another $5 million has been set aside to support community clubs to undertake energy efficiency upgrades such as rooftop solar.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/21/green-ammonia-breakthrough-a-potential-boon-for-solar-powered-exports/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 21, 2021",Green ammonia breakthrough a potential boon for solar-powered exports,"Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the University of Sydney (USYD) have put their big heads together and managed to produce ‘green’ ammonia from air, water, and solar energy in a fashion that does not also require high temperatures, high pressure and enormous amounts of infrastructure. The researchers believe the new production method, which has so far only been demonstrated in a lab, could play a role in the global transition to a hydrogen economy. 
Ammonia, a hydrogen product, is currently used mainly in the fertiliser industry but could play a pivotal role in the evolving hydrogen economy, particularly as a shipping fuel in its liquefied form. This, says Rystad Energy’s Head of Global Energy Systems, Marius Foss, is for the simple reason that ammonia can be safely liquefied at only 33 degrees Celsius – making it much easier and more efficient to store and transport than H2. 
However, the traditional way to make ammonia, the Haber-Bosch process, is only cost-effective at enormous scale, expense and emissions. As UNSW’s School of Chemical Engineering and co-author of the research published in Energy and Environmental Science, Dr Emma Lovell, says: “The current way we make ammonia via the Haber-Bosch method produces more CO2 than any other chemical-making reaction. In fact, making ammonia consumes about 2 percent of the world’s energy and makes 1 percent of its CO2 – which is a huge amount if you think of all the industrial processes that occur around the globe.”
Lovell added that the carbon footprint of the Haber-Bosch process is amplified because such a large-scale project requires a centralised location which necessarily entails a great deal of global transportation. Moreover, as was shown with the catastrophic ammonium nitrate explosion at a warehouse in Beirut last year, storing large amounts of ammonia in one place is very dangerous.  
Wanting to avert further events like that tragically seen in Lebanon, Lovell and her team have found a way to produce ammonia cheaply, locally, and greenly. Indeed, Lovell believes that once the technology is available commercially that farmers would be able to produce their own green ammonia to make fertiliser on site. 
“So if we can make it locally to use locally, and make it as we need it,” said Lovell, “then there’s a huge benefit to society as well as the health of the planet.”
The fourth state matters 
The key to this breakthrough is found in the fourth state of matter – plasma. According to ARC DECRA Fellow and co-author Dr Ali Jalili, converting atmospheric nitrogen (N2) directly to ammonia using electricity “has posed a significant challenge to researchers for the last decade, due to the inherent stability of N2 that makes it difficult to dissolve and dissociate.”
However, by using plasma (a form of lightning in a tube) Jalili and his colleagues were able to convert air into an intermediary called NOx (either NO2 or NO3) which is more reactive than N2 in the air. 
“Once we generated that intermediary in water,” said Jalili, “designing a selective catalyst and scaling the system became significantly easier. The breakthrough of our technology was in the design of the high-performance plasma reactors coupled with electrochemistry.”
Solar-powered storage solution 
Thus, not only has this team of researchers made a breakthrough in the ammonia industry, which could, among other things, nullify the possibility of a disaster like that witnessed in Beirut happening again, but they may have also solved the problem of storing and transporting hydrogen. 
UNSW’s and ARC Training Centre for Global Hydrogen Economy‘s Scientia Professor Rose Amal, said that though hydrogen is exceptionally light, it therefore requires an exceptional amount of space for storage, “otherwise you have to compress or liquify it.” 
“But liquid ammonia actually stores more hydrogen than liquid hydrogen itself,” continued Amal, “and so there has been increasing interest in the use of ammonia as a potential energy vector for a carbon-free economy.”This is all to say that allied with this technological breakthrough, ammonia could be made from solar energy and be essentially ready for export.
“We can use electrons from solar farms to make ammonia and then export our sunshine as ammonia rather than hydrogen,” concluded Amal. “And when it gets to countries like Japan and Germany, they can either split the ammonia and convert it back into hydrogen and nitrogen, or they can use it as a fuel.”

It’s a deep question, or at least, schooner-deep. But when it comes to Melbourne brewer Moon Dog Brewing, the liquid gold is crafted using sunlight itself. The Brewer recently saw a 99.85 kW rooftop mounted solar system installed alongside a Fimer’s PVS-100 inverter atop the brewery.
Unfortunately for everyone, the amber nectar doesn’t make itself. Heroes are required, and these independent brewers answered the call when they decided to open Moon Dog World, a new brew pub or “adult theme-park”, in October 2019.
Conscious of wanting to reduce their emissions, Moon Dog asked Energis to design and install a solar system that would reduce their reliance on energy from the grid and cut their electricity bill. Energis then went ahead and installed a 317-panel array along with a single PSV-100 inverter.

According to the Director of Energis, Raman Chhabra, the PSV-100 was chosen because it was “especially suited for the string sizing and other site-specific requirements of this project.”

Moreover, Moon Dog Co-Founder, Karl Van Buuren, said Fimer’s Aurora Vision monitoring solution allowed him and the rest of the team to monitor their entire solar array remotely. “Our site, like many other food and beverage sites, is power-hungry, we have boilers, chill units and big packaging lines…We can see what time of day we are…generating the most solar energy, plus see reporting on how much we are producing and consuming on a month to month basis.”
According to this monitoring, Moon Dog Brewing has generated over 110 MWh of solar energy since its installation. Now, this is something to yell home about whether you’ve on the yellow yelling stuff or not. And so, inspired by their solar system, Moon Dog released a limited-edition beer in 2020 called “the future is bright”, a. message we can all cheers to now that we have finally been able to discard of 2020 like a stubby in the street.
The solar-powered beer is an IPA, a robust beer in taste and colour that perfectly represents the sunlight used to make it. Frothie-lovelies don’t come much lovelier than this.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/21/green-finance-innovation-caters-for-virtual-storage-market/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 21, 2021",Green finance innovation caters for ‘Virtual Storage’ market,"In what Renewable Energy Hub is calling a ‘Virtual Storage’ first, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) funded clean energy marketplace middle-man has announced its first virtual storage hedge contract, a deal done between Hydro Tasmania and the buyers, Macquarie Group and ERM Power. 
The contract is demonstrative of how green finance is developing new and innovative instruments for the energy marketplace. The idea is to allow participants to agree on a set charge and discharge price for stored pumped hydro energy spread across agreed time. 
The deal, which will take place in FY2022, sees Hydro Tasmania selling the rights to the highest priced periods ‘discharge’ and buying a fixed MW block of low-priced energy ‘charge’. 
Hydro Tasmania Executive General Manager of Commercial, Caroline Wykamp, said innovative partnerships like this presented a great opportunity to support the NEM transition.
Chris Halliwell, Co-Founder and Head of Markets at Renewable Energy Hub, said this contractural capability will help firm up renewables and support retailers to hedge spot market prices.“As the energy market changes,” said Halliwell, “the financial markets are changing with it. The Virtual Storage contract enables merchant storage operators to de-risk their energy arbitrage revenue, to move beyond complete exposure to spot prices and hedge their risk and capture more attractive revenue options in the forward market.”
Of course, Hydro Tasmania is extremely confident in its storage, so much so that it is strongly pushing its ambitious Battery of the Nation initiative as the Island State seeks to provide firming capacity across the NEM. 
Toward this end, Wykamp said the Virtual Storage hedge contract represents just how seriously the financial market is taking Hydro Tasmania’s stored-up clout. Moreover, Wykamp believes “that further liquidity in such trades can support investment needed to develop pumped hydro and other storage technologies that will ultimately support Australia’s renewable energy future – it’s a win-win”.
As financial risk has been taken out of the energy transition it has been revealed to be the major weight which had kept it back. 
David Guiver of ERM Power, one of the buyers, said the Virtual Storage product allows ERM (now a Shell company) “to help our customers manage the risk around an increasingly intermittent market. It supports integration of renewables into the NEM and demonstrates our commitment to decarbonising the Australian power sector.”
Charged market 
A recent report from Wood Mackenzie predicted a 30% drop in front-of-the-meter battery costs in the Asia Pacific region. Tie that in with Cornwall Insight Australia’s (CIAs) estimate that Australia’s current battery energy storage pipeline sits at around 7 GW, and we realise that the energy storage market long predicted has come upon us rather suddenly. 
In fact, CIA’s quite startling estimate has shown to be almost conservative in light of the first fortnight of 2021. Along with a slew of project announcements to round out 2020, the first weeks of 2020 have seen the release of charged announcements including Origin Energy’s plans for a 700 MW megabattey in NSW’s Hunter region as well as Neoen’s 500 MW battery planned west of Sydney. Not to forget Australia’s largest power producer, AGL, which remains on track to add at least 850 MW of new large-scale battery storage to its portfolio by 2024.
Add in the fact that the Battery of the Nation initiative has strong federal support, and the stored energy market has well and truly arrived. Hence why Renewable Energy Hub is instituting its Virtual Storage contract to encourage increased liquidity across the rapidly growing market.
