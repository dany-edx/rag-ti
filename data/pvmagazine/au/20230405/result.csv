Nonetheless, major retailers like Origin and AGL have stunningly claimed to have 450 MW and 200 MW worth of power ‘under orchestration’ respectively.
In fact, Origin reported in early 2022 it had over 100,000 connected services in its ‘Loop’ VPP program. This clearly can’t be all batteries since the cumulative national tally for home batteries stood at 140,000 at that time, SunWiz managing director Warwick Johnston told pv magazine Australia.
VPPs aggregate the latent potential of distributed energy resources like home batteries, combining their capacity to be able to meaningfully trade on energy spot markets, opening up new revenue streams, but also potentially providing grid support by balancing supply and demand. Given this, VPPs assets are generally taken to be flexible in their capacity to use power (for instance, a battery charging when electricity supply is high) as well as being able to flexibly supply power to the grid during shortages.

Earlier this year, Plico, the retail arm of Perth-based renewable energy company Starling Energy Group, was notified by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide additional capacity to Western Australia’s main grid via its VPP fleet.
Plico said more than half of its VPP’s power storage capacity was dispatched between 5pm and 7pm on January 30 to support the grid, which was threatened by soaring demand due to a local heatwave. This is an example of a VPP delivering on its promise, with WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston having described VPPs as “the future for electricity in WA.”
The disparity between retailers claimed participation and the number of batteries in Australia, however, would suggest they aren’t concerned with the actual definitions of VPPs. SunWiz’s Warwick Johnston suspects Origin and AGL are including commercial and industrial loads and residential deferrable loads as part of their VPP fleets. While, of course, flexible loads play into managing supply-and-demand, such assets offer limited support to an undersupplied, unsteady grid.*

As Johnston points out, the total size of Australia’s storage market is difficult to calculate, and the VPP market even harder still. SunWiz’s investigation into the VPP market size drew on interviews with manufacturers, VPP operators, AEMO, and combined it with other data-driven market research, Johnston said. 
“The task is made more difficult by varying definitions of what a VPP is,” he said. “Some batteries are remotely controlled for an individual’s benefit, but not necessarily orchestrated with other batteries.”
As Johnston notes, electricity retailers have some ambitious targets for VPPs, “which they appear to be relying upon to replace their coal generators when they close.” If they are including mostly demand loads incapable of supplying electricity to the network under the VPP banner though, it could prove problematic.
Moreover, given the VPP adoption rate among battery owners appears to be just 14%, such hopes might be dashed. “It seems early adopters of energy storage systems aren’t willing to hand back to retailers their expensively-purchased independence,” Johnston said.

Electricity supply allocations became a source of drama in the state after a rule was introduced in February 2022 mandating circuit breakers be installed on all new properties and following any major electrical work – including installing a solar system.
For regional properties, that circuit break would trip with any draw of over 32 amps (an induction cooktop alone draws at least 20 amps). This caused major disruptions to regional residents and local solar businesses, who sustained pressure on both Western Power and the state government to find a more equitable solution.

Western Power indicated it would move its regional customers to a 63 amp allocation last October, but said it must first undertake a trial. The 24-week trial spanned seven regional areas and sampled a diverse range of rural customers with different energy needs, the government said.
“Data from 140,000 single-phase meters across the network was analysed to understand load demand and network usage in metro and rural areas, which proved that existing electrical infrastructure could accommodate increased rural load requirements.”
The state’s switch breaker mandate will remain in place, with the government noting: “Homeowners are responsible for managing their electrical load and should seek electrical contractor advice when adding or replacing larger appliances or equipment.”
Given this, it seems likely as households electrify appliances and purchase electric vehicles that supply allocation will again become a sore spot for Western Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/05/brookfield-partners-with-victorian-developer-as-it-prepares-to-replace-origins-fossil-fleet/,"MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 5, 2023",Brookfield partners with Victorian developer as it prepares to replace Origin’s fossil fleet,"Brookfield Renewable, one of the many arms of the giant Brookfield fund, has formed a “strategic partnership” with a Victorian-based developed Greenleaf Renewables. Founded in 2021, the developer is working on three wind farms in Queensland, but reportedly has another 600 MW of unannounced projects in its pipeline.
Brookfield and Greenleaf plan to jointly develop projects along Australia’s east coast, with a focus on wind and energy storage projects, the pair said. The first will be the 400 MW Moonlight Range Wind Farm in Queensland, which Greenleaf has previously been working on.
Together, the pair will develop, build, own and operate the proposed project in central Queensland, with construction slated for 2025, subject to approvals. Moonlight Range Wind Farm will also include storage, though no further details were given on that front.
“The Moonlight Range Wind Farm will be the first of many renewable power projects for Brookfield in Australia as we expand our presence in this market,” Brookfield’s Managing Director and Head of Renewable Power and Transition in Australia, Luke Edwards, said.
Brookfield has made rather a big splash in Australia in the last year – grabbing major attention in 2022 when it teamed up with Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes to put in a shock bid for Australia’s biggest ‘gentailer’ AGL. This play was ultimately unsuccessful, but in the 12 months since the company shifted its sights to the next player on Australia’s ‘gentailer’ ladder, Origin Energy, for which it put began the formal acquisition process in March. 
On top of the $18.7 billion (USD 12.5 billion) buyout bid, Brookfield has said it plans to spend “at least” $20 billion to build new renewables and storage in Australia over the next decade, equating to roughly 14 GW of capacity – or about one-fifth of the what the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) estimates will be needed by 2030 to reach national targets. 
“Approximately 8 GW of coal fired power generation capacity is expected to come offline by 2030 – this generation needs to be replaced with new sources of clean energy,” Edwards said. Taking ownership of Origin will mean Brookfield has a direct stake in replacing this lost coal generation.
To date, Brookfield Renewable says it has installed more than 25 GW of renewable projects across the world and boasts a global pipeline of approximately 110 GW.
Greenleaf is a far smaller outfit, listing two projects on its website alongside Moonlight Range Wind Farm. Those are the 166 MW Stony Creek Wind Farm and an unnamed project simply listed as ‘Queensland Project 3’ with up to 300 MW of capacity. Both projects are located in southeast Queensland.
Next to Origin, in the last 18 months Brookfield has also acquired Victorian electricity transmission network AusNet Services as well as Spanish developer X-Elio, which has over 500 MW of projects in development in Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/05/global-heat-pump-sales-rose-by-11-in-2022-says-iea/,"MARKETS,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"APRIL 5, 2023","Global heat pump sales rose by 11% in 2022, says IEA","From pv magazine Global
Global sales of heat pumps rose by 11% year on year in 2022, according to a new study by the IEA. Heat pumps cover around 10% of heating needs in buildings today, when they are used as a main heating device, said the agency.
“This corresponds to over 100 million households, meaning that one in ten homes that require substantial heating are served by heat pumps today,” the IEA said. “However, many more households use heat pumps only part of the winter or as a supplementary source of heating in regions where they are mainly used for cooling buildings.”
Across Europe, heat pump sales grew by 49% year on year in 2022. Nearly 3 million heat pumps were sold last year, with air-to-water devices proving more popular in Germany and Poland, and air-to-air units emerging as the technology of choice in the Nordics and the Baltic countries, as well as in Southern Europe. Italy, France, and Germany accounted for almost half of all sales in Europe, while the markets in Poland and Czechia doubled in size in 2022, according to the IEA.
Hybrid systems, which combine heat pumps and gas boilers, were reportedly a popular choice in Italy, as they accounted for more than 40% of sales in the air-to-water segment in 2022. While ground-source and water-source heat pumps are the most efficient technologies, they are also the most expensive and account for less than 10% of European sales, according to the IEA.
Heat pumps outsold fossil fuel boilers in French buildings for the first time in 2022, at a time when France introduced a national ban on gas boilers in new buildings. In the United States, heat pumps overtook gas furnace sales in 2022, after years of almost equal growth.
“Installations of heat pumps remain concentrated in new buildings and existing single-family homes,” the IEA said. “Apartment buildings and commercial spaces will need to be a priority area if solid growth is to continue.”
China manufactures around 40% of the world’s heat pumps, according to the IEA. The country is the largest producer and exporter of the technology, with most of its exports going to Europe.
The agency noted that continued growth in heat pump deployment will require secure and resilient supply chains. The five largest global manufacturers reportedly have their headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region. Supply chains for chips are particularly stretched thin at present, said the IEA.
The agency added that large-scale industrial heat pumps and district heating have a critical role to play in the decarbonization of heat. It noted that additional market statistics will be crucial to expanding deployment.
