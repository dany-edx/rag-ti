In a communique issued following their meeting in Alice Springs on Friday, Australia’s energy ministers said the “time was right” to transition to a new operating model for the ESB with the Energy Advisory Panel (EAP) to advise on security, reliability and affordability of Australia’s east coast energy system.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the ESB, which was launched in 2017, was designed for a particular time and “a new government with a new agenda has new needs.”
“The concept of an Energy Security Board which would receive regular referrals for policy work is no longer one that is fit for purpose and one that ministers unanimously agreed to move on from,” Bowen said.
The EAP will include the chief executives of the three energy market bodies – the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), Australian Energy Regulator (AER), and the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) – and the energy commissioner of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as an observer. The new arrangements will take effect from 1 July 2023.
The Smart Energy Council (SEC) described the decision to abolish the ESB as a smart choice, saying the body has “long stifled the progress of renewable energy in Australia.”
“Again and again in recent times, the Energy Security Board has put up proposals that have been rejected by energy ministers because they would delay the uptake of renewables,” it said. “Ministers and government departments will now rightly be responsible for energy policy development.”
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) also welcomed the decision but warned there can be no delays with the rollout of renewable energy projects if federal government is to meet its target of 82% renewables by 2030.
“Any new advisory body must focus on reducing complexity and increasing collaboration because we have no time to waste,” the CEC said in a statement.
The energy ministers acknowledged that during their meeting, agreeing to increase resourcing to the AEMO to get more clean energy connected to the grid, more quickly.
Bowen said the decision will see a rise in AEMO’s resources of about $3 million (USD 2 million) to ensure that renewable dispatchable investments are connected to the grid as soon as possible.
“There’s a lot of investment into our grid, a lot of good work occurring in renewable transmission, but some of it is encountering delays in being connected to the grid, receiving approvals to connect to the grid,” Bowen said.
“So we’ve agreed to increase resources jointly between the Commonwealth and the states for AEMO now to get that work done more quickly, particularly overcoming months to ensure we have maximum capacity in the lead‑up to next summer.”
Bowen said the ministers also agreed to work together on removing any obstacles to any of the new transmission or generation coming online in the next couple of months.

Delivered by Horizon in conjunction with the Department of Education, the system comprises 499 solar panels spread across five roofs at the school coupled with 12 inverters. It is expected the power plant will save the school approximately $350,000 in electricity costs in the first year.
Education Minister Dr Tony Buti said the system, which is backed by a solar web tool that allows for real-time monitoring, will also allow staff and students to engage with the technology and link it to their learning in the classroom.
“The solar panels at Broome Senior High School – the largest solar panel installation at a regional school under the Solar Schools Program – will reduce the school’s carbon emissions and energy costs,” Buti said. “It will also provide further teaching and learning opportunities for students and staff in STEM areas which is exciting.”

The Broome Senior High School rooftop PV system is one of six solar systems installed at schools in Broome as part of the Solar Schools program and is part of a long-term investment by Horizon in the remote town that includes the introduction of two community batteries to maximise energy supply and distribution in the Kimberley township.
The energy storage solution means excess energy generated by rooftop solar can be absorbed by the batteries, which simultaneously smooth the flow of energy back into the network. This will ensure reliability of power supply and allow for a greater uptake of rooftop solar.
The Broome Senior High School rooftop system has been delivered as part of stage two of the state government’s Solar Schools initiative which is delivering PV systems to 65 remote and regional schools across two stages.
The first stage of the program was launched in 2020 with $5 million invested to rollout rooftop solar systems at 30 schools across the Kimberley, Pilbara, Gascoyne Mid West and Goldfields Esperance regions.
Stage two of the program has seen the state government earmark $4.6 million out of the $45 million School’s Clean Energy Technology Fund to install rooftop solar systems at 28 schools in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions. Solar systems will also be installed at an additional seven schools which are being funded the Solar Clean Energy Technology Fund.
Horizon said there are 20 systems remaining to be delivered in stage two with the last installation expected to be completed by September 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/22/community-batteries-are-popular-but-we-have-to-make-sure-they-actually-help-share-power/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 22, 2023",Community batteries are popular – but we have to make sure they actually help share power,"There’s another size too: community-scale or neighbourhood batteries, which are growing rapidly in Australia due to support from state governments like Victoria and Western Australia and, more recently, from the federal government. They seem to solve a lot of problems we know people are concerned about – such as enabling more rooftop solar and helping to speed up a transition to renewables.
But the popularity of these batteries shouldn’t be the only factor in decisions about where they are rolled out. Sometimes – and in some parts of the grid – they make sense. At other times, they may not be the best solution.
Our research explores when community batteries are – and are not – useful. In short, we find the main use of these batteries is to make the grid able to handle more solar and electric vehicles. But they’re not the only option. This is why we have produced a decision-making tool for policymakers to figure out where and when these batteries are worthwhile.

Think of a community battery as like a neighbourhood asset – battery packs similar in size to a 4WD that can store locally produced solar or help serve local electric vehicle charging.
The idea is for these batteries to reduce carbon emissions and energy bills while benefiting all energy users nearby, rather than only those with access to rooftop solar. These are great ambitions – small wonder they’ve proven a hit.
But the success of these batteries is far from certain.
Over the last four years, our research has found two areas we have to fix to maximise the chances these batteries actually do what we want them to do.
First, we need greater clarity on how we decide whether community batteries are a good investment.
Second, we need better measurement and evaluation of what these batteries actually contribute to the grid and to energy users.
Why does it matter? Making sure neighbourhood batteries deliver what they promise is particularly important because they have generated so much public interest and excitement.
If they don’t work, they could undermine public support for collective solutions – the type of solutions we know are more efficient and equitable than households going it alone.

Batteries will play a crucial role in getting us towards our goal of 82% renewables by 2030. One way they can do this is by storing energy from solar and wind for later use.
Surprisingly, this doesn’t necessarily mean emissions will go down. Recent research has shown that if batteries are run to maximise profits, they could actually increase emissions by charging from coal power. By contrast, if they are run to maximise the use of solar and wind, they could contribute to lowering emissions.
What batteries do better than any other technology, however, is to provide (or soak up) power at extremely short notice to tide the grid through sudden shocks, such as the storm knocking over a transmission line or a coal-fired power station exploding.
But batteries can do this from anywhere on the grid. So the real question is: why put batteries into our suburbs and small towns at all?
In a new discussion paper, this article’s lead author argues the primary purpose of community batteries ought to be addressing constraint in the local electricity grid. This reiterates a consistent finding from our research.
While this sounds reasonable, community batteries aren’t the only option to fix local grid issues. That means we should only turn to them where they are clearly better than the alternatives, such as upgrading transformers.
What about storing solar and shoring up the grid? These tasks may be done more efficiently and with less environmental impact with grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro or electric vehicle batteries.
And what about sharing the benefits of solar with people who can’t afford an array or who have nowhere to put one? While this vision is in line with public sentiment, the complexity of the privatised energy system makes it very difficult to redistribute financial benefits.
Community batteries are also no panacea for the desire of people to see and be included in national planning for the decarbonisation transition. An inclusive planning process can address uncertainties in how the transition will affect us and our communities and ensure it upholds public values.
Time will tell if the newly announced Net Zero Authority will deliver this.

So does this mean we should avoid community batteries altogether? No – but it does mean we should carefully track and evaluate these projects to see where they work best.
To help with this, several of this article’s authors developed a framework to figure out what impact these batteries have on the clean energy transition, how to do it with social acceptance and good oversight, and to do so in a way which is economically beneficial.
Community batteries are not a silver bullet, but they do have promise. Used wisely, they could help accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels while reducing network costs.
To make the most of them, we need to understand how and where these batteries will best serve the work of building a just, reliable and sustainable energy system.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/22/nsw-targets-1-5-gw-of-renewables-and-storage-in-latest-tender-round/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 22, 2023",NSW targets 1.5 GW of renewables and storage in latest tender round,"New South Wales (NSW) has officially opened the third in what’s to be a decade of rolling tenders as the state continues to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap which aims to deliver at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation and 2 GW of long-duration storage by 2030 to help replace the state’s ageing coal-fired power stations.
AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as NSW Consumer Trustee, said the latest tender is seeking an indicative amount of 2,500 GWh (about 950 MW) of generation and 550 MW of long-duration (at least eight hours) storage, but more can be awarded if it is in the long-term financial interest of NSW consumers.
The tender is open to all projects across the state that can connect to existing grid infrastructure, irrespective of their location within the renewable energy zones.
AEMO Services Chair Paul Moy said the tender will look to build on the success of the inaugural tender round, which concluded at the start of May.
That tender delivered renewable energy projects worth $2.5 billion of investment, including two solar farms, a wind farm and a long-duration battery that will contribute 1.4 GW of renewable energy generation in NSW. The three generation projects selected for the first tender round exceeded AEMO Services’ indicative target by more than 400 MW.
Moy said the first tranche of renewable energy projects, drawn from a shortlist of 16 projects representing more than 4.3 GW of large-scale generation and long-duration storage, would serve as a running start for the coming instalment.
“We spent more than 12 months in the lead-up to our first tender working closely with investors and proponents to streamline the process and design new products to incentivise the acceleration of their energy infrastructure projects,” he said.
“We’ll continue to build on that work and fine-tune our offering to make sure subsequent tenders enjoy the same success.”

Moy said the strong pool of projects which had been shortlisted on non-price criteria in the first tender but not yet demonstrated the same financial value to electricity consumers, would provide a solid base for the next tranche of bids with unsuccessful proponents from the inaugural tender encouraged to submit bids.
“We designed our tenders specifically to allow unsuccessful proponents to submit subsequent bids at minimal additional cost to them,” he said. “This provides benefits to both consumers and bidders and is a key features of our rolling 10-year competitive tender schedule.”
“The first tender also demonstrates the depth of the pipeline of projects that are well placed to re-submit high quality bids in this tender. We anticipate that many of these projects will be able to improve their bids and be successful.”
AEMO Services Acting Executive General Manager Graeme Edie said the two-stage process for this tender round will be similar to that employed in the inaugural round.
“The first stage will be an assessment against non-price criteria, such as community benefit and local employment,” he said. “The second stage is a financial value assessment for shortlisted projects, which determines the projects that best deliver in the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers.”
Edie said successful projects will be awarded long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) that provide a floor price for output, allowing for greater investment certainty for developers.
The first tender round delivered strike prices about 40% below the levelized cost of electricity which Edie said “demonstrates the market understands the advantages and value of the LTESA contract.”
“AEMO Services has designed and consulted on these innovative option contracts, and feedback received from the market is that they are highly sought-after,” he said. “We expect robust competition for them in this tender round, increasing over time as the tender plan progresses.”
This tender round is the second for generation and long-duration storage and the third in AEMO Services’ tender schedule. The state is also seeking offers for a minimum of 380 MW of shorter duration ‘firming capacity’ (at least two hours of storage) to supplement resources in major load areas ahead of the impending closure of the Eraring coal plant in late 2025.

The pair signed the Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact during a bilateral meeting held on the sidelines of the annual Group of Seven Summit in Japan at the weekend.
In a joint statement, the two leaders said “Australia and the U.S. will deliver sustainable, resilient and secure critical minerals and clean energy technology to the world.”
“We intend to identify areas where Australia and the U.S. can coordinate the development of our respective clean energy industrial bases, including but not limited to solar, wind, storage, and clean hydrogen materials and technologies.”
Speaking in Hiroshima, Albanese said the joint initiative was the “largest action by any country” to deal with climate change and to direct investment into the clean energy transformation.
“And if we think about industries like hydrogen, without that support, there would be a massive incentive for hydrogen-based industries to be based in the U.S.,” he said.
Albanese said the agreement will open up new opportunities for Australian manufacturers and suppliers and help address concerns that the impressive subsidies offered by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will disadvantage Australian companies.
“So the big risk with the Inflation Reduction Act … is that you would see capital leave Australia to go to the United States. This is about addressing that. This is about creating an enormous opportunity for Australia,” he said.
While there is little detail about how the initiative will work in practice, the joint statement said the framework intends to “coordinate policies and investments to support the expansion and diversification of responsible clean energy and critical minerals supply chains, accelerate the development of markets for established and emerging technologies, and to meet the growing energy and adaptation needs of the Indo-Pacific.”
A climate change action plan is to be developed by the end of the year and new ministerial-level dialogue will be established between Australia and the U.S. to encourage stronger industrial collaboration and accelerate progress towards net zero emissions.
Biden hailed the agreement as a “huge step forward” in the fight against the climate crisis, saying climate and clean energy has become the “third pillar” of the Australia-US alliance, alongside defence and economic co-operation.
“This contract can enable the expansion and diversification of clean energy supply chains, especially as it relates to critical materials,” he said.

Researchers at the National University of Singapore have developed an optimisation model for PV-powered green hydrogen facilities that can evaluate different options for each technology.
The scientists said in “Green hydrogen from solar power for decarbonisation: What will it cost?,” which was recently published in Energy Conversion Management, that their model incorporates solar irradiance, physical hydrogen storage, land footprint, power grid carbon intensity, and various factors including project type, size, capital and operating costs, efficiencies, and lifespans. They also said that in the current technology landscape, an LCOH of less than USD 10/kg ($15/kg) will be needed to make green hydrogen compete with grey, blue, and orange hydrogen.
“The model accounts for the impact of intra-day and inter-day variations in renewable electricity generation by considering the solar irradiance data at a fine granularity,” they said, noting that it also allows for an import from and export to the local electrical grid. “The model enables an option to install batteries for storing and utilising renewable electrons. Similarly, it also considers the storage of hydrogen molecules to manage hydrogen demand.”
The model considers a green hydrogen facility with a PV plant, electrolyser, battery storage, buffer tanks, and a pumping station for hydrogen supply, and incorporates the facility’s ability to trade power with the grid as necessary.
“The main challenge in designing this facility is to use the transient and uncertain solar irradiance optimally to satisfy hydrogen demand at the least expense,” the scientists emphasised. “The model is employed to obtain the optimal facility design that yields cheapest green hydrogen under different geographical and techno-economic conditions.”
The model works based on four different scenarios: a fully grid-disconnected plant or Islanded Facility (ILF) which generates exclusively green hydrogen; a plant that can buy electricity from the grid with no option for selling it back or Facility with Grid Import (FGI); a facility that can sell electricity to the grid with no option of buying it or Facility with Grid Export (FGE); and a plant that can either import electricity from or export electricity to the local power grid or Facility with Grid Import and Export (FGIE).
For the first plant, the research team found that its LCOH might be USD 10.68/kg in Saudi Arabia, USD 12.0/kg in Australia, USD 13.86/kg in Singapore, and USD 42.12/kg in Germany, with the difference between these three countries being attributable mainly to the solar radiation levels and the costs being estimated by assuming the cost of water to be zero. “The stronger the solar irradiance, the lower the LCOH and smaller the solar PV farm,” the academics said.
For Singapore only, the researchers also identified the LCOH of the other project typologies and found it is USD 11.78/kg, USD 12.55/kg, and USD 10.44/kg for the FGI, FGE, and FGIE projects, respectively.
“Clearly, grid connectivity in any configuration lowers LCOH compared to ILF,” they explained. ” Clearly, grid connectivity in any configuration lowers LCOH compared to ILF the he focus should be on advances in solar PV, storage, and battery technologies.”
According to their analysis, an LCOH of USD 3.29/kg to 4.15/kg could be through a 60% reduction in solar PV Capex, a 20% increase in electrolyser performance, a 75% reduction in battery Capex, and a discount factor of 0.01%. “Indeed, green hydrogen seems like a potential yet costly silver bullet for deep decarbonisation at this time,” they concluded.

Scientists from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China have simulated a solar cell based on an absorber using a perovskite material known as CsSnI3, which is an inorganic perovskite that has low exciton binding energy, a high absorbance coefficient, and an energy bandgap of 1.3 eV.
“The cell we designed is suitable for commercial production, however, this requires intensive experimental work,” researcher Azhar Ali Haidry told pv magazine.
The researchers used the SCAPS-1D solar cell capacitance software, which is a simulation tool for thin-film solar cells developed by the University of Ghent in Belgium, to simulate several cell designs with different electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs).
Through a series of simulations, the Chinese team found that the best possible cell configuration was provided by a device based on a substrate made of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a titanium oxide (TiO2) ETL, the CsSnI3 absorber, an HTL based on nickel(II) oxide (NiOx), and back electrodes.
“The perovskite CsSnI3 thickness of 1,250 nm is found optimum for obtaining the highest performance with each ETL and HTL thickness of about 50 nm,” the academics said. “The absorber layer with around 1200−1300 nm thickness, TiO2, and NiO with 50 nm thicknesses are considered favourable to obtain high PV efficiency.”
The best-performing device built with this architecture achieved an efficiency of 31.09%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.084 V, a short-circuit current of 31.17 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 88.68%. The researchers said the performance depended mainly on the absorber thickness, the perovskite material’s energy bandgap, the acceptor level density, and the cell’s central trap energy levels.
They described the cell in “Device Simulation of a Thin-Layer CsSnI3-Based Solar Cell with Enhanced 31.09% Efficiency,” which was recently published in Energy Fuels.
“The findings will provide the guideline for the fabrication of the CsSnI3-based PV device in the laboratory,” the scientists said.
