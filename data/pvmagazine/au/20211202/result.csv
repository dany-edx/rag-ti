The AEMC sparked debate earlier this year when it released its draft plan, proposing charging storage providers for drawing power, ignoring a recommendation by the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) that they should be exempted from network charges when charging or pumping.
AEMO argued it was important storage providers were not “disincentivised from connecting to the transmission network, as they generally provide a net benefit to the power system by charging at periods of low demand”.
AEMO’s request for an exemption has however been refused with the AEMC declaring energy storage participants will continue to negotiate transmission services and charges, as they currently do.
“We’re not moving the goal posts on network charges,” AEMC chair Anna Collyer said. “Energy storage participants will continue to negotiate their transmission services and charges. Our intention is for existing network agreements to remain unchanged.
“The reform maintains the existing framework to allow large grid-connected storage to choose between connecting under a negotiated agreement or the prescribed service.”
The Clean Energy Council (CEC) was among those critical of the final determination, saying it could result in energy storage providers and consumers paying twice for network charges while the added costs could impact the viability of new projects.
“Batteries and pumped hydro will now be placed at a commercial disadvantage to coal and gas generators, who do not face network charges,” said the CEC’s director of energy transformation, Christiaan Zuur. “This undermines the efforts of state and territory governments to decarbonise the power system.”

The AMEC conceded further work is needed on how network prices are set for storage and other large flexible loads, including hydrogen, to provide them with efficient operational and investment incentives to support the energy market as it transitions to more renewables.
“An important part of our final decision is that we are not suggesting that storage should automatically be paying network charges,” Collyer said. “And we agree the rules on prescribed transmission services are not designed for price responsive loads.
“However, reforms to network charges for price responsive load involve other issues we need to consider that are broader than this rule change. These issues require further stakeholder engagement and consideration of how all participants, not just storage, will play in the market.”
While disappointed that the request to exempt energy storage providers from network charges had been rejected, the CEC said the commission had made several positive changes to the original draft decision.
“We are pleased to see that the AEMC has made a few changes to help address some of the concerns raised by industry, such as trying to exclude existing storage units from facing new charges and stating that all new negotiated charges must be consistent across existing and new storage providers,” Zuur said.
“However, the devil will be in the application, and we will be observing how the network businesses apply these rules in practice.”
Included in the final rule is a new participant category, the Integrated Resource Provider (IRP), that the AEMC said will facilitate the efficient entry and operation of storage and hybrid facilities in “a flexible and technology-neutral way”.
The category accommodates a variety of participants with bi-directional energy flows that may offer and consume energy and ancillary services. This includes batteries, pumped hydro, companies that aggregate energy from small generation and storage units, or large-scale hybrid facilities that combine different technologies behind the one connection point (like factories with solar PV and a battery).
The AEMC said the proposed change will level the playing field for market participants with energy storage assets.
“This makes it simpler and easier for anyone who provides storage or a combination of energy services to enter the market,” Collyer said.
“For large batteries the rule will cut red tape, reduce costs and logistical hurdles to participate in the market. Batteries will no longer need to register twice, to both draw energy from the grid and send it out, as they currently do.”
Collyer said the package would also create opportunities for households and small business customers to earn more revenue for their home battery, because they can sign up with new aggregator businesses who will pay them for discharging power from their batteries at certain times.
The AEMC said the rule on hybrid systems would make it easier to manage electricity flows behind a connection point, allowing excess wind and solar power energy to be stored and released into the network when it’s needed.
“What this means is that the operator is not exposed to the spot market price to purchase energy from the grid and the energy being created by the solar plant is not being wasted,” Collyer said. “Some stakeholders have told us this could reduce their energy costs by around 15%.”
The majority of changes made by the final rule are due to come into effect on 3 June 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/02/ensuring-quality-in-australias-prospering-utility-scale-segment/,"INSURANCE,OPINION & ANALYSIS,QUALITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 2, 2021",Ensuring quality in Australia’s prospering utility-scale segment,"Renewable energy’s contribution to electricity production in Australia increased 10% in just five years, going from 17% in 2017 to 27% in 2020. The renewable industry has also demonstrated its capacity to keep growing at a high pace despite the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly due commitments from state and regional governments.
This positive trend will continue in 2021 and future years, as new solar PV projects will increasingly replace coal-powered stations and new solar capacity will be installed to produce green hydrogen, meaning the assurance of quality through risk mitigation will become even more imperative. 
There is a global tendency to perform on-site quality control testing instead of “In-Lab”, mainly for operating plants but also on the secondary market for acquired projects already in operation. 
Aspects such as damages incurred during PV module disassembly and transport and their corresponding costs, together with custom clearance procedures (when needed), all increase the lead time of the overall procedure, and obviously the risk.

Apart from mitigating these risks, another main advantage of on-site procedures is test accuracy and duration. On the one hand, they assure test accuracy as the test provider are ISO/IEC 17025 accredited, and on the other, test ratios (# modules/day) are continually optimised.
In specific case of Australia, utility-scale PV projects are growing in scale, leading to larger samples to test.  Proficient testing institutions must optimise their testing pace in order to keep the service cost-effective without compromising the quality of the results. 
Performing a quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) & testing program is essential for all solar PV markets worldwide. In the Australian market, it holds special relevance due to the size of the projects as hundreds of MW or even GW developments are quite common. This is due to the severe climate in most of the regions where the majority of projects are concentrated, and a relatively low investment cost.  According to BNEF (2020), Australia has one of the lowest electricity production costs for solar energy in the world, which is justified by a lower investment cost when compared to other southeastern Asian countries, according to the World Bank – IBRD – IDA.
This year, solar PV projects commissioned in 2019 are reaching the end of the Defects Liability Period (DLP). Performing a quality assurance and quality control and testing program is vital in this phase in which the contractor is responsible to repair any defect identified after plant commissioning.
Risk mitigation is one of the primary drivers behind implementing a comprehensive QAQC & Testing program at the various stages of new project development and there is no doubt that it is an investment that will yield returns. 
Ideally, QAQC programs for PV projects should start with the implementation of a Modules Supply Agreement (MSA) tailored to every specific project case and feature (module technology, environment, market situation, etc.). At this stage, the most protective clauses for the buyer should be sought while drafting technical, warranty and QAQC specifications of the MSA, which defines aspects related to IEC standards, testing Acceptance Quality Limits (AQL), Bill of Materials (BOM) and “PASS/FAIL” clauses regarding potential module performance issues, among others.
Steps that typically follow MSA completion include the approval of the module production workshops through pre-manufacturing audits, production supervision and third-party testing at an accredited PV Laboratory.
Performing a first-class QAQC program at the manufacturing stages should be coupled with post-shipment testing of PV modules upon arrival and during project construction. 
The scope of these tests may vary from project to project but testing during construction is essentially aimed at detecting possible damages to PV modules, and any corresponding liabilities are to be expeditiously clarified and executed. These services are usually carried out in the following stages of a project’s value chain:
In a country where the projects are achieving hundreds of MWs, where the climate can be quite extreme in some regions and seasons, and there are external factors impacting the revenue of an utility-scale solar projects such as Marginal Loss Factors (MLF) or obtaining the Generator Performance Standards (GPS), a complete QAQC & testing assumes a crucial importance. It empowers the developer, owner, or sponsor of the project to act directly on risk mitigation and generation of appropriate tools to act in case of failure or underperforming equipment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/02/acciona-signs-up-to-supply-solar-for-3-gw-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 2, 2021",Acciona signs up to supply solar for 3 GW green hydrogen project,"A 3 GW green hydrogen facility planned for Gladstone could be powered by solar PV after the state-owned Stanwell Corporation and Acciona Energia, a subsidiary of Spanish conglomerate Acciona, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on future energy supply for the proposed hydrogen production and export project.
Stanwell has teamed with a consortium of Australian and Japanese energy companies to develop a large-scale electrolysis plant at Aldoga, about 20 kilometres north-west of Gladstone, with the view to producing green hydrogen for export to Japan and use in local industry.
Since the CQ-H2 project was unveiled, land has been secured at Aldoga, a planning study completed, a $10.4 million feasibility study announced, and now an MoU has been signed that allows for a direct connection to be established between the hydrogen production facility and Acciona’s proposed Aldoga Solar Farm.
Originally slated as a 250 MW project, the $550 million Aldoga Solar Farm is expected to reach a capacity of 600 MWp after Acciona recently received approval from the Queensland government for a significant expansion of the project.
Acciona Energia managing director Brett Wickham said the company was excited to provide the Stanwell-led CQ-H2 consortium with “renewable energy supply to their innovative hydrogen project”.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the agreement marked a major milestone for the CQ-H2 consortium which includes Japanese companies Iwatani Corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Kansai Electric Power Company and Marubeni, and Australian energy infrastructure business APA Group.
“A direct connection would see Queensland’s largest solar project providing clean and renewable energy to Queensland’s largest renewable hydrogen project,” he said.

The proposed CQ-H2 green hydrogen project is expected to commence production in the mid-2020s with the project to scale up to more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity by the early 2030s.
The project, which has attracted financial support from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), aims to produce up to 36,500 tonnes per annum of renewable hydrogen and export to Japan from 2026, scaling up to 328,500 tonnes per annum in 2031 to meet forecast demand.
Stanwell chief executive officer Michael O’Rourke said the MoU would allow for the consortium to push ahead with its plans but said more renewable energy will be needed to deliver the project in full.
“We will leverage the direct connection to the Aldoga Solar Farm to power stage one of the proposed CQ-H2 hydrogen facility,” he said. “(But) our proposed facility will require substantially higher quantities of renewable energy to support the development of stage two.”
The Aldoga Solar Farm is due to commence construction in September 2023, with generation output scheduled to commence in December 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/02/engie-begins-construction-of-150-mw-big-battery-at-hazelwood-site/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 2, 2021",Engie begins construction of 150 MW big battery at Hazelwood site,"With energy storage set to play a key role in Australia’s transition from fossil fuels to renewables, Engie has teamed with the green investment arm of asset manager Macquarie Group to build a 150 MW/150 MWh big battery at the site of the former Hazelwood power station in Victoria’s Latrobe valley.
Engie announced on Wednesday that construction of the Hazelwood Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) has commenced and network connection agreements are already in place, with the battery scheduled to be operational by November 2022.
The project, with an estimated cost of $150 million, has been funded by Engie and Macquarie’s Green Investment Group (GIG) and will be built, operated and maintained by United States-based energy storage firm Fluence Energy, a joint venture between German electronics group Siemens and American power generator AES, under a 20-year contract.
The battery, which will connect to existing network infrastructure, is set to provide one hour of energy storage but the expectation is that the facility will be expanded in the future with the former power station site having access to 1.6 GW of dormant transmission capacity.
Engie and Macquarie said the design of the first stage of the battery, being built at the site of the former Hazelwood coal-fired generator which shuttered in 2017, and the site’s attributes provide the flexibility to “quickly and cost-effectively” scale up storage capacity to meet future network and market demand.
The companies said the Hazelwood battery will participate in the frequency control ancillary service (FCAS) markets, delivering stability to a grid increasingly comprised of renewable sources and playing a key role in accelerating the build-out of solar and wind resources.
“The Hazelwood Battery Energy Storage System … will play a critical role in increasing renewable energy capacity in Victoria, while delivering further grid stability for the state,” the companies said in a statement.
It will support the transition to green energy and help “ensure that electricity networks are resilient, reliable and flexible”, Greg Callman, the global head of energy technology at GIG, said.

The project will be the first in Australia to use Fluence’s Gridstack battery system, incorporating 342 modular Fluence Cubes, a standardised enclosure that houses battery modules as well as inverters, transformers, switchgear and other plant equipment and integrated edge controls software.
The system will be coupled with Fluence’s AI-enabled IQ Application to optimise the bidding of the Hazelwood battery capacity in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“The Hazelwood battery will be the product of Fluence’s latest generation technology, supported by our rapidly growing team in Victoria and the most widely adopted automated trading platform available in Australia today,” Fluence Australia general manager Aaron McCann said.
The project builds on Engie’s Australian portfolio which includes 1.1 GW of operating gas-fired power plants, 165 MW of operating wind farms and a 2 GW pipeline of solar, wind and large-scale batteries under development.
The Hazelwood battery is the latest utility scale batteries to be unveiled in the Latrobe Valley with AGL announcing last week it had received approval for a 200 MW/800 MWh energy storage system to be developed at the site of its coal-fired Loy Yang power station.
Earlier this year EnergyAustralia announced plans to build a four-hour 350 MW capacity big battery at the site of the Yallourn coal-fired power station which is set to be retired by mid-2028.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/02/jinko-reduced-module-prices-in-the-third-quarter/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",MAX HALL,"DECEMBER 2, 2021",Jinko reduced module prices in the third quarter,"From pv magazine Global
Chinese solar giant JinkoSolar appears to have swum against the tide on panel pricing in the last three-month window, according to its latest quarterly update.
Jinko’s peers have dealt with ever more expensive raw material polysilicon – and runaway shipping costs – by passing on the expense to customers in the form of more pricey products, citing the fact rampant demand worldwide has done little to dim enthusiasm for solar.
In the third-quarter update issued by Jinko today, in fact, chairman and CEO Xiande Li wrote: “Due to the transition to renewable energy in most regions of the world; the increase in electricity prices; financing support; and other favourable policies, clients are more willing to accept higher module prices.”
Lower down the earnings statement, however, a note added to explain why gross margin had fallen in the July-to-September period cited a “decline in the average selling price of solar modules in response to the intensified market competition globally.” Reducing prices while everyone else is raising them could help explain why Jinko doubled the extent of its slice of the Chinese module market between the second and third quarters and why it hopes to achieve more than 50% growth in annual shipments next year.
Whatever the pricing strategy, Jinko is forging ahead with production capacity expansion, perhaps not surprisingly after the company saw solar cell manufacturing costs fall more than 10% in Q3 after the more-than-7 GW of production lines it switched on in the previous window were cranked up to full capacity.
With 31 GW of annual wafer manufacturing capacity online at the end of September, plus 19 GW of cell lines and 36 GW of module facilities, Jinko plans to raise those numbers to 32.5 GW, 24 GW, and 45 GW, respectively, by the end of next month. Of the cell production lines, 940 MW were devoted to manufacturing the company’s n-type, high efficiency components and Jinko wants that number to leap to 16 GW in the first three months of the new year.
The manufacturer also trailed the fact its 7 GW monosilicon wafer production fab in Vietnam is due online within the next four months, and would give it the same volume of joined up wafer, cell and module facilities outside China.
In terms of the numbers, Jinko shipped 4,993 MW of product in the last quarter, including 4,671 MW of modules. That was slightly less than it shifted in April-to-June thanks to “logistical issues and blockages.” The company expects to move another 7-8.5 GW of modules in the current window – and total solar system shipments of 7.3-8.8 GW – for an expected full-year figure of 22.8-24-3 GW.
Third-quarter revenue came in at RMB8.57 billion (US$1.19 billion) – up 8.1%, quarter on quarter – for a gross profit of RMB1.3 billion (US$180 million), and net income of RMB194 million (US$26.9 million), almost treble the figure recorded in April-to-June. Jinko anticipates it will generate revenue of $1.8-2.2 billion (US$250-305 million) for the full year.
Although the company balance sheet took a hit to the tune of almost RMB11 billion (US$1.53 billion) less in total assets since the end of 2020, that was almost counterbalanced by a RMB10 billion (US$1.39 billion) fall in total liabilities.
And the directors also offered up their thoughts on polysilicon, described as “currently in its most severe shortage,” by stating: “We expect polysilicon supply will gradually return to sufficient levels, starting next year.”
