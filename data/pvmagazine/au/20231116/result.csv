Through the exemption order, the state’s Lands Minister will be able to grant an option to lease Crown land to renewable energy proponents while their proposal is being evaluated by the EPA.
Western Australian Environment Minister Reece Whitby said the new approvals process is part of the state government’s commitment to developing creative, collaborative approaches to support the transition of WA’s energy system from fossil fuels to renewables.
“We have listened to the feedback from proponents and investors and found an innovative approach to ensure these renewable energy projects are able to progress in a timely manner,” he said, noting that the exemption order will not impact the current environmental assessment processes under the Act.
“We are not making any changes to the due diligence or responsibilities of the EPA – or the Minister for Lands through this reform – these changes will simply reduce government approvals timeframes for projects that can meet their environmental requirements, while preserving the due diligence and responsibilities required by the EPA.”
Lands Minister John Carey said providing renewable energy developers with early access to Crown land will help draw new investment to the state and facilitate more clean energy production.
“This new streamlined process means government can provide renewable energy proponents greater confidence to invest here, further highlighting WA’s leading role in a decarbonised future,” he said.
The new streamlined approvals pathway is part of the WA government’s $22.5 million Green Energy Approvals Initiative. Launched in July, the initiative is aimed at driving investment in wind and solar projects, green hydrogen, lithium mining, critical minerals processing as well as manufacturing of renewable energy products such as batteries, electrolysers, solar panels and wind turbines.
The WA government has committed to reducing public sector emissions by 80% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels, and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The state has announced it will exit coal-fired power by the end of the decade with state-owned power provider Synergy to close its two remaining coal plants by 2029.

Under the agreement, GameChange will supply Bison with its Genius Tracker technology for deployment at the solar farms.
Bison’s Australia and New Zealand Country Director Brendan Murphy said the agreement builds on an existing relationship with GameChange which is working with the developer on a solar project under construction in Victoria.
Bison is currently building the 4.95 MW Bostock Creek Solar Farm, located near Cobden in southwest Victoria. Construction of the facility is expected to be complete in early 2024.
“The racking industry is a tough one but GameChange Solar has managed to find a niche in the market with its efficient pre-assembling and speed clamping designs which the Bison Energy engineering team is very impressed with,” Murphy said.
“In commercial terms, these types of designs save us on install costs, which in the current environment means everything.”
The Bostock Creek Solar Farm is part of a growing portfolio that Bison has assembled since its arrival in the Australian market in 2017.
The company, which developed the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm before Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) acquired the project development rights in 2019, is working on a portfolio of solar projects across NSW and Victoria ranging from sub 5 MW to larger-scale projects from 60 MW up to a new 800 MW solar and battery energy storage project which has just commenced development in southern NSW.
Bison is also working on a pipeline of standalone battery energy storage projects ranging from 5 MW to 100 MW with a mix of 2-4 hours storage.
Among these is the 60 MW/240 MWh Bairnsdale battery energy storage system being developed in southeast Victoria.
Bison said the Bairnsdale project is nearing the final connection approval stages with construction expected to commence in early/mid 2024, and grid connection by early 2025.
In New Zealand, Bison has four solar projects with a combined capacity of almost 100 MW under development.

Griffin succeeds current CEO and 5B co-founder Chris McGrath who will assume a new role developing strategic partnerships and new market opportunities.
“There is no better person than David to lead 5B through this time of transformation,” McGrath said.
“He is a veteran of the renewable energy industry in Australia and around the world, with in-depth working knowledge of the complexity of the clean energy transition. David is the right leader at the right time for 5B.”
Griffin, who has been a member of 5B’s board since early in the company’s journey and became a seed investor in 2015, will oversee the next stage of the company’s development which is expected to include an increased focus on meeting high demand in the Australian market.
Griffin said the opportunity ahead is vast for 5B which has developed its prefabricated and modular Maverick solar system, which allows pre-mounted solar panels to be installed quickly.
“We will concentrate on profitable segments in our home market and abroad, where our customers have a deep understanding of the unique benefits of 5B’s Maverick technology and related services, and servicing our strategic partners,” he said.
“5B is truly revolutionising the renewable energy sector with its 5B Maverick prefabricated solar array technology and I couldn’t be more honoured to have been chosen to lead the company.”
To date, 5B has deployed its technology across more than 140 sites worldwide, with a total generating capacity exceeding 70 MW.

AEMO estimates that on average, the National Electricity Market (NEM) will have 1.5 GW more dispatchable generation capacity available this year than during the 2022-23 summer. This includes the 250 MW/250 MWh Torrens Island battery energy storage facilities in South Australia, the 150 MW/150 MWh Hazelwood battery in Victoria, and the 150 MW/300 MWh Riverina energy storage system in New South Wales.
The market operator also included the 100 MW/200 MWh Capital Battery in the Australian Capital Territory in its modelling but French developer Neoen only last week said the project is facing significant delays due to connection issues. It is now expected that it will enter into operations in early 2024 at the earliest.
New wind and solar farms, including Iberdrola’s 190 MW Avonlie Solar Farm in New South Wales, will also provide about 2 GW more generation capacity than was available last summer.
In Western Australia’s Wholesale Energy Market (WEM), an additional 46 MW of scheduled generation, including the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana battery energy storage facility, is expected to be available.
AEMO Executive General Manager for Operations Michael Gatt said this year’s summer forecast is for hot and dry El Niño conditions, increasing the risk of bushfires and extreme heat, which could see electricity demand reach “a 1-in-10-year high across the eastern states and in Western Australia.”
In August, AEMO identified periods when electricity reliability thresholds were at risk in the NEM and the Western Australian South West Interconnected System (SWIS) but Gatt said months of planning with industry has gone into preparing the power systems for a possible summer of extreme demand.
“The entire industry has been focusing and continues to focus on managing possible risks for the summer ahead, particularly during high demand periods,” he said.
In addition to the new wind, solar and storage capacity, AEMO is also working to procure additional reserves at short notice through the Interim Reliability Reserve and Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) mechanisms in the NEM. In Western Australia, AEMO is tendering for reserves through the Supplementary Reserve Capacity mechanism.
“The increase in generation availability and additional reserves being procured will help navigate reliability pressures, should they eventuate,” Gatt said.

Scientists led by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute have developed new residential small-area high-voltage (SAHiV) solar modules that they said are designed to endure high partial shading.
The researchers designed panels with both rectangular and triangular shapes and solar cells connected in parallel, which have higher partial-shading tolerance compared with cells connected in strings. “However, the module voltage will be very low in a parallel connection,” they also stressed. “Designing a module with parallel connections of high-voltage and low-current cells is a basic solution but is impossible with commercial solar cells.”
The academics divided conventional cells measuring 60 mm × 60 mm into 12 cells with both triangular and rectangular shapes, measuring 15 mm × 20 mm and 30 mm × 20 mm, respectively.
“We connected 12 cells in strings to become one subgroup to form a pseudo-high-voltage low-current cell with the same dimensions as a conventional cell,” they said. “This design differs from that of shingled cells, where a module is divided into four to six pieces arranged in strings lengthwise and connected string subgroups to group with parallel connections to the side.”
Shingled panels feature a busbar-free structure in which only a small proportion of cells are not exposed to sunlight. The cells are bonded with electrically conductive adhesive to form a shingled high-density string and the resulting strips are connected. The reduced number of busbars reduces shadowing losses.
With these cells, the research group built solar modules measuring 240 mm x 180 mm and with an active area of 432 cm2. They also built a shingled module with four subgroup cells, where each subgroup cell consisted of 12 string cells, and a SAHiV module with 12 subgroup cells, where each subgroup cell consisted of 12 string cells. Finally, they also designed a SAHiV triangle module with 12 subgroup cells, where each subgroup cell consisted of 12 string cells.
Through a series of Monte Carlo-based simulations and verification experiments, the scientists tested the performance of all panels under different types of shading patterns and angles, including eight discrete shading scenarios and five continuous shading scenarios. They compared their performance with that of a reference shingled panel.
The researchers said the tests showed that both the SAHiV modules and the SAHiV triangle modules are less sensitive to partial-shading geometries. “We found that the SAHiV triangle module demonstrates better partial shading tolerance under most of the investigated scenarios,” they further explained, noting that this shading tolerance is particularly high under shallow shadowing of up to 50%.
“For the SAHiV and SAHiV triangle modules in the vertical shading pattern, slight changes in the total shading area result in the same power,” the group said. “The SAHiV modules are robust against changes in the shading shape as long as the shading area is similar.”
The scientists presented the novel module architecture in the study “Small area high voltage photovoltaic module for high tolerance to partial shading,” which was recently published in iScience. “The results of this study indicate that the SAHiV module is very suitable for urban applications with unpredictable shadows and limited land,” they concluded. “Under these conditions, the SAHiV module will increase its performance by 1.5–3 times compared to conventional modules, maximizing electricity production.”
