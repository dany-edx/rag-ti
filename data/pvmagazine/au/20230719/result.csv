“A set of coordinated activities is required to ensure that Australia can successfully deploy the scale of solar PV needed, not just to realise the government’s target of 82% renewables in our electricity system by 2030, but to reduce the cost of solar PV even further beyond 2030 and realise the vision of Australia as a renewable energy superpower,” ARENA says in the white paper.
Central to the white paper, which primarily focuses on the utility-scale market, is ARENA’s 30-30-30 vision for ultra low-cost solar in Australia, which represents 30% solar module efficiency and 30 cents per installed watt at utility scale by 2030.
ARENA said achieving the targets will require a step change from where we are today at about 22% solar module efficiency and more than $1 per watt installed cost.
In terms of total levelised cost of energy (LCOE), ARENA’s vision requires a drop to about one-third of today’s solar LCOE to below $20/MWh.

ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said “achieving this vision won’t be easy, but Australia has a comparative advantage due to our huge land mass, strong solar resources and abundance of minerals that can be used to make green products.”
“Innovation is key to reducing the cost of solar. Groundbreaking research has been taking place in Australia’s labs since the 1980s, and we have homegrown startups such as 5B and SunDrive doing exciting things in novel deployment methods and materials science.”
ARENA said the main objectives of white paper are to elevate PV in Australia’s national priorities by outlining the benefits that extremely cheap solar could unlock. The agency is also looking to identify key barriers and innovation priorities for ultra low-cost solar to government, industry and the Australian public.
Miller said Australia needs to step up support to deliver further cost reductions through increased module efficiencies, cheaper material costs and innovative ways to deploy and maintain solar in the field.
“We need a united front to tackle this task,” he said. “We’re calling on Australia’s governments, market bodies, developers, investors and innovators across the entire supply chain to commit to these goals.”

The $157 million project is to be built in the designated Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) on land owned and managed by NSW network operator Ausgrid and would connect to the grid via the existing Ausgrid Muswellbrook substation.
The NSW government has also given the green light to Melbourne-headquartered developer ACEnergy to build the planned $123 million Aspley BESS about 60 kilometres south of Dubbo in the coordinated Central-West Orana REZ.
The project involves the development of a standalone battery with a capacity of up to 120 MW/240 MWh, and a new 132 kV transmission line which would connect to the existing transmission line to the east of the project site.
ACEnergy expects to reach financial close on the project early next year with the state government saying both batteries are expected to be operational towards the end of 2025.
NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said the batteries will help balance the grid and support the performance and future uptake of renewable energy in the state.
“Giving these batteries the green light will play a critical role in securing reliable, renewable energy across NSW,” she said.
“The transformation of our energy system needs to occur as soon as possible. Batteries are not only critical to supporting our state’s transition to net zero, they will assist us to get there sooner.”
The state government’s Renewable Energy Roadmap calls for at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation and 2 GW of energy storage by 2030 to replace the state’s ageing coal-fired power generators.
Sharpe said there are currently 27 large-scale renewable energy, transmission lines and storage projects under assessment in the NSW planning system. If approved, they would provide 9 GW of renewable energy and 5.5 MW of firming storage.
The Apsley and Muswellbrook projects are expected to create 132 jobs and inject $280 million into NSW’s economy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/19/solar-leads-way-for-new-build-power-source-as-all-technology-prices-surge/,"COVID-19,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 19, 2023",Solar leads way for new-build power source as all technology prices surge,"The latest GenCost report from the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), reveals that the capital costs of all power generation technologies had increased by about 20% since 2021-22 but with significant diversity.
Cost increases were as low as 9% for solar and up to 35% for wind, a disparity that the CSIRO attributed to differences in material inputs and exposure to freight costs.
CSIRO Chief Energy Economist and GenCost lead author Paul Graham said the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in lingering global supply chain constraints which impacted the prices of raw materials required in technology manufacturing as well as freight costs.
Graham said these factors have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine but noted the inflationary cycle is assumed to be at its peak and that technology cost pressures felt in Australia are forecast to revert to normal levels by 2027.
“During the recovery from these global events, various input costs are showing signs of moderation,” he said. “However there is an expected delay due to future price uncertainties and the robust demand associated with the global energy transition.”

Graham said modelling shows that technology costs have mostly peaked and are unlikely to extend beyond 2030 as “the global manufacturing capability established by that time will adequately meet deployment needs.”
The GenCost project, a joint initiative of the CSIRO and AEMO to provide an annual process for updating electricity generation and storage cost data for Australia, shows that solar is the cheapest form of generation in Australia now and out to 2050.
The report shows the current generation technology capital cost for large-scale PV is $1,516 per kW. Modelling projects that by 2050 that cost will reduce to between $513/kW to just under $700/kW.
The current cost for rooftop solar is $1,400/kW and that is projected to drop to between $483/kW and $619/kW by 2050.
The report does note that the final minimum cost level for PV is one of the most difficult to predict because, unlike other technologies, the historical learning rate for the technology has not slowed.

Despite the up to 35% spike in costs, wind power remained one of Australia’s cheapest new-build generation sources, listing the current capital costs for onshore wind at $2,644/kW with cost reductions resulting in a price of about $1,600/kW to $1,900/kW by 2050.
The current capital costs for hydrogen is listed at $2,140/kW, while gas was costed at $1,706/kW and black coal came in at $4,964/kW.
The report also includes current costs for small-scale batteries, designed to be installed in homes. They are estimated at $16,000 for a 5 kW/10 kWh system or $1,600/kWh, including installation. This is more than twice the cost of large-scale battery projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/19/researchers-develop-bifacial-cell-with-93-efficiency-on-backside/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 19, 2023",NREL develops perovskite solar cells with 93% bifaciality,"Research by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on bifacial perovskite solar cells has resulted in bifaciality of 91% to 93%, leading it to conclude that bifacial perovskites could be a preferable pathway for a lower levelized cost of electricity. It published the results in Joule.
Perovskites hold promise because of their low production costs, and their thinness allows them to be deposited on most surfaces. While challenges remain with the stability and longevity of perovskites, new efficiency records have been achieved month after month in recent years.
Past iterations of bifacial perovskites have struggled to keep up with monofacial cells, which currently have a record efficiency of 26%. Bifacial cells are also more expensive to produce than their single-face counterparts. The NREL researchers noted that for the technology to compete, a bifacial cell should have a front-side efficiency close to the best-performing monofacial cell, and that the bifaciality rating should be close to 100% of the front-side efficiency.
In the newly produced single-junction NREL bifacial cell, an efficiency of 23% was recorded on the front, with the back side achieving a bifaciality of 91% to 93% of that efficiency level. The research team said that bifacial cells could generate 10% to 20% more power than single-face cells.
Before constructing the record-breaking cell, researchers used optical and electrical simulations to determine the ideal thickness. The front layer had to be thick enough to absorb most of the photons from a certain part of the solar spectrum, but a perovskite layer that is too thick can block the photons.

On the back of the cell, the NREL team had to determine the ideal thickness of the rear electrode to minimize resistive loss. The team noted the balance between the resistive and optical losses needs to be considered. The transparent oxide rear electrode needs to be sufficiently thick to minimize the resistive loss, but it also needs to be sufficiently thin to minimize parasitic absorption.
The research team found that an ideal thickness for a perovskite layer is around 850 nanometers, which is incredibly thin. For reference, a human hair is roughly 70,000 nanometers thick.
Albedo, or the reflectivity of the surface beneath the solar cell, impacts the output of the backside perovskites. The bifacial output power was measured at 28.5 mW per square centimeter with an albedo of 0.3 and 30.1 mW per square centimeter for an albedo of 0.5.
This research was funded by the US Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/19/bowen-talks-of-turning-climate-ambitions-into-reality/,"MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JULY 19, 2023",Bowen talks of turning climate ambitions into reality,"Speaking at the Australian Clean Energy Summit in Sydney on Tuesday, Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the federal government will develop plans across six key economic sectors: electricity and energy, industry, the built environment, agriculture and land, transport, and resources.
“The sector plans will feed in to both our Net Zero 2050 plan and strong 2035 targets which we will lodge in keeping with our Paris commitments,” he said.
Bowen was blunt in assessment of Australia’s current Net Zero 2050 plan, labelling it a “fantasy, invented by the Morrison government. It assumes future technologies will do the heavy lifting without any effort or investment to bring them about,” he said.
The energy minister added that the federal government will seek statutory advice from the Climate Change Authority on the 2035 target and expected to receive that advice in late 2024.
Industry consultation
The decarbonisation plan was light on specific detail, but Bowen stressed that strong engagement with community and industry would be central to the plan.
“The level and quality of dialogue and collaboration with industries, experts and citizens will set these plans apart from anything that’s been done before,” he said. “This is a shared endeavour: we must work together to do what’s both possible and practical to stop dangerous climate change and realise the economic opportunities of net zero.”
Bowen explained that the responsibility of developing each sector plan would be shared by his Federal Cabinet colleagues. Ed Husic will look after industry and the built environment, Tanya Plibersek and Murray Watt will take on agriculture and land, Madeleine King would be in charge of resources, and Catherine King would develop the plan for transport.
The waste sector, Bowen added, would be included in the industry plan but the focus on the circular economy would be a “cross-cutting issue” for all sectors.
Positive response
The plan for a cross-sector approach to decarbonisation was welcomed by the Australian Energy Council (AEC), the nation’s peak body for energy retailers and generators.
“Achieving a 43% emission reduction by 2030 will necessitate sectors in addition to electricity to begin to decarbonise,” AEC Chief Executive Sarah McNamara said. “We know that as emissions get closer to net zero, abatement will only become more challenging and more costly, so updating Australia’s Net Zero Plan now is timely.
“Determining sectoral pathways for key emitters in the economy is critical to the delivery of Net Zero by 2050.”
McNamara noted that Australia’s electricity sector has already decreased its emissions by 26.9% since their peak in 2009 and is expected to shoulder the bulk of the decline in emissions to 2030.
In his address, Bowen also reiterated the federal government’s commitment to renewable energy in the face of nuclear alternatives. He pointed to a GenCost report, released Tuesday by the CSIRO and Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) that confirmed wind and solar remained the cheapest new-build energy generation.
“The latest Gencost Report, out today in fact, confirms that the more we learn about small modular reactors (SMRs), the more expensive they get,” Bowen said.
“SMRs, even with all the supposed technological advancement coming this decade, are tracking to be up to five times more expensive than firmed wind and solar in 2030.”
Earlier, Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton had laid the groundwork for Bowen’s thoughts about nuclear energy.
“Next-generation nuclear has not yet been invented or demonstrated and must be seen for what it is in Australia – another distraction promoted by bad-faith actors with no genuine interest in emissions reductions, energy security or lowering power prices,” Thornton said.
“If we had listened to them, we wouldn’t have built the hydro schemes, a bridge over Sydney’s harbour, or the overland telegraph that first connected us to the world. We wouldn’t have Wifi. These are acts of courage and foresight that now define our nation.”
Thornton used his opening remarks to emphasise the urgency of Australia’s need to increase its renewable energy capacity in the wake of the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
“We are now in a global clean energy investment race – and are losing,” he said. “While we can and should manufacture more clean energy equipment in Australia, for now we are dependent on global supply chains. To become a clean energy superpower, we will need to do more than dig and ship our mineral resources.
“More importantly, we will only become a clean energy superpower if we decarbonise our own energy system. Fast.”
Thornton noted that the current average annual output of approximately 3 GW of rooftop solar and 3 GW of large-scale renewables would need to double if Australia is to meet its target of 82% renewable energy by 2030.
The CEC head also called on the Federal Government to extend the Renewable Energy Target (RET). “Extending it beyond 2030 would be simple and fast, and the benefits to energy prices and the Australian economy will outweigh the costs associated with this extension,” he said.
“These are the actions and leadership we now need to turn ambition into reality.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/19/arena-funds-vpp-to-cool-demand-from-supermarkets-and-refrigerated-warehouses/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,AUSTRALIA",TRISTAN RAYNER,"JULY 19, 2023",ARENA funds VPP to cool demand from supermarkets and refrigerated warehouses,"Smart refrigeration could cool peak grid demand from the retail sector, under a new ARENA trial.
Aiming to have parts of the commercial and industrial refrigeration sectors act together as coordinated load, the VPP project with Enel X aims to aggregate 20.9 MW of demand from some 440 supermarkets. Enel X has a 20-store pilot underway with a “Tier 1 Grocery chain”, possibly extending to 250 more stores, along with 13 refrigerated warehouses owned by Lineage Logistics. Enel X is recruiting more businesses in commercial refrigeration to reach the 440-store funding support mark from ARENA.
By shifting demand to periods of high supply capacity and away from peak times, the project, dubbed, “Unlocking Flexible Demand in the Commercial Refrigeration Sector”, hopes to alleviate grid constraints while considering the intermittent nature of renewables. In addition, the aim is to de-risk the uptake of new technology for prospective demand response providers, and together, Enel X and ARENA are hoping for project completion by 2027. 
A previous grant from ARENA to Enel X for a VPP with commercial and industrial customers delivered 50 MW of flexible load to suit emergency demand response requirements, unrelated to refrigeration.
ARENA estimates Australia has up to 500 MW of potential flexible demand in refrigeration across Australia’s supermarkets, grocery stores, beverage shops and warehouses, and hopes to unlock shifting demand opportunities to complement energy storage options. 
“Our electricity grid is changing, and a more variable supply requires more flexible demand,” said ARENA CEO Darren Miller. “Commercial refrigeration can unlock this opportunity at a material scale, so we’re excited to see the Enel X project rolled out across Australian supermarkets and other businesses with refrigeration.
Australia’s Federal government already offered businesses with annual turnover of less than $50 million an energy incentive to encourage heating and cooling efficiency. But a coordinated approach for larger-scale necessary cooling and refrigeration is a further step. 
Stepping up flexibility
ARENA has already identified flexible demand as a strategic focus to avoid curtailing renewables and reduce future reliance on energy storage.
Already, ARENA previously supported Shell Energy Australia with a $9.1 million grant to implement energy load control across at least 40 commercial and industrial (C&I) customer sites, with the entire energy system, including HVAC, refrigeration, electric vehicle (EV) charging control, and onsite solar PV and storage, using Shell’s C&I load flex product called LoadFlex.
On the heating side, multiple projects in 2021 and 2022 have been awarded ARENA grants to demonstrate active control over residential hot water systems to dynamically orchestrate hot water (HW) load, including $1.98 million for Rheem, and $2.72 million to PLUS ES for projects in South Australia.
