On Thursday, work begun on the 1.5 MW pumped hydro facility which will use two farm dams to provide 30 MWh of storage. The “mini” pumped hydro facility is expected to be operational by the second half of 2023.
It will connect into the state’s islanded South West Interconnected System (SWIS) network and work as part of a microgrid, providing power to just over 500 local customers, Western Power said. In the event of a network disruption, the microgrid will be able to work independently.
The pumped hydro facility will store enough power to supply Walpole for up to two days, far longer than a typical lithium battery solution.
“This project, despite being on a smaller scale, will be used as a template for other areas in the state, and possibly nationally and internationally,” WA’s Energy Minister Bill Johnston said.
Earlier this month, the Power Research and Development was awarded $2 million as part of the state government’s Clean Energy Future Fund to progress the project.
The pumped hydro solution, which stores energy by pumping water uphill when renewables are abundant and cheap before releasing it downhill when needed, will ultimately not only store renewable energy but also safeguard the regional town against power outages.
Situated on the southern tip of the state, Walpole sits at the end of a 125 kilometre long feeder line that is exposed to storms, lightning, bushfires, animals and other disruptive elements.
The pumped hydro solution will mitigate up to 80% of outages experienced in the town though, according to the state government. The plan for the microgrid is to offer this vastly improved reliability at no additional cost to businesses or the community.
The pumping mechanism at the Walpole facility will be powered by solar panels and batteries “making it self-sufficient,” Western Power said.

Western Power and Horizon Power, both government owned entities, have pioneered a number of microgrid projects in the state, which has long been challenged by connecting its regional populations across vast, harsh landscapes. The utilities have found not only a cleaner but also a more economic solution in deploying renewable microgrids and standalone solutions.
In February, Western Power switched on its largest renewable energy microgrid to date in the coastal town of Kalbarri. It is powered by 1 MW of feed-in from residential rooftop solar, a 1.6 MW wind farm, backed by a 5 MW/2 MWh battery energy storage system.

Now the company is investigating the opportunities for pumped hydro as a storage solution.
“Our project has new and clever technology; but generating power from two farm dams in Walpole is inspired by the earliest AC hydro power plant, built in 1892. It is still running today as a source of clean, renewable energy,” Power Research and Development Director Colin Stonehouse said.
“We must be onto something good because the project has drawn on some of the leading suppliers in the world for its equipment and without exception, they have all wanted to be involved and been very generous with their help.”

The team plan to charge an electric Tesla vehicle (EV) by unrolling 18 flexible panels beside the car forming an off-grid charging system. The organic solar cells being deployed have been printed on laminated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic by a printer formerly used for wine labels.
The 18 metre long ultralight and ultraflexible strips are similar in thickness and appearance to a chip packet, the university team have said. The project will see the technology’s performance and durability tested in the real world, while also offering the team an opportunity to educate along the way.
The Charge Around Australia project is set to embark in September and is a partnership between the UK company Charging Around Britain Ltd and the University of Newcastle’s Centre for Organic Electronics, where the printed solar cell technology was developed by Professor Paul Dastoor and his team. 
Lane Cove Council
“This is actually an ideal test bed to give us information about how we would go about using and powering technology in other remote locations, for example, in space,” Professor Dastoor told Reuters about the project.
The main challenges for printed organic photovoltaics are efficiency and durability, the Charge Around Australia project notes. It says extensive economic modelling has found that even with modest device efficiency and lifetimes, large area oriented solar technology can compete with coal generated power.
“The projected efficiency of a pilot scale installation is around 1%–2% with a lifetime of between one and two years,” the project’s website says, adding that for manufacture at scale, this would correspond to a cost of electricity as low as $0.88 per kWh.

The university teams says its technology can be manufactured at a production cost of less than $10 per square metre and can rapidly be produced, with commercial scale equipment capable of printing kilometres of material a day.
“No other renewal energy technology can be manufactured as quickly. The low cost and speed at which this technology can be deployed is exciting as we need to find solutions, and quickly,” Professor Dastoor said.
Over 99% of the panels are made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, for which the Newcastle team is currently looking into recycling processes. “Our hope is that we can separate the outer PET layers and reuse them to make new panels with minimal processing,” Professor Dastoor said.
The technology has already been deployed in the form of a solar arbour in Sydney’s Lane Cove, which opened in June 2020.
The low-cost, lightweight, flexible solar technology could hold promise for a range of applications including disaster relief and recovery; retractable recharging systems for electric vehicles, caravans, camping and the defence industry; floating covers for dams and pools; yacht sails; smart blinds for residential and high-rise buildings; greenhouse covers and more, the Newcastle University team have said.
In the Charge Around Australia project, the team is aiming to dispel “range anxiety” around electric vehicles and prove how efficient solar technology can be at car charging. The project will also see scientists visit around 70 schools to teach students about renewable energy technologies and future potential.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/26/construction-begins-on-lynas-rare-earths-refinery-in-western-australia/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 26, 2022",Construction begins on Lynas’ rare earths refinery in Western Australia,"Listed mining company Lynas Rare Earths has officially begun construction of its $500 million rare earths processing facility in Kalgoorlie which will eventually service the growing battery and electric vehicles markets.
Lynas plans to process rare earth concentrate from its Mount Weld mine at the facility, bringing that capacity onshore for the first time.
Lynas currently processes the Australian materials in Gebeng, Malaysia, producing separated rare earth materials like neodymium and praseodymium (used in magnets), lanthanum, cerium, and mixed heavy rare earths for export to manufacturing markets in Asia, Europe and the United States.

The company says its Malaysian facility is “the world’s largest single rare earths processing plant” and is the “only significant producer of separated rare earth materials outside of China.”
Bringing this capacity onshore has been welcomed by West Australian energy and mining minister Bill Johnston, who described the new facility as an “exciting moment for Kalgoorlie and the Western Australian economy” as it moves towards diversifying its economy. That is, moves away from its traditional role as “quarry” towards value adding. 
In the Western Australian government’s statement on the news, it said Lynas’ Mount Weld mine accounted for 10% of the global production of rare earths in 2021.
The news comes just weeks after another West Australian mining company Iluka announced it had received a $1.25 billion loan from the Commonwealth government to build an integrated rare earths refinery in Eneabba, Western Australia.
Presumably the Iluka project is bigger than Lynas’ plans, given the capital to be deployed by Lynas is around $500 million while the Iluka project will use more than $1 billion. It also appears Lynas won’t be moving its processing facilities out of Malaysia, but rather adding to its arsenal. 

“Western Australia is in a prime position to establish our place at the centre of the global critical minerals supply chain for generations to come,” minister Johnston said.
In February, Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mayor John Bowler said the Lynas facility could be as significant for the local economy as the discovery of gold.

The Ministry of Information (MOI) and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Economic Relations (MIFER) of Myanmar last week issued a joint press release stating that the government is planning to boost renewable energy development and increase foreign investments despite the threat of new economic sanctions.
The two ministries said the announcement comes in response to recent unspecified media reports about energy shortages in the country and exits of some foreign energy companies.
“The recent temporary shortage of power was caused by a surge of global liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a weaker kyat currency, as well as terrorist actions linked to the People’s Defensive Force (PDF),” the government said referring to the armed wing of the democratically elected National Unity Government (NUG) which was ousted by a military coup on February 1, 2021.
“Apart from advocating a boycott of utility payments since 2021, PDF terrorists blew up power lines from the Lawpita hydroelectric plant in Kayah State. These actions contributed to outages which caused hardship to ordinary citizens and small businesses in particular.”
The government also said it will accelerate power generation in the country from oil and gas sources through new investments.
As for solar development, the two ministries said the 40 MW Letpanhla and 30 MW Nyaungbin Gyi solar projects have been completed and 13 solar power projects totalling 370 MW have been launched.
“Three more solar power projects which will generate 390 megawatt are also planned. Special efforts are being made to promote floating solar projects, rooftop solar projects, and small and medium-sized projects wherever possible. Tenders are also being called for 18 solar power projects that can generate 635 MW. These are in addition to ongoing negotiations for 11 solar projects which will generate 300 MW that have been invited,” their statement reads.
Despite the optimism of Myanmar’s authorities, the development of large scale solar appears to be  encountering difficulties. Chinese PV inverter manufacturer Sungrow announced last week in its financial results that the project it secured in Myanmar’s first solar tender held in September 2020 has been canceled.
Last month, Irrawaddy news website owned by the Irrawaddy Publishing Group (IPG), founded in 1990 by Burmese exiles living in Thailand, reported that the utility solar projects selected in the above-mentioned tender were still far behind their construction schedules.
“Myanmar’s military regime is not pushing enough or not pushing at all the Chinese firms who are contracted to start solar power production, despite the fact that they are several months behind schedule,” the media outlet reported, hinting at the fact the military coup took place four months after the tender was finalised.
“The companies were set to start operations within six months under the agreements. However, the Myanmar military seized power from the NLD government in a February coup last year while the bidders were in the final phase to sign power purchase agreements with the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MOEE).”
German project developer ib vogt, which secured one of the awarded projects, has declined to provide a comment upon pv magazine request. “ib vogt generally does not comment on projects that are under development,” the company stated.
Only an undisclosed project developer has so far secured a power purchase agreement from the MOEE, said Irrawaddy citing unidentified sources from the ministry. Furthermore, the article reveals that several of the regions where the projects will be located are currently affected by clashes between the army and resistance groups.
The MOEE allocated 1 GW of PV capacity in the procurement exercise and final prices ranged from US$0.0348/kWh to $0.051/kWh. The biggest winners were Chinese inverter maker Sungrow and China Machinery Engineering Corp. (CMEC), with nine and eight projects awarded, respectively.
A consortium formed by China’s State Power Investment Corporation Limited (SPIC) and local company Khaing Long Gems secured four projects. Two more consortia – including a group involving Chinese solar manufacturers Longi and GGL Systems – also won projects, as did the remaining two bidders, including groups led by ib vogt and Myanmar’s Gold Energy.
In June 2021, the MOEE launched a second 1 GW PV tender and a few months later it postponed the deadline to submit the bids for unspecified reasons.
According to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the country reached an installed PV capacity of 80 MW at the end of 2021.

With renewables developers Quantum Power Asia and Ib Vogt having recently announced plans to invest $5 billion into a 3.5 GW/12 GWh solar-plus-storage project in Indonesia, the governor of the nation’s Riau Islands has signed up for more utility scale solar generation and energy storage capacity.
Singaporean clean energy company Sunseap on Tuesday announced it had signed a deal with Riau governor Ansar Ahmad to develop an unspecified volume of “large-scale solar and storage” across the Riau Islands and is already considering 1.38 GWp of solar and 3 GWh of storage on the island of Combol, and 1.62 GWh of solar plus 3.5 GWh of storage on Citlim.
Sunseap’s largest shareholder is European utility Energías de Portugal, whose own largest investor is state-owned power company China Three Gorges.
The recent project announced by Singaporean developer Quantum and its German peer aims to export all the projected 4 TWh of solar electricity to be generated to the city state, to help meet 8% of its electricity demand.
By contrast, Sunseap says its facilities will provide clean power to Indonesia as well as Singapore, without specifying volumes.
Sunseap has already signed a deal with government entity Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority to invest $2 billion in a floating solar and storage project on the Duriangkang reservoir on the Riau island of Batam.
In January last year, state-owned Emirati developer Masdar signed an agreement with Singaporean peer Tuas Power, French energy company EDF, and Indonesian state-owned utility PT Indonesia Power to explore the development of 1.2 GW of solar generation capacity, with the potential for energy storage, on Indonesian territory, also for export to Singapore.
