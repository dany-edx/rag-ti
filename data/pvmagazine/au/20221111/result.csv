The Community Solar Program pilot (CSP) is the result of solar provider Solar Energy Enterprises and non-for-profit Community Housing Provider Blue CHP.
The CSP pilot will operate under a power purchase agreement in which residents pay for the solar power their homes use at a rate approximately 40% less than if they were completely reliant on the National Electricity Market (NEM).
In a company statement Solar Energy Enterprises described the CSP pilot as a “first of its kind solar initiative aiming to solve the energy crisis for disability and community housing residents with benefits for tenants, developers, and investors alike.” And added that while the residential solar PPA model is popular in the US, it has not been well taken up in Australia.
If the CSP pilot proves a success, it could pave the way for a much larger rollout. BlueCHP’s portfolio tops 800 houses, but the not-for-profit’s CEO Charles Northcote suggested the scope of a larger rollout could see approximately 400,000 social housing properties in Australia get access to affordable solar.
Northcote added that people with a lower socioeconomic status tend to be the people hit hardest by the cost of living crisis, particularly electricity price hikes. And without the access to capital required for the installation of solar, “they have little to no option other than to absorb the cost and look for somewhere else they can cut expenses.”
Adam Dragic, the CEO of Solar Energy Enterprises, said the initiative “has the potential to disrupt the entire social housing and energy industry.” Moreover, Dragic noted that the multifaceted benefits of this model is what “makes it so revolutionary.”
“Residents who may not have had the opportunity to access more sustainable and cheaper energy from solar do not have to find the upfront capital to pay for the solar system,” Dragic added. “Developers increase the value of the homes and can offer genuine benefits for their tenants without increasing their operating costs, and investors are expected to get a return of between 7% to 8% on the initial investment.”
In the future, the partners see an opportunity to integrate virtual power sharing and battery storage into the program.

The multi-building Huntingwood manufacturing facility will feature a 4.1 MW rooftop PV system and 600 kW of solar car park shades which will operate alongside a 15 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). The project, which will comprise an estimated 10,000 solar panels, shapes as one of Australia’s largest integrated behind-the-meter solar and battery installations, generating more than 5.25 GWh of renewable electricity annually.
CleanPeak will also source an additional 17.3 GWh of mixed renewable and non-renewable electricity as part of a multi-year front-of-meter energy agreement that will allow operations at the site to progressively transition to renewable electricity from 2023, reaching 100% by 2029.
Sydney-based CleanPeak will also build a 1.3 MW rooftop solar system at Arnott’s manufacturing site at Virginia in Queensland.
Arnott’s chief transformation officer Simon Lowden said the agreement with CleanPeak “allows us to make significant progress towards achieving our group net-zero targets that we’ve set ourselves.”
“It offers greater certainty over our electricity prices, is affordable and efficient, and is just one of the tools we’re investing in to get to meet our net-zero commitment. We are also investing in large-scale energy monitoring trials and working with our suppliers to better understand their emission profiles,” he said.

CleanPeak chief executive Phillip Graham said he was excited to work with Arnott’s in building a behind-the-meter strategy for their manufacturing sites and partnering with them to deliver a whole-of-meter 100% renewable offering.
“It’s terrific to see tier-one industrial companies who have large rooftops in metropolitan areas showing the leadership needed to achieve the renewable energy transition,” he said. “These deals are very complex in a manufacturing environment as its imperative to deliver the system without impacting production, and we congratulate The Arnott’s Group’s focus and commitment to achieving what really is commercial sustainability in action.”
From January 1, 2023, CleanPeak will become the energy retailer for Arnott’s Huntingwood and Virginia sites. The company will then commence installation of the rooftop systems with the Huntingwood project due to be fully operational by the end of 2023.
Graham said about half of the energy use at the 44,000sqm Huntingwood facility, which operates 24 hours, seven days a week, would come from behind-the-meter resources, providing a significant cost saving for Arnott’s, which is owned by United States-headquartered investment firm KKR.
“By managing high-quality solar and battery assets behind the meter and integrating them with our portfolio of renewable assets, we’re able to offer reliable, firm renewables, that are more cost-effective than current grid contracts,” he said.
Graham told the Australian Financial Review that Arnott’s is expected to save money in the short- and long-term on electricity because generally, behind-the-meter resources could deliver electricity of $100 per MWh, compared to a grid rate of $250 per MWh.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/11/companies-line-up-as-queensland-plans-renewables-led-manufacturing-boom/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022",Companies line up as Queensland plans renewables-led manufacturing boom,"The Queensland government is aiming to supply 80% of the state’s electricity demand from hydro power, wind and solar farms by 2035 and more than 230 companies have already expressed an interest in supply chain opportunities and establishing manufacturing facilities in the state to provide the thousands of renewables components needed to enable the shift to clean energy.
In September, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk launched the state’s Energy and Jobs Plan, a 10-year vision for the state’s energy transformation that is expected to command $62 billion worth of public and private investment over the next 15 years.
The state government is aiming to supply 70% of the state’s energy demands from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035. It plans to reach these targets by constructing what it’s calling the “Queensland SuperGrid” – an interconnected and massive fit out of solar, wind, battery and hydrogen generators.
Last month it called for expressions of interest from private firms to make the renewables components, including an estimated 25 million solar PV modules, nearly 7,000 batteries and more than 2,000 wind towers, and 7,000 turbine blades, in Queensland.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles told Parliament on Thursday that 230 companies from Australia, Japan, South Korea, China, Germany, the United States and India have already responded to the Energy Manufacturing Opportunity Prospectus.
“Around half of these, more than 100 companies, are manufacturers wanting to consider the possibilities for building energy equipment and other assets here in Queensland,” he said.
“These are companies who are now considering how they can establish, expand or accelerate Queensland-based facilities. They are interested in the possibilities for local manufacturing of wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, green-hydrogen system components, transmission lines and hydro systems.”

Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said as well as looking to manufacture components, companies have also expressed interest in providing the many goods and services needed for renewable energy supply chains.
“Companies of all sizes, areas of expertise, and global reach have told us they want to be part of the energy transformation,” he said.
“We are bringing back manufacturing to Queensland – from companies in the state looking to expand, to overseas companies looking to move here, there are hundreds of businesses who want to help build the Queensland SuperGrid.
“That includes the supply of raw materials and components needed by manufacturers as well as the goods and services required to assemble, install, operate and maintain energy assets.”
Miles said companies which had responded to the prospectus are now part of a Queensland Treasury Corporation market-sounding process identifying existing Queensland-based capability and participation readiness as well as manufacturing opportunities.
“Importantly this process will also convey to government the roles it could play in supporting the industry to bring the local manufacturing opportunities to life,” he said.
The information will be reported to government in March 2023 to inform the release of requests for proposal later in 2023. The prospectus remains open for registrations of interest.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/11/1500-new-pumped-hydro-sites-found-next-to-existing-reservoirs/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 11, 2022","1,500 new pumped hydro sites found next to existing reservoirs","At its simplest, pumped hydro involves two dams, one high on a hill and one down in a valley, with pipes and turbines connecting them. You store electricity by pumping water uphill to the upper reservoir on sunny and windy days – and turn it back into power at night or during calm or cloudy days by letting the water flow back downhill through a turbine. Think of this system as a giant “gravity battery”, where electricity is turned into gravitational potential energy and back again.
The question now is: where are the best locations? Last year, we released a global atlas of more than 600,000 greenfield locations for pumped hydro. These are sites where there is no existing reservoir. About 4,000 of those are in Australia, including the site for Queensland’s newly announced 5 GW Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro scheme.
Now we’ve identified 1,500 new Australian sites in our new bluefield atlas. Bluefield refers to locations with one reservoir already in place, meaning only one new reservoir needs to be built. Existing reservoirs already have a social licence and are usually publicly owned. None of our sites require damming major rivers.
Because we have so many good options, we can afford to be choosy. We can go all the way to 100% renewables while only developing the very best sites.

The world doesn’t have much energy storage right now – and the storage we do have is almost all pumped hydro, co-located with hydroelectric schemes on rivers.
What’s new is that we have found vast opportunities for these projects without new dams on rivers.
We need a lot more energy storage than we now have to support solar and wind. Grid-scale batteries are useful for short-term storage – minutes to hours – but pumped hydro excels at overnight and longer storage.
Creating these atlases showed our energy planners and leaders that pumped hydro storage is effectively unlimited – Australia has 300 times more storage potential than we would need for a fully renewable grid.
Despite their advantages, bluefield sites are not necessarily better than greenfield sites even though they only need one new reservoir. That’s because greenfield sites may excel in areas such as the head – the crucial difference in altitude between the two reservoirs which makes energy generation possible.

So what have we found? An abundance of choice, with pumped hydro storage options ranging from 2 to 500 GWh. To put that into perspective, 500 GWh is enough to supply all of Sydney’s electricity for about four days.
For comparison, the Kidston project under way in Far North Queensland and the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro expansion will provide 2 GWh and 350 GWh, respectively. Queensland’s recent plans are a 50 GWh scheme inland from the Sunshine Coast at Borumba, and the enormous 120 GWh Pioneer-Burdekin project west of Mackay.
We have rated each of the 1,500 bluefield sites based on cost, where top-rated options are expected to have half the capital cost of the most expensive, per unit of storage.
The Snowy Mountains have large numbers of excellent sites of all sizes, located not far from the Snowy 2.0 scheme. If we built reservoirs at the three largest, we’d have double the storage capacity we’d need to support a 100% Australian renewable energy system when everything is electrified and there are no fossil fuels. That’s because the amount of storage needed to support a clean grid is actually quite modest.

In New South Wales, Lakes Pindari, Wyangala, Windamere, Burrendong and Chaffey all have attractive bluefield possibilities, and could support the state government’s new renewable energy zones.
Canberra’s main water supply dams, Cotter and Googong, could both host pumped hydro.
Victoria could support its major planned offshore wind farms with storage close enough to the coast, in places like Tarago, Maroondah, Nillahcootie, Rocky Valley, Upper Yarra and Thomson.
To store Queensland’s vast solar and wind wealth, you could have pumped hydro at Teemburra, Eungella, Cressbrook, Tinaroo and others as well as the two schemes at Borumba and Pioneer-Burdekin.
Tasmania is already at 100% renewable energy based on its wealth of hydroelectricity. Many of these facilities could host pumped hydro too and back up Victorian solar and wind when the new Marinus Link undersea transmission cables are completed.
What about Western Australia? There are a few options, but not nearly as many or as good as in the east. The pick of them are the Harvey, Brockman and Dandalup reservoirs near Perth. South Australia and the Northern Territory have some good options too.
You might see the word “dam” and think twice. But these aren’t the river-stopping megaprojects of old.
Pumped hydro doesn’t have to be on a river at all. None of the 5,500 potential greenfield or bluefield sites we’ve identified require new dams on major rivers.
What about resource use? Pumped hydro is a resource miser.
Water? For a 100% renewable grid, we’d need about three litres of water per person per day to fill the reservoir and offset evaporation. That’s about 20 seconds of your morning shower. Once full, the water can be used and reused for 50 years or more, with only top-ups to offset evaporation. Land? About three square metres of land per person would have to be submerged – the area of a double bed.
Two decades ago, people worried we’d have to invent new technologies to decarbonise. But the resurgence of pumped hydro suggests this fear was misguided. Older, proven technologies can do the job just fine.

The first figure looks at the profitability of batteries in the NEM over the past financial year and shows that Queensland provided the greatest opportunities for battery profits in FY22, followed by South Australia, New South Wales, and then Victoria.
The main drivers behind the high battery revenues in Queensland and South Australia are high energy price events allowing the battery to earn significant revenues over short-term price spike events.

One thing to note is that these results assume perfect price foresight. That is, the optimisation algorithm knows with certainty what future prices will be. Therefore, actual revenues are likely to be lower for an operational BESS (our analysis indicates that this reduction for perfect foresight is usually in the order of 10-20%).
Our BESS results show high energy arbitrage opportunities in Queensland (accounting for around 70%) due to price volatility in Queensland, with Victoria making the lowest revenue in the energy markets during the same time scale.

The second figure illustrates the contribution of daily operating profit to the annual total. If battery revenues were consistent throughout the year, we would expect the cumulative revenue line (blue) to be linear throughout the year.
However, we see that Queensland’s revenues for FY22 have been driven by a few price spike events, with 50% of revenues earned over 8% of the year. In our simulation, almost 10% of the year’s battery profit was earned on 1 February and 8 March, where the average wholesale price hit $14,500 (USD 9,289) on Feb. 1, between 6pm-7pm, and $11,600 between 5:30pm-7:30pm on March 8.
Looking at these charts, Queensland was best placed to earn significant operating profits in FY22.

Once complete, the lithium-ion grid-scale system is expected to provide back-up for an estimated 10,000 households and businesses in the historic mining region of Broken Hill.
The 50 MW Broken Hill battery will feature one hour of storage and will capture, store and distribute energy from surrounding wind and solar farms, including AGL’s 53 MW Broken Hill Solar Farm, improving the reliability of energy supply in Broken Hill, as well as providing storage and firming capacity to the National Energy Market (NEM).
United States-based technology provider and system integrator Fluence, which will deliver the battery in conjunction with its consortium partner Valmec, said the project will feature the latest-generation technology and offer market-leading functionality.
Fluence said the battery system will be permanently set to grid-forming mode, resisting changes in network voltage and frequency and providing synthetic inertia through the ‘Virtual Machine Mode’ in the Fluence software and controls system.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which has provided a $14.84 million grant to enable the construction of the battery, said the battery’s capabilities will be tested in what it describes as “some of the most challenging conditions” on the NEM.

ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said he expects the Broken Hill battery to demonstrate the ability of large-scale batteries to be equipped with grid-forming inverters to improve system strength and facilitate higher penetrations of variable renewable energy generation at the lowest cost.
“As Australia’s electricity system switches to higher rates of renewables it will be increasingly important to deliver storage solutions that have the capabilities to stabilise the grid,” Miller said.
“AGL’s Broken Hill battery allows us to test advanced inverter technology in some of the most challenging conditions for the grid, while also improving system security and stability in the region.”
Fluence Australia general manager Achal Sondhi said the Broken Hill battery, the first project the company is delivering to AGL after signing a framework agreement in 2021 to supply up to 1 GW of grid-scale battery storage, is a “pioneering project” for the industry.
“We are excited to bring our latest product, proven technology and more than 14 years of global deployment experience to support the energy transition in Australia,” he said.
The Broken Hill battery is to be built on industrial land about six kilometres southeast of the city centre. The battery, which will connect to the grid via TransGrid’s Broken Hill substation, is expected to be completed by early 2023.
The project is expected to provide up to 50 jobs for engineers, tradespeople and other contractors during construction.

AGL energy hubs general manager Travis Hughes said the project highlights the company’s commitment to investing in battery-based energy storage in Australia and is an important milestone towards AGL achieving its 5 GW target of wind, battery, pumped hydro and other low-carbon firming projects by 2030.
Australia’s largest energy generator-retailer, AGL earlier this year announced it plans to have up to 12 GW of new generation and firming capacity in place before 2036. This includes an interim target to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by the end of the decade.
“The new Broken Hill battery is another exciting step for AGL, with the battery playing a crucial role in supporting renewable energy supply and ensuring communities in western New South Wales have access to reliable energy,” Hughes said.
“AGL has been part of the Broken Hill community since 2015 through the Silverton Wind Farm and Broken Hill Solar Plant and we are proud to continue to deliver renewable power to households and businesses in the area.”

KU Leuven researchers in Belgium have created a hydrogen panel that directly converts water vapor from the air into hydrogen gas, with the help of sunlight. They claim it produces 250 litres of hydrogen per day, at an efficiency of 15%. They are developing it under the Solhyd project, which is now in a transition phase from research to spinoff.
In a nutshell, hydrogen panels are modules that use solar energy to split water molecules and produce hydrogen gas. This means only the most arid places on Earth are too dry for hydrogen panels to work efficiently. They are akin to classical solar modules, but instead of an electric cable, they are connected via gas tubes.
Specifically, electricity is produced by the top layer solar panel, with a system of tubes underneath, where the hydrogen is produced from water molecules extracted directly from the air using a membrane.
“Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with most commercial modern PV modules, which are directly plugged into our system. This way, we can benefit from the ongoing developments and cost reductions in the PV industry,” KU Leuven researcher Jan Rongé told pv magazine. “To further enhance this synergy, Solhyd hydrogen panels are compatible with common PV mounting structures.”
The researchers described the hydrogen panel as small-scale, modular, and ideal for decentralised production. They estimated that 20 of the panels could supply electricity and heat for a well-insulated house with a heat pump all winter long. When installed alongside a solar thermal collector and traditional solar panels, hydrogen panels could help heat homes and provide electricity throughout the year.
“The hydrogen panels themselves do not store hydrogen and work at very low pressure. This has several safety and cost benefits. The hydrogen is collected centrally from the hydrogen panel plant, and then compressed, if needed,” Rongé said. “Hydrogen can be stored indefinitely in compressed form. Of course, certain applications do not require compression, or will use other means of storage.”
Hydrogen produced by Solhyd panels can be used in a wide range of applications, including mobility.
“In the shorter term, we are mostly targeting mid-sized applications, such as backup power, logistics, heavy transport, but also providing energy in the Global South,” said Rongé. “Later, you could think of anything from large scale ammonia production down to small-scale off-grid systems.”
The researchers said they foresee a similar system-price cost curve like the one seen in PV, and noted that they use non-precious materials to keep the hydrogen panels affordable. They have tested several prototypes since the project launch in 2011 and are ready to launch industrial production of hydrogen panels.
In September, the Solhyd project moved from the university labs to a new 350 square-meter production space close to the Belgian town of Leuven, where pilot production lines were established with the help of Flemish government funding. Initially, the team will produce a few dozen hydrogen panels for small-scale pilot projects. But by 2026, the team expects to scale up production to 5,000 panels a year.
“At this moment we expect that the product will be commercially available from 2026 onwards,” Rongé said. “When we achieve mass production, the price will be close to that of PV modules today.”

Scientists from research institutions across China have developed a model to evaluate the impact of rooftop PV on the energy use of residential buildings and their surrounding air temperatures during heatwaves. They revealed their findings in “Thermal and energy benefits of rooftop photovoltaic panels in a semi-arid city during an extreme heatwave event,” which was recently published in Energy and Buildings.
The study assesses the impact of rooftop PV arrays of varying energy efficiencies on mid-rise residential buildings. In particular, it investigates the impact on air conditioning use and surrounding urban temperatures. The researchers conducted the study in northeastern China, in a semi-arid area that was hit by an extreme heat wave in 2018.
They handled the numerical evaluation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, coupled with building effect parameterisation (BEP) and building energy model (BEM).
“Forced by the atmospheric conditions on the lowest level of the WRF model, the system computes the surface momentum, heat, humidity and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes induced by the underlying urban surface and feeds back these fluxes to the atmospheric dynamic governing equations,” said the researchers.
The academics analysed 12 simulations with different percentages of rooftop coverage and panel conversion efficiency against a control case. They assumed that the PV arrays were installed in parallel and at a certain height away from the roof. It was also assumed that every building in the city used an air-conditioning system during the modelled heatwave conditions.
The control case had an air-conditioning system installed, but no rooftop PV. The 12 scenarios consist of rooftop PV coverage levels of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, with conversion efficiencies of 10%, 20%, and 30%.
The results showed that an increase in covered area and conversion efficiency contributed to strong cooling effects. Rooftops with 100% PV coverage and energy efficiency of 30% could lower air temperatures by 0.4 C to 0.7 C. The combination reduced air-conditioning energy consumption by 14.74%.
“Such results indicate that the cities with a lower albedo and emissivity could benefit more from [rooftop PV] implementation in urban heat mitigation, along with an increasing urban effective albedo,” said the researchers.
Based on the 12 scenarios, the average daily cooling energy consumption reduction ranged between 1.29 MWh and 6.58 MWh per square kilometre. That represented an energy reduction of 2.89% to 14.74 %, relative to the control scenario. The 25% rooftop coverage and 10% efficiency scenario showed negligible thermal impacts, “suggesting a minimal threshold of [rooftop PV] coverage in terms of improving thermal environment,” the researchers concluded.
