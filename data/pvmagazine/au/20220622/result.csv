The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) announced the news today after taking the dire step of suspending the spot market last Wednesday.
Once market pricing has been restored, AEMO says it will monitor the conditions in the National Electricity Market (NEM) for 24 hours before making a final decision to formally lift the market suspension.
Before fully lifting the suspension, AEMO CEO Daniel Westerman said AEMO would expect to see:
Should these conditions be met, the suspension may soon lift entirely.
“By removing these conditions, we hope that the market will return to a normal bidding and dispatch situation – allowing the market to operate without major AEMO interventions and manual management of generation,” Westerman said.
AEMO also noted the return of 4000 MW of generation capacity, including several large thermal generators which had been unexpectedly offline due to failures, had eased the pressure on the electricity market.
The energy ministers from the states and territories in the National Energy Market, including New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, have been briefed.
The operator did, however, note the situation remains “dynamic,” saying it will continue to monitor reserve conditions across all regions.

The NSW government has allocated $1.2 billion to fast-track priority transmission and energy storage projects, an announcement it made earlier this month. It is the state government’s single biggest investment in renewable energy infrastructure to date and the funds aim to unlock massive investments in the electricity system and support the state’s renewable energy zones.
This pledge remains the centrepiece of the budget in terms of energy, though the budget yesterday pledged a further $130 million for a ‘Critical Minerals Activation Fund’ to encourage critical minerals mining for technologies like batteries.

There is also a $500 million commitment to deliver on its fast rail vision as well as $218.9 million over the next seven years to support moving its bus fleet to zero emissions technology.
“This investment includes funding of $84 million to enable transition planning, including electrical grid upgrades at 11 Transport for NSW bus depots,” Kean said. “Transitioning the entire fleet of buses will reduce Transport for NSW’s emissions by 78%, reduce noise on our streets, improve air quality and ensure our commuters enjoy a smoother ride,” he added.
Differing starkly from his recently ousted federal colleagues, Kean has spoken often and openly about the importance of sustainability, saying the Liberal party’s conservative tendency should refer not simply to economic and cultural conservatism but environmental conservation.
“We are on track to reduce our emissions by 50% by 2030, on 2005 levels, and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,” Kean said.
“These commitments are not just about avoiding more record bushfires, droughts and floods, but also about underwriting our prosperity as our trading partners go to the green goods of the future.”
Queensland’s Labor government has also linked the energy transition to prosperity, with treasurer Cameron Dick saying the budget “backs Queensland’s position as an energy powerhouse… unlocking our renewable future.”
Most notably, the Queensland budget has upped the royalties it takes from coal companies as prices for fossil fuels soar. 
The government’s decade long freeze on coal mining royalty rates ended this year, with the treasurer saying the structure for coal royalties was “not fit for purpose.”
The new increased tax rates are expected to generate $2.6 billion over the next four years.

The government has also set aside a total of $48 million to progress two pumped hydro projects, a commitment announced earlier this month.
Just shy of $80 million has been allocated to help diversify the state’s resources sector, which is fossil heavy, moving it towards the new economy minerals sector.
“Exploration is the lifeblood of new resources projects and jobs, and its essential we continue to support exploration, including with free access to first-rate geological data,” Scott Stewart, Queensland’s Minister for Resources said.
In total, the government said its 2022-23 budget delivers more than $2 billion for large-scale storage, renewable energy projects and generation and transmission investment, though this total seems to build on previous pledges and schemes. 
An additional $10 million will be invested over two years to support the Queensland Microgrid Pilot Fund, offering regional and remote communities clean energy and independence.

The Australian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Partnership, as it’s named, will see the companies invest US$200 million (AU$285 million) to “accelerate the establishment of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia.”
The agreement was signed by Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury in Doha at the International Air Transport Association annual general meeting (AGM).
The Qantas Group has committed to using 10% SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030, but said it is currently sourcing it from overseas. 
“Due to the lack of a local commercial-scale SAF industry, Australia is currently exporting millions of tonnes of feedstock every year, such as canola and animal tallow to be made into SAF in other countries,” Qantas said in its statement.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are biofuels which, unlike hydrogen, would not require substantial alterations to existing aircraft, meaning any developments would be easily implementable. SAFs and what’s known as “renewable diesel” are made from a range of alternate oils, fats and grease, such as cooking oil and waste animal fats.
Biofuels have already been trialled by major airlines and has been used in commercial flying as early as 2008.
The aviation industry claims it could reduce its emissions by 80% by finding sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel.
Qantas and Airbus say their partnership will see them invest in locally developed and produced SAF and feedstock initiatives. “Projects will have to be commercially viable and meet a strict set of criteria around environmental sustainability,” Qantas added.
The partnership is initially for five years with options to extend. Qantas’ financial contribution to the partnership includes AU$50 million previously committed to research and development of SAF in Australia back in 2019.
On the other end of the alternate fuels, Australian startup Aviation H2, owned by Liberty Energy Capital, is pursuing hydrogen.
The company on Wednesday sent out an update saying it is still aiming to have Australia’s first hydrogen-powered plane in the sky midway through 2023.

The test engines it is acquiring for modification to run on hydrogen are set to arrive in the coming five weeks, with Aviation H2’s Director and Principal Engineer, Dr Helmut Mayer, saying it will use these as a proof of concept for their method of converting jet planes to carbon-free fuel.
It’s worth noting, however, that Aviation H2’s owner, Liberty Energy Capital, doesn’t seem to be committed to green, renewable hydrogen and owns stakes in a number of companies seeking to produce hydrogen from biomass (essentially wood and other organic matter).
Biomass is not zero emissions technology and its label as such has been hotly contested globally, which also seems relevant for the pursuit of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs).
Back to Aviation H2, it says its strategic partner and specialist charter flight operator FalconAir is currently in the process of ensuring the test engines meet its requirements.
“Once the test flight is successful in the middle of 2023, Aviation H2 will have a patentable method for modifying aircraft,” it said.
Following this, its plan it to “quickly seek to certify and commercialise this product” via a planned public listing on a major exchange in Q4 2023.
(Aviation H2 is entirely owned by Liberty Energy Capital Pty Ltd, an Australian investment firm with “significant positions” in 18 renewable energy companies, including H2X Global, Patriot Hydrogen, Sweetman Renewables, Verdant Earth Technologies, Port Anthony Renewables Limited, and more. On its website, Liberty Energy Capital say it is “100% owned by Sirius Capital Pty Ltd, itself owned by a group of Family Office’s”. Strange grammar and punctuation aside, family offices usually refers to private wealth management advisory firms that serve ultra-high-net-worth individuals.)

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/22/rio-tintos-flashy-new-mine-powered-by-34-mw-of-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"JUNE 22, 2022",Rio Tinto’s flashy new mine powered by 34 MW of solar ,"Mining giant Rio Tinto has officially opened its Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (WA). The company is calling Gudai-Darri, located on Banjima Country, its most technologically advanced iron ore mine in the region, with a capacity of 43 million tonnes each year. 
The mine boasts all sorts of Q-Branch-style gadgets, from autonomous trucks, trains and drills, to a digital replica of the processing plant complete with interactive 3D environment for virtual reality training. However, the flashiest technology has to be the site’s 34 MW solar farm. 
Consisting of 83,000 panels the solar farm will provide one-third of the electricity needs of the mine, and is expected to be completed in August 2022. 

Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Simon Trott said the company had “worked closely with both the Banjima and Yindjibarndi People through the planning and development stages of Gudai-Darri and we look forward to partnering with them into the future to ensure the project achieves significant social and economic benefits.” 
Of course, it is not surprising that the company is on its best behaviour after it destroyed two 46,000-year-old sacred Indigenous sites in the Juukan Gorge back in 2020. Perhaps the only surprising thing is that Rio Tinto has been allowed to continue mining at all. 
Trott described Gudai-Darri as Rio Tinto’s first greenfield mine in the Pilbara in more than a decade. 
WA’s minister for mines, petroleum and energy, Bill Johnston, attended the opening ceremony, saying he was “impressed by Rio Tinto’s innovation and sustainability; this is a prototype of the mine of the future. Once the new solar farm is complete it will be able to power one-third of Gudai-Darri’s operational needs with renewable energy.” 
Johnston added that the solar farm will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 90,000 tonnes a year, equal to the emissions produced by 6,000 Australian households annually. 
WA Premier Mark McGowan said “Western Australia offers a stable investment environment – we have a strong economy, highly-skilled workforce, and a world-class mineral resources backed by industry-leading mining and logistics infrastructure. This means our state is well-placed for the future.” 
Rio Tinto has promised to develop a one gigawatt solar and wind power operation in the Pilbara, with plans to develop green steel. The company has also promised 4 GW of renewables with firming for its Queensland projects.

Alsym Energy has emerged from stealth mode to introduce a battery storage solution that will provide the performance of lithium-ion batteries at a fraction of the cost, and without the inherent risk of fire. While we know that the cathode is primarily manganese oxide, the anode is a different metal oxide, and the electrolyte is water-based, the company has not yet disclosed the exact battery chemistry. It has indicated, however, that the battery uses no lithium, cobalt or nickel to avoid the problems associated with material supply and cost.
The company said it expects the batteries to cost less than half of current lithium-based batteries. An added benefit is that the batteries are easier to recycle because of the use of non-toxic materials.
“We’re seeing global competition to bring new batteries to market. Most companies are focused primarily on performance and put little thought into also making their batteries safer and more cost-effective – especially for the developing world where consumers are more price-sensitive,” said Nitin Nohria, PhD, chairman of Alsym Energy’s board of business advisors and former Dean of the Harvard Business School. “The team at Alsym Energy is working to ensure that their batteries not only meet performance expectations at reduced cost, but also avoid most of the supply chain challenges associated with lithium-based technologies.”
Founded in 2015, Alsym raised US$32 million (AU$46 million) to date from investors including Helios Climate Ventures. The company’s team of scientists and product developers, based in Massachusetts, is currently developing a 500 kWh prototype manufacturing facility. Alsym said its batteries can be manufactured in existing lithium-ion battery factories with little to no retrofitting required and without the need for expensive dry rooms, fire locks, and solvent recovery systems.
Alsym has partnered with an automaker based in India in a joint effort to develop the batteries for EVs. The automaker is expected to contract with Alsym to supply a minimum of 3 GWh of battery systems annually, providing that key performance levels are being met. Alsym said it is in discussion with marine shipping and electric two-wheeler companies to develop similar partnerships.
