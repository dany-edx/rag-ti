The study will include assessing how day-ahead markets combined with balancing markets, similar to markets in parts of the US and Europe, could drive more bulk storage.
The university team will also investigate market structures for new system services such as inertia, and “study the risk of market manipulation by owners of storage assets.”
While Australia’s pipeline of grid-scale battery storage projects has ballooned in the past years, the batteries operating today tend to make the bulk of their income through Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets. Such uncertain revenue streams don’t tend to sit comfortably with institutional investors, so finding new market designs is vital to boosting investment interest. 
“Services from battery storage are not valued clearly at present, and this exciting research will reveal ways in which markets can better reflect their value to guide investment,” Chairman of the Monash Grid Innovation Hub, Professor Tony Marxsen, said.
Numerous experts have highlighted this issue, with Enosi founder and CEO, Steve Hoy, noting the current market design does not properly differentiate between technologies. “We need incentives to fill the gaps, not just more solar and that’s where I think the wheels are falling off in the current schemes,” he told pv magazine Australia.
The Victoria Energy Policy Centre has advocated Australia introduce a Renewable Electricity Storage Target (REST) scheme, following closely the design of the existing Renewable Energy Target scheme.
Monash has not given a timeframe for the study’s completion.

The median premium paid for energy efficient houses in 2022 was $125,000 or 17.1%.

Moreover, houses with those features sold faster and were more often viewed online, the report found. Domain chief of research and economics, Nicola Powell, noted energy efficient homes also tend to be newer, contributing to the premium.
The number of solar houses on the market has also risen, with 101,383 properties listed in the 12 months to May, up from 80,000 in the same period to 2020, according to analysis from real estate agency Ray White.
Properties featuring battery storage have grown far faster, albeit from a lower base. Ray White recorded 3366 properties in 2022, up from 1819 in 2020.
The number of off-grid homes for sale in 2022 was 1362 compared to 809 in the 2020 period.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/26/rules-changed-to-allow-multiple-installers-to-complete-jobs/,"LEGAL,POLICY,QUALITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 26, 2022",Rules changed to allow multiple installers to complete jobs,"The Clean Energy Regulator, the Commonwealth government agency responsible for overseeing Australia’s rooftop solar schemes, will now permit installations to be completed by different installers, as long as each installer is accredited and the agency is notified.
From April 1, the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) began requiring installers to take “selfie photographs” to prove they were present at the beginning, middle and end of each job. This stepped up compliance regime was in response to a government review of the integrity of the rooftop solar sector in Australia published last year.
Whether the implications of this photo proof has led to today’s announcement isn’t clear but CER did note when it is “not reasonable” for the same Clean Energy Council (CEC) accredited installer to complete the job they began, it can ultimately be signed off by another accredited installer.
This change is accompanied by set of conditions, outlined by CER:

CER has been ramping up its prosecutions of installers fraudulently creating Small-scale Technology Certificates, or STCs, which form the basis of what is effectively Australia’s rooftop solar subsidy. 
Just last week, it announced Canberra installer B and J Finnigan Pty Ltd (trading as A1 Electrical) had been convicted and fined $9,000 after it was discovered its sole director, Bradley Finnigan, was overseas at the time he said he was supervising installations.
In May, CER also executed search warrants on three Perth addresses connected to a WA installation company. The search warrants were part of its investigation into whether the company had fabricated information about who installed almost 550 solar panel installations.
The crackdown is part of CER’s takeover as the sole regulator of the sector, bringing with it a new suite of oversight tools.
CER is also in the process of finding a new accreditation body for the solar industry. Before March 31, 2023, it will open up applications to decide who will take over responsibility for solar accreditation from CEC.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/26/can-renewables-curtailment-be-rethought-as-a-good-thing/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 26, 2022",Can renewables curtailment be rethought as a good thing?,"From pv magazine USA
Power curtailment is often viewed as a limiting factor of renewable energy, as intermittent cycles of generation can lead to excess electricity on the grid during peak production. Curtailment is the deliberate reduction in output that otherwise could have been produced, and typically occurs when supply exceeds demand.
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 1.5 million MWh of utility-scale solar in 2020, representing 5% of total production, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Solar is by far the most dominant source of energy that undergoes curtailment in the state. EIA said 94% of power curtailments in 2020 involved solar energy.
While curtailment is often viewed as a bad thing, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) said based on its research and modelling of the grid of the future, it may be time to reframe our thinking about power curtailment.
“(Curtailment) can happen not just in cases of oversupply but also when there’s a lack of system flexibility, which could mean congested transmission lines, other power plants being unable to reduce their output safely or economically, or other constraints,” said Kerrin Jeromin, NREL correspondent in a video on the subject.
“Think about it like buying a cable package for your TV—or a subscription to any of the streaming services out there. Buying that package knowing you can’t possibly watch all of the thousands of programs available to you isn’t all that different from building more renewable power plants, knowing we won’t always be able to use all the energy they produce. The point is, you have it for the shows you can’t miss, and the package gets you the best value in the end. We’re going to need a lot of wind and solar in a super-high-renewable future. And the best strategy might be to max out our renewable energy “package,” so we have enough power when we really need it, and get comfortable with curtailing some of it sometimes, to maximise its value at other moments.” National Renewable Energy Laboratory
Power curtailment is nothing new, as the grid has always had more power plants than are used. It is essential to reserve backup power for times of peak demand to keep the lights on. Currently, solar energy is serving that role in Texas, where fossil fuels are struggling to meet demand during summer heat peaks.
Curtailment comes with a particularly negative connotation because it represents lost opportunity. But as the cost of grid-scale renewables continues to decline, so does the cost of that lost opportunity.
“Curtailed electricity can be used to help make the grid more flexible and reliable, making these solar and wind systems more valuable in the end. It’s happening today: Xcel Energy can actively curtail wind generation to support reliability in its US power systems. And First Solar’s large-scale PV plant in Chile uses curtailment as a tool to help the grid respond to changing system needs, letting grid operators turn the system’s output up and down as needed,” said Jeromin.
NREL concluded that creating regulations that discourage curtailment could create barriers for renewable energy buildout, thereby limiting the many benefits it can offer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/26/new-kind-of-black-silicon-shows-improved-light-trapping-properties/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,RUSSIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 26, 2022",New kind of black silicon shows improved light-trapping properties,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Institute of Automation and Control Processes in Russia have developed a novel kind of black silicon that they say has a higher near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and is better adjusted to absorb solar irradiance in the 1100-1800 nm range.
“We simply added one another absorbing layer atop black silicon, which replicates its morphology to some extent,” the research’s corresponding author, Alexander Shevlyagin, told pv magazine. “We have already demonstrated solar cell operation of a silicon-silicide heterojunction without surface texturing in our previous work.”
In the paper “Mg2Si is the new black: Introducing a black silicide with >95% average absorption at 200–1800 nm wavelengths,” published in Applied Surface Science, the Russian research team explained that the new absorber layer was made of magnesium silicide (Mg2Si), which is an inorganic compound consisting of magnesium and silicon with an energy bandgap 1.5 eV. “Mg2Si is a Si-compatible optical material with superior absorbance from the ultraviolet (UV) to NIR regions compared to bare silicon,” it explained. “It has already demonstrated photovoltaic perspectives as homo-/heterojunction photodetectors and solar cells.”
The researchers implemented what they called the “silicidation” of the black silicon through a low temperature and scalable process that doesn’t require an ultra-high vacuum and can be conducted by thermal evaporation and magnetron sputtering. They fabricated the black silicon substrate for black magnesium silicide preparation via reactive ion etching of a crystalline silicon wafer and then used used vacuum evaporation to cover the substrate surface with the Mg2Si layer.
“The reflectance spectrum of the Mg2Si covered b-Si nanocones demonstrates strong NIR antireflection performance when compared to starting b-Si surface,” the academics emphasised. “Our measurements confirm averaged reflection in the 200-1800 nm spectral range of 3.7% from black magnesium silicide surface, which is 5 times lower with respect to 17.6% of the bare black silicon.”
According to them, the material’s improved light trapping properties should be attributed to the complex hierarchical nanocone-nanoflake
structure realised in the new compound, which resulted in the marked increase of both NIR antireflection and absorption properties. “NIR photons after being back-scattered within b-Si nanocones are effectively absorbed by Mg2Si possessing much higher intrinsic absorption coefficient over the wide spectral range,” they further explained.
The group called the new wide-band black material “black silicide” and said it may also be used for NIR optical absorbers and highly sensitive NIR devices. “The results obtained propose a simple technology to further enhanthe photoelectric conversion efficiency of the silicon-silicide tandem solar cells using a black silicon instead of pyramid-like Si surface textures as a platform for silicidation with other environment-friendly and silicon compatible silicides,” they concluded.
