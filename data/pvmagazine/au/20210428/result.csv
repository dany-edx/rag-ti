Unpopular as that fact may be, it makes Burwood Brickworks, an undertaking of Frasers Property, all the more important. To attempt to transform from the poster child of the problem into a poster child of the solution is a brave undertaking. It reframes not only what’s possible, and also what’s desirable.
Burwood Brickworks, in Melbourne’s east, is the first ever retail space to ever go after the Living Building Challenge Certification, which is the the world’s most advanced measure of sustainability in the built environment. It is also the first retail centre to ever achieve it, albeit partially at this stage. (Full certification can only be achieved after 12 months of independent testing and was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is expected in late 2022.) 
Frasers Property
The ultimate goal of the Living Building Challenge is to create a space that has a net positive impact on the environment, to build something regenerative rather than destructive. To certify this, aspects of the building are assessed in seven areas, referred to as ‘petals’ – invoking the imagery of a flower as a culmination of the elegant, circular design of nature.
They include:
These metrics speak to a mode of climate action that is often downplayed because it requires nothing short of a complete revision of society’s central values. In a culture unashamedly governed by profits, the Living Building Challenge’s framework asks us to draw value from broader, more primal arenas. Beauty, equity, place, health – these are all vital aspects of not only buildings, but society more generally, yet all routinely made subservient to efficiency.

Good architects understand that how a space is designed inspires particular ways of thinking, behaving. Yet the demand for quick turn arounds and cut costs has left us with cities which are largely populated by buildings which could be described as slapdash at best, monstrous at worst.
When was the last time you went into a beautiful mall? I, for one, don’t think I ever have. Yet the enforced thoughtfulness of Living Building Challenge means in Burwood Brickworks careful attention has been paid to aspects that make a building not only better for the environment, but better for the people who move within it.
The shopping centre’s has as extensive 1 MW solar array is spread across the rooftop, equating to 3,260 individual solar panels. It is also home to a 250 KW battery (though the chemistry is unknown). This energy solution, combined with off-site renewable technologies, provides all the centres’ energy requirements with a surplus.
The centre also has a 500,000-litre water tank which sits in the underground car park. Rainwater is funnelled from the rooftop and the carpark to the tanks, and is then treated onsite for use in the centre. Treated water is used for toilet flushing, use in washing machines, cooling towers, car-washing and to irrigate on-site urban agriculture.
Frasers Property
The centre, which is 13,000 square metres, also incorporates a 2,000 square metre rooftop urban farm which is operated by acre Farm & Eatery and provides produce for its adjacent restaurant. Naturally, the centre also has composting facility on site.
Every material used in the construction of the building was assessed, sustainably sourced and salvaged materials have been used where possible. Likewise, no materials used in the construction of building contain chemicals listed on the International Living Future Institute Red List.
On Saturday, Frasers Property and its Burwood Brickworks achieved official Living Building Challenge Certification for the built aspects of the project – its Place, Materials, Health & Happiness, and Beauty Petals. The remaining three aspects – Water, Energy, and Equity – relate to the centre’s operation over time, and these have been impacted by Covid-19 trading restrictions and lockdowns. Before they can be award, these Petals must be independently audited based on 12 months of operational data. 
Assuming an undisrupted 12 months of ‘typical’ operation, Frasers Property is on track to achieve full Living Building Challenge (LBC) Certification by late 2022.

“This was a benchmark-altering aspiration that we knew would push us, and the industry, to create buildings that deliver a net benefit to the environment and the community. Reaching Petal Certification was certainly challenging and the pathway to achieve the remaining three Petals, and therefore full Living Building Challenge Certification, will continue to challenge us, as it should,” CEO of Frasers Property Australia, Anthony Boyd, said.
“The vision for Burwood Brickworks was to redefine sustainability in retail by challenging ourselves in new and uncomfortable ways. It meant exposing ourselves to possible failure, inviting new levels of scrutiny, balancing commercial feasibility, challenging our project partners to take the journey with us, and investing time and resources into working with our tenants, so they could play their essential role.
“We’re grateful to our family of retailers at Burwood Brickworks for embracing the LBC. For some retailers, the requirements of the LBC necessitated a complete re-imagining of their fit out and operations.”
For instance, the Woolworths in the centre has had to enclose all of its fridges as an energy conservation mechanism – just one example of the way tenants have had to shift their approach to earn a place in the project.
Frasers Property
Regenerative building is a vital though often under appreciated tier of climate action. Equally, it is paramount to creating better, more beautiful cities and urban landscapes – ones which connect people to place rather than alienate them from it.
Frankly, language of mitigation, cuts, and reduction is uninspiring. Worse yet, it insists on a binary between humans and environment by suggesting  the environment’s gain is our loss.
Such an approach is not only detrimental, it’s false. Living more sustainability can and should mean living more beautifully, living in ways that answer urgent human needs including connection to place, to community, to beauty. It feeds our urge for self-sufficiency and autonomy, our desire to live healthily and happily and fairly.
The Burwood Brickwork is not only a massive undertaking and achievement logistically, it is also an equally important feat philosophically. It asks us to broaden the metrics with which we measure the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/28/error-in-solar-tax-calculations-may-leave-homes-with-no-export-profits-analysis-finds/,"FINANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 28, 2021","Error in ‘solar tax’ calculations may leave homes with no export profits, analysis finds","In March, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) published a draft determination proposing networks be allowed to charge households exporting solar energy into the grid in times of peak supply.
The AEMC insisted the charge would be negligible and would only cut the profits of solar-fitted homes slightly. However, a new report has found the impacts of the rule change, dubbed a ‘solar tax,’ could be far greater than the Commission outlined. The AEMC have responded to the report, telling pv magazine Australia the new analysis fails to consider the full picture.
Undertaken by Professor Bruce Mountain of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, the analysis found that after deducting the proposed network usage charge many solar homes are unlikely to obtain any payment from surplus solar energy exported to the grid. In Victoria, the only outlier, solar homes are left with a profit of just $32 annually.
The report goes on to claim the AEMC has made an “error” in its calculations by massively underestimating the injection price of solar exports. In its draft determination, the AEMC suggested the injection price for solar exports would be around 2 cents per kWh. However, the analysis suggests it will probably sit between 4 cents per kWh and possibly up to 4.9 cents per kWh.
“Using the corrected injection price means that the typical (median) solar home in Victoria can expect to receive just $32 per year for the surplus solar production that it feeds in to the grid after the revised regulated minimum feed-in rate takes effect from the middle of the year. For a typical 5 kW solar home in Sydney, the correct network injection charge increases from the $100 per year that the AEMC claims, to $240 per year,” Mountain writes.
“Much lower retailer feed-in rates in all regions of the NEM can be expected soon reflecting large declines in wholesale prices. Taking account of the AEMC’s corrected network injection price and much lower retailer feed-in prices, it is likely that at this price the great majority of solar homes in the National Electricity Market will receive little or no income for the surplus solar production that they export to the grid.”
The AEMC’s rule change was initially designed to recover costs for infrastructure needed to accomodate two-way power flow, which is necessary for rooftop solar exports and other renewable energy sources. The new analysis, however, determines that networks networks may be able to charge up to ten times more than that needed to cover distributed energy integration costs.
The AEMC said it stands by its calculations, adding that they are based on detailed analysis.
Community group Solar Citizens have said the AEMC’s rule change will ultimately disincentivise solar at a time when the world desperately needs to decarbonise. 
“This new evidence shows us the AEMC has significantly underestimated how much millions of Australians will be affected by their proposed rule change,” Solar Citizens’ National Director, Ellen Roberts, said in response to the new analysis.
“With feed-in tariffs dropping all the time, this rule change will majorly impact the financial incentive for solar owners to provide cheap electricity for their neighbours to use.
“Now the AEMC wants to let big network companies decide how much solar owners get slogged. It’s not good enough.”

The drop amounted to lowest operational demand since 2002.
In fact, the first quarter saw record low average operational demand in the majority of the regions in the NEM, in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia.

Regional electricity spot prices fell massively, between 21% and 68% compared to the first quarter of 2020, reaching their lowest average since 2015.
The largest spot price reductions occurred in Victoria, falling from $79/MWh to $25/MWh, its lowest quarterly average since the first quarter of 2012.
New South Wales declined from $86/MWh to average $38/MWh, while Queensland averaged of $43/MWh.
Continuing the trend of final quarter of 2020, negative spot prices remained confined to the southern regions, with Victoria reaching record quarterly occurrences at 10.3%, and South Australia remaining what the AEMO described as “very high” at 16.8%.
“South Australia’s average daytime prices fell below zero consistently between 10am and 3:30pm (AEST) during the quarter, the first time in the NEM’s history. At the same time, persistently low electricity prices below their cost of generation required AEMO to direct South Australian gas-powered generations on for system security for a record 700% of the quarter,” the AEMO’s Chief Markets Officer, Violette Mouchaileh, said.
In South Australia, the average spot price during peak solar production was negative $12/MWh.

Increased renewable energy output coupled with reduced daytime electricity demand saw average Balancing Prices reduced in Western Australia from $56/MWh in the first quarter of 2020 to $47/MWh this quarter – the reduction was despite increased evening peak demand and a hot summer.
The state set a new record for minimum operation demand in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) on 14 March. Operational demand at this time dropped to 952 MW, 33 MW below the previous record, with estimated distributed PV output of 1,026 MW at the time.

GMG, which was recently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, has reached a research agreement with scientists from UQ’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) to build batteries for anything from watches to grid storage and everything in between, including phones, laptops, and electric vehicles (EVs). 
The UQ technology, which sees an aluminium ion battery paired with graphene electrodes, was designed by Prof Michael Yu, Xiaodan Huang and postdoctoral student Yueqi Kong as a way to make graphene into more efficient electrodes for powering batteries. The technology has already been patented and licensed by UQ commercialisation company, UniQuest.
Graphene 
Graphene is the wonder material of the age, both the thinnest and strongest material known to science, and, if that wasn’t enough, it is also a great conductor of electricity, better even than copper. Or at least, it would be the wonder material of the age if the so-called ‘Graphene Revolution’ promised less and delivered more. 
It was over a decade ago that scientists from the University of Manchester won the Nobel Prize for Physics thanks to some bog-standard sticky tape which proved to be the breakthrough in extracting graphene from everyday graphite. 

In essence, graphene is just good old carbon, but it is tessellated in such a way to produce a bogglingly strong bond between atoms. Of course, like anything with so much promise and hype, the ‘Graphene Revolution’ has taken longer than expected, but that is only because people don’t have much patience for the things they’ve been promised, especially when it is something as potentially ubiquitous as graphene. 
Nevertheless, UQ and GMG are not the only parties making progress. In March, scientists at China’s Dalian University of Technology and the University of Nebraska in the United States collaborated to fabricate a battery consisting of a pure aluminium anode, a graphene cathode, and an organic electrolyte. The batteries are described in the paper Ultra-fast charging in aluminium-ion batteries: electric double layers on active anode, published in Nature Communications.
And back in 2019, scientists at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) demonstrated a laser printing process that enables graphene supercapacitors to be embedded directly onto textiles, creating a fabric that can store energy and be integrated with a solar cell and used to power smart fabric applications.
Graphene battery technology 
“Testing showed rechargeable graphene aluminium ion batteries had a battery life of up to three times that of current leading lithium-ion batteries,” said AIBN Director Professor Alan Rowan, “and higher power density meant they charged up to 70 times faster.” 
AIBN has been working hard on the technology for several years, and the research team is excited to be shifting into a commercial prototype development stage, especially as the promise on the cards is more efficient and greener batteries. 
“The batteries are rechargeable for a larger number of cycles without deteriorating performance and are easier to recycle,” continued Rowan, “reducing potential for harmful metals to leak into the environment.” 
UniQuest CEO Dean Moss believes aluminium ion batteries with graphene electrodes “could transform the existing rechargeable battery market. Lithium-ion batteries demand the extraction of rare earth materials using large amounts of water and are processed with chemicals that can potentially harm the environment.” 
GMG CEO Craig Nicol agrees, noting that the possibility for the energy storage market included far-reaching benefits in safety, efficiency, sustainability, and an ability “to use local raw materials to manufacture battery cells at a competitive cost to replace imported lithium-ion cells is a massive opportunity for GMG and Australia to reduce supply chain risks and create local jobs.” 
UQ scientists were awarded a $390,000 grant over three years from the Australian Research Council’s Linkage Project in 2020 to develop graphene aluminium ion technology.

Twelve companies have formed the Hamburg Hydrogen Network (Wasserstoffverbund Hamburg), submitting an application under the EU-wide ‘important projects of common European interest’ (IPCEI) funding program, which would also allow for exemptions from the EU rules on state aid. The network is made up by Airbus, ArcelorMittal, Gasnetz Hamburg, GreenPlug, Hamburger Hafen und Logistik, Hamburg Port Authority, HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Shell, Vattenfall, and Wärme Hamburg.
“Financial support by the federal German government, under the IPCEI program, is necessary to implement this landmark interconnection project and close the price gap between green hydrogen and fossil solutions,” reads a statement released on Monday, explaining that the application includes nine projects. Shell, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Vattenfall and municipal company Wärme Hamburg are planning to produce hydrogen from wind and solar power at the Hamburg-Moorburg power plant site, deploying a scalable electrolyser with an initial output of 100 MW. Additionally, apart from logistics and mobility solutions, the application includes a waste-to-hydrogen project and the reconversion of ArcelorMittal’s Hamburg plant to climate-neutral steel production by 2030.
German gas grid operator Gascade and Dutch gas provider Gasunie have teamed up with energy companies RWE and Shell to step up collaboration on the AquaDuctus project, the “first German offshore hydrogen pipeline.” The companies expect commissioning in 2035. AquaDuctus is taking part in the IPCEI process of the German government. “The AquaDuctus pipeline will transport green hydrogen from the North Sea directly to the continent. It is part of the AquaVentus initiative, which plans to install 10 GW of electrolysis capacity for green hydrogen production from offshore wind power between Heligoland and the Dogger sand bank,” reads a note released on Monday. The AquaDuctus project will first undergo a feasibility study.
Siemens Energy and Germany-based industrial gases company Messer Group signed a cooperation agreement to collaborate on green hydrogen projects in the 5 MW to 50 MW range, for industrial and mobility applications. Within the framework of this agreement, Messer Ibérica has presented, to the Spanish government, three green hydrogen projects at the Tarragona chemical complex, the largest chemical park in Spain. The total electrolyser capacity is expected to total 70 MW. “We are focused on developing technologies that make our customers’ production processes safer, more efficient and eco-friendly, including clean hydrogen applications in industry and in mobility. Together with Siemens Energy, we will extend these advantages to industrial customers switching to green hydrogen produced by electrolysis,” Stefan Messer, owner and CEO of Messer Group, commented in the press release.
S&P Global Ratings published, last week, a report on the future of hydrogen, in which it singles out the sectors that will first embrace hydrogen: industrial gas, oil refining, chemical and, later, possibly, fertilisers. “Net zero commitments imply the full decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors such as steel but using hydrogen to do so would be extremely costly. We therefore see steelmakers’ credit quality as most at risk, since the sector’s profitability has been weak for years,” reads the note published on Thursday.
Dutch energy and commodity trading company Vitol acquired a 10% equity interest in Gen2 Energy, a Norwegian producer of green hydrogen. The company didn’t disclose the details of the investment. Gen2 Energy aims to use Norway’s surplus hydroelectric power to produce green hydrogen, targeting the European market. “Work at the company’s initial site, in the north of Norway, is under way and, once complete, it will have a capacity of at least 80 MW, producing 11.7kt per annum of green hydrogen. Simultaneously, Gen2 Energy is developing a second green hydrogen facility in the south west of Norway, with an eventual capacity of 300 MW,” the company said.
Norway-based service company Aibel and hydrogen company Nel ASA entered into a framework agreement to develop renewable hydrogen projects. The first collaboration effort will be the delivery of the 20 MW PEM hydrogen production plant to Iberdrola, which was announced at the beginning of the year. “This partnership is a long-term commitment,” Jon André Løkke, CEO of Nel ASA, commented in a statement released on Monday. Aibel is also active in Dogger Bank.
Brussels-headquartered materials technology company Umicore, and British mining company Anglo American, through its PGMs business Anglo American Platinum, announced a research and development collaboration agreement to develop PGM-based catalysts for liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) applications on fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and other mobile applications. “This catalyst technology has the potential to transform the way hydrogen can be stored and used to power FCEVs,” wrote Umicore in a press note published on Monday.
GH2, a developer of renewable hydrogen projects, and the Grand Port Maritime de Bordeaux, signed an agreement for the implementation of a €250 million renewable hydrogen production and conversion project in New Aquitaine. The project aims to produce up to 14,000 tons of renewable hydrogen per year. According to a note released on Thursday, it includes a 100 MWe alkaline electrolyser, two new, local, dedicated photovoltaic power plants, and an electrochemical plant. The project is located in the port area near Bordeaux, alongside the Garonne river.
South African integrated energy and chemical company Sasol, and Sonatrach Raffineria Italiana (SRI), a subsidiary of the national state-owned oil company of Algeria, formed a Temporary Association of Companies (ATI) to collaborate on developing hydrogen production projects in Sicily. “The petrochemical area of Syracuse can and must play a key role in the energy transition,” Rosario Pistorio, CEO of SRI, commented in a note released on Friday. According to the companies, Sicily could become an integrated hydrogen ecosystem, or ‘hydrogen valley.’
The Italian Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Association, which includes companies, research centres and universities, exceeded the 70-member threshold with a nearly 50% increase in members since the beginning of the year. “Making a common front and creating a unique network of collaboration is the only way to create a strong Italian supply chain, [a] leader also at international level,” Alberto Dossi, president of H2IT, commented in a note released on Monday.

Chinese solar module manufacturer Longi has added two new products to its Hi-MO4m panel series designed for distributed-generation applications.
The two modules have a 60-cell and a 72-cell design and add to the 66-cell panel previously launched by the company. Referring to its 60-cell, 66-cell and 72-cell modules, Longi stated: “The three products cover power ranges of 370-385 W, 410-420 W and 450-460 W, respectively, with a maximum efficiency of up to 21%, providing global DG clients with wider flexibility and choice.”
The 60-cell module, called Hi-MO4m LR4-60HPH, is available in seven versions, with wattages ranging from 350 W to 380 W and efficiencies of between 19.2% and 20.9%.
The panel is manufactured with 120 monocrystalline half-cut cells, measures 1,755×1,038x35mm, and weighs 19.5kg. The open-circuit voltage is between 40.1 V and 41.3 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 11.15 A to 11.69 A.
The 72-cell panel, called Hi-MO4m LR4-72HPH, is available in five versions with power ratings ranging from 430 W to 460 W and efficiency of between 19.8% and 21.2%. The open-circuit voltage is between 48.5 V and 49.7 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 11.31 A to 11.73 A. This product measures 2,094×1,038x35mm and weighs in at 23.3kg.
The maximum system voltage for both products is 1,500 V. They can be used with operating temperatures of between -40 degrees Celsius and 85 degrees Celsius and their operating temperature coefficient is -0.35% per degree Celsius. Both modules also feature an IP68 enclosure rating, 3.2mm coat tempered glass, and an anodised aluminium alloy frame.
They come with a 25-year linear power output guarantee, a 12-year product guarantee, and are said to be able to operate at 84.8% of their original performance after 25 years.
