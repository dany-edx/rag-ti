Aware has, according to media reports, made an initial commitment of $300 million to the platform but expects its investment to grow to up to $2 billion as more projects become ready for financing.
Aware portfolio manager Jired Zhou said the partnership’s planned investments will help diversify the super fund’s existing $2 billion portfolio of larger-scale wind and solar projects.
“We see tremendous opportunities in the renewable energy transition sector,” he said. “This platform will invest in a portfolio of smaller-scale, distributed renewable generation and storage assets which complement well with our existing utility scale renewable investments.”
Birdwood Energy Managing Partner Scott McGregor said the platform’s acquisition strategy will target late-stage developments, ready-to-build projects and equity investments in businesses to scale and accelerate distributed energy.
The project pipeline is expected to be composed of smaller-scale solar projects of between 30 MW to 100 MW fitted with battery energy storage systems. Birdwood said the scale of the platform is also likely to mean investing in some larger strategic projects.
Birdwood said the platform has already purchased two operating solar farms in South Australia that it is currently fitting with battery energy storage systems, and has another 10 solar and battery projects that are in development.
McGregor said the focus on small-scale solar and battery projects means the grid connection process can be streamlined, resulting in a more rapid deployment profile.
He also noted that Aware’s investment will allow it scale up the rollout of distributed energy which he expects will eventually deliver up to 60% of Australia’s future energy requirements.
“While this sector offers the cheapest, most secure and cleanest energy system, it does require investment at scale in order to achieve capital and operating efficiencies and hit our net zero targets,” he said.
“With Aware Super’s capital and support, we look forward to helping make Australia a world leader in the deployment of distributed energy resources.”
McGregor said the platform would service retail, commercial and industrial customers via offtake agreements.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/19/rec-rolls-out-new-470-w-rooftop-solar-panel-in-australia/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",REC rolls out new 470 W rooftop solar panel in Australia,"REC said the Alpha Pure-RX series, which is based on the company’s heterojunction solar cell technology (HJT), is the highest power class residential solar panel that it has yet produced with a power density of 226 W/m2.
The Alpha Pure-RX is available in three versions, with power ratings ranging from 450 W to 470 W, and efficiencies of 21.6% to 22.6%. The modules are made with 80 heterojunction, half-cut monocrystalline solar cells and have a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V.
The modules have open-circuit voltages ranging between 65.1 V and 65.6 V, short-circuit currents ranging from 8.81 A to 8.95 A, can operate within a temperature range of -40 C to 85 C, and have a power temperature coefficient of -0.24% per degree Celsius.
All three panels in the series measure 1,728 mm × 1,205 mm × 30 mm and weigh 23.2 kg. They feature a 3.2 mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, a black polymer backsheet, an anodized aluminium frame, and an IP68-rated junction box.
REC said the four-part junction box design makes the module a good performer in shady conditions and it is also designed to withstand weather extremes – including Australia’s hot climate.
“These panels perform better under low light and hot days offering higher power generation with a guaranteed power output of at least 92% at year 25,” the company said.
REC said the Alpha Pure-RX series will be showcased at the All-Energy conference in Melbourne next week when the manufacturer will also unveil its Alpha Pro M panel, a HJT solar panel targeted at commercial and industrial projects.
Gus Paviani, REC’s head of Asia Pacific and Japan, said the Alpha Pro M is the highest power class solar panel available in the market with a power output of up to 640 Wp and efficiencies of 21.8% to 22.9%.
“The REC Alpha family delivers top-quality, high-performance solar panels for homeowners, businesses and now for commercial and industrial project markets,” he said.
The manufacturer said the Alpha Pure-R panels are available to order now with the Alpha Pure-RX and Alpha Pro M panels expected to be available in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2024.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/19/unsw-student-team-to-push-for-change-in-world-solar-challenge/,"EV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,GERMANY,NEW SOUTH WALES,WORLD",CARRIE HAMPEL,"OCTOBER 19, 2023",UNSW student team to push for change in World Solar Challenge,"The Dutch solar-powered electric car team from Eindhoven University this week celebrated that its Stella Terra (off) road-legal solar car completed the North African test race, a stretch spanning from northern Morocco to the Sahara Desert.
The Stella Terra vehicle has a top speed of 145 km per hour, weighs 1,200 kilograms, and has a range of 710 km when there’s enough sun. The Eindhoven team said the vehicle achieved an average range of about 550 kms, depending on the surface, which included dry riverbeds, forest area, along steep mountain trails and loose desert sand.
The Eindhoven team was once a regular in Australia’s iconic Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, a biennial 3,000 km expedition from Darwin to Adelaide, and boasts four wins in the Cruiser class. But the team has this year chosen to focus on the development of its solar-powered off-road car.
Among the teams that will line up in the race this year is the University of New South Wales (UNSW). The team’s Sunswift 7 solar-powered electric car holds the world record for the fastest electric vehicle (EV) over 1,000 km on a single charge. The team will be seeking to better that when it lines up in this year’s edition of the race which commences in Darwin on Saturday.
The team’s most recent car design, the Sunswift 7, will compete in the Cruiser class, where once the Eindhoven team pushed them in competition. The Sunswift team must complete the three stages across 3,600 km using only the power of the sun.

The UNSW team has taken part in the epic race nine times, going back to 1996, but the team said it may be competing in the event for the last time with Richard Hopkins, Professor of Practice at UNSW, saying the race badly needs an update.
“The regulations for the World Solar Challenge have basically been the same for the past 20 years. Innovation and technology have moved on so much in that same period of time, but these regulations have not been re-aligned in the same way,” he said.
“We need to be able to explore new technologies. For example, we are only able to use silicon solar cells, but there are plenty of other technologies, such as gallium arsenide, that we are not allowed to utilise.”
“There are lots of different battery technologies emerging, as well as new motor technologies, in addition to what we are already planning for Sunswift 8 in terms of including hydrogen fuel cells.”
“I think it would be great to have more freedom because the world has moved on, and the World Solar Challenge regulations maybe need to move with the times as well.”
The world of electric cars is now vastly different to when the solar car race launched in 1987.  In the past five years, electric car sales have increased exponentially, going from just over two million EVs sold in 2018 – which included full hybrid vehicles that still primarily run on fossil fuels – to almost 11 million EVs sold globally, now primarily fully electric cars. There has been an exponential jump not only in EV sales but also in priorities for testing the boundaries of sustainable vehicles.
Solar panels for EVs are now a commercial element. Among others, the U.S. start-up Aptera Motors this year presented the ‘launch edition’ of its three-wheeled solar electric car, which the company plans to start producing by the end of 2023. The production launch version of the two-seater solar-powered electric car achieves a cW value of 0.13 and a range of 643 km.
Integrating photovoltaics into vehicle bodies has also moved forward. In August this year, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE showed a PV bonnet at the IAA Mobility car show in Germany, which has a rated output of 115 W and features 120 PERC shingle solar cells.
“We applied the solar cells to the hood panel of a car model that is frequently sold in Germany, interconnected them and laminated them with film,” explained Martin Heinrich, coordinator for PV mobility at Fraunhofer ISE. “To achieve this, the lamination process was optimised carefully to minimise air pockets, avoid wrinkling of the film module, which can occur due to the curved surface area, and to maintain the overall integrity of the hood structure.”

To make the most of the available surface area on the hood, the Fraunhofer ISE team constructed their prototypes using a selection of IBC, PERC shingle, and TOPCon shingle solar cells. The researchers say, in principle, any solar cell technology can be used.
“The technology could also be applied to the metal roofs of vehicles, which would have the advantage of being much lighter than photovoltaic roofs made of glass,” said Harry Wirth, Power Solutions Division Director at Fraunhofer ISE. “Expanding the technical possibilities for integrating photovoltaics into vehicle shells will appeal to more and more customers; there is still a lot of potential to be tapped here.”
In Australia, Hopkins would like to see students involved with the Sunswift project at the cutting edge of automotive design and construction and showcase that level of expertise on the world stage.
“What disappoints me is that mainstream car companies at times are now using more advanced technologies than we are,” he said. “We should be the ones ahead of the curve. Those companies should be looking at us and trying to understand what our amazing young, inspirational students are doing.”
Hopkins is hoping to enter discussions with both event organisers and other teams to discuss the possibility of updating the rules. The question is whether the race can maintain its ethos of helping to push the limits of technological innovation.
Until more adaptive frameworks for cars in the race are developed, the Australian solar electric car team will still be trying to push the boundaries they can in the race starting this month on 22 October. The team will broadcast the race from the car back to Sydney using 5G mobile. This way, the race control team back on campus at the university can monitor the telemetry and data from the car in real time.

The report shows average wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market (NEM) were less than half that seen at the same time last year.
Electricity demand fell to its lowest level yet for a third quarter, averaging about 5%, or 1,200 MW, lower than the same period last year.
The AER said this was driven by mild weather conditions alongside a huge increase in rooftop solar output which was 31% higher than the same quarter last year, and in September alone was 41% up on a year ago.

With continued growth in rooftop solar installations, the regulator expects the record output from rooftop solar will likely be surpassed in the final quarter of 2023 but warned the roll out of large-scale renewable energy assets needs to accelerate to keep pace with the shift from a grid dominated by coal-fired generation.
Modelling by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has forecast potential supply shortfalls for all mainland regions over the next 10 years with 8.3 GW of coal-fired generating capacity scheduled to exit the National Electricity Market (NEM) grid by 2030.
The AER said just two solar farms, two wind farms and two big batteries – which will constitute about 800 MW of capacity once fully commissioned – commenced generating in the NEM during the July to September quarter of 2023.
The regulator said more large-scale energy assets are needed to keep pace with the planned coal plant retirements over the next decade.
“Overall, the rate of new entry into the market is not in line with what the market needs to transition,” it said. “With 8.3 GW of firm capacity scheduled to exit the market in the next decade as coal plants retire, there is a pressing need for new investment to be realised across the NEM.”
Despite its concerns, the AER said the progressive connection of new solar farms meant there was more low-priced capacity in the NEM this quarter than either last quarter or in Q3 2022.
Compared to last quarter, an additional 1,500 MW was offered below $70 per MWh with large-scale solar generators, coal and hydro contributing most of the increase in low-priced capacity.
Average prices in the NEM ranged from $31 per MWh in Tasmania to $114 per MWh in South Australia, but prices this quarter were lower in all regions compared to the previous three months.

Solax has introduced a three-phase hybrid inverter with the capability of achieving a 200% oversizing of a PV system.
The Chinese manufacturer said the new inverters feature a switchover time of less than 10 milliseconds, guaranteeing a smooth transition to backup power. The devices can also handle a 200% emergency power supply (EPS) overload for up to 10 seconds and can be paired with a wide range of loads.
“The X3-Ultra is designed to seamlessly integrate with all types of PV panels, allowing for a maximum 36 A DC input per MPPT,” the manufacturer said. “This ensures optimal performance and compatibility with a wide range of solar setups.”
The new product has dimensions of 696 mm x 529 mm x 240 mm and weighs 47 kg. It is offered in five versions, with rated power outputs ranging from 15 kW to 30 kW.
The hybrid inverters also offer battery voltages ranging from 180 V to 800 V and a maximum charge/discharge current of 60 A. Solax said its dual battery ports provide the flexibility to connect batteries either separately or in parallel for various energy storage configurations.
The inverters can allocate power independently to each phase, with control down to 0 W per phase, offering a maximum of 10 kW output on a single phase. Solax said that the X3-Ultra can provide 100% unbalanced output, permitting feed-in power down to zero on each phase.
The new inverters also feature isolated sampling, arc fault circuit interrupters, and surge protective devices on both the AC and DC sides.
“The inverter also boasts Intelligent Loads Management, extending support to electric vehicles and heat pumps, making it a forward-thinking choice for the modern energy landscape,” Solax said.

The US Department of Energy (DoE) says it has earmarked USD 7 billion ($10.97 billion) to launch seven nationwide Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) for the rapid deployment of low-cost clean hydrogen. The H2Hubs aim to collectively produce 3 million metric tons of hydrogen per year, contributing to nearly one-third of the 2030 US production targets. The funds will also support clean hydrogen storage, delivery, and end-use. The seven selected hubs are as follows: the Appalachian Hydrogen Hub between West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; the California Hydrogen Hub in California; the Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub in Texas; the Heartland Hydrogen Hub between Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Mid-Atlantic Hydrogen Hub between Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey; the Midwest Hydrogen Hub between Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan; and the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub between Washington, Oregon, and Montana. The H2Hubs selectees are investing USD 40 billion.
The Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) – in cooperation with RMI, Systemiq, Power2X, and industry leaders – has set up the Transatlantic Clean Hydrogen Trade Coalition (H2TC) to enable the initial shipment of clean hydrogen from the United States to Europe by 2026. H2TC will provide members with access to regulatory and infrastructure requirements analysis, supply and demand matching, and integration with capital markets. The coalition seeks to connect US fuel producers with heavy-industry consumers in Europe, facilitating the first shipment of clean hydrogen-based fuels by 2026. Their aim is to expand transatlantic trade to 3 million metric tons per year by the end of the decade.
ITM Power says it will launch bidding on projects in the US market, offering its electrolyser stack for both CE and ASME territories. The UK electrolyser producer says it will pursue a streamlined, asset-light entry into the US market, capitalizing on existing relationships in North America. By standardising production processes and supply chains, it aims to simplify operations and achieve economies of scale.
SSAB, LKAB, and Vattenfall have completed a month-long commercial test of Hybrit’s hydrogen storage on the electricity market. Vattenfall stated that by introducing storage, the variable cost of hydrogen production could be significantly reduced, by 25% to 40%. The mission aimed to produce hydrogen using fossil-free electricity at varying electricity prices, optimizing cost-effectiveness, especially during times of abundant weather-dependent electricity generation. The hydrogen was continuously supplied to SSAB for fossil-free iron production in Luleå, Sweden. The hydrogen storage facility, operational since the summer of 2022, will continue testing activities until 2024. This pilot plant measures 100 cubic meters and contains hydrogen gas pressurised up to 250 bars.
Portugal‘s Secretary of State for Energy and Climate, Ana Fontoura Gouveia, has announced an upcoming auction for green hydrogen and biomethane injection into the natural gas grid, with expectations of the European Commission’s opinion on the Portugal, Spain, and France green hydrogen corridor project in November.
