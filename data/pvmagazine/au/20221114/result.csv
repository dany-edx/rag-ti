https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/14/rooftop-solar-returns-as-sa-rebuilds-after-wild-storms/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022",Rooftop solar returns as SA rebuilds after wild storms,"Authorities encouraged South Australians to turn off their rooftop solar systems “as a last resort” to maintain grid security after wild storms brought down a transmission tower and caused multiple transmission lines to trip, islanding the state from the rest of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
South Australia’s transmission network owner ElectraNet said a fallen transmission tower near Tailem Bend caused both circuits on the 275 kV the interconnector with Victoria (VIC) to trip, disconnecting the state’s grid from the NEM at 4.40pm on Nov. 12.
“Until the damaged tower is repaired, power flows to and from VIC are constrained to zero, which will require curtailment of rooftop solar to maintain system stability,” ElectraNet said in a statement at the time. “We are liaising closely with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and will continue to closely monitor the state’s high-voltage transmission network.”
With South Australia – which made headlines in 2021 when it became the first interconnected power system of its size (1 to 3 GW) to have 100% of its demand met by 100% PV – islanded from the NEM and high rooftop solar exports forecasted, AEMO issued a market notice declaring Distributed PV Contingency (DPVC) conditions in the state.
The market operator also postponed planned transmission maintenance outages, increased electricity demand by directing scheduled load into service and curtailed large-scale generation but the measures were not sufficient to manage the risk of major supply disruptions.
“Therefore, the curtailment of commercial, industrial and residential solar generation is required as a last resort to maintain grid stability,” AEMO said in a statement.

At 2pm on Nov. 13, South Australia’s electricity distributor SA Power Networks (SAPN) issued a notice calling for South Australians to switch off their solar systems.
“A further issue has emerged with SA’s power supply beyond the impact of yesterday’s storm,” SAPN said in a social media post. “The transmission connection with Victoria has been hit and this is affecting the ability of the national energy market operator to manage the balance between energy supply and demand in our state.”
“To assist, they have asked whether we can encourage customers to turn off solar panels. This action will help stabilise the energy system in South Australia.  We understand there are complex issues with energy at the moment, but turning off your solar will be a big help. We will advise when it can be turned back on.”
That call came at 8.30pm on Nov. 13, with SAPN declaring “we are pleased to advise that customers who turned off their solar systems to help manage the balance between energy supply and demand can now reactivate them.”
While AEMO said the transmission network “remains in a secure operating state”, more than 33,000 properties across South Australia were without power on the morning of Nov. 14, with SAPN saying many will not be reconnected until at least Nov. 15.
South Australia was hit with more than 423,000 lightning strikes on the night of Nov. 13, while wind gusts were recorded at more than 100kmh.
SAPN received more than 500 reports of fallen wires while about 163,000 homes and businesses lost power in what is being described as the worst outage since the state-wide blackout in 2016.
In the 2016 incident, storms damaged major transmission lines in the state’s mid-north which tripped most of the South Australian power grid, blacking out about 850,000 properties.
SAPN corporate affairs head Paul Roberts said this most recent event is in some ways worse than the 2016 event because it would take “a lot longer” to fix as the network had to be rebuilt, not just reconnected.
“Due to the large number of faults, rebuilding and repairing the network and restoring power will continue over the week,” he said.
“SA Power Networks has mobilised all possible resources and has called in interstate field resources to assist. We expect to have the vast bulk of customers back with supply by the end of Tuesday (Nov. 15), but the reality is some may be off for longer.”

AEMO Services, which is administering the process in its capacity as NSW Consumer Trustee, announced it had received more than 5.5 GW of wind and solar generation projects and more than 2.5 GW of long-duration storage projects covering technologies such as pumped hydro, lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and compressed air storage. The portfolio of projects is enough to power the equivalent of 2.4 million homes.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said the level of interest is an outstanding result for the government’s long-term plan to modernise the state’s electricity system.
“This is an overwhelming response from the market and a strong endorsement of the roadmap’s vision for the NSW electricity system,” he said in a statement, before adding that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the global energy crisis had given “extra impetus to modernise our electricity system. The need for new sources of electricity generation that are not tied to the volatility of global commodity prices has never been greater.”
Kean’s position is that the best way to provide structural, long-term relief from skyrocketing electricity bills is to drive new generational supply.

The first tender is seeking about 950 MW of wind and solar, along with 600 MW of long-duration storage. The tender is designed to select projects capable of delivering new large-scale energy infrastructure as the NSW government looks to implement its Roadmap for at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage, defined as a minimum eight hours of storage, online by 2030 as the state prepares for the exit of its coal-fired generators.
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said bids for the generation and long-duration storage tenders will now be independently assessed according to a set of merit criteria which evaluate the deliverability of the project, the quality of the proponent and social licence, before being assessed for financial value.
“We recognise there is an increasing need for additional energy generation and storage,” Verschuer said. “Our tenders are designed to drive competition from projects that are able to deliver that energy in the interests of NSW electricity consumers.”
Verschuer added that while the tender had an indicative size of 950 MW of generation and 600 MW of long-duration storage, AEMO Services “can recommend greater or less capacity than this size if it is in the long-term financial interests of consumers to do so.”
Successful projects will be awarded long-term energy service agreements, underwriting the delivery of built energy resources that will benefit the long-term interests of the state’s electricity consumers.
This tender round is the first in a biannual schedule that will continue for the next 10 years, open to eligible projects located anywhere in NSW. The second tender is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2023.
“These tenders have been specifically designed to identify the best projects to bring quality energy to market in the earliest possible timeframe,” Kean said.

The company’s entry into the wholesale electricity market was marked by the ringing of the NZX bell.
Over the past year, NZX, Transpower, Panasonic and Auckland University have jointly developed the software. They have also integrated the solarZero platform and validated the ability of the VPP to participate in the market.
SolarZero is now starting a staged enrolment of its 10,000 household battery systems into the New Zealand electricity reserves market to provide fast, sustained reserves. The VPP will help state-owned Transpower maintain a stable electricity grid as the nation transitions to 100% renewable energy by 2030.
SolarZero shares revenue from trading in the market with its community members through a monthly eco-bonus credit. Every member can expect to be credited NZD 18,000 ($10,722) over the next 20 years by lending their solar batteries to take part in its VPP, thus reducing their power bills. The company claims the solarZero community currently saves more than NZD 2.3 million on annual energy costs.
“In the face of the highest energy prices in the history of New Zealand, every home that has a roof can now earn extra income, safely power through blackouts, and support their community by reducing the cost of electricity for everyone,” solarZero chief executive Andrew Booth said.
Earlier this year, solarZero made headlines as US investor BlackRock agreed to acquire the company as part of its push into renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific region. At the time, solarZero claimed a 40% market share of new residential rooftop solar installs in New Zealand and had approximately 8,500 systems under its belt across the residential, commercial, and community sectors.
Biggest battery
In another momentous development for New Zealand’s battery energy storage market, Meridian Energy revealed that it has secured the green light for a 100 MW battery – the island country’s largest such system to date. It will provide additional reserve power and resilience to the national grid.
The battery system is the first stage of Meridian Energy’s Ruakākā Energy Park, north of Auckland, and will also include a 125 MW solar farm. Construction is scheduled to begin early next year on land adjacent to the former Marsden Point oil refinery. It is expected to be completed in 2024.
“It will provide reserve power in the event of insufficient generation by allowing more electricity to flow north from the South Island, and by storing power from the grid during off-peak periods,” said Rebecca Knott, Meridian Energy’s head of renewable development. “When fully charged, it would be capable of powering 60,000 average households for two hours over a winter’s evening.”
In addition to improving resilience and reducing the chance of network outages, Knott said the battery storage capacity will likely have a modest positive impact on regional and national power prices.
The biggest battery currently under construction in New Zealand is a 35 MW system in Waikato on the North Island. The system, developed by WEL Networks and developer Infratec, is expected to go online in December. The equipment supply contractors include Saft and Power Electronics NZ.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/14/fortescue-lines-up-for-offtake-agreement-with-worlds-largest-pv-project/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,BRAZIL",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022",Fortescue lines up for offtake agreement with world’s largest PV project,"With ambitions to develop a green hydrogen plant in the Brazilian state of Ceará capable of producing 15 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) is said to be investigating a power purchase agreement with Brazilian renewable energy developer Omega Energia which is building a 4.6 GW solar project in the country’s northeast that is set to become the world’s largest PV installation upon completion.
Omega Energia is yet to reveal its investment in the 4.6 GW Kuara solar park project, which will comprise 8 million solar modules from an undisclosed manufacturer. The project will cover 7.8 thousand hectares of unused farmland between the municipalities of Aracati e Icapuí, in Ceará.
While the Kuara solar park project has already attracted potential offtake agreements, the Ceará state government has postponed plans to grant it an environmental licence until next month.
The environmental council of Ceará met last week to discuss the project’s environment licence and decided to postpone its final decision until 1 December 2022. The council noted that a member of the Order of Attorneys of Brazil has asked to visit the project site before casting a vote.
Despite the delay, local media has reported that Omega Energia will sell some of the renewable electricity generated at the site to FFI which plans to develop a renewable hydrogen project which could start large-scale green hydrogen production as early as 2027.
FFI last week signed an updated memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ceara state government to build an industrial green hydrogen production plant within the Pecem industrial and port complex, about 200 kilometres from the 4.6 GW Kuara solar park project site.
The subsidiary of iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group said it will invest USD 6 billion to build the facility. The goal is to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, the local government said.
Currently, the project is in the feasibility study stage in which engineering, environmental and social impact studies are being carried out. If the ongoing feasibility studies confirm the project’s viability, FFI is targeting a final investment decision by 2024 and the commencement of large-scale hydrogen production in Ceará in 2027.
The world’s two largest PV parks to date are now under construction in China. State-owned China Huadian is building a 3.3. GW solar park in Changdu, Sichuan province. A second 3 GW solar installation is also planned in Zhongwei, in China’s Ningxia Hui region.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/14/forced-labour-concerns-prompt-u-s-ports-to-block-over-1000-shipments-of-solar-components/,"COVID-19,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 14, 2022","Forced labour concerns prompt U.S. ports to block over 1,000 shipments of solar components","Reuters reported that more than 1,000 shipments of solar energy components, valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, have been blocked in U.S. ports under enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).
The Xinjiang region of China, which is home to roughly 50% of the global supply of polysilicon, an essential material in conventional solar modules, has come under scrutiny for its human rights abuses and the forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. Beijing has repeatedly denied allegations of forced labor.

The UFLPA places a “rebuttable presumption” that goods from the region are made with forced labor, and it places the burden of proof on buyers to show that the imported goods have no connection to forced labor whatsoever. To be in compliance with UFLPA, companies must provide a comprehensive supply chain mapping, a complete list of all workers at a facility, and proof that workers were not subject to conditions typical of forced labor practices and are there voluntarily.
Corporations like Coca-Cola and Nike lobbied against the UFLPA, as their supply chains are deeply woven into China’s economy.
Reuters was told by U.S. Customs and Border Protection that it has seized 1,053 shipments of solar energy equipment between June 21, when the UFLPA went into effect, and Oct. 25. Customs said none of the shipments have yet been released.
Three of Reuter’s sources were told the shipments include solar panels and polysilicon cells, adding up to 1 GW of capacity, and primarily made by three of the largest Chinese PV providers. This includes Trina Solar, JinkoSolar, and Longi, which together account for about one third of U.S. panel supply, said Reuters. Other reports have said the impact may be even larger than that.
In August, ROTH Capital Partners said over 3 GW of components were held up at Customs. It estimated that much as nine to 12 GW of solar modules could be prevented from entering U.S. markets by the end of the year.
In a press briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijan said forced labor allegations are, “the lie of the century fabricated by a small group of anti-China individuals.”
“The U.S. side should immediately stop the unreasonable suppression of China’s photovoltaic enterprises and release the seized solar panel components as fast as possible,” said Lijan.
Module supply challenges have been an ongoing issue in the United States, exacerbated by COVID-19 related shutdowns, increased shipping costs, semiconductor supply chain challenges, and the enforcement of the UFLPA and other trade and labor laws.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said solar developers across the United States planned to install 17.8 GW of capacity this year. However, through six months, only 4.2 GW had been brought online. From January through June 2022, about 20% of planned PV capacity was delayed, according to the EIA. Reports show solar installations were delayed by an average of 4.4 GW each month, compared with average monthly delays of 2.6 GW during the same period last year.
At the RE+ conference in Anaheim this September, marketing directors at Trina Solar told pv magazine they were confident in the high degree of traceability of its products and supporting supply chains.
“We realized supply chain can not be centralised in one place and customers also want independence. Our mid-term strategy is to have a clear fragmentation of products and markets, as well as geographically diversify our supply chain. Different markets require different supply chains,” said Helena Li, president of global cell and module business at Trina.
In an email, JinkoSolar said it is working with Customs Border Patrol on documentation proving its supplies are not linked to forced labor and is “confident the shipments will be admitted.”
“The world and the American people cannot abide the presence of goods made under the exploitative conditions experienced by Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in its global supply chains,” said Marty Walsh, U.S. Secretary of Labor.
