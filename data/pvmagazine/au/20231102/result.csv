LAVO Life, the company’s latest offering, promises to provide renewable energy ecosystems to Australian households who can’t afford the upfront cost. 

Dubbing the model ‘Energy-as-a-Service,’ LAVO proposes customers install 10 kW of Yingli solar, a hybrid 13.3 kWh lithium LAVO battery and an EV Charger at no upfront cost, instead paying back the system via monthly instalments over 10 years, similar to a mobile phone plan.
The company says it can size and cost its systems, which it will also maintain, to ensure customers pay the same or less than their current electricity bills in majority of scenarios. At the end of 10 years, those customers are expected to own the rooftop solar and home battery system outright.
While the LAVO Life package is overall focussed on family homes, the company will also offer a system with slightly less capacity, at 6.6 kW of rooftop solar coupled with a hybrid 10 kWh battery and 5 kW inverter product.

The company soft launched the LAVO Life concept at All-Energy, and is currently only taking expressions of interest from potential customers. The company has not yet committed to a full market launch date, but Chief Technology Officer Michael Huang told pv magazine Australia that the ambition is to see megawatt-scale installations in 2024.
LAVO’s product contribution to this new system comes in the form of battery storage, though it is not hydrogen-based. In fact, the company is opting for lithium iron phosphate or LFP battery technology, using CATL cells. LAVO’s product line comes in two durations, the LAVO S2 at 10.2 kWh and the LAVO S4 at 13.3 kWh.

Yingli is set to provide the solar panels in the LAVO Life system, offering its 440W N-Type solar modules. The two companies shared their flashy booth at All-Energy, which was titled LAVO x Yingli.
Less is known about the electric vehicle (EV) charging component in the system, with the online data sheet saying simply that it will come with an “AC EV Home Charger Charger C7/C11.”
The rollout of LAVO Life will be done in partnership with retailer Diamond Energy, though the company is aiming to recruit additional retailers in future.

The east coast of Australia, that is Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, are set to be the first regions with access to LAVO Life, with South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory only to be rolled out later.
Exactly how this Energy-as-a-Service model will be financed is a little hard to pin down. It is not clear at this stage if it will be financed through separate private backing only or will involve support from each of the partner companies. Currently, the customer contracts are set to run for 10 years, but will have an early-exist option if customers are willing to pay off their system early, as you might a mobile phone.
LAVO Life is currently in testing with a representative saying the first system was installed in Concord, Sydney in October. Further trial systems are set to be installed over November.
The model will also involve a rewards program where customers will be able to earn product rewards by shifting their energy use to off-peak periods, essentially changing their energy use behaviours. The system will also integrate with an AI (artificial intelligence) to help educate and keep customers on this path.
The company did not reveal details about the specific product rewards to be offered, but said a key Australian airline is looking at tying the system in with its frequent flier points program.

LAVO is still working on its hydrogen battery technology, with staff saying both the residential and utility-scale hydrogen batteries remain “in trials” at the moment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/02/treasurer-flags-australian-response-to-ira-good-start-but-more-ambition-urgently-needed/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",Treasurer flags Australian response to IRA – good start but more ambition urgently needed,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has turbocharged the energy transformation in the US and attracted unprecedented private capital into the country, reindustrialising and greening the economy and threatening to pull capital investment away from Australia at a critical juncture in the energy transition.
Climate Energy Finance, the Climate Capital Forum, the Smart Energy Council, the ACTU, Saul Griffith’s Rewiring Australia, the Clean Energy Council and others have repeatedly called on the government to invest $100 billion of strategic public interest capital into an Australian renewables industry package, including onshore critical minerals processing, green iron, battery manufacturing, and green hydrogen/ammonia, to respond to the challenge of the IRA.
The Treasurer’s focus today on four key industry and economic opportunities, which reflect the key priorities we and others have identified is to be applauded. These are refining and processing critical minerals; supporting manufacturing of generation and storage technologies, including batteries; producing renewable hydrogen and its derivatives like ammonia; and forging green metals including green iron.
All are industries where Australia can lead the world and exercise our significant comparative advantages. There is a clear geopolitical imperative to prioritise and establish domestic supply chain capacities in these sectors, to diversify risk. This won’t happen if we leave it to the free market.
We also welcome the Treasurer’s emphasis in his remarks on the crucial role of skills, technology, planning and regulation to activate and deploy the capital investment needed to underpin these industries, and his refocusing of the Productivity Commission to guide our country towards a successful net zero transformation.
But the Treasurer’s projection that $225 billion capital investment is needed by 2050 is too low by orders of magnitude, this timeframe is too late, and it reveals a too-cautious federal policy mindset that risks forgoing Australia’s opportunity to position itself as a leader in global cleantech as the world moves at breakneck speed to decarbonise.
Further, the Treasurer’s statement that capital commitments will be detailed in the May 2024 Budget betray a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the challenge. MYEFO is December 2023 – we need to see commitments then, and go further again in May 2024.
The $40 billion committed to-date by the Albanese government is a good start – $15 billion for the National Reconstruction Fund (NRF), the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation, Energy Minister Chris Bowen’s brilliant Capacity Investment Scheme, the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions fund, the extra $4 billion in critical minerals support, the extra $2 billion equity support for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (NAIF) and the $1.3 billion downpayment on “Electrification of Everything” are all positive steps. But collectively too small and too slow, so far.
Incrementalism will not deliver on the transformative opportunity we have to remake our nation. We need a comprehensive, coordinated front-loaded package to drive decarbonisation this critical decade. Australia is starting a decade behind due to the climate science denialism of the previous mob and its pandering to the incumbent fossil fuel industry’s self-interest. We have zero time to lose and everything to gain.
We are in a collective, entirely interrelated climate, energy and cost of living crisis, but when combined with China’s global leadership and supply chain dominance, this creates unprecedented opportunities for wholesale transformation of the energy system, industry base and economy here in Australia.
Rather than talking in multiple decades, we need the Albanese government to seize the current moment as a massive global technology, innovation and investment race to scale up a multitude of new zero-emissions industries and solutions and capture global supply chains, building diversity to reduce geopolitical risk and position Australia at the forefront of the new global
economy.
We are uniquely positioned to export “embodied decarbonisation” by processing our critical minerals, our iron ore and our other energy transition materials here using our abundant clean energy, helping our trade partners decarbonise their economies, as well as transitioning our own at speed and scale.
Other countries’ responses on establishing new cleantech supply chains are accelerating, the IRA being a prime example, as is South Korea’s new leadership in batteries and EVs in response to the IRA.
China is leading the energy transition by a huge margin and dominating critical supply chains. Further delay or or insufficient capital ambition in terms of Australian government investment means we now risk being permanently locked out as other countries build their new supply chains by locking-in value-added processing of our critical minerals and metals.
Vision is everything, leadership is everything, and the context of increasingly complicated and challenging geopolitical dynamics, securing domestic supply chains is everything.
For this we need landmark strategic public capital investment. The Treasurer cited the $2 billion boost into critical minerals announced last week by PM Albanese and the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program. Again, these are incremental steps – nowhere near commensurate with Australia’s opportunity, and nor are they large enough to attract the quantum of investment we need to onshore critical minerals processing and green hydrogen at scale.
Private finance will “crowd in” once it has the price signal, and policy architecture and public investment that catalyses and rewards decarbonisation is key to this. The private capital is entirely there to be a key competitive advantage for Australia.
For example, Australia has one of the largest private capital pension pools in the world. Our $3.5 trillion of super is ready to invest when it gets the right policy and carbon pollution price signals, for example, building on the start from the Safeguard Mechanism. Likewise, we have the opportunity to leverage the massive power of Australian corporate balance sheets, such as those of BHP, Rio Tinto and Wesfarmers.
This financial firepower remains latent until the price and policy signals are right to derisk and crowd in their investments.
Australia’s key trade partners are also keen to build their partnerships in Australia, be that China’s iron and steel major Baowu, or South Korean steelmaker POSCO and battery producer LG Energy Solutions, and a nation-building scale investment package would signal Australia’s material strategic commitment and provide certainty.
Alongside industry policy and investment, grid infrastructure, renewables, storage and electrification are critical enablers of our industrial and economic transformation. While we have a laudable national 82% renewables by 2030 target, we need multiples of 100% renewables, and our superabundance of wind and solar potential underpins this opportunity.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) estimates 250 GW of renewables and battery storage capacity is needed. This equates to over $250 billion of investment.
The total investment opportunity of a comprehensive response to greening Australia’s grid and economy is closer to $1 trillion than $225 billion cited by the Treasurer, taking into account the jobs and
value-added exports this entails.
At the end of the day, we have an investment, jobs and export opportunity of a century.
The opportunity cost of seeing this squandered by insufficient strategic vision, public investment, ambition or urgency of response is unthinkable, and will be borne by future generations.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/02/south-australia-moves-to-fast-track-big-battery-developments/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",South Australia moves to fast-track big battery developments,"South Australian companies planning to build large-scale battery energy storage systems can now apply for planning exemptions to get their projects off the ground faster as the state government seeks to accelerate the roll out of battery developments to help stabilise the grid as the rapid uptake of renewable energy continues.
The state government said companies seeking to build big batteries can submit expressions of interest (EOI) for Crown Sponsorship from the Minister for Energy and Mining for their proposed development.
The Department of Energy and Mining (DEM) said these projects will be considered for a planning exemption, which could streamlined the approvals process and improve project timelines. The exemption pathway relates to planning approval of the battery energy storage systems component of a project only.
The move comes as the state government seeks to introduce new dispatchable firming capacity into the market by 2027 to address reliability gaps forecast by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
The DEM said grid-scale battery storage facilities have a key role to play in supporting the reliability and security of South Australia’s grid, which already has an average share of variable renewable energy of more than 70%.
“South Australia has transformed its energy system from 1% to over 70% renewable energy in just over 16 years,” the department said.
“The high penetration of solar and wind in the state means periods of low renewable resources could have a high impact if there is insufficient dispatchable firming technology.”
Large-scale battery storage can store and release energy over short periods of time, with the flexibility to respond to grid events in fractions of a second contributing to grid stability.
The EOI applications must be received by 15 November 2023.
The announcement coincided with electricity transmission network operator ElectraNet’s forecast that South Australia is expected to reach “net” 100% renewables on an annual basis within four years.
In its latest Transmission Annual Planning Report (TAPR), ElectraNet said data from AEMO shows South Australia “will reach 100% net renewable electricity generation by 2026–27, two years earlier than forecast last year.”
The planning report notes wind and solar energy supplied all of South Australia’s electricity demand for at least part of the day during the 12 months to 30 September 2023. The share of renewables averaged more than 70% throughout that period.
“Energy from renewable sources supplied about 71% of South Australian electricity generation in 2022-23 and is forecast to exceed and remain close to 100% of South Australian demand from 2026-27,” the report reads.
ElectraNet said the state has “frequently” experienced periods of 100% or more instantaneous renewable energy since October 2021 and has demonstrated that operating at 100% instantaneous variable renewable energy is achievable.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/02/quinbrook-introduces-energy-tracing-into-portfolio-as-australia-hesitates-on-granular-certificate-scheme/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,POLICY,QUALITY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 2, 2023",Quinbrook introduces energy tracing into portfolio as Australia hesitates on granular certificate scheme,"Australian-owned renewables player Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners will adopt the new energy-tracing software, dubbed Quintrace, across its portfolio companies and customers in Australia, the US, and the UK, it says.
The Quintrace digital platform enables customers to trace the source of every kilowatt-hour consumed at their operational facilities, matching it back to their nominated renewable supply projects located within the grid on a 24/7 basis. The software also includes information about the carbon-intensity of electricity supplied by the grid at any given time, allowing for granular monitoring of emissions.
In other words, platform is about time matching renewables – something which looks like it will soon be legislated in the US and Europe, but is only just starting to crack Australia’s cognisance. The importance of energy tracing most prominently came to light after Google’s own engineers called the company out for claiming to run on 100% renewable energy, when in fact it was matching 100% of the electricity its operations consumed with renewable purchases, much like Australia’s Capital Territory (ACT).

In fact, when Google audited its energy use, it found it had only used ‘carbon free energy’ 66% of 2021 – meaning renewables actually powered its data centres two thirds of the time, while coal and other fossil generation was still consumed for the nighttime difference.
This publicised example spurred a more nuanced examination of the difference between actually using renewable energy and claiming to have used renewable energy via a certificate scheme. Currently in Australia and much of the rest of the world, renewable energy certificates like Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) do not account for when or where electricity is used.
Australia’s federal government agency the Clean Energy Regulator is currently working on introducing a new renewable energy certificate scheme, which will be known as the REGO, or Renewable Electricity Guarantee of Origin. This scheme is expected to come into effect around 2025, and will coexist with Large-scale Generation Certifications before replacing them and Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs) after 2030.
Despite the fact that Europe is structuring its own Guarantee of Origin certificates down to 1 watt hour of granularity, including time stamping, and President Biden committed the US to having a ‘carbon pollution-free electricity sector’ (that is, with 24/7 time matching) by 2035, Australia’s scheme does not appear to be pursuing this standard, and is still working on a much larger megawatt hour window.
During consultation period for the REGO scheme earlier this year, a number of different industry groups including the Clean Energy Investor Group, the RACE for 2030 group, Google Australia, UNSW, Enosi and more, called on government to include time-stamping and carbon intensity information in the REGO certificate scheme. So far, the Clean Energy Regulator appears hesitant to consider this due to the added complexity.
Industry argues that moving forward with a scheme misaligned with standards being adopted by the world’s biggest markets will undercut Australia’s ability to export green energy and green manufactured materials.
Coming back to Quinbrook, cofounder and managing partner David Scaysbrook said: “Knowing what your real and auditable footprint is to defend greenwashing claims and track genuine carbon impact is now an acute business need. This urgent customer need is exactly why we created Quintrace.”

The company says the platform will also integrate with emerging global standards like EnergyTag and can access hourly carbon calculations in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The platform also facilitates the recording of annual and hourly energy flows under Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), including custom PPAs, Quinbrook says. 
The company pointed to the software’s particular role given the rise of battery storage – a technology embraced as renewable, even though batteries are entirely agnostic about the source of the electricity they store. “It’s now critical to know the carbon intensity of the grid power being used to charge batteries before that stored energy is supplied to a customer,” Scaysbrook said.
For customers with battery storage, Quintrace provides advanced tracking and real-time monitoring of battery carbon intensity “with the ability to support optimisation of both commercial and carbon impact objectives in real-time,” Quinbrook says.
While energy traceability and 24/7 time matching is undoubtedly necessary to reach a zero-emissions grid, these types of technologies raise the bar on renewable claims significantly. This, in turn, entails far more nuanced work from both companies and governments. It is inevitable that should such standards be widely employed, many renewable hydrogen and battery projects would have their green credibility undercut, as would the long list of RE100 companies. 
Quinbrook argues: “Companies must be able to prove and audit their carbon footprint reductions along with the need to meet increasingly stringent carbon reporting that presents huge and costly challenges.”
These stringent carbon reporting standards may indeed be imminent in other countries, but it remains to be seen whether Australia will even move forward with properly time-stamped renewable certificates, let alone carbon-intensity information.
There are already a number of companies, including Australia’s Enosi, which have developed granular energy tracing software. At this stage, it is not clear whether Quintrace has been developed in-house by Quinbrook or includes third-party programs.
Earlier this week, Quinbrook also announced plans to develop a green polysilicon manufacturing plant in North Queensland’s Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct. Quinbrook has been conditionally allocated a 200-hectare at the site, and is looking for an operational parter to complete the vertical play.
The company, it seems, is rapidly expanding outside its traditional wheelhouse as a renewable energy investor, looking to become involved in vertical supply chains as well as energy accounting software.

The announcement comes just days after Origin’s largest shareholder, superannuation giant AustralianSuper, said it would reject the prior buyout offer from Brookfield and EIG, describing it as “substantially below” its estimate of long-term value for the energy generator and retailer. The position taken by AustralianSuper, which owns 13.7% of Origin, was supported by several other institutional shareholders.
The Brookfield-led consortium is now offering Origin shareholders $9.53 per share, up 8.2% from the prior offer of $8.81 apiece. The revised bid pushes Origin’s valuation closer to $20 billion.
Importantly, the consortium said the increased offer is its “best and final” proposal meaning it cannot be increased unless a rival offer emerges.
“The fact that no competing offer has surfaced in nearly a year, together with the massive premium in our proposal, evidences the fact that we have identified every element of value available,” EIG Chief Executive Officer Blair Thomas said in a statement.
Origin’s board said it unanimously recommends shareholders vote in favour of the revised deal at the scheme meeting which is currently scheduled for 23 November 2023.
“The revised consideration is now above the top end of the independent expert’s 30 June 2023 valuation range,” Origin Chairman Scott Perkins said in a statement. “We encourage all shareholders to vote in favour of the scheme.”
Perkins said while Origin is already well placed to navigate the energy transition, Brookfield’s ownership will accelerate the build out of cleaner energy at a speed and scale much greater than Origin’s existing plans.
Brookfield has said it will invest up to $30 billion in Origin in the next decade to fund the company’s energy transition, using that capital to develop up to 14 GW of new renewable generation and storage assets by 2033.
Brookfield Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Stewart Upson said with its current funding sources and as a public company Origin will not to be able to match the level of investment at the scale and speed as it could achieve under Brookfield’s ownership.
“Under Brookfield’s ownership, we will fund and facilitate the required investment,” he said. “Our capital is committed and not contingent on any future capital raise processes.”
“The combination of Brookfield and Origin in Australia will fast-track significant decarbonisation in the National Electricity Market. We also intend to support a local manufacturing industry that will make components for the renewables development industry in Australia, creating jobs.”

The Ulinda Park battery energy storage system is being developed adjacent to the Western Downs substation at Hopeland near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region.
Melbourne-based Akaysha said the project will support the rapid expansion of solar and wind projects leveraging existing transmission infrastructure in the region.
Akaysha said construction of the first phase of the Ulinda Park project, which will involve the installation of a 150 MW/300 MWh battery featuring lithium Iron phosphate (LFP) cell technology, would begin this month. The battery is expected to commence commercial operations in 2025.
Adelaide-headquartered Consolidated Power Projects (CPP) has been awarded the engineering, procurement, and construction contract with Akaysha handing the battery equipment supply agreement to US battery specialist Powin and eks Energy.
Akaysha Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Nick Carter said reaching FID is an “amazing milestone” for the company which has also secured the contract to deliver the 850 MW/1.68 GWh Waratah Super Battery project in New South Wales.
“Ulinda Park was our first-ever development at Akaysha Energy right back at the start, so we have a soft spot for it,” he said. “The Waratah Super Battery gets a lot of the attention/headlines, but the unsung heroes of the Akaysha Energy battery portfolio will become Ulinda Park BESS and the other large battery developments that are rapidly marching towards FID across the NEM.”
Other projects in Akaysha’s development pipeline include the Orana energy storage project near Wellington in central-west NSW, which is to deliver a 400 MW to 1600 MW big battery with up to 1600 MWh of energy storage capacity.
It is also developing the 200 MW/400 MWh Brendale BESS in Queensland, the 200 MW/800 MWh Elaine big battery in Victoria, the 100 MW/200 MWh Palmerston battery energy storage system in Tasmania, and the 200 MW/800 MWh Mobilong big battery in South Australia. The company has also announced plans to develop a 300 MW/1,200 MWh battery and 200 MWp solar farm near Brinkworth in South Australia’s mid-north region.

AIKO CEO Tiger Lu said the company would also be looking to launch its inverter and storage systems, which are currently available in China, to global markets in the coming year.
The centrepiece of AIKO’s exhibition was its N-Type All Back Contact (ABC) modules, which deliver efficiency ratings of up to 24% and earned Intersolar and Red Dot Product Design Awards in 2023.
The ABC double-glass solar component uses dual-glass encapsulation technology, building on the core strengths of the ABC single glass component, enhancing its properties in terms of barrier, moisture resistance, and fire retardance.

Its 54-cell distributed modules deliver power output ranging from 445W to 465W at an efficiency of 23.6% and 23.8%. The 72-cell modules for ground-mounted applications can deliver up to 620W at an efficiency rating of between 23.8% and 24%. ‘
The modules come with a 25-year product quality and 30-year power quality warranty, with an annual degradation rate of less than 1% in the first year and less than 0.35% in years two to 30.
Speaking to pv magazine Australia, AIKO Director of Digital Energy Products Yao Lu said the company’s high-efficiency modules were a result of its commitment to innovation. The company currently has a 2,300-strong R&D team, and invests around 3% of its annual revenue in R&D.
While there is no indication yet around pricing, it is expected AIKO’s products will be at the higher-end of the market.
The appearance at All-Energy is part of a global expansion for AIKO, having established subsidiary companies this year in nine countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. 
In 2020, AIKO established the Solarlab Aiko Europe research institute in Germany, and currently partners with a number of other research organisations in Western Europe.
In addition to its foray in the Australian market AIKO said it plans to launch into the United States and North Africa, and continue to grow throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific.

The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for Mono PERC modules from China, and TOPCon module prices, declined this week by the same amount of USD 0.005 per Wp to ISD 0.140/wp and USD 0.147/wp respectively. With falling upstream prices and weak demand in China with its key export markets these are the lowest prices ever recorded, according to OPIS data.
Upstream prices across the supply chain in China continue to slide, weighing on module prices. China polysilicon prices extended losses by falling 3.33 yuan/kg, or 4.19%, to 76.17 yuan/kg this week. The wafer and cell segments saw prices fall for a third consecutive week, with Mono G12 cells seeing a 10.45% plummet to USD 0.0703/wp. Buyers and sellers of modules alike reported lower prices during OPIS’ weekly market survey. P-type modules are on the threshold of 1 yuan/W, while n-type modules are a little more than 0.10 yuan/W higher, a developer said.

Sentiment in China remains bearish. While domestic demand will come from fourth-quarter installations, this is typically a low-demand period, concurred multiple sources. As available land for projects is decreasing, demand will not be as high as hoped, one module manufacturer explained. Orders signed last quarter have been cancelled and buyers want to re-sign contracts at current low prices, another module manufacturer said. The supply picture is gloomy, too, as China’s module manufacturers are sitting on 1-2 months of inventory, according to one seller.
China’s key export markets continue to struggle, with inventories in the European distributed market so large that there’s “basically no need to replenish supply,” according to one source. Even with low prices, approvals for ground-mounted projects are slow and there is insufficient labor to set up projects, they said. Over in Latin America, Brazil’s market is also facing weakness. Brazil is “hoarding too much” inventory, a seller said.
Looking ahead, module prices are expected to continue falling as we reach the end of the year, OPIS learned during its weekly market survey. Many sources pointed to how the 1 yuan/W era has arrived already, with a recent major China procurement tender seeing P-type module bids of as low as 0.993 yuan/W. There is “brutal competition” coming, and “industry consolidation may see more momentum,” according to one solar market veteran.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
