In Western Australia, a small but tumultuous campaign that has been simmering for the last months has just boiled over. The result for TNG Limited, the developer of the Northern Territory’s Mount Peake Project, touted as the world’s “most advanced” vanadium project, is a complete shakeup of management.
The project was clearly not advanced enough for TNG’s shareholders, who voted overwhelmingly to support the change of management campaign run by Grant Wilson, a former Australia Financial Review columnist and hedge fund manager. 
Wilson’s primary criticism was the slow progress of the Mount Peake project, which promised to begin construction in 2018 but is still finalising engineering and approvals some four years later.

Mount Peake aims to be a top 10 global producer of vanadium, with a mine sitting alongside TNG’s proprietary TIVAN technology, which the company says allows it to “overcome limitations of conventional processing.” The company also plans to build a processing facility in Darwin’s Middle Arm Precinct.
While the project received Major Project Status from the federal government in 2021 and is finalising its front-end engineering design (FEED) study, completed by German engineering company SMS Group, shareholders reached the end of their patience.
While TNG’s incumbent leadership team claimed the upheaval would be detrimental for Mount Peake’s offtake agreements and partnerships, its power waned through November with former chair Neil Biddle announcing he would not offer himself for re-election at the general meeting, followed by the dropping out of another director and finally the stepping down of former CEO Paul Burton on Nov. 25.
Grant Wilson, who has now succeeded at becoming the company’s new chair of directors, heralded the win as “time to kickstart the new era.”
Wilson is even proposing to change the company’s name.
The Mount Peake Vanadium-Titanium-Iron Project is located 230km north of Alice Springs and is aiming to produce around 6,000 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide annually to be used for vanadium redox flow batteries.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/29/determined-to-really-lift-the-standard-guidelines-for-first-nations-engagement-launch/,"LEGAL,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 29, 2022",Guidelines for First Nations engagement ‘determined to really lift the standard’,"Having drawn a sizeable list of partners, the recently formed First Nations Clean Energy Network (Network) is launching two new guidelines to help both members of renewables industries and First Nations communities negotiate energy projects – something Australia has historically done quite poorly. 
“We have the opportunity to do projects right this time – working together cooperatively, fairly and respectfully in our joint mission to power the nation,” Luritja man Chris Croker, managing director of Impact Investment Partners and a member of the Network’s steering group, said.
The Network’s first guide, ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Best Practice Principles for Clean Energy Projects’ outlines 10 principles for the clean energy industry and government to help them ensure projects successfully consider culture and environment, mutual respect, and economic and social benefits to Australia’s Traditional Owners.
The second guide, ‘Clean Energy Negotiations Guide for First Nations’ aims to help communities negotiate mid to large scale developments on country, as well as assisting those wanting to initiate their own clean energy projects.
The Network will be holding a webinar to launch and explain these the two guidelines on Nov. 30, at 12:30p.m. AEDT.

“These guides set the gold standard and will help everyone involved, including the clean energy industry itself and governments responsible for driving and regulating them,” Croker said.
“Indigenous communities overseas are making great strides from the development of clean energy projects on their land, owning a stake or initiating their own, and it will happen here too,” he added.
Kane Thornton, chief executive of industry peak body the Clean Energy Council, believes renewables can contribute to righting mistakes made by Australia’s energy and mining industries in the past. “The clean energy industry is determined to really lift the standard when it comes to working with First Nations communities,” Thornton said. “These guides provide a wonderful steer for how to do this and we’ll all reap the benefits in terms of strong, respectful relationships and cheaper, more reliable energy.”
In August 2022, federal, state and territory energy ministers committed to co-design a new strategy which will see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people share in the benefits of the renewable transition.
More than 60% of Australia’s landmass is held in Indigenous Estate, meaning First Nations groups either hold native title or other land right claims. Although Australia’s Native Title Act is federal law, states and territories have retained sovereign rights over land, water and resources which leads to considerable variations in how the law is enacted. 
Speaking to pv magazine, Croker said in his experience Australia’s land rights landscape has been difficult for international renewable developers to navigate, leading to proponents giving Native Title-claimed land a wide berth.
Complex as it might be, Croker believes it would be more constructive for developers to form good working relationships with First Nations Australians rather than squabble over small subsets of unclaimed land. “If we work positively with Indigenous landowners and cultural groups we will actually enable many, many more opportunities,” he said.

The First Nations Clean Energy Network’s partner list includes the National Native Title Council, Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation, Smart Energy Council, Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at ANU, Clean Energy Council, Renewable Energy Alliance, ACTU, ETU and MUA, Impact Investment Partners, Community Power Agency, Lowitja Institute, Climate Council, and many others.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/29/nt-to-get-grid-forming-big-battery-as-darwin-site-hits-construction-milestone/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 29, 2022",NT to get ‘grid forming’ big battery as Darwin site hits construction milestone,"Australia’s top end is set to have its first big battery operating in 2023, the 34.7 MW / 34.7 MWh Darwin-Katherine Battery Energy Storage System (DK BESS) being built at the Channel Island Power Station in Darwin.
While the big battery’s capacity looks modest, it’s worth noting the Northern Territory has a population of just 247,000.
Being delivered by the Swiss-headquartered Hitachi Energy, which was awarded the Territory government’s tender in Dec. 2021, the battery will deploy the company’s Virtual Synchronous Machine or grid forming technology. The technology gives batteries the capacity to help stabilise the grid by providing inertia and frequency control services which have until recently only been provided by gas or coal fired generators. 

Hitachi has already deployed this technology in Australia with Hitachi ABB Power Grids in use at South Australia’s 30 MW/ / 8 MWh Dalrymple battery.
Hitachi Energy Country Managing Director Bernard Norton described this deployment as “a bold step towards operating the entire Darwin-Katherine network without gas powered generators.”
Norton is gesturing toward the end vision for the Darwin-Katherine battery which, being built at the site of a 279 MW gas facility, the Channel Island Power Station, is a step towards eventually replacing the fossil fuel generation.
Alongside providing stability services, the DK BESS is expected to unlock more capacity for residential and industrial solar and save 58,000 tonnes per annum of carbon emissions.
The battery is anticipated to generate cost savings of $9.8 million and pay for itself in just under five years. It will feed into the Darwin-Katherine Interconnected System which services 150,000 Territorians.
According to Gerhard Laubscher, CEO of Territory Generation – the Territory-owned company behind the Channel Island Power Station –  Hitachi Energy already has a team mobilised to the site to carry out specialist battery equipment and cabling installation.
Hitachi is working with local contractor ESPEC to deliver the battery, while West Australian company Pacific Energy Group will supply and install the 11.5 kV switchroom via its subsidiary MVLV Power Solutions.
The DK BESS has been described as the “cornerstone investment” of Territory Generation’s Fleet Transition, with the project also a major part of the Darwin-Katherine Electricity System Plan.
“Construction of the Darwin-Katherine BESS is a huge step forward in our plan for 50% renewables by 2030,” NT Minister for Renewables and Energy, Selena Uibo, said.

Researchers from the University of Buraimi in Oman have studied how PV plants and CSP facilities could compete in terms of expected electric energy output and the effective use of land at low latitudes in regions such as the Sahara Desert, the Arabian Peninsula, Mexico, and South Asia.
The main goal of the study was to rank nine types of solar power system typologies – four kinds of PV plants and five types of CSP facilities – while defining land-use performance metrics.
“This ranking does not include economic factors, scalability, or technology complexity; which may make one system preferred to others even if it demands relatively more land area to yield the same electric energy,” the scientists explained.
They looked at PV systems with fixed photovoltaic panels (PVF), arrays with single-horizontal-axis trackers (PVH), installations with single-vertical-axis trackers (PVV), and systems with two-axis tracking (PV2). They also considered CSP systems based on parabolic dishes with attached heat engines (CSPd), plants with parabolic troughs (CSPt), facilities with linear Fresnel reflectors and single absorbers (CSPF1), projects based on compact linear Fresnel reflectors wit two absorbers (CSPF2), and solar towers with heliostats (CSPh).
The scientists used three different simulation tools to describe the performance of the nine project typologies: Energy3D, PVWatts Calculator, and PVGIS. They considered monthly energy generation intensity (MGI), daily energy generation intensity (DGI), and hourly energy generation intensity (HGI), with the aim of defining the overall energy generation intensity (EGI) of projects. They found that PVF systems are the best performers among the PV typologies.
“Despite the simplicity of the system, being free from any major moving parts, it allows high ground coverage ratio (packing density),” the scientist said. “Adding a single-axis (horizontal) solar tracking gives the best EGI. Upgrading the tracking system to two-axis tracking can misleadingly show better energy conversion assuming the same amount of panel surface, but the EGI actually dropped.”
The scientists said that CSPd, CSPt and CSPF1 have comparable EGI, but the parabolic dishes are preferable when less seasonal variability is required.
“Adding absorbers to a linear Fresnel reflector system without adding a proportional number of reflectors (keeping the same ratio of reflectors to absorbers) is not recommended, and can actually cause a performance penalty,” the scientist said.
They presented their findings in the paper “Land-Use competitiveness of photovoltaic and concentrated solar power technologies near the Tropic of Cancer,” which was recently published in Solar Energy.

PV InfoLink said this week that polysilicon prices are now on a “distinctive downward” trend, following months of high prices. The consulting firm said it expects prices to fall significantly from the end of November into early December. “Unhealthy inventory will persist in the polysilicon sector until the end of the month,” it said, noting that it expects to see the first decline in polysilicon inventory in two years. In October, PV InfoLink predicted that prices would fall from around CNY 300/kg ($41.85), excluding VAT), then to below CNY 150/kg by the end of 2023.
Longi said this week that it has lowered its wafer prices. It said p-type M6 products (166 mm, 223 mm) are now priced at CNY 6.24 each, down 1.4%. Prices for p-type M10 (182 mm, 247 mm) wafers now stand at CNY 7.42 each, down 1.6%.
JA Solar has revealed that it will invest around CNY 7.44 billion in a new 10 GW solar cell factory in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. It said its panel capacity will reach 50 GW by the end of this year and 75 GW by the end of 2023.
JG Solar said this week that it is testing n-type wafers with a thicknesses of 130 micrometers and 120 micrometers for its heterojunction solar cell lines. The module maker is currently building a 4.8 GW factory in Jiuquan, Gansu province. It expects to start trial production in the first quarter of 2023.
Solarspace has inaugurated the first stage of a 16 GW n-type TOPCon solar cell factory in Chuzhou, Anhui province. It currently has an annual production capacity of 8 GW spread across 16 production lines. It will make cells based on 182 mm and 210 mm wafers from the beginning of 2023.
