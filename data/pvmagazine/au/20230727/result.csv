The new mark, 431 MW higher than the same time last year, was also the highest year-on-year growth yet for rooftop solar output and the second-highest recorded growth in percentage terms.
Output from grid-scale variable renewable energy (VRE) also reached a record second quarter average of 4,599 MW, up 745 MW on the same period last year. Almost half of the increase, 347 MW, came from large-scale solar with the balance from wind.
Grid-scale solar accounted for 5.5% of total generation in the NEM during the 1 April to 30 June 2023 period while rooftop PV accounted for 7.9%, a market share increase of 1.4% and 1.8% respectively.
The share of renewables might have climbed even higher if not for limits due to system strength and other network constraints. VRE curtailment increased by 20 MW from Q2 2022 with about 61 MW of generation lost for the quarter.

AEMO Executive General Manager Reform Delivery Violette Mouchaileh said the higher renewable output and improved generation availability had combined with less volatile market conditions to put downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices.
“Increased market share of lower marginal-cost renewables helped push down the wholesale electricity cost from Q2 2022, despite this quarter having the highest Q2 underlying demand recorded since 2016,” she said.
“In addition to increased wind and grid-scale solar output, lower thermal-coal costs and a net increase in black-coal generation availability in NSW, despite the retirement of the Liddell Power Station, helped reduce year-on-year wholesale prices.”
Total emissions in the NEM declined during the quarter to the lowest Q2 levels on record at 28.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, 6.6% lower than the same period last year.

The latest edition of the QEM report has for the first time included data on the number of connection applications and capacity processed over the quarter.
AEMO said it received 16 new connection applications from projects totalling 3.9 GW of capacity in the June quarter, with 30 GW of new renewable energy projects now working their way from connection applications to commissioning.
“At the end of Q2 2023 there were 10.3 GW of plant at various stages of construction (pre-registration), compared to 6.5 GW at the end of Q2 2022,” the market operator said.
“The number of connections progressing through registration and commissioning remains relatively similar across both quarters, with 1.2 GW and 3.9 GW of plant progressing through registration and commissioning respectively in Q2 2023, compared with 1.5 GW and 5.0 GW in Q2 2022.”
AEMO noted that the construction timelines of large-scale renewable projects are being affected by the “need to refinance, long lead times for equipment, and the need to change original equipment manufacturers.”
AEMO said there had been a 63% increase in new connection approvals in the past financial year, up from 4.2 GW to 6.8 GW capacity.
The amount of plant approved for registration to commence commissioning fell by 32% to 2.4 GW. However, the amount of plant that completed the commissioning process over the year, and were approved for full operation, increased by 21% to 2.9 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/27/melbourne-researchers-target-mw-scale-with-proton-battery-technology/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,ITALY,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 27, 2023",Melbourne researchers target MW scale with proton battery technology,"RMIT University researchers are planning to develop a ‘megawatt scale’ version of their patented proton battery energy storage system that uses a carbon electrode as a hydrogen store, coupled with a reversible fuel cell to produce electricity.
The RMIT team said it has demonstrated the proton battery as a working device and will now collaborate with Italy-based international automotive component supplier Eldor Corporation to produce a protype unit with a storage capacity that meets the needs of a range of domestic and commercial applications including large-scale storage and electric vehicles.
Lead researcher RMIT Professor John Andrews said the aim of the collaboration is to “scale up the system from the watt to the kilowatt and ultimately to the megawatt scale.”
Andrews, from RMIT’s Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Laboratory (SHEL), said recent design improvements to their proton battery technology meant it is becoming competitive as a carbon-neutral alternative to the dominant lithium-ion technology.
“As the world shifts to intermittent renewable energy to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions, additional storage options that are efficient, cheap, safe and have secure supply chains will be in high demand,” he said.
“That’s where this proton battery, which is a very equitable and safe technology, could have real value and why we are keen to continue developing it into a viable commercial alternative.”
The RMIT proton battery utilises a carbon electrode to store hydrogen that has been split from water, and then works as a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity.

During charging, the carbon in the electrode bonds with protons generated by splitting water with the help of electrons from the power supply. When discharging, protons are released from the carbon electrode and pass through a membrane to combine with oxygen from the air to form water, a reaction that generates power. Unlike fossil fuels, the carbon does not burn or cause emissions in the process.
Andrews said the proton battery avoids the energy-wasting steps of storing hydrogen gas at high pressure, and then splitting these gas molecules again in fuel cells.
“Our proton battery has much lower losses than conventional hydrogen systems, making it directly comparable to lithium-ion batteries in terms of energy efficiency,” he said.
The latest battery’s storage capacity of 2.2 wt% hydrogen in its carbon electrode is nearly three times that of a 2018 prototype, and more than double other reported electrochemical hydrogen storage systems. The researchers said the performance gains have been achieved by design changes that enhance electrochemical reactions in the battery.
“Our battery has an energy-per-unit mass already comparable with commercially-available lithium-ion batteries, while being much safer and better for the planet in terms of taking less resources out of the ground,” Andrews said. “Our battery is also potentially capable of very fast charging.”
The researchers also pointed to the environmental and economic advantages of its technology, saying it does not rely on scarce natural resources and avoids the end-of-life challenges associated with some renewable energy technologies.
“The main resource used in our proton battery is carbon, which is abundant, available in all countries and cheap compared to the resources needed for other types of rechargeable battery such as lithium, cobalt and vanadium,” they said. “There are also no end-of-life environmental challenges with a proton battery, since all components and materials can be rejuvenated, reused or recycled.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/27/top-solar-panel-brands-in-performance-reliability-and-quality/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JULY 27, 2023","Top solar panel brands in performance, reliability, and quality","The Renewable Energy Test Center (RETC) has released its 2023 PV Module Index report, evaluating the reliability, quality, and performance of solar panels.
Solar modules are put through a variety of accelerated stress tests to evaluate these parameters. Through comparative test results, project stakeholders can select products best suited for a particular environment, location, or portfolio.
Quality
Hail durability
Top performers: JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Trina Solar
RETC’s hail durability test takes UL and IEC standards testing a step further, exposing solar modules to higher kinetic impact to reflect the risk posed by hail over a 25 or 30-year operating life. In addition to ballistic impact testing, RETC runs thermal cycle and hot-spot tests to reveal potential long-term module degradation.
The top eight performers in this category withstood an effective kinetic energy of 20 Joules or more. These modules effectively demonstrated resistance to a 45 mm (1.8 in.) iceball traveling at a terminal velocity of 30.7 m/s (68.7 mph).
Thresher Test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar Longi Solar, Runergy
The thresher test is a summation of a series of tests that places modules under a variety of vigorous environmental stresses to provide quantitative data behind degradation modes. Power drop, leakage current and visual observations are also made in the test.
The RETC test places backsheets, modules, and connectors through accelerated stresses. Thresher tests include humidity-freeze cycling, thermal cycling, damp heat exposure, static and dynamic load testing, and UV soaking. High performers in this category consistently achieved less than 2% of power degradation.
Performance
LeTID resistance
Top performers: Aptos Solar, Astronergy, JA Solar, Runergy, SEG Solar, Silfab Solar, Solar Space, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Relatively new cell technologies may experience long-term degradation associated with light exposure and elevated temperatures. This phenomenon, called light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID), is tested with a protocol of light soaking, followed by 75 C (167 F) temperature exposure for two 162-hour cycles to identify significant degradation (>5%). Subsequently, test samples are subject to 500 hours of 75 C temperature exposure followed by two additional 162-hour cycles.
Highlighted top performers demonstrated products that less than 0.75% power loss after 486 hours of exposure.
LID resistance
Top performers: Dehui Solar, Longi Solar, Merlin Solar
Light-induced degradation (LID), or power losses from sunlight exposure, affects some PV cell types but not others. PV modules exposed to LID losses rapidly lose performance over the first few hours or days of operation before stabilizing.
RETC notes LID resistance is highly correlated with cell type. Top performers were all monocrystalline silicon panels and experienced an increase in performance or a modest decrease amounting to less than one tenth of one percent.
Module efficiency
Top performers: Auxin Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Meyer Burger, Mission Solar, Qcells, REC Solar, Silfab Solar, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Module efficiency, or the percentage of incident solar energy converted to electrical energy, is a well-known and key metric for solar performance. It is highly correlated with cell technology and module design.
The top 14 highest scoring modules scored efficiencies of 20% or more. An N type TOPCon cell scored the highest at 25.8% efficiency, followed by a monocrystalline silicon module with heterojunction technology, recording a 22.4% efficiency.
PAN file
Top performers: Dehui Solar, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Yingli Solar
The PAN file test is a module characterization test with 22 parameters set by the PVsyst modelling software. Project developers use PVsyst to evaluate potential sites based on energy production and financial performance.
The assuming filed test conditions of a 10 MW utility-scale solar plant in Midland, Texas with fixed tilt ground mounts and 500 kVA central inverters. Top performers in the PAN test achieved a performance ratio in PVsyst of 85% or greater.
Reliability
Damp heat test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
The RETC thresher test includes a damp heat test that exposes modules for 2,000 hours, double the amount required for product certification. The test evaluates a module’s ability to withstand prolonged exposure to humid, high-temperature environments. Taking place inside an environmental chamber, the test exposes modules to a controlled temperature of 85 C (185 F) and a relative humidity of 85% for a set amount of time.
RETC highlighted performers that experienced less than 2% degradation after this exposure.
PID resistance
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Qcells, Runergy
Potential induced degradation (PID) resistance tests rack-mounted modules in an environmental chamber, which controls temperature and humidity, and exposes them to a voltage bias of several hundred volts with respect to the mounting structure. Typically, exposure times range from 96 hours to as much as 500 hours. PID testing characterizes a module’s ability to withstand degradation due to voltage and current leakage resulting from ion mobility between the semiconductor and other elements in module packaging.
Nearly 28% of the test samples experienced less than 1% degradation over the test period. By comparison, less than 9% of modules achieved greater than 5% power loss.
Static and dynamic mechanical load test
Top performers: Astronergy, JA solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Runergy, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
This test exposes modules to 1,000 cycles of +1,000 pascal and –1,000 pascal loads at a frequency of three to seven cycles per minute. Measurements taken after this stress test rate electrical performance.
This year, nearly 47% of the modules that RETC subjected to simulated wind and environmental stresses achieved less than 2% degradation in power. Roughly 17% of the total test samples experienced less than 1% degradation in power after the SDML sequence. RETC notes that the results in this category represent a modest improvement on a year-over-year basis.
Thermal cycling
Top performers: Astronergy, JA Solar, JinkoSolar, Longi Solar, Qcells, Runergy, Saint Gobain, Trina Solar, Yingli Solar
Thermal cycle test calls for cycling modules in an environmental chamber between two temperature extremes: 85 C on the high end and –40 C on the low end. The RETC test runs 600 cycles, three times as much as the 200 required for certification.
About 80% of modules in this test achieved less than 2% power loss, while only 2.4% had power losses of 4% or more.
Overall top performers
“To identify the best of the best, we reviewed and ranked the overall data distributions across all three disciplines: quality, performance, and reliability. The Overall Results Matrix on the right summarizes the results of this analysis, which highlights eight high achievers based on overall highest achievement in manufacturing,” RETC said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/27/atco-shelves-western-australia-green-hydrogen-project/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 27, 2023",Atco shelves Western Australia green hydrogen project,"Atco had planned to locate a 10 MW electrolyser at Warradarge in Western Australia’s midwest and use renewable energy to produce up to four tonnes of green hydrogen a day for blending into the state’s gas network.
The Clean Energy Innovation Park (CEIP) project was to be located alongside Bright Energy Investments’ 180 MW Warradarge wind farm about 250 kilometres north of Perth with the green hydrogen to be trucked south to gas network injection points.
Atco, which operates and maintains WA’s largest gas distribution network, has however backed away from the project citing the disconnect between production facility and end use.
“While we were initially confident we could build CEIP at Warradarge, our ongoing assessment and market development found the benefits of being closer to the end-user of the renewable hydrogen was more commercially viable than locating the CEIP in a more remote location,” the company said in an emailed statement.
“Atco still intends to explore a commercial hydrogen facility however believes it is more feasible to identify opportunities closer to heavy industry where demand will justify the investment.”
“We are confident that as the hydrogen economy in Western Australia grows and demand for renewable hydrogen increases, developing hydrogen plants across the state will become a reality.”
Atco had received $28.7 million (USD 19.4 million) from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to help fund the CEIP project but the company said the change in project fundamentals meant it will not access the funding.
Despite scrapping the CEIP project, Atco continues to explore renewable hydrogen production. It is already producing green hydrogen at a solar-powered facility at Jandakot in Perth’s outer southern suburbs.
The Clean Energy Innovation Hub (CEIH) has been in operation since 2019, producing green hydrogen which is now servicing a high-speed hydrogen refuelling station. Green hydrogen, at levels from 2% to 10%, is also being blended into the existing gas distribution network in the region as part of a two-year trial that commenced during the last quarter of 2022.
The decision to not proceed with the CEIP project comes just weeks after Atco announced it would delay a 325 MW/2,600 MWh pumped hydro project planned for the New South Wales central west until there is a “clear commercial pathway” for the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/27/to-achieve-net-zero-energy-status-solar-powered-buildings-should-not-exceed-10-floors/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CANADA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 27, 2023","To achieve net zero energy status, solar-powered buildings should not exceed 10 floors","Buildings powered by solar energy should not exceed 10 floors in height if they have to achieve a net-zero energy performance.
This is the main conclusion of a study by researchers from the University of Toronto, investigating the technical feasibility of solar-powered high-rise nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs), specifically residential and commercial buildings that have very low primary energy requirements that are to be met to a significant extent by renewable sources.
In such buildings, the total sum of annual energy use is approximately equal to the total sum of the renewable energy produced on-site. “Net-zero energy performance in all-electric buildings will offset the emissions associated with any energy drawn from the electricity grid and hence achieve net-zero emission status,” stated the Canadian researchers.
The scientists pointed out that most net-zero energy buildings are either single-family homes or low-rise buildings, noting the difficulty of high-rise buildings in achieving NZEB status, due to their large floor area-to-surface ratio, which reduces the space available to deploy solar energy systems. “In a survey of 32 nearly zero energy buildings in Europe, only 4 had five or more stories, with the tallest one having seven stories,” they reported.
The group conducted its analysis by using as a main parameter the maximum energy use intensity (EUI), which is calculated in kWh/m2. They investigated different solar system configurations, including both the PV and photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) technologies, evaluating various geographical areas and building geometries.
For their assessment, the academics assumed a 40-floor building with a 40 m2 × 40 m2 floor area, a 3.8 m ceiling height, and a window-to-wall ratio of 50% on all the walls. “To cover a wide range of locations, climates, and solar potentials, 16 metropolises in North America are studied,” they explained, noting that they considered both PV and PVT collectors under two different scenarios.
In the first scenario, the whole roof area is covered with PV systems and all the walls are equipped with building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels. In the second one, all the available areas on the roof and walls are covered with PVT panels. “This study assumes that all the available areas on the roof and the walls, including the north-facing wall, are covered with PV or PVT panels,” the scientists specified, adding that their analysis also does not consider the shadow coming from the urban environment. “This assumption can be impracticable in many cases, especially for the roof, as other systems in a building, for example HVAC, require some of the available areas.”
The analysis showed that, under the first scenario, the maximum EUI permitted for net-zero energy performance ranges from 16.5 kWh/m2 to 24.2 kWh/m2. In the second scenario, the EUI is between 18.6 kWh/m2 and 27.8 kWh/m2. “Switching from PV to PVT collectors improves the EUI by 8 to 44% due to PVT being significantly more efficient,” the academics said. “Changing the building’s orientation to a non-square floor shape improves the EUI by up to 52% in PV and 63% in PVT scenario.”
They concluded that, in order to become NZEBs, buildings should not exceed an EUI of 50 kWh/m2a, which they said corresponds to a maximum of 10 floors.  “Conversely, if an energy intensity reduction to only 75 kWh/m2a can be achieved, the building height should be limited to 5–6 floors if it is to be NZEB,” they added.
Their findings can be found in the paper “Feasibility of achieving net-zero energy performance in high-rise buildings using solar energy,” which was recently published in Energy and Built Environment.
