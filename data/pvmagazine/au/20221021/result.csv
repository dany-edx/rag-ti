By 2050, 65% of the electricity in the National Energy Market will be from rooftop solar, producing around 70 gigawatts, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
We are spending more than $5 billion (USD 3.14b) per year on solar installations, however less than 1.0% of Australia’s installed solar panels are made in Australia. Most panels, and their component parts, come from China.
That exposes Australia to the risk that our future energy system relies solely on favourable trade relationships with another country. Associated risks include importing low-quality panels that go to landfill long before their claimed ‘thirty-year life’, and inadvertently relying on forced labour to provide us cheap renewables hardware.
You can’t build a circular economy from a supply chain that has forced labour in its manufacture and landfill at its decommissioning.
Sheffield University’s In Broad Daylight report alleges that in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China, an estimated 2.6 million Uighurs and Kazakhs are imprisoned and forced to labour in the polysilicon industries that create cells for solar panels.
We also know that the thousands of solar panels that are taken off roofs every week could amount to 100,000 tonnes of modules by 2035.
If we manufacture some of our renewable energy needs in Australia, we give ourselves an opportunity to take control of these systemic sustainability issues, while also weaning ourselves off a reliance on other nations for our energy infrastructure.
Recently the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a special report on Solar PV Global Supply Chains which pointed to China’s dominance of solar PV. The IEA argued that in order to avoid the risks of industrial concentration, nations other than China must build their own capability to make all or some of the components of a solar panel.
India and the United States have embarked on policies aimed at domestic manufacturing of renewables hardware, and in Australia we – as Australia’s only manufacturer of solar panels – have been investigating how to make an Australian solar panel with as few imported components as possible. Our conclusion is that an Australian solar panel with at least 50 per cent of components by value made or derived in Australia, could kickstart a Circular Solar ecosystem. If we could produce half of the components of a solar panel in Australia, we’d not only control the quality of the panel, but we’d ensure no forced labour in the supply chains and a recycling guarantee at decommissioning. We’d be building a sustainable and ethical domestic industry.
Tindo is working with University of NSW and the Australian PV Institute (APVI) to explore detailed options for local PV Manufacturing in Australia. It’s clear from early work that in order to drive a domestic solar panel industry and supply chains, we need manufacturing scale of at least 1 GW per annum. Currently Tindo Solar, Australia’s only manufacturer, produces around 100 MW per annum.
Starting with a scenario of Australian solar panel production of 1 GW per annum, using imported components, we could drive down the cost of making a solar panel from 0.50¢ per watt to 0.33¢.
A more ambitious scenario would see most panel components made domestically from local resources. Australia would probably not build its own solar cell because that entails four vertical sub-industries, making it uneconomic for Australia.
However, Australia does have an advantage in the products already exported by our mining industry that are processed into solar panel components in China. These components – including glass, aluminium frames, junction boxes, EVA and backsheet – could be made in Australia for a domestic solar panel industry.
By making all the non-cell components in Australia we would save around $15 million per 1 GW of production, $10 million of which is saved on logistics costs from not importing PV glass.
These savings are conservative and don’t include the value-added sales Australian producers could make by refining, processing and manufacturing what otherwise is a bulk commodity export to Asia.
A domestic solar panel industry and supply chain first requires scale (at least 1 GW per annum). We also need the three layers of government to coordinate policies that give procurement weighting to Australia-made renewables products; our governments must also enforce anti-dumping and forced labour laws and consider policy settings that incentivise investment.
We see an opportunity for this country to make a sustainable investment in clean energy, by combining industrial policy with the energy transition, and building sustainability into the product.
We’re calling it ‘Circular Solar’ – the ability to ensure sustainable supply chains free of forced and child labour, a genuine 25-year performance warranty for the panel (not just a theoretical one), and a recycling guarantee for a decommissioned panel.
Circular Solar allows us to take domestic control of issues such as slavery, recycling, safety, and panel longevity, that cannot be guaranteed by relying solely in imports.
Most important, domestic manufacturing of solar panels, from Australian resources, would build sovereign capability, jobs and energy security at a time when the nation needs it most.

Peter Leeson, managing director of Leeson Group and founder and director of Volt Solar Tile, said the Volt Planum and Lodge mono PERC solar tiles are the first in the world that can generate the equivalent amount of energy as a standard solar PV panel.
“It’s the highest efficiency solar tile in the world to date,” he said. “We’ve reached 19.3% efficiency.
“With Volt, we’ve made solar tiles affordable and accessible for homeowners who want clean and affordable energy to power their homes.”
Leeson said Volt has designed the “highest wattage, highest quality, and lowest cost solar tile available”.
“Volt solar tiles are a quarter the cost of its competitors’ integrated solar roofs and half the cost of other solar tiles systems,” he said. “A 5kW Volt system costs $12,000 fully installed after STC (small-scale technology certificate) rebates.
“We’re coming close to or meeting the price of your premium quality solar power systems but it’s obviously a lot more than your standard systems.”
The Volt Solar Tile range includes the 115 W Planum module which has an 18.8% solar efficiency and the 105 W Lodge solar tile with 19.3% efficiency. Both tiles benefit from metal wrap through (MWT) cell technology and a busbar-free design which decreases shading area by up to 3%.

The tiles, which measure 1.7m x 0.44m and 1.65m x 0.44m respectively and weigh in at 10 kilograms, feature a black aluminium frame, matte-black glass and built-in cable containment system which eliminates the need for live cables in the roof. The solar tiles are designed to tie in with adjacent roof tiles and feature their own drainage channels and gutters.
The solar tiles, which are backed with a 30-year performance warranty and 15-year product warranty, have already secured TUV certification and Volt said it is waiting on certification from the Clean Energy Council (CEC) for its approved product list.
Currently being manufactured in China, Leeson said the plan is to eventually move that process into Australia.
“By late 2023 we’re hoping to have assembly set up and operating here in Australia,” he said. “From there, we will be looking at setting up an actual manufacturing plant here. The aim is to be financially closing on a manufacturing plant in 2024 and at the end of 2024, start of 2025 actually be making the solar modules here.”
The Volt solar tiles will be officially launched at the All-Energy Australia event in Melbourne next week but Leeson said they are already available in Australia with the first installations expected to commence in the coming weeks.
The launch of the Volt Solar Tile range coincides with the appointment of Bristile Roofing as the roofing partner for the product in Australia while Spain-headquartered roof tile manufacturer La Escandella will serve as its global distributor outside of Australia.
The Volt Lodge solar tile integrates with Bristile’s concrete roof tile range while the Planum tile is designed to fit with terracotta tiles manufactured by La Escandella.
Bristile, one of Australia’s largest roof tile manufacturers, has a significant market share for new home roofing products across the nation while La Escandella has a presence in more than 85 countries.

Leeson said the distribution agreements will open opportunities for the solar tiles to be sold in 85 countries including Spain, United States, United Kingdom and Germany and will provide Volt with an initial potential market of 250 MW annually.
“Australian engineered solar technologies are highly regarded around the world and recognised for their innovation and quality,” he said.
“Our partnership with Bristile Roofing and La Escandella will allow us to expand our market share in the solar tile industry.”
The company is forecasting about 6.6 MW of its product sold and installed around the world in 2023 with that increasing to 80 MW globally by 2026.
While the solar tiles can be retrofitted to an existing roof, the main target is expected to be the new home market with Leeson saying the Volt solar tiles provide homeowners with an alternative to traditional solar panels.
“That is where we are going to gain market traction,” Leeson said, adding Volt would be looking to take advantage of the recent changes to the National Construction Code.
The changes, which are to be implemented in May next year, are designed to help reduce buildings’ ongoing costs on the path to net-zero emissions, with the introduction of minimum energy ratings of seven stars.
The new standard is designed to encourage builders to consider the efficiency of appliances, such as hot water systems, heating and cooling, pool and spa pumps, solar modules and battery storage that they recommend to homeowners.
“That’s going to push a huge requirement of solar power going onto new homes,” Leeson said, noting the integrated design features of the solar tiles would appeal to new home builders.
“Not a lot of new homes will put solar panels on a new home but solar tiles really are a new-home market product,” he said. “It provides an integrated option which can be introduced during the construction phase.”

In 2021, the company announced its battery division, E22, would develop 13 large-scale batteries in South Australia, Victorian and NSW.
On Oct. 20, 2022, GRS announced the energisation of its 5 MW/ 7.5 MWh Longwarry energy storage project in Victoria, which is now connected to the grid.
The lithium-ion battery will provide AusNet with much-needed network services as grid congestion worsens in the peak summer period. AusNet and E22 have a 5-year deal.
Rod Jones, AusNet’s general manager of network strategy and planning, said the Longwarry battery “is one of the first of many across the AusNet network. In conjunction with Gransolar, the site will provide important network support capabilities for us over the peak summer periods and ensure a more reliable supply of electricity to our customers.”
Jones added the E22 battery energy storage system (BESS) “will also pave the way for more new and innovative solutions to the growing demand for energy services.”
According to the agreement with AusNet, E22’s battery capacity will be available in the peak summer period and for emergency events. Outside of these emergency dispatch periods, E22 will be able to participate in the electricity and ancillary services markets with the BESS.
In a statement, managing director of GRS in Australia, Carlos López, noted the pivotal time we find ourselves in the energy transition. “It is a time when large-scale projects are beginning to spread, often hybridised with renewables. These ambitious storage projects enable the transition to green energies by ensuring the energy supply, but also help (sic) correct grid imbalances and regulate electricity prices.”
AusNet requested expressions of interest (EOIs) for a non-network solution in the West Gippsland Region in the early and now seemingly very distant months of 2020. AusNet set out its requirements for “a non-network solution to provide up to 3 MW of evening peak summer network support, typically 4:30 to 8:30pm from December to March, and up to 2 MW overnight hot water peak network support – typically 12am to 2am year-round.”
AusNet suggested behind-the-meter solar PV and battery storage was one of the most sought after EOIs as “a minimum of 6MWh dispatch capacity is required, with 120 MWh annual dispatch allowance. The solution must be dispatchable upon command,” and the “provider will own, operate and maintain the proposed system.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/21/new-tool-to-simulate-climate-at-utility-scale-pv-project-sites/,"TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 21, 2022",New tool to simulate climate at utility-scale PV project sites,"From pv magazine Global
A research group in China has developed a meteorological and forecasting model to assess climate impacts from utility-scale PV plants.
“The proposed model is unique based on its analytical expression of land-surface processes and the coupling of this expression with a mesoscale meteorological model,” the scientists said, noting that the new model can simulate the near-surface climate of utility-scale PV plants.
The new tool features a PV-associated energy balance model integrated with a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system that serves both forecasting and atmospheric research needs. It is suitable for a broad range of applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometres, including weather forecast research, air quality and wind energy evaluation, as well as hydrological research studies.
The model is based on the surface energy balance principle, which determines the amount of energy flux available to evaporate surface water and to raise or lower the temperature of the surface. According to the scientists, relying on this principle represents the first attempt to parameterise the soil/latent heat and non-constant or observation-constrained critical parameters in solar plants.
The researchers tested the model at a 70 MW utility-scale PV plant located in Wujiaqu, in China’s Xinjiang region, with the testing period running from July to October 2020. They found that the shielding effect of the solar modules reduces the surface soil temperature while increasing the heat of the surrounding atmosphere and the temperature gradient between the atmosphere and the land surface.
They also determined that the downward soil heat flux in the PV plant grows by approximately 34.0 % during the daytime.
“At night, the PV panels cool and absorb heat rapidly from the near-surface atmosphere, so the decreased surface temperature steepens the temperature gradient between the deep soil and the surface, resulting in a small increase in the upward soil heat flux of approximately 7.0%,” they said.
During the cold season, the daily mean soil heat flux in the PV plant declines by approximately 22.0 %.
“The physical shading of the PV panels lowers the land surface temperature in the PV plant, and the cooling range varies with diurnal and seasonal variations. Generally, the cooling during the daytime/summer is stronger than that during the night/winter,” the scientists said.
They introduced the model in “A coupled WRF-PV mesoscale model simulating the near-surface climate of utility-scale photovoltaic plants,” which was recently published in Solar Energy. The research team comprises academics from the National Climate Centre of China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Tsinghua University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This coupled WRF-PV model not only better reproduces the variations in the max/mean daily surface temperature, downward shortwave radiation, and wind speed observed from two utility-scale PV plants, but also improves the simulation ability of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux over PV plant areas,” they said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/21/global-installed-pv-capacity-could-hit-260-gw-in-2022/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 21, 2022",Global installed PV capacity could hit 260 GW in 2022,"From pv magazine Global
The IEA PVPS recently published its latest report on “Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2022.” It estimates, “with a reasonable firm level of certainty,” that the world installed a minimum of 173.5 GW of new solar capacity in 2021, representing a 22% year-on-year growth. That makes 2021 another record-breaking year, despite the pandemic-related perturbations.
“The markets reached incredible numbers last year, but they will probably be even higher this year,” Gaëtan Masson, co-author of the report and co-chair at the European Solar Manufacturing Council, told pv magazine. “Without trade disruptions as we’ve seen in the last two years, my bet is that the market will reach 260 GW.”
He said this prediction is “roughly on line” with the predictions of an undisclosed company.
“Looking at production numbers , we had 153 GW of wafers produced in the first six months of the year, so it is not totally impossible to see a market of around 250 GW to 260 GW,” he added.
European manufacturing
Last year, the European Union came second in terms of new installed solar capacity with 28.7 GW, after China with 55 GW.
“Most probably we will see production capacities in all segments of the value chain in Europe in the coming years. I think that the atmosphere has changed significantly, policy makers started to understand that there is no growth without local manufacturing,” said Masson.
However, most European manufacturing projects happening at national level are too small to be competitive.
“There is a political will, there is an industry need, but the conditions are too favourable in the US or in India for the time being, so we will lose a certain number of projects which only a few months ago were supposed to be developed in Europe,” Masson noted.
This problem of competitiveness will not be solved at the policy level through the European Commission, he said. He argues that European PV manufacturing isn’t lacking policy instruments at the European level, but rather massive investment and continuous technology development at the national level.
“If you want to remain competitive, you need to be flexible, you need to develop new production lines mostly on a yearly basis, with lower cost, to benefit not only from economies of scale, but also from technology improvements, and lower cost of manufacturing,” he said.
Continuous investment in the order of €1 billion (USD 977 million) a year will be needed to replace Europe’s current “static projects,” added Masson.
“That’s probably the key challenge that will not be solved by public support. It must be understood by the investors that it will be a multibillion investment for each company, with a continuous need for fresh money, and increase of production capacities,” he concluded. “The market will follow up – there’s no problem.”
