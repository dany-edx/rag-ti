Under the MoU, Brookfield and Envision will explore direct capital investment and the contribution of skills, knowledge and expertise to help accelerate Australia’s renewable energy transition.
The companies said they hope to eventually establish facilities in Australia that can manufacture components or assemble equipment needed for local renewable energy developments.
Brookfield said Australian-manufactured equipment could include wind turbines, towers and blades as well as assembly lines for grid-scale or electric vehicle batteries and hydrogen electrolysers.
The Canadian company, which is currently in the process of acquiring Australian energy generator and retailer Origin Energy, announced only last month that it will invest up to $30 billion (USD 19.86 billion) in Australia over the next 10 years.
Brookfield said it, and its partners in renewable energy projects, plan to develop up to 14 GW of new renewable generation and storage facilities within the Origin Energy business by 2033.
Luke Edwards, head of Brookfield’s renewable power and transition business in Australia, said the Envision partnership intends to support that strategy as well as Australia’s broader energy transition plans.
“We want to make sure domestic renewables developers, including Origin’s Energy Markets business, are in the best position possible when it comes to securing the components we need to build critical infrastructure that reduces our emissions,” he said.
“The scale of the task ahead and the amount of equipment required in Australia justifies having best-in-class large-scale domestic manufacturing.”
“Envision is a world-leading operator with deep energy experience, manufacturing know-how and a track record of setting up successful clean technology supply chains.”
The agreement with Envision comes after Brookfield earlier this month announced a similar arrangement with India-headquartered manufacturer Reliance Industries.
Reliance is currently developing one of the world’s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in India, including gigafactories for PV panels, energy storage, hydrogen electrolysers and fuel cells.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/16/genex-reaches-construction-milestone-on-2-gwh-pumped-hydro-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 16, 2023",Genex reaches construction milestone on 2 GWh pumped hydro project,"Sydney-based developer Genex Power said construction of the 250 MW/2 GWh Kidston Pumped Storage Hydro Project being developed in far north Queensland is progressing at pace with the underground construction works expected to be completed by the end of the year.
The pumped hydro storage facility being developed in the abandoned Kidston gold mine, about 380 kilometres west of Townsville, is part of the $777 million (USD 500 million) Kidston Clean Energy Hub that includes an already operational 50 MW solar farm and 258 MW of wind power.
The pumped hydro facility will provide up to eight hours of continuous energy for the grid. It is expected to be energised in the second half of 2024 and come online in 2025.
EnergyAustralia has already entered an off-take agreement with Genex to utilise the deep storage capacity, most likely at the end and start of each day when renewable energy output is at its lowest.
Genex said the roof of the powerhouse cavern, located 250m below the surface, is now on. Once completed, the cavern will be 80m long, 18m wide and 45m high. It will house two reversible turbines capable of generating 250 MW of rapid response renewable energy.

Construction of the upper and lower reservoirs, being developed in existing mining pits, and electrical infrastructure are also well underway.
“We’re already past the halfway mark,” Genex said, noting that the project “is creating significant work opportunities, boosting the supply chain, and fostering manufacturing prosperity.”
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the clean energy hub is contributing to the creation of 900 direct jobs, and will help the state achieve its renewable energy targets of 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035.
“Once operational, Kidston pumped hydro will generate enough energy to power towns the size of Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton for eight hours each and every day,” he said. “I’m incredibly excited about unlocking the power of north Queensland, and this milestone shows how close we are to achieving the renewable future promised by the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/16/atmos-adds-112-mw-solar-farm-to-renewables-portfolio/,"FINANCE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 16, 2023",Atmos adds 112 MW solar farm to renewables portfolio,"Atmos Renewables, the clean energy arm of investment manager Igneo Infrastructure Partners, has added the 112.5 MW solar farm near Mildura in northwest Victoria to a growing portfolio that includes interests in 15 renewable energy plants capable of generating 2.5 TWh of electricity.
Atmos Chief Executive Officer Nigel Baker said the deal, which also includes an option to acquire interests in BayWa wind development projects, affirms the Sydney-headquartered company’s strategy of growing its portfolio of Australian renewable energy assets.
“Atmos is committed to playing a significant role in enabling Australia’s energy transition,” Baker said.
“The acquisition of Karadoc Solar Farm further expands Atmos’ already diverse portfolio of operational renewable energy assets.”
“It is our first Victorian solar farm and complements our existing portfolio of solar and wind assets across each state of the National Electricity Market (NEM).”
Established in 2020, Atmos’ investments to date have focussed primarily on operating assets but the company said it is also working to build a “substantial development pipeline for future investment and expansion.”
“Atmos invests in green energy at all stages of the project lifecycle and is committed to building out a scaled and diversified portfolio of generation and storage assets that provide clean power to a range of customers,” it said.

Karadoc, which comprises more than 345,000 solar panels, was the largest solar farm in Victoria when it commenced operations in 2019 and with an output of up to 112.5 MW, it can generate enough renewable energy for 65,000 homes.
Its revenue is underpinned by long-term power purchase agreements with Australian electricity retailer Flow Power and beer maker Carlton United Breweries, owned by Asahi Beverages.
The acquisition of Karadoc Atmos owns interests in 15 large-scale renewable generation assets across the NEM.
In April last year it acquired the Childers (56 MW) and Susan River (85 MW) solar farms in Queensland and the Nevertire (105 MW) solar farm in New South Wales as part of its takeover of Elliot Green Power. It also owns the Daydream (168 MW) and Hayman (58 MW) solar farms in Queensland.
It also owns or has a stake in wind portfolio with a generation capacity of more than 1.1 GW. This includes the Cherry Tree, Kiata, Elaine, Yendon and Macarthur wind farms in Victoria, the Hornsdale wind farms in South Australia, and the Granville wind farm on Tasmania’s west coast.
