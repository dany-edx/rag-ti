Green hydrogen is typically produced using renewable electricity to conduct electrolysis using an electrolyser. Sparc, a joint venture with clean energy tech company Sparc Technologies, the University of Adelaide and Fortescue, has developed a technique that entails solar radiation being directly applied to a reactor where PWS takes place.
Sparc said its approach, which uses only sunlight, water and a photocatalyst to produce green hydrogen, has the potential to improve the efficiency of PWS technology.
The company’s technique includes the use of the entire solar spectrum to enhance reaction efficiencies along with incorporating concentrated solar radiation via mirror reflectors, which has been shown to increase reaction efficiencies, while allowing for a reduction in the amount of photocatalyst material required for a given production rate.
Sparc has been awarded $470,511 under Australia’s Economic Accelerator (AEA) grant program to accelerate testing of a prototype PWS reactor unit that has already been installed at the CSIRO Energy Centre at Newcastle in New South Wales.

Sparc Technologies Executive Chairman Stephen Hunt said the funding reflects the “game-changing potential of the PWS technology under development.”
“This funding will enable Sparc Hydrogen to accelerate and build on laboratory-based testing and on-sun prototyping at the CSIRO,” he said.
“Sparc Hydrogen will also look at opportunities to participate in the subsequent phases of the AEA program, along with other funding programs to support the next stage of scale up as we progress towards commercialisation.”
Sparc said adopting the PWS process to produce green hydrogen has the potential to deliver a cost competitive advantage over electrolysis driven by renewable energy.
“Given lower infrastructure requirements and energy use, the Sparc green hydrogen process has the potential to deliver a cost and flexibility advantage over electrolysis, along with being more flexible and scalable,” the company said.
Sparc said two rounds of testing have already been completed at the CSIRO centre with both the reactor and balance of plant performing well at the planned upper limits of solar concentration and temperatures.

In 2021, Q4 was the most tumultuous quarter. On the other hand, elevated lead levels and a spike in Google searches suggests Q4 will contend for 2023’s strongest period.
“I think there’s already a good deal of momentum backed in and that we are going to see elevated levels [of sales],” Warwick Johnston, Managing Director of Sunwiz, tells pv magazine Australia. “I suspect we are going to have a strong October, so we’re up for a record year.”
Lead volumes this September were up 78% compared to the number of quote requests in September 2021, Sunwiz has found. Moreover, proactive customers are turning to Google to find out about installing solar.
“I’m seeing consumer interest levels 10 to 20% up on what they were in the same time of previous year. All this hasn’t yet flowed through to leads proposals and sales,” Johnston said of the spike in Google trends for “solar” and “solar panel.”
“That’s the highest level its been,” Johnston added. “And paybacks [on solar systems] are all improving now, so that bodes well for 2024 as well.”
“My prediction is that we are going to have a strong finish to the year and have a record year for 2023.”
The average size of solar systems in Australia is also at record high, with especially strong growth in 10 kW to 15 kW systems. “The reason is because you’ve got commercial doing really, really well. Record year for commercial.”
Another interesting trend is that while Australian solar system prices are now falling after the Covid pandemic hike, this has not translated to customers spending less overall.

This is demonstrated in the above two graphs, with the total dollar customer spend on top and dollars per watt below. “If you look at the dollar total spend, it’s pretty consistent and flat. So this to me is saying as panels are getting cheaper, people are putting more of them on,” Johnston said.

James Allston, co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer of Melbourne-based Orkestra, said the funding will be used to fuel the company’s global expansion initiatives, the development of innovative product features, and the execution of strategic growth plans.
“We’re ready to expand into global markets,” Allston said. “As we progress towards our Series A funding, our primary emphasis will be on optimising our software’s capabilities to streamline and expedite our customers’ processes.”
Founded in 2020, Orkestra offers software-based tools that are designed to improve how commercial and industrial solar, battery, and electric vehicle (EV) charger projects are scoped and sold.
The company said its software as a service (SaaS) platform provides energy companies with the tools necessary to improve both the economics and effectiveness of new energy projects. Orkestra said the platform combines an easy-to-use interface with mathematics and data science to provide advanced modelling capabilities that reduce the cost and time required to evaluate project feasibility and optimise project outcomes.
The seed funding round was led by local investment fund Tidal Ventures, with participation from others including early-stage venture capital firms Rampersand, Impact Ventures and Luxem.
Wendell Keuneman, general partner at Tidal Ventures, said Orkestra’s platform has become an integral tool for nearly every Tier 1 and Tier 2 energy company and commercial and industrial-focused solar installer in Australia.
“We’ve supported Orkestra since pre-seed and firmly believe that their technology and team will continue to have an outsized impact on the clean energy sector,” he said.
Orkestra said it has successfully modelled more than 2,500 projects in 2023 alone and its customers include some of Australia’s biggest names in energy, including Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia.
Eddie Springer, founder and director of Queensland-headquartered Springers Solar, said the Orkestra platform has been a game changer for the solar installation business, enabling staff to provide clients with in-depth feasibility analyses, even delving into more complex projects, including virtual power plants.
“Orkestra has enabled us to fill a void in our ability to accurately provide feasibility studies for commercial solar and battery projects,” he said, adding that the Orkestra platform “provides excellent analysis and sales proposals for our customers, most taking less than 30 minutes.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/20/downward-trend-for-pv-module-prices-losing-momentum/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 20, 2023",Downward trend for PV module prices losing momentum,"From pv magazine Germany
The downward trend in module prices across the board could not be stopped this month, but it is clearly losing momentum. Manufacturers and dealers of solar modules are still reducing their prices, but only in small steps, and seek to slowly approach the price level accepted by the market. For a long time now, nothing has been earned from products at this price level.
In China too, it’s all about minimising damage, because unsold stocks generate avoidable costs and the risk of progressive depreciation is always present. In order not to have to pay extra for transport costs, export quantities to Europe have been drastically reduced by Asian producers in recent weeks.
Interestingly, module prices on continents other than Europe and Asia are not as affected by the price decline. The price gap is sometimes drastically different – in the United States, it is up to 100% compared to the European prices for modules with comparatively low efficiency, which means with monocrystalline PERC cells.
However, products produced in China cannot easily be redirected to America because there are strict import restrictions there. This keeps prices there high and market volume low. We will be curious to see whether the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) really has the desired and needed impact on local PV production capacity. At least with the currently very high purchase and installation costs in the United States, it is rather unlikely.
Transferring this model to other markets is risky, although some non-Chinese manufacturers are already celebrating and shifting their sales focus and scope of operations to the United States. An industry cannot be kept alive permanently through subsidies, we should all have learned that by now.
Chinese photovoltaic manufacturers cannot endure a sustained period of low prices for long and are already trying to stabilize prices again through artificial shortages. If demand picks up again towards the end of the year due to the current price situation, the downward trend could soon be stopped. There is hardly a market participant who is happy with the current situation.
Overview of the price points differentiated by technology in October 2023, including the changes compared to the previous month (as of Oct. 15):

North American manufacturer Ecoflow has launched a “retrofit” residential battery solution that it claims can be easily integrated with existing rooftop PV arrays.
“Unlike conventional DC-coupled or AC-coupled battery systems, PowerOcean DC Fit uses EcoFlow’s PV-coupling technology to directly connect with existing home solar energy systems on the PV side – meaning users don’t need to install additional storage inverters,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The battery uses lithium iron phosphate (LiFePo4) as the cathode material and is based on a self-adaptive algorithm that the manufacturer said makes the system compatible with most of the existing solar single-phase and three-phase inverters that are already in use in existing PV installations.
“Using EcoFlow’s unique PV-coupling technology, the PowerOcean DC Fit connects its batteries directly with solar panels. Users can leave the AC wiring as it is and don’t have to apply for an on-grid permit,” the company stated.
The storage system measures 680 mm x 183 mm x 479 mm and weighs 59.2 kg. It has a capacity of 5 kWh and is expandable to 15 kWh. It also features an output voltage range of 150-800 V and a maximum output current of 20 A.
The new product is IP65-rated and reportedly has a lifecycle of more than 6,000 cycles.
“Each battery pack is connected parallelly and equipped with the EcoFlow BMS (Battery Management System) to prevent one battery’s issues from affecting other packs,” the manufacturer said, noting that the new product comes with a 15-year warranty.
