While the proposed VNI West is still in the early regulatory assessment stage, having not yet been validated, committed nor approved, it was identified by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) as an actionable project in its Integrated System Plan (ISP). This is because the project would boost energy supply and sharing between Australia’s two most populous and energy congested states.
Moreover, with a spate more coal-fired power plants set to retire over the course of the decade, Transgrid’s 2021 Transmission Annual Planning Report and AEMO’s Victorian Annual Planning Report both identified the need for additional interconnection to maintain reliable electricity supply.
According to Transgrid CEO Brett Redman, formerly of AGL, said “the new 500kV interconnector would improve supply reliability and increase customer access to cheaper, cleaner electricity from generators like Snowy 2.0, as energy storage becomes critical to support growing renewables.”
“Transgrid will link South Australia with New South Wales and Victoria with the new interconnector EnergyConnect and delivering the ISP vision to reinforce the backbone of the east coast’s transmission network with another major transmission project HumeLink” continued Redman.

“Together, our major projects will transform the grid by enabling a significant increase in the amount of renewable energy that can be delivered to consumers across the National Electricity Market.”
“By delivering a reliable transition to renewables, we will help drive down customer bills and help reduce carbon emissions for a cheaper, more reliable and sustainable clean energy future.”
The regulatory assessment stage for VNI West is expected to conclude in early 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/08/community-scale-tesla-battery-set-for-charge-in-bundaberg/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 8, 2022",Community-scale Tesla battery set for charge in Bundaberg ,"In March 2021 the Queensland (QLD) government announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial. With a combined capacity of 40 MWh, the batteries will be installed at substations in Townsville, Yeppoon, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Toowoomba.
The installation of the grid-connected battery near Bundaberg is now nearing completion. QLD Treasurer and Minister for Trade and Investment Cameron Dick said the Tesla battery installation would help residents around Bargara and Bundaberg get the most out of their solar panels. 
“Queensland has one of the highest rates of rooftop solar installation in the world, and there are times on sunny days when generation far outstrips demand,” said the Treasurer. 
“Batteries like this one being installed near Bargara allow us to store that excess energy for use in the evening,” Dick continued. “In total, these network-connected batteries will collectively store up to 40MWh, enough energy to power 2,400 households.” 
Currently, 20% of Queensland’s energy mix comes from renewables. The government are aiming to bring that up to 50% by 2030 – and is clearly hopeful that capturing low-cost renewable energy during the day and distributing into the market in peak evening periods will accelerate its energy sector’s decarbonisation.
Around 18 staff from Yurika, part of Energy Queensland, have been involved in the installation of the Tesla Megapack, which should be fully energised in June, a boon for the “thousands of local residents and businesses around Bargara who stand to benefit from more cheap solar power.” 
Member for Bundaberg Tom Smith said the Bargara battery would place the local community firmly at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution. 
“The Bargara battery will store excess low-cost solar power produced in the middle of the day before supplying it back to the local community during peak consumption in the evening,” said Smith, who noted the energy stored in the Tesla Megapack “is enough to run 478 average homes for one day”. 
“Distribution-connected batteries will be critical to enabling Queensland’s renewable energy target of 50% by 2030” continued Smith. “By basing the batteries in the community, it means renewable energy will be generated locally, stored locally, and then used locally, avoiding network energy losses.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/08/andrew-forrest-buys-up-three-cattle-stations-for-5gw-renewable-energy-hub/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 8, 2022",Andrew Forrest buys up three cattle stations for 5GW renewable energy hub,"According to the ABC, Australian mining magnate Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has continued his land grab in Western Australia to generate renewable energy with the purchase of three cattle stations in the state’s northwest. 
Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) purchased Emu Creek Station in the Pilbara and Ella Valla Station in the Gascoyne for undisclosed sums, with the sale of Yalbago Station (also in the Gascoyne) still to be finalised.  
The stations will continue to run cattle but their primary function will be to generate renewable energy to power Fortescue Metals Group’s (FMG) Eliwana iron ore mine 170 miles west of Emu Creek Station. 
According to the environmental documents FFI lodged with the WA Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) for its Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara region, which it is assumed these cattle stations were purchased for, the hub will consist of 3.33GW of solar and 2.04GW of wind spread across 10,000 hectares. In addition, the hub would also include a 9.1GWh battery.  
The hub is set to utilise a 220 kV transmission line that would connect Uaroo’s main substation to a substation at the Eliwana mine site, though this transmission line was not included in the EPA submission.

“What the greater Perth area would be using on a really, really hot day with all of the air conditioning on would be something like the energy that we’d be hoping to generate from this development,” FFI’s director-western states Maia Schweizer told ABC. 
“[Ella Valla and Yalbago Stations] are not so much supporting the decarbonisation of FMG, but they could be supporting the export of green energy in some other form, so for example green hydrogen or green ammonia,” continued Schweizer.  
FMG said the Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub will provide renewable energy to power its mining operations in the Pilbara and is a critical component of it achieving net zero emissions from its mining operations by 2030.
The miner said the renewable electricity would eventually eliminate its reliance on gas and diesel-fired generation and diesel-fuelled mobile plant such as haul trucks and trains which currently consume hundreds of millions of litres of fuel annually.
It is expected the Uaroo project would reduce the miner’s current annual carbon emissions of 2.2 million tonnes by at least 1.5 million tonnes by the end of this decade.
The renewable generation assets will be integrated with the company’s $700 million Pilbara Energy Connect program, which includes a $250 million transmission project that will install 275km of high voltage transmission lines connecting Fortescue’s mining operations in the region.
Interestingly, FFI isn’t done with its land acquisitions. “We have our eyes on a few other areas where that wind and sun is really high quality,” said Schweizer.

Floating PV has added meaningful generation to water bodies at large scales. Now a new, lightweight solution built on closed water covers can bring solar generation for C&I producers with water reservoirs.
Genap is a 70-year old company – based in Arnhem, the Netherlands – that specializes in membrane solutions for water storage in agriculture. It showed off its Genap Energy Cover this week at the Fruit Logistica trade fair in Berlin. It works with fellow Arnhem-based flexible PV manufacturer HyET Solar to glue thin-film flexible panels to the membrane.
The modules in use are HyET Solar PowerFoil 115 modules, made to custom lengths for the cover. Each module is glued in place. Lightweight styrofoam is placed between the module and cover to act as a float.
Chrétien Hendriks, business development manager for Genap, told pv magazine that the idea came from the lack of available land and the efficiency benefits of lower operating temperatures for solar on water.
“Right now the payback period is around eight years, with the aim to get it down to five to six. But the normal covers we sell have a warranty of 15 years,” said Hendriks. “We’re also looking at ways to remove already-glued modules to reuse them on new covers.”
The company’s novel use of membranes and thin-film solar secured a finalist position in Fruit Logistica’s Innovation Awards for 2022. Curiously competing with an onion that doesn’t cause tears, a cauliflower with an edible stem, a new type of tomato, and other food innovations, the Genap Energy Cover offers tangible benefits for land-scarce locations, while adding conventional anti-algae and evaporation prevention.

The company’s novel use of membranes and thin-film solar secured a finalist position in Fruit Logistica’s Innovation Awards for 2022. Curiously competing with an onion that doesn’t cause tears, a cauliflower with an edible stem, a new type of tomato, and other food innovations, the Genap Energy Cover offers tangible benefits for land-scarce locations, while adding conventional anti-algae and evaporation prevention.
Initially, the target market is local, focusing on water storage for agricultural and floristry greenhouses in the Netherlands. A pilot was placed on a reservoir at Wageningen University and Research in Bleiswijk in September 2021. The facility is approximately sized at 35 meters by 12 meters, with the overall output at 12kWp.
Hendriks said increasing the yield is a key goal. “The first generation of these panels in the test setup was around 60W/m2, rising to 120W/m2 in a year from now. And at the end, we’re aiming for around 165W/m2. It’s our first design and we think we can optimize and increase the percentage of the [membrane] that is covered in PV quite a bit higher – we’d like to go to a 90% coverage of the full floater.”
Genap expects to release the Energy Cover in the third quarter of 2022. Hendriks claimed that the capital cost of Genap’s floating, flexible PV solution is “less than half as expensive as other floating PV solutions currently available.” Maintenance is simplified with the retractable plastic-foil cover, without the heavy infrastructure of fixed panels, he said. No soiling issues have been noted, as there are cables to deter birds.
Hendriks also noted that a rooftop setup is also being explored with High yield Energy Technologies (HyET) Group, recently majority acquired by Australian-based Fortescue Future Industies. HyET is helping with weight-constrained rooftops that are unable to support the heavy structures of fixed modules.
“We’re doing an innovation at the moment with HyET Solar, which is their modules glued onto our foils, with cables already integrated,” said Hendriks. “We’ll tension them and the membrane onto existing roofs, for rooftops that cannot have too much weight for conventional frame structures and glass panels. It’s a lightweight roofing solution we’re working on.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/08/radiative-cooling-based-solar-cell-with-50%e2%80%89mw-m2-of-generation-at-night/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 8, 2022",Radiative cooling-based solar cell with 50 mW/m2 of generation at night,"From pv magazine Global. 
Researchers from Stanford University have designed a solar cell based on radiative cooling that purportedly produces electricity at night.
Radiative cooling occurs when the surface of an object absorbs less radiation from the atmosphere and emits more. As a result, the surface loses heat to the outer space and a cooling effect can be achieved without the need for power.
“Such radiative cooling effect has received significant recent interest, focusing on achieving cooling in various materials and on integration in energy-related applications, such as building cooling,” the scientist explained, noting that this flow may be used for power generation at night.
The solar cell is based on a thermoelectric generator (TEG) module that extracts power from the radiative cooler at night and extra daytime power from excess heating coming from the cell itself.
“What we managed to do here is build the whole thing from off-the-shelf components, have a very good thermal contact, and the most expensive thing in the whole setup was the thermoelectric itself,” said researcher Zunaid Omair.
The device achieved 50 mW/m2 of power generation with a clear night sky and an open-circuit voltage of 100mV, which the scientists described as significantly higher than the values achieved in previous demonstration.
“The nighttime power generation is around 10–100 mW/m2 depending on location and sky condition,” they said. “Our approach can provide nighttime standby lighting and power in off-grid and mini-grid applications, where PV cell installations are gaining popularity.”
They described their findings in “Nighttime electric power generation at a density of 50 mW/m2 via radiative cooling of a photovoltaic cell,” which was recently published in Applied Physics Letters. Radiative cooling has been applied to solar panel cooling by researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, the Purdue University in the United States, the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales in Spain, and the Jordan University of Science and Technology and the Australian College of Kuwait.
