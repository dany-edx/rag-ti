This wealth of buried assets already contributes around $1.3 billion to our GDP, a figure set to grow massively as the world electrifies over the coming decade and demand for batteries booms. But far more wealth could be on the table if Australia can manage to start value adding and diversifying its battery industries onshore, according to the report Future Charge: Building Australia’s Battery Industries, commissioned by Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre.
Western Australian company Australian Vanadium Limited (ASX: AVL) is bringing some of these propositions into reality, with endeavours ranging from classic mining to battery design to diversification into ethical cobalt supplies. The company’s managing director Vincent Algar told pv magazine Australia the company is seeking through its diversification to have “all the bases covered” for both greening the grid and the vehicle fleet.

While the Future Battery Industries’ report focuses heavily on lithium-ion, the battery chemistry at the heart of electric vehicles, Australian Vanadium is focussing on the flow battery market. Despite flow batteries technology being well established, it is no where near as prevalent as the lithium-ion makeup used by giants like Tesla.
Interest in flow batteries is steadily growing however, with a recent market study published by Global Industry Analysts projecting the global market for flow batteries to grow from US$290.5 million in 2020 to US$961.9 million by 2026, with an impressive compound annual growth rate of 22.7% over the analysis period.
Australia is home to considerable vanadium deposits – which Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL) hopes to use. In fact, Algar says the deposits in Western Australia can “easily dominate the battery supply chain for vanadium inside and outside Australia.”
AVL is currently establishing its vanadium mine in Gabanintha, which is almost smack bang in the middle of Western Australia. The Australian Vanadium Project, as its called, has been awarded Major Project Status by the federal government. Its vision, however, is bigger than simply digging up the raw materials and shipping them overseas.

“AVL is planning to construct a vanadium electrolyte manufacturing facility in WA, adding future downstream value to the vanadium when it’s extracted and providing a revenue stream for the company in the meantime,” Algar told pv magazine Australia.
AVL also recently identified a Cobalt-Nickel-Copper sulphide component in is project. “Our work with Bryah Resources (ASX:BYH), of which AVL holds 5%, has helped quantify the resource and prove recovery via normal sulphide floatation,” Algar added.
“AVL’s vanadium products will be extracted close to Geraldton from the concentrate we will produce on site at Meekatharra. The vanadium products will be used in steel markets and battery markets, specifically as the feedstock for electrolyte in vanadium redox flow batteries,” he added.
In 2016, Australian Vanadium set up subsidiary VSun to drive market demand for vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). “VRFBs’ target market is long-duration off and on-grid energy storage batteries capturing large scale renewable energy and diesel replacement,” Algar explained. “These are stationary storage batteries suited to the long life and durability.”
In January, VSun announced its plans to develop a vanadium redox flow battery for the Australian residential market, with the company previously working on a number of other off-grid and commercial projects. While the company remains primarily devoted to flow batteries, it is also seizing on opportunities to expand into new corners of the industry.

“The energy transition is also hinged upon changing over the vehicle fleet to high power batteries such as the current suite of Li-ion chemistries. Included in those chemical makeups (for example NMC – nickel, manganese, cobalt) are lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese."
https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/07/06/australias-first-privately-funded-big-battery-to-be-hosted-in-melbourne/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 6, 2021",Australia’s first privately funded big battery to be hosted in Melbourne,"Lumea, an arm of private transmission company Transgrid, on Monday announced plans for a 300 MW big battery to be fully financed from private sector without government funding. To do so, the company has launched a selective Expression of Interest (EOI) tender and is seeking proposals from suppliers and developers.
The big battery would be housed in the Deer Park Energy Hub, which Lumea described as a key source of electricity for metropolitan Melbourne. The company says the tender process will ultimately determine the optimal size and duration of the battery.
Naturally, the energy storage system will be connected to the National Electricity Market (NEM) as it is seeking to supply system reliability services to the grid which are increasingly in demand and often fairly profitable.
In April, electricity rule maker the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) proposed rewards for fast frequency services in the NEM for the first time, with the move largely hailed as a major leg up for big batteries in the country.
Australia currently has a handful of big batteries in operation, including the country’s biggest and most famous, the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, which has proven lucrative for French owner, Neoen. Australia also six more big batteries currently in construction and a bulging pipeline following what can only be described as an onslaught of battery announcements in the first few months of 2021. Those include a 500 MW / 1000 MWh battery in Western Sydney again from Neoen, which was coincidentally announced on the same day energy giant Origin proposed a 700 MW battery at its Eraring coal generator in the NSW Hunter region. Just yesterday, developer Maoneng lodged plans to construct a ‘critical’ 225 MW/450 MWh utility-scale battery at Gould Creek in South Australia.
Following the slew of battery plans, Cornwall Insight Australia’s Principal Consultant, Ben Cerini, told pv magazine Australia that it could see storage pricing in Australia ‘cannibalise’ itself. In the meantime, almost all of the country’s large-scale energy storage projects have relied on funding from government bodies like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) or the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
Lumea is hoping to demonstrate the big battery market in Australia is mature enough now to stand on its own two feet.
“Lumea is looking to demonstrate that batteries can be fully funded through the market. We know that the energy transition requires innovative pathways to reach its renewable targets. It is critical we also find new avenues to fund these projects through the market to allow the most effective use of all funding sources for lower cost energy,” Lumea’s Head of Infrastructure, Nigel Buchanan said.

Landowner and grazier Greg Fowler did initially have trepidations about how the two would get along, but said the shade of the panels have proven a smash hit with his merino flock.
“Through the summer you’d go up there and you’d drive around and only see three or four [sheep] and you’d think some of them got out,” Fowler told the ABC. “But they were just spread out along the whole area, under the panels feeding during the day.

“So they had shade all day, whereas if they were in a 300-acre open paddock, they’d be back in the trees during the heat of the day.”
Agrisolar, also known as agrivoltaics, is essentially the co-existence of agriculture such as grazing or even crop farming with solar farms. It is a way of maximising land use and allowing the continuation of traditional industries alongside new renewable sectors, with the two forming partnerships as opposed to competing.
Sheep were introduced to the Gannawarra Solar and Energy Storage Farm as part of an agrisolar trial in partnership with landowner Greg Fowler in November 2020. Edify Energy, which owns the solar farm in conjunction with majority stakeholder Wirsol, described the trial as an ‘industry benchmark’ as its the first integrated utility-scale solar and battery agrisolar partnership in Australia.
The point of difference is that the 60 MW (DC) Gannawarra Solar Farm, Victoria’s first utility-scale solar farm when it came into operation back in 2018, is also home to a big battery: the 25 MW/50 MWh Tesla Gannawarra Energy Storage System (GESS) which was retrofitted to the site grant funding by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Victorian Government.

In regards to the argisolar trial at the site, Edify Energy’s project manager Patrick Dale noted to the ABC mowing the grass on site can sometimes be difficult as the solar tracking infrastructure can be tricky to get around. Sheep, thus, offer a neat solution – keeping grass lengths down in hard to reach places and making the site easier to maintain.
He described the installation of internal fencing to accomodate the sheep as “quite easy”. He told the ABC he knows of five other solar farms which have integrated sheep grazing, though he predicts that number will increase.
Edify also noted the ‘potential for improved wool’ as part of the trial, given that some sheep farmers have reported wool improvements following agrisolar trials. Landowner and grazier Fowler said he would need more time to establish if that is the case on Gannawarra Solar Farm.

A fold-out solar umbrella design that was inspired by NASA spacecraft and origami could bring clean energy to beachfront resorts this summer and beyond.
The “Parelio for Sammontana” design is a collaboration between innovation company Carlo Ratti Associati (CRA), architect Italo Rota, and gelato-maker Sammontana.
The fold-out array is meant to be deployed in the sun, shading beachgoers and generating PV energy that feeds attachable nebulisers and coolers underneath. This provides a way to keep beachgoers, their drinks and Italian ice cream cool on hot summer days.
The project was supported by a “transformable design” proponent, Prof. Chuck Hoberman of Harvard University. He worked with Italo Rota and MIT Prof. Carlo Ratti on the design. The modular system means that multiple umbrellas can be strung together, leaving it up to resorts to be creative with how they integrate the technology.
The umbrella is 8.2 feet high, has a 10.5-foot diameter, and includes panels over the entire top. A prototype is on display in the Porta Nuova district of Milan from June 12 to Aug. 8.
The solar umbrella is one of many ways designers are finding ways to integrate pv technology into unlikely spaces such as windows and blinds.

A study by academics at Finland’s Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT) has concluded the expense of residential battery systems means they are less profitable than exporting unused electricity generated by household solar panels to the grid.
Researchers, in a paper published in Applied Energy, concluded the most valuable use of household solar electricity was for self consumption, as it avoids the taxes and grid charges associated with each kilowatt-hour of network electricity, as well as the wholesale cost of the energy.
While residential batteries increase the amount of self consumption in solar households, the paper stated, their costs outweigh the benefits they bring, meaning the simple export of excess energy to the grid, at the wholesale price, offers the best returns at current battery price levels.
“We could roughly say that battery prices would need to drop to a third of their current level for them to be a viable investment for residential power systems,” said LUT researcher and lead author of the paper, Pietari Puranen, in a press release issued by LUT on Monday.
The academics also attempted to weigh the financial returns available to solar households who sign up to be part of ‘virtual batteries’ set up by electric companies who aggregate groups of solar ‘prosumers’ – households which both consume and export solar power.
However, the researchers were unable to come to a conclusion on the merits of such systems, with LUT associate professor Antti Kosonen frustrated in his attempt to calculate the economics. “In my opinion, virtual battery storage is not particularly transparent,” he said. “At least, regular prosumers may have trouble finding out about its advantages compared to selling excess electricity to the grid.”
The findings of the Techno-economic viability of energy storage concepts combined with a residential solar photovoltaic system: A case study from Finland paper, also published on the ScienceDirect website, were based on the electricity import and export data from two detached houses in Finland over a three-year period, and the corresponding electricity market prices.
The academics found the costliness of residential batteries rises with their storage capacity at a faster rate than the economic benefits they offer by increasing household consumption levels.
“Many still think batteries are the best, or even a necessary solution for deriving a profit from self-produced electricity,” said Jero Ahola, LUT professor of energy efficiency in electricity-driven systems. “However, current battery prices rarely make the investment profitable.”
