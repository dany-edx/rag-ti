The Australian government classes 26 resource commodities as critical minerals, defining them as metallic or non-metallic elements essential for the functioning of modern technologies and economies. They include lithium, rare earths, graphite, vanadium and others, and are used in technologies like electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, and big batteries. 

As of Tuesday, June 13, 33 major ASX-listed critical mineral stocks came to be worth more than the 25 companies within the ASX All Ordinaries Gold Index, which were valued at $86.1 billion.
Home to historic mining booms in the past, Australia’s mining industry is highly developed and has managed to rapidly move into the burgeoning sector. Various politicians and lobby groups have pointed to critical minerals as Australia’s ace card in the global race to become a renewables superpower as it is home to both bountiful deposits and industry know-how.
In a recent report, consultancy Climate Energy Finance noted Australia’s pipeline of investment proposals in the critical minerals sector “accelerated dramatically in 2022” to value of $10 billion.

Meanwhile, Commonwealth agency Geoscience Australia found Australia’s economic inventories for many critical minerals soared in 2021, including platinum group elements, up 131%; scandium, up 21%; vanadium, up 10%; and cobalt, up 6%. Australia is already the world’s top lithium producer, with nearly all of it coming from Western Australia.

While the market growth holds vast economic promise, the industry has significant environmental impacts – a fact often brushed over by clean energy industries which enjoy touting themselves as ‘planet savers.’
A recent report from the Jubilee Australia Research Centre warned the race to capitalise on “staggering” demand could see Australia dig up more critical minerals than necessary.

Jubilee Australia Research Centre Executive Director, Dr Luke Fletcher, urged government to pause and reflect to ensure the new mining push does not repeat the mistakes and damage of past mining booms. The report also questioned global mineral demand projections, suggesting they may be inflated since most fail to factor in supply from future recycling. 
The Australian government is currently preparing a revised critical minerals strategy, and appears to be planning to rapidly accelerate the growth of the sector with a broader view of breaking China’s domination– a role Australia’s allies are eager for it to step into, given energy security is front of mind.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/14/60-new-renewable-energy-eiss-slated-for-nsw-in-next-12-to-18-months/,"MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 14, 2023",60 new renewable energy EISs slated for NSW in next 12 to 18 months,"With as many as 60 additional environmental impact statements, or EIS documents, expected to be lodged in New South Wales over the next year to 18 months, the state’s strategy to replace coal generators is gaining momentum.
Environmental impact statements are documents which outline the impacts of a proposed project on its surrounding area and are put on public display via government portals for assessment before projects are determined.
New South Wales (NSW) is not the only state experiencing an acceleration in its renewable energy rollout, but with its dense population, entrenched agricultural industry, and Renewable Energy Zone-based design, it is already encountering pronounced community frustrations.

It is worth reiterating here, these 60-odd proposed projects sit not only within the five renewable energy zones (REZs), but pertain to endeavours across the entirety of NSW.
While the intention of EIS documents is to make clear to the general public precisely what projects will involve, these documents tend to be exceedingly long and are often complicated by jargon and technical details.
Moreover, it can be difficult to quantify the information they contain, including traffic and environmental impact assessments. Most renewable energy projects are proposed in regional and rural Australia, where there is more access to land. Given how small some rural councils tend to be in Australia, they are often limited in their capacity to make informed comments on projects and judge their costs and benefits, Warwick Giblin, who advises local governments on renewable energy projects and is an Adjunct Professor at the University of New England, previously told pv magazine Australia.

As a result of lobbying, the NSW government recently acknowledged the strain this influx of renewable energy proposals is putting on councils within the Central West Orana REZ, awarding the Warrumbungle, Dubbo, and Mid-Western councils an additional $250,000 per year for next seven years to help resource this additional load.
In NSW renewable energy generation projects are defined as State Significant Developments (SSDs). Projects such as major transmission lines are deemed State Significant Infrastructure (SSI). While local government has an opportunity to examine the adequacy of EISs for both types of development, SSI projects are in effect mandated by the state government and there is limited scope for councils or the general public to overturn such a development. 
Councils have a bit more power when it comes to State Significant Developments like renewable generation in that they can choose to support, remain neutral or oppose projects. If they choose to oppose such a project, determination is deferred to the Independent Planning Commission of NSW. Projects are also directed to the Commission if more than 50 public objections are lodged in response to the EIS.

The newly-minted NSW Energy Minister, Penny Sharpe, addressed the ‘public interest’  issue at the ESG Summit held in Sydney earlier this month, saying: “We have to be able to answer the question asked by communities hosting projects like new renewable energy infrastructure: ‘What is in it for us?’”
“The success in being able to answer that question, to be able to communicate the need for urgency of action and to have the right policy, communication and support in place, will determine how quickly these projects can be delivered,” Sharpe added.
In this address, the minister also spoke about social licence, an issue increasingly tied to the energy transition, noting projects which lacked social licence risked slowing the energy grid’s decarbonisation.
A lack of social licence, of course, spans many business enterprises. What is unique to the renewables industry is how much, cumulatively, these projects will shape the physical landscape of regional and rural Australia, especially within renewable energy zones.

“This will be the biggest change in this region, on the landscape, since white men turned up with sheep in the 1840s,” Sam Coupland, Major of the Armidale Regional Council which falls within the New England Renewable Energy Zone, previously told pv magazine Australia. “It fundamentally changes everything.”
In theory, project EIS documents are supposed to assess cumulative impacts of projects within a region. This assessment currently falls to project developers – something Giblin has described as questionable.
Developers, Giblin noted, are working within a competitive free market environment, so by nature they are limited in the information they can access about competitor’s projects.
Rather, Giblin thinks the assessment of cumulative impacts should fall to the NSW Department of Planning and Environment, which has a mandate for regional planning.  
“It needs whole-of-government planning to address cumulative impacts and to deliver social services and benefits to these rural communities,” Giblin said.
In the current structure, cumulative impacts tend to be inadequately assessed, according to Giblin. 
In terms of project’s social impacts, there are now substantial social impact assessment, or SIA, guidelines in place for standardising EIS documents. Even with these in place, converting assessments into actual tangible benefits for communities remains a challenge, according to Giblin.
Giblin feels few projects to date have managed to deliver or promise tangible benefits for host communities, resulting in communities still struggling to see why they should play host. 
Given the state government has decarbonisation targets to meet and renewable projects have investors to answer to, there is a growing impetus on solving issues around social licence.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/14/australia-commissions-first-big-battery-at-a-former-coal-site/,"ENERGY STORAGE,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 14, 2023",Australia commissions first big battery at a former coal site,"One of Australia’s most historic coal hubs, Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, has today seen the commissioning of the nation’s first big battery to go into operations within a former coal site. The 150 MW/150 MWh battery was jointly funded and developed by French energy giant Engie and Eku Energy, the battery storage platform of Macquarie Group.
The Hazelwood battery is believed to be Australia’s largest privately funded utility-scale battery to date.

The commissioning of the Hazelwood battery brings Australia to its first gigawatt of installed battery storage, Energy Synapse founder Marija Petkovic recently pointed out.
Hazelwood’s battery facility has been supplied, and will be operated and maintained, by US-headquartered firm Fluence. The project is the first to use Fluence’s Gridstack battery system, which the company says is built for the “most demanding applications” including flexible peaking capacity, and frequency regulation. The facility incorporates 342 modular Fluence Cubes.

While the battery currently only has one hour of duration, it is believed the project will eventually grow – following a broader trend in Australia towards supersized batteries. “With [the battery’s] access to transmission and available space at site, Hazelwood is the perfect location for an asset that can grow in depth and duration, increasing the hosting capacity for renewables,” Engie’s Australian CEO, Rik De Buyserie, said. 
The Hazelwood site is reported to have access to 1.6 GW of dormant transmission capacity.

The coal-fired Hazelwood Power Station was built in the 1960s and closed in 2017, giving just five months notice before its retirement. Power prices in Victoria soared as a consequence, and the debacle led to state governments to impose much stricter rules around notice periods of generation retirements.
While Hazelwood is the first coal-site battery to come into operation, it belongs within a much larger movement. Coal plants are ideal sites for big batteries thanks to their grid connection and existing infrastructure, and there are a huge number of retired and retiring coal plants today which either have big batteries in construction or planning. 

In the Latrobe Valley alone, AGL is constructing a 200 MW/800 MWh battery at its Loy Yang power station. Meanwhile, EnergyAustralia is planing 350 MW/1.4 GWh big battery at Yallourn coal-fired power station, set to retire by mid-2028.
“The Latrobe Valley has been the home of Victoria’s energy generation for decades and new investment in technologies like energy storage this will help solidify its role in our renewable energy future,” Victoria’s Minister for Energy and Resources, Lily D’Ambrosio, said.
She opened the Hazelwood battery on Wednesday, saying the project plays a key role in achieving Victoria’s energy storage targets of at least 2.6 GW of storage capacity by 2030 and at least 6.3 GW by 2035.

German inverter manufacturer SMA and South Korea’s Samsung have partnered to facilitate the integration of heat pumps with residential PV systems.
The two companies developed a new cloud-to-cloud system that allows PV systems with SMA inverters to be integrated into Samsung’s SmartThings smart home ecosystem, which controls and monitors a Samsung heat pump installed at the property.
“The good thing for users is how simple it is to integrate Samsung Eco Heating Systems,” said Jan Van Laethem, executive vice president of SMA’s home business segment. “Thanks to the interconnected communications for energy and smart home management, they can easily manage domestic appliances that generate and consume energy.”
In addition to heat pumps, the SMA Sunny Home Manager 2.0 can be used to integrate energy generators, battery storage systems, wall boxes, and home appliances, SMA said in a statement.
In a recent study, SolarPower Europe said that heat pumps and residential solar benefit from a symbiotic effect, with households in Germany, Spain, and Italy standing to more than triple their savings by pairing PV with heat pumps.

Israeli inverter manufacturer SolarEdge is unveiling two new power optimisers for residential and commercial PV systems at Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany.
“In the residential segment, the company is introducing the S500A power optimiser for short strings,” said SolarEdge. “This new product allows for a cost-efficient design of smaller rooftop systems with higher power modules. Following a growing demand for higher power modules across the markets in Europe, the S500A can be used on systems with as few as six modules using the SolarEdge home short string three phase inverter and the SolarEdge home single phase wave/hub inverter, or 10 modules using any SolarEdge residential three phase inverter.”
The S500A has a rated input DC power of 500 W with a maximum efficiency of 99.5% and a weighted efficiency of 98.6%. The dimensions of the S500A are 129 mm x 165 mm x 45 mm, and it weighs 790 g.
“For the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, the company is introducing the 2:1 S1400 power optimiser for high-input, bifacial, and high-power 700W modules, including G12 modules,” SolarEdge said. “The increased output current allows the PV system to be designed with fewer, yet more powerful strings, resulting in a typical around 30% reduction in DC balance of system costs.”
The S1400 has a rated input DC power of 1.4 kW with a maximum efficiency of 99.5% and a weighted efficiency of 98.8%. The dimensions of the S1400 are 129 mm x 155 mm x 52 mm, and it weighs 1.087 kg. The device is designed to connect to two PV modules in series and includes a 25-year warranty. The optimisers come with an IP68 enclosure and support a maximum system voltage of 1,000 V.
“Both new power optimisers include SolarEdge’s multi-layered suite of safety features,” the manufacturer stated. “The SafeDCTM feature allows the PV systems’ DC voltage to be automatically reduced to touch-safe levels (1V DC per module), in grid failures or when the inverter is shut down. The Rapid Shutdown feature enables installers to activate SafeDCTM at the flip of a switch, discharging the conductors to safe voltage levels within just 30 seconds.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/14/global-rooftop-pv-additions-soar-by-50-to-118-gw-in-2022/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JUNE 14, 2023",Global rooftop PV additions soar by 50% to 118 GW in 2022,"From pv magazine Global
SolarPower Europe published the latest edition of its Global Market Outlook 2023-2027 during Intersolar Europe this week in Munich, Germany.
It says the world installed 239 GW of new solar capacity in 2022, equivalent to a 45% annual growth rate – the highest since 2016. It was another record year for solar, driven once again by China, with almost 100 GW added in a single year and a 72% growth rate. The United States held onto second place, despite a 6.9% drop in installations to 21.9 GW, followed by India with 17.4 GW, and Brazil with 10.9 GW. Spain is also becoming Europe’s largest PV market with 8.4 GW, according to SolarPower Europe. The figures differ slightly from other research firms. BloombergNEF, for example, said that global capacity additions hit 268 GW in 2022.
Overall, 26 countries added more than 1 GW of solar in 2022. These countries include China, the United States, India, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Japan, Poland, The Netherlands, Australia, South Korea, Italy, France, Taiwan, Chile, Denmark, Turkey, Greece, South Africa, Austria, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Hungary, Pakistan, Israel, and Switzerland.
The rooftop segment grew by 50% last year, with installations reaching 118 GW from 79 GW in 2021. Utility-scale solar grew by 41% to hit 121 GW, despite high module prices in 2021 and 2022.
“Large-scale systems remained the main contributor to the total capacity, but the shares of utility and rooftop solar have not been this close to each in three years; utility-scale contributed to 50.5% of total installations and rooftop contributed to 49.5%,” said SolarPower Europe.
Among the top 20 solar markets, Australia, South Korea, and Japan installed less rooftop solar compared to the previous year, with reductions of 2.3 GW, 1.1 GW, and 0.5 GW, respectively. However, all other top 20 markets posted growth in the rooftop segment.
“The most impressive progress could be witnessed in Brazil, which added an additional 5.3 GW. This giant 193% growth rate from 2021 was pushed by the rush of installations that sought to benefit [from] the generous conditions of the net-metering scheme before the rule changes in 2023,” said SolarPower Europe.
Italy and Spain posted rooftop market growth rates of 127% and 105%, respectively, driven by residential installations in Italy and self-consumption in Spain. Denmark, India, Austria, China, Greece, and South Africa all experienced rooftop growth rates exceeding 50%. China led the market with 51.1 GW of installed systems, accounting for 54% of its total installations in 2022.
SolarPower Europe predicts a 35% growth in the rooftop segment in 2023, with an anticipated addition of 159 GW. The figure could rise to 183 GW by 2024 and potentially reach 268 GW by 2027, according to the medium scenario. The growth will be more consistent compared to 2022, as it will be driven by energy prices returning to lower levels.
On a global scale, the utility-scale segment is expected to reach 182 GW in 2023, marking a 51% growth from the previous year. The forecast for 2024 is 218 GW, with further growth projected to reach 349 GW by 2027.
“The forecast is bright – between 341 and 402 GW of solar will be installed worldwide in 2023. From a total TW solar fleet today, the world could be installing 1 TW of solar annually by the end of the decade – hitting up to 800 GW per year already in 2027,” concluded SolarPower Europe.
