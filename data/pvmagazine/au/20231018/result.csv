The study, published in the journal Solar Energy, looked at Australia’s solar irradiance and variability under a high emissions scenario – the climate trajectory Australia is currently tracking.
“Our study reveals Eastern Australia will experience an increase in solar resource availability and episode length in the future, indicating the probability of more stable and reliable future energy output,” Shukla Poddar, lead author of the study and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the UNSW School of Photovoltaics and Renewable Energy Engineering, said. “This region is predicted to experience a reduction in the lulls and frequency of intermittent and overcast days in the future, highlighting reduced future intermittency.”
“On the contrary, some regions in Western Australia may experience increased intermittency issues, a key challenge for Australia’s future energy systems, and they will likely need to rely more heavily on energy storage solutions to ensure grid stability in the future,” Poddar said.
“As the climate warms, managing these weather-induced power fluctuations will be a growing challenge, so we need modelling to help better predict and prepare for these changing dynamics,” she added.
In the study, researchers also assessed the future solar resource expected in two major Australian solar projects: SunCable and New England Solar Farm.
SunCable, in the Northern Territory, is seeking to build the world’s largest solar farm, among other ventures. The 720 MW New England Solar Farm in New South Wales is Australia’s second-largest solar project, and recently entered its first 400 MW stage one facility into operations.
The team found the New England project will likely enjoy favourable conditions in the future, with more clear-sky days and an expected net increase in the long-term power generation capacity. 
On the other hand, SunCable did not fair as well in the modelling, which found the project may experience an increase in intermittency issues in the future, suggesting the need for more energy storage systems and solar resource forecasting.
“Understanding the reliability of future solar generation can inform the design of these large-scale solar PV sites – where they should expand development and where they might need to invest more in storage technologies,” UNSW Associate Professor Merlinde Kay, co-author of the study and lecturer in the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said.
“The next step would be to conduct a synergy study of how wind energy can complement solar in a future warmer climate, as we know hybrid systems can be advantageous for generating consistent energy supply,” the Associate Professor added.
“We also need to look at how disruptive extreme events, such as bushfires, will impact renewable energy generation and grid operation moving into the future, given they’re likely to increase in frequency and intensity.”

It says the novel concept increases temperatures in the process from 500°C to 800°C, and possibly over 1000°C.
This, it says, holds promise for decarbonising heavy industry, which can require extreme heat for processing. It also overcomes some of the limitations of heat transfer fluids traditionally used in concentrated solar thermal (CST) technologies, the CSIRO says.

The heated ceramic particles can store energy as heat for up to 15 hours, the government agency added.
Just as a quick recap, concentrated solar thermal (CST) technologies use mirrors to concentrate sunlight, converting it to heat, which can then be stored or used to generate electricity.
The CSIRO operates a CST pilot plant in Newcastle, New South Wales, known as the CSIRO Energy Centre. It has around 400 mirrors. At this research facility, the team has been experimenting with new ways to store its concentrated solar energy, looking beyond commonly used heat transfer fluids like molten salt and old – which Wes Stein, the CSIRO’s Chief Scientist for Solar Technologies, says can only handle temperatures of 600°C and 400°C respectively.
The ceramic particles, only the other hand, can endure temperatures over 1000°C. “These particles not only absorb the sun’s heat but also store it, simplifying the system and reducing costs,” the CSIRO said.

The “falling” component of this new method refers to the team using gravity to heat the dark-hued ceramic particles. “The particles are dropped from a hopper at the top of the tower, and heated as they pass through focused solar energy,” the CSIRO said. “Unlike traditional methods that rely on steel tubes, the particles fall freely. This approach avoids the heat limitations of steel. Once heated, they’re stored in a silo. When needed, they’re used to produce steam for power generation or other industrial tasks.”
In developing this free falling method, however, the team encountered some difficulties. “When particles fell too fast, they spread out. This let sunlight through and reduced efficiency,” the CSIRO said. To fix this, the team landed on a ‘catch and release’ method where, after falling a short distance, particles land in a trough, slowing them before they were allowed to fall into the next trough.

Dr Jin-Soo Kim, who leads the CSIRO’s solar technologies team, said the group recently achieved a critical milestone temperature of 803°C at the falling particle receiver using the new process.
“This is significant because it creates the opportunity for greater renewable energy storage when combined with our patented heat exchanger,” Jin-Soo said. “Over eight years of development and thousands of hours were invested to reach this outcome.”
“The CSIRO CST falling particle technology can provide renewable heat at the same high temperature that coal and gas deliver, and over multiple hours,” Dominic Zaal, Director of the Australian Solar Thermal Research Institute (ASTRI), said.
“In addition to being an ideal technology to replace current fossil-fuel based power generation assets, it is also an excellent technology to meet higher temperature requirements for mineral processing,” Zaal added.

On Wednesday 27th September 2023 we wrote about ‘Another (Tesla) big battery fire in the NEM … this one at Bouldercombe BESS in QLD’.
1)  A day later I was surprised to see that ‘Bouldercombe battery has started charging again (Thursday evening 28th September 2023)’.
2)  I saw (at the time) that this was only brief spurt, but did not have time (or see a real need) to update that article.  Probably should have!
Following my article, Giles also noted this on RenewEconomy here … but unfortunately that seems to have sprouted legs and been misinterpreted a number of times on social media, such as by Warwick Johnston in the past 24 hours here on LinkedIn (a couple weeks later):

Now, batteries are wonderful things, but they are not miracle workers immune from their own operational challenges ….
Here’s a view of what’s happened over the past 30 days with both sides of the battery over the past 30 days … so spanning a couple weeks prior to the fire and the aftermath, as seen through the ‘Bids & Offers’ widget in ez2view:

This is more what I expected to see (i.e. following a fire of unknown cause at any industrial plant – especially during a commissioning period).
Of particular interest is the green dotted ‘PASA Avail’ line, which shows how much capacity is available to the AEMO (even if it’s not offered at any price).  See that these green dotted lines drop to 0MW with the fire and have not yet returned….
As we can see, apart from the brief blip on Thursday 28th September (for reasons I’ve not explored), it has not run operationally since the fire.
Remembering that I’d been pointed at the Genex company page on the ASX website for their Wednesday announcement about ‘minor fire incident at Bouldercombe Battery Project’, there is currently no subsequent update:

The 4-3 decision has been closely watched across Australia for its implications on how EVs are taxed here and what exactly can be collected by governments for their use of roads. It was reported that other Australian states were considering similar taxes. 
Hopes of such moves now appear moot with the High Court deeming the tax an “excise,” an inland tax on goods, that only the Commonwealth government has the power to apply, according to section 90 of the Constitution.
In 2021, Victoria attempted to levy a 2.8c per kilometre tax on electric vehicles, with EV owners Christopher Vanderstock and Kathleen Davies taking the government to court over the tax that same year. The High Court’s full decision is available here.
Australia is still lagging the world in its uptake of EVs, but Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, recently said EVs now represent almost 9% of new car sales, up from just 2% in May 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/18/rmit-software-tool-unlocks-bipv-design/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",MARIJA MAISCH,"OCTOBER 18, 2023",RMIT software tool unlocks BIPV design,"BIPV is one of the most promising pathways to net-zero energy buildings, representing an opportunity for hundreds of gigawatts of solar-generating building components to be installed worldwide. However, integrating BIPV into design is not easy, given the vast range of data and technical factors to be considered and the difficulties that designers and developers face in choosing and sourcing materials.
“BIPV design and management is a complex process which involves requirements geophysical, technical, economical and environment factors throughout the life cycle of the system, ranging from acquiring architectural visual effects to higher solar insolation in given location, efficient energy generation and economic operation and maintenance of the BIPV system,” Rebecca Yang, a researcher for RMIT’s Solar Energy Application Group, told pv magazine. “Lack of consideration for PV integration of the building envelope in the early design phase is one of the main reasons for complicating the design and construction process of BIPV systems.”
Yang has led the development of a new tool, BIPV Enabler, which is the first of its kind to combine BIPV product, regulation, technical, economic and construction data. The tool was developed with Australian data and features maps, a 3D shape library, solar visualisations, hourly weather data and pricing information for materials and feed-in tariffs.
“The Zero Carbon Australia Buildings Plan promotes BIPV to reach a full uptake on suitable buildings by 2030. BIPV is at Technology Readiness Level 9, but adoption has been slow in Australia because it reframes distributed solar energy as a building product which needs close collaborations between the PV and building industries,” Yang said. “It is difficult to develop a business case for a BIPV project without accessible information and value-for-money solutions.”
Yang said that BIPV Enabler is the perfect solution for building designers and developers looking to select the right solar option, be it for a new build or an existing building, by retrofitting BIPV.
“We’re making integrated-solar a more attractive option to developers, slicing the time it would normally take to research and implement incognito solar devices,” she said. “Our software aims to translate technical complexities into a packaged, user-friendly platform that integrates product, technical, economic and construction data to create the best BIPV solution for individual building projects.”
Yang, the director of the Australian PV Institute and head of the BIPV Alliance, said that the platform serves building professionals in making design choices and enables PV suppliers to showcase the value of their products to clients.
In BIPV Enabler, users have several key functionalities. They include the ability to select building types and project locations with an interactive map. Users can also create building models using the 3D geometric building shapes library or default arch and draft workbenches within FreeCAD. In addition, the platform allows users to visualize the solar irradiance on the building envelope.
Users can also choose BIPV modules from the product database, which enables the generation of a comprehensive report on the energy output of the BIPV designs. This report encompasses economic and environmental considerations. Users can perform both automatic and manual placement of the BIPV modules to suit their specific needs.
Another valuable feature is the ability to estimate wind loads for BIPV design, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Lastly, the platform allows users to optimise their BIPV designs, taking into account factors such as tilt angles, BIPV product options, window-to-wall ratios, and distance-to-length ratios.
The BIPV product database consists of records of about 80 Australian and international BIPV modules. The data are presented with 13 major attribute categories and 136 sub-attribute categories of BIPV products based on local and international building design codes and construction-related regulatory requirements.
The database contains information on the cost of BIPV modules, including their maintenance expenses. Users can choose to create customised BIPV modules if they prefer. Users additionally have the flexibility to select one or more BIPV modules for either the economic analysis or the optimisation process.
The BIPV modules can also be organised based on parameters such as the module technology, transparency, color, patterns frame type. The most dominant module technology in the BIPV Enabler database is mono-crystalline, followed by copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe). More than a half of the products are colourful.
The software, funded by RMIT and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, was initially announced last year and opened to users mid this year. “We provide a one-year usage for free at this stage,” Yang said.
She claimed that with minimum effort and some funding support, the RMIT team could redesign BIPV Enabler to cover other countries. It is now on the lookout for such collaborative opportunities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/18/adelaide-cuts-emissions-at-train-stations-starts-testing-hydrogen-buses/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,"OCTOBER 18, 2023","Adelaide cuts emissions at train stations, starts testing hydrogen buses","The South Australian government has just launched the converted hybrid diesel trains into passenger services in Adelaide on the Outer Harbour, Grange and Belair lines. This marks the end of the test phases of hybrid diesel trains, the latest of numerous introductions and tests of more sustainable transport in the South Australian capital, including hydrogen-powered buses, battery-powered buses and fully electric trains. Two hydrogen-powered buses will now also be entering testing phases, and these will be joined by pure electric buses at the end of this month.
The two-car diesel hybrid train entering passenger services is the first of 44 diesel railcars to be retrofitted with the Energy Storage and Recovery System by late 2024. The new systems enable the trains to turn off their polluting engines at stations so that commuters are spared the noise and smell of diesel engines. The trains will still run on fossil fuels, with the batteries gathering kinetic energy from the trains’ braking systems and storing it in a battery system. When the trains are stopped at stations, their systems switch to electrical energy, cutting out the smell and sound of the diesel engine while the train is stationary.
While it keeps polluting vehicles in operation, the retrofitting makes the most of the service life of old trains while alleviating some of the more unpleasant and palpable effects of diesel engines – the smell and the noise. The retrofitted diesel trains have been covered and rebranded with bright green wrap.
South Australian Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Tom Koutsantonis, explained: “Reducing our environmental impact and using significantly less fuel, this new hybrid train also offers a great customer experience, particularly at Adelaide Railway Station where the diesel engine can remain off – reducing noise and fumes for those on board and in the station.”
The hybrid diesel trains are said to have energy savings of “up to 20%,” and better fuel efficiency should result in savings of $1.3 million (USD 830,000) per year. Earlier this year, the government predicted that operational would be reduced by $4 million over the remaining service life of the fleet. The upgrading of the state’s 70 diesel rail cars is part of a $10 million 2021-22 State Budget initiative.
But more than just saving on fuel costs and rebranding fossil-fuelled vehicles with the bright green, minister Koutsantonis explains: “We are about exploring any technologies or solutions to decarbonise and deliver a net zero-emissions public transport system.”
This is also the case with more sustainable and longer-lasting technologies, such as Adelaide’s purely battery electric buses, hydrogen-fuelled buses and purely electric trains. Here, the vehicles not only have zero tailpipe emissions, but they also represent longer-lasting infrastructural developments more integrated into Australian domestic industries.  In August this year, the South Australian government announced that the 42-kilometre-long Gawler rail line would begin running with all-electric trains as another new train entered service.
Along with the diesel hybrid trains, two hydrogen-electric buses began trials in the South Australian capital with two Foton Hydrogen Fuel Cell Buses. These will be joined by fully battery-electric buses by the end this month. Experience from other continents shows that purely battery-electric heavy-duty vehicles and hydrogen-fueled electric vehicles have different advantages for different circumstances.
While hydrogen-powered heavy-duty vehicles do well on steep terrain and extremely cold weather – both elements of which affect the efficiency of batteries – deciding between hydrogen and purely battery-powered heavy-duty vehicles also involves a number of different, more complex factors, such as the availability and cost of green hydrogen, and the regional energy circumstances. For example, while storing energy in batteries is more effective for frequent discharge, hydrogen becomes more cost-effective when storing large amounts of energy for longer periods, and even more so where it can be generated close to the source of renewable energy, therefore bypassing energy transport costs. How the two very complimentary technologies cover transport services is a matter of trial and error, now being undertaken by Adelaide Metro.
While Adelaide is flat and warm, hydrogen-powered heavy-duty vehicles are conceivably well-suited to Australian terrain with greater distances. Hydrogen fuel cell systems have greater power density than batteries and can, therefore, run for longer periods before refuelling.
The new hydrogen-powered Foton buses will be fuelled with green hydrogen produced at Tonsley Innovation District. When announcing the hydrogen bus trials at the end of July, the government stated: “This trial will exploit innovative local supply chain solutions, gauge the economic benefits of renewable energy and harness local talent as part of the South Australian government’s pioneering work to support local industry into a green future.”
Elsewhere in the world, the USA just announced a USD $7 billion ($11 billion) package for hydrogen hubs, which is set to become a magnet for talent and investment, while Alstom – the company providing Adelaide’s zero-emission trains – is being set back in the UK as the government cuts funding to its Aventra programme, days after ministers scrapped the Birmingham to Manchester leg of HS2, a new high-speed railway that is supposed to form the backbone of Britain’s transport network.
These kinds of policy decisions affect the economic environment of clean technologies. Countries investing in these technologies snap up opportunities and skills left dangling by those countries unable to commit. Earlier this month, the Australian government opened to Expressions of Interest for its $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program, which seeks to bridge the commercial gap between the cost of producing green hydrogen and the market price for large-scale projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/18/mit-scientists-develop-csp-system-to-produce-hydrogen/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",LIOR KAHANA,"OCTOBER 18, 2023",MIT scientists develop CSP system to produce hydrogen,"From pv magazine Global
MIT researchers have developed a new CSP system to produce green hydrogen. The system, which is currently in the conceptual stage, aims to use up to 40% of solar heat for green fuel generation – a significant improvement from previous systems, which only achieved a 7% utilisation rate.
“The increase in efficiency could drive down the system’s overall cost, making solar thermochemical hydrogen (STCH) a potentially scalable, affordable option to help decarbonise the transportation industry,” the scientists said. “It is a big step toward realising solar-made fuels.”
Similar to other STCH designs, the conceptual system can be built around an existing CSP plant, absorbing the receiver’s heat and directing it to split water and produce hydrogen. However, there is a novel two-step thermochemical reaction at the heart of the new system.
“In the first step, water in the form of steam is exposed to a metal. This causes the metal to grab oxygen from steam, leaving hydrogen behind,” the scientists said. “Once hydrogen is separated, the oxidised (or rusted) metal is reheated in a vacuum, which acts to reverse the rusting process and regenerate the metal. With the oxygen removed, the metal can be cooled and exposed to steam again to produce more hydrogen. This process can be repeated hundreds of times.”
The efficiency of this process is related to its train-like design, with box-shaped reactors running on a circular track. Each reactor in the train would house the metal repeatedly going through different thermochemical stations.
“Each reactor would first pass through a hot station, where it would be exposed to the sun’s heat at temperatures of up to 1,500 C. This extreme heat would effectively pull oxygen out of a reactor’s metal,” the group said. “That metal would then be in a ‘reduced’ state – ready to grab oxygen from steam. For this to happen, the reactor would move to a cooler station at temperatures around 1,000 C, where it would be exposed to steam to produce hydrogen.”
Another improvement in the system is its ability to recover most of the heat used in the process. It does so by allowing reactors on opposite sides of the circular train-like track to exchange heat through thermal radiation. In addition, a second set of reactors circle around the first train, moving in the opposite direction and operating in cooler temperatures. This allows the evacuation of oxygen from the hotter inner train, without the need for energy-consuming mechanical pumps.
“When fully implemented, this system would be housed in a little building in the middle of a solar field,” said researcher Aniket Patankar. “Inside the building, there could be one or more trains each having about 50 reactors. And we think this could be a modular system, where you can add reactors to a conveyor belt, to scale up hydrogen production.”
The research team said it will build a prototype of the system in the coming year.
“We’re thinking of hydrogen as the fuel of the future, and there’s a need to generate it cheaply and at scale,” said the study’s lead author, Ahmed Ghoniem.
