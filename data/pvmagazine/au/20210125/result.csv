It’s expensive to replace electricity infrastructure, and edge-of-grid communities are often left powerless for long periods of time after disaster strikes.
The study, Network Resilience — Potential benefits of a requirement to provide for resilience, assessed more than 2,000 small towns, villages and hamlets in bushfire and cyclone risk areas across the National Electricity Market, calculating the savings in avoided outages and line replacements if the communities were self-sufficient in energy supply in the event that extreme conditions were to isolate them from the grid or bring down their electricity network.

The net economic benefit of transitioning these combined communities to SAPS was found to be between $980 million and $1.5 billion, but for the vast majority of towns the investment in stand-alone infrastructure only stacks up if the advantages of improved resilience — as opposed to pure cost-benefit analysis — are taken into account.
The study defines resilience as “the capacity of communities to prepare for, absorb and recover from natural hazard events and to learn, adapt and transform in ways that enhance these capacities in the face of future events”.
Between 192 and 244 communities were found to have a positive business case for going off grid, given the expectation of increasing climate risk.

As the Total Environment Centre’s (TEC) energy market advocate, Mark Byrne points out, “Bushfires and other climate risks are increasing the cost of maintaining electricity supply, especially in rural and remote parts of Australia.”
Natural disaster and hazard events can affect electricity infrastructure in a number of ways, including strong winds and falling trees bringing down power poles and overhead lines; floodwaters inundating substations and underground assets, rendering them unusable; and bushfires burning through above-ground assets. 
In addition, network infrastructure can itself spark bushfires on extreme-weather days.
The report found that in 2020 three applications were submitted by networks to recover “an unprecedented $42.67 million from customers as a result of the recent bushfire and severe weather events”.
The probability that such events will increase in frequency given the lack of concerted global effort to make meaningful reductions in carbon emissions, will result in increases in the cost of insurance to network service providers — an impost that will also ultimately be borne by customers.
Existing electricity rules, says Byrne, do not require distribution networks to consider how escalating climate risks change the business case for different models of supplying energy in the event that infrastructure is knocked out — they just tend to rebuild.
The findings of the Network Resilience report, which was funded by Energy Consumers Australia, will now be used as the basis for the TEC to later this year submit a rule change request to the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) that would explicitly require network businesses to provide for resilience when rebuilding infrastructure to serve edge-of-grid communities.
In Western Australia both state-government-owned energy suppliers, Western Power and Horizon Power, have successfully transitioned far-flung properties and communities to standalone energy systems, and achieved significant savings in the process.
October last year saw Western Power complete the Stage 1 rollout of stand-alone power systems (each comprising a solar array, battery and back-up generator) to 52 properties throughout the Mid West, Goldfields, eastern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions. It calculates that even with servicing the systems throughout their expected life cycle, the utility will save $6 million dollars on not having to refurbish the network to ensure reliability of supply to those properties.
The rollout was preceded by a trial of stand-alone power systems at six properties, launched in 2016; over the three years of the trial, it was found that 90% of the power used was generated by solar (showing minimal reliance on the back-up diesel generators) and that the properties avoided more than 200 hours of power interruptions.
Byrne emphasises that there is “no substitute for decarbonising the energy system, but we need to recognise that climate change is here already …. so we need to plan accordingly”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/25/australian-world-first-domestic-hydrogen-battery-signs-an-iconic-investor/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JANUARY 25, 2021",Australian world-first domestic hydrogen battery signs an iconic investor,"From 1868 to 2006, Gowings men’s department store was a cornerstone of Sydney city life, a towering 12 storeys built in what was known as “commercial palazzo style” on the intersection of Market and George Streets; last week the investment company Gowing Bros, which has existed in parallel for much of that time, and has survived the iconic suits, trousers, camping-equipment and barbershop business, has become a cornerstone investor in LAVO, an Australian “lifestyle company” developing domestic hydrogen energy-storage technology.
In research partnership with the University of New South Wales’ Hydrogen Energy Research Centre (HERC), LAVO has produced the world’s first residential/commercial hydrogen battery, which stores 40 kWh of energy — that’s three times the capacity of a Tesla Powerwall 2, at 13.5 kWh.
It has the potential to reshape how rooftop solar-generated energy is stashed for use when the sun goes down, or the grid grinds into blackout.
Alan Yu, CEO and Executive Director of LAVO says the system is “the culmination of decades of research”, and the hard work of an ecosystem of design and manufacturing partners, such as engineering and design firm GHD; fuel-cell technologists Nedstack; and Australian industrial design consultancy D+I.
“Having Gowings on board is a huge vote of confidence in the work that we are doing,” said Yu last week.
Mid last year, LAVO’s energy storage mechanism — canisters containing a metal hydride that looks like iron filings, but which acts like a sponge for hydrogen —  was still being refined in the lab; in early 2021 it is available for use, in an attractively engineered unit.
Prior to its official installation-ready date in June this year, LAVO has orders from ventures such as an eco lodge, and Gowing Bros.
As part of Gowings investment in LAVO, it has committed to purchasing 200 LAVO units, to be deployed on its various commercial properties, such as shopping centres, many of which are already solar enabled, with installations across rooftops and carparks.
“In addition to providing our retail tenants cost savings on energy across Gowings shopping centres, we see a major opportunity to become our own retailer of power at our residential developments through the use of LAVO technology to underpin an embedded network,” said John Gowing, Managing Director of Gowings, in a statement.
The LAVO is about the size of a domestic fridge, with dimensions 1680 x 1240 x 400 mm, and weighing 324 kg. 
At installation, it is connected to a solar PV system via a (hybrid) inverter, and to mains water via a purification system, to enable internal electrolysers to convert excess energy into hydrogen, which it stores in four canisters, and oxygen which is vented into the atmosphere.
When stored energy is needed, the LAVO activates a fuel cell to deliver electricity to the residence or business. An integrated 5 kWh lithium battery provides a buffer that can provide instantaneous response to power shortage or outage.
LAVO software partner Evergen, an Australian energy-technology developer, has integrated intelligent monitoring and control software into the system, including a phone app and Wi-Fi connectivity.

One potential brake on deployment of LAVO in non-grid-connected systems that it is currently limited to 5 kW of maximum continuous power output. A potential resolution for homes or businesses with higher output needs is installation of more than one LAVO system running in parallel to form an intelligent virtual power plant.
Such largesse may in turn be limited by the current cost of a LAVO: the 2021 launch edition, of which the company plans to produce 2,500 units, will cost $34,750. 
But prices will reduce as manufacturing ramps up: 5,000 units of the 2022 launch edition are expected to be priced at $29,450 each.
Although the cost of LAVO seems high, it is no greater than an equivalent Tesla home battery stack of three Tesla Powerwall 2 systems at $12,500 each; and it promises far greater longevity than current lithium-ion batteries.
Key components such as the hydride storage technology have an expected lifetime of 30 years, and can deliver more than 20,000 cycles. 
At the end of its life, the hydride metal alloy can simply be melted down and reused, which confers significant environmental benefits compared to competitive battery storage technologies.
The ability to remove or swap out LAVO canisters also facilitates using them to power other mechanical or heat-generating systems beyond buildings, such as bicycles or barbecues.
Professor Kondo-Francois Aguey-Zinsou who leads the HERC, and developed the metal-hydride solid-state storage medium in collaboration with LAVO, has said that products such as this hydrogen-based energy storage system are critical to the development of a domestic hydrogen industry.
The hydride material, he says, also has potential applications for exporting hydrogen at a larger scale.
Energy efficiency remains a challenge for all hydrogen based storage systems; much is lost in translation with some 20% of generated solar energy typically lost in translation to hydrogen, and only around 50% of stored energy making it back into circulation.
LAVO claims more than 50% “round-trip efficiency” of conversions, which perhaps just assumes a larger rooftop solar installation than system owners may have planned, and must be weighed against the longevity of LAVO technology, and its environmental upside.
Equity investor and customer John Gowing says, “At Gowings we look for opportunities to invest in something that we believe will offer a more secure future for all our stakeholders and can make a difference in communities.”
The world-first realisation of a residential-scale solar-energy-storage system based on hydrogen, when hydrogen has so far only been deemed viable at mega scale, demonstrates the potential for green hydrogen to become more than a pipe dream — perhaps even a lifestyle choice.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/25/queensland-develops-100-solar-battery-neighbourhoods/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JANUARY 25, 2021",Queensland develops 100% solar + battery neighbourhoods,"Economic Development Queensland (EDQ) has designated two new residential developments in the greater Brisbane area — Carseldine Village and Songbird Estate Oxley — as 100% solar + battery neighbourhoods.
Both developments are currently under construction, and have also planned to ultimately integrate childcare facilities, bushland, sport-and-recreation, and aged-care facilities, creating total smart environments for today’s living needs.
The new homes are designed to EnviroDevelopment’s Six-Leaf standard. The scientifically based EnvironDevelopment assessment scheme provides independent review of developments and certifies those that achieve outstanding performance on a number of indices including sustainability of building materials, energy efficiency and supply, and water management.
At Carseldine, EDQ’s first-stage development of 53 contemporary terrace houses is expected to be complete by June this year.
Each residence will incorporate solar PV and an AlphaESS battery storage system, a heat-pump hot water system and have provision for an electric vehicle charger in the home’s electrical wiring.
The combined effect of the renewable-energy installation “could save owners up to $1,600 per year off their power bills,” said Steven Miles, Queensland’s Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning in a statement on Saturday.

At Oxley, the Songbird development is releasing 39 blocks of land in its first stage, and home builders are required to meet design guidelines for sustainability, to a level that complies with EnviroDevelopment’s Six-Leaf certification.
That is, homes on the Songbird estate will be required to have three-phase power connection, and install a dedicated AC circuit to the garage in order to facilitate future dedicated Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) of the homeowner’s choice.
Builders must also use thermally efficient colours, and materials in construction of each home; include energy-efficient appliances and LED lighting; and install a minimum of 6 kW of solar, supported by a minimum 13.5 kW of battery storage and an inverter set to export a maximum of 4 kW of energy at any time to the grid.
The guidelines state that the cap on solar exports, “will help ensure that most of the solar generated is used within the dwelling enabling all dwellings at Songbird to be solar PV homes.”
To enable compliance with renewable energy requirements, Songbird’s home builders are given access to a solar PV and Tesla Powerwall package at a 50% discount via an agreement with Natural Solar, one of Australia’s leading solar battery installers 
“Solar PV combined with a Tesla Powerwall will have on- and off-grid capability and the option to link into a virtual power plant to generate revenue for the homebuyer,” said Miles.
He added that in the event of a power outage in Oxley, the technology would enable these homes to use their own stored supply of energy to power “their fridge, lights and favourite streaming service”.
Natural Solar CEO, Chris Williams estimates that Songbird Oxley residents could expect to save up to $2,000 a year by taking up the offer, which would deliver them a “return on investment in around five years”.

Mandated solar and batteries, alongside, energy efficiency measures implemented on homes in new developments makes sense both in terms of state planning for future energy needs, and supporting lower costs of living for residents.
The Queensland Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick de Brenni, said in Saturday’s announcement, that Queensland was working towards carbon-neutral housing design becoming the norm across Queensland, and that updates for Queensland’s National Construction Code were “in the pipeline”.
Queensland leads Australia in residential rooftop PV adoption, with just over one in three households powered by solar, and the state can claim four of the top-five solar postcodes in Australia, including Bundaberg at number one.
The state first introduced schemes to support solar uptake in 2018 and was overwhelmed by the response from householders.
De Brenni said that “futuristic” renewable-energy-enabled homes would help ensure that Queensland reaches the target it set in 2017 of achieving 50% renewable energy in its electricity supply by 2030. The state’s electricity supply is currently around 20% powered by renewables.
Miles said that with the Carseldine and Oxley developments, the state government is “hoping to inspire more home builders and developers to design and build sustainable, net-zero emission homes across Queensland”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/25/sa-water-is-pumping-with-the-power-of-the-sun/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RACKING,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"JANUARY 25, 2021",SA Water is pumping with the power of the sun,"You may not be able to taste the sunlight, but the 7.5 MW solar plant built to power the third pumping station on South Australia’s Morgan-Whyalla pipeline, which delivers drinking water from the Murray River to the Upper Spencer Gulf region, has been energised and is now moving water, participating in Australia’s National Electricity Market, and contributing to the masterplan for SA Water’s zero-cost energy future.
Drinking water in South Australia typically has to travel a long way from source to water treatment to tap. The four pumping stations involved in transporting water from the Murray River to tens of thousands of customers in the Barossa Valley, Riverland, Mid North and Upper Spencer Gulf zones of the network propel the vital supply along a pipeline 358 kilometres long.
“The energy requirements to pump such volumes of water are significant,” said SA Water’s Senior Manager Zero Cost Energy Future, Nicola Murphy in a statement celebrating the third milestone in this particular piece of SA Water’s $300 million solar rollout.
More than half a million solar panels and 34 MWh of energy storage will be installed as part of the water utility’s ambitious agenda to neutralise the energy costs of its operations.
Outlined at this time last year, the plan has progressed in leaps and bounds despite social distancing required of workforces under Covid-19 conditions.
On the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline, pump stations 1 (5.5 MW) and 2 (5.5 MW) have already been completed, and only the final leg of the water’s journey remains to be powered by solar — pump station 4 (also 5.5 MW) is expected to be complete in mid-2021.
No. 3 pump station, at the prettily named Geranium Plains  is the subject of the current justified gushing.
Murphy explains that each of the 19,000 panels in this array is supported by a pivoting racking system that tilts the panels to track the sun from east to west during the day. “The direct current (DC) voltage captured by the panels is converted into high-voltage alternating current (AC) energy,” before it “travels underground to a connection point for use at the pump station.”
Any excess electricity generated by the plant will be sold on the national electricity spot market, says Murphy, and the generated income will further help to reduce the costs of operating SA Water’s system.
The utility’s water and wastewater operations are one of South Australia’s biggest electricity consumers: its cost of energy for the 2019-2020 financial year totalled approximately $86 million.
More than 160,000 solar panels have already been installed as part of SA Water’s Zero Cost Energy Future initiative, at sites such as the Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant (19.24 MW) and the Adelaide Desalination Plant (15.5 MW).
When complete, the deployment of a total of 500,000 solar panels will also result in emissions reductions “equivalent to planting more than seven million trees, or removing more than 30,000 motor vehicles from the road” for every year they operate, Murphy proudly says.
Of course, the planned renewable-energy-powered water system flows also into South Australia’s overall intention, declared in 2015, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
In December 2020, the South Australian Government Climate Change Action Plan 2021-2025 further ramped up the state’s ambitions, charting “a proud bipartisan pathway towards decarbonisation”, as David Speers, the SA Minister for Environment and Water wrote in the forward.
It heralded a scenario in which the state’s transformation to a net-zero-emissions economy, and to concurrently becoming a national and international exporter of clean energy could lead it to generate a volume of renewable energy more than 500% of its current local grid demand by 2050.
SA Water is contributing to such goals, one drop and one solar panel at a time, while ensuring it keeps water prices ““low and stable for our customers across the state”, Murphy said.
