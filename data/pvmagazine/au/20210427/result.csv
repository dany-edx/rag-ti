“We have 6,000 data points on our microgrid,” Director of Deakin’s Energy Initiative, Dr Adrian Panow, told pv magazine Australia. “So it becomes a very complex system very, very quickly.”
Last week, Deakin unveiled the new set up – attracting guests like Dr Alan Finkel AO, who was previously Australia’s Chief Scientist and is currently Special Adviser to the Federal Government on Low Emissions Technology.
The $23 million microgrid is comprised of a 7 MW solar farm (made up of 23,000 ground mounted solar panels – the largest on any Australian university campus), a 2 MWh lithium iron phosphate battery, 250 kW of distributed rooftop solar (833 panels) as well as a series of smaller battery systems with a collective capacity of 30 kWh.
Deakin University
With this extensive infrastructure at the university’s disposal, its aspirations are growing. With no time to waste, it is already underway with a number of projects as part of its university-wide approach to energy research.
“The research is beyond just the poles and wires, it goes into broader issues, social equity,” Panow said.
For him, the microgrid is really an opportunity for the university and all the brains who populate it to become a power station operator – and to examine all the issues embedded in that, from electrical standards to cyber security, fairness and equity to the critical mass of virtual power plants.
Such questions, prompted by seismic shifts in the electricity generation, are not easily answered by traditional market operators. Their primary job will always be to keep Australia’s lights on. So interrogating these problems, testing, discovering what’s possible, is being taken up by institutions like Deakin.
“All of that becomes available because we’ve invested in the infrastructure,” Panow said. “Industry is moving so quickly, but when it’s within your campus, that conversation can really start.”
One of the first questions researchers at Deakin are taking up is whether batteries at lower voltage end of the spectrum can offer the support services which are proving lucrative for big batteries like the Hornsdale Power Reserve.
The question is “how much network support can be provided at the distribution level?”
“We’re already thinking of how to do that with our network.”
“It might actually be at time more valuable [for batteries] to discharge in the day… for a very short period, there’s high value in discharging. Getting that [timing] right is really important.”
Battery storage systems are technically capable of so much, the question Deakin is prioritising is not what they can do, but what they should do. “That’s when data scientists come in,” Panow said.
While it may sound like a premise for a dystopic sci-fi film, Panow says that developing a digital twin for its microgrid is the universities top priority. Put simply, a digital twin is a virtual representation of, in this case, the university’s microgrid and all its components.
Given the infrastructure is real, physical and functioning today in the real world, it’s possible to develop a highly accurate, data-informed digital model.
Where digital twins prove crucial is for testing. It can be tweaked and re-tweaked, tested and trialled before hands are ever laid on the real multimillion system.
“When there’s a level of low enough risk that it’s going to affect the actual physical project, it can be implemented,” Panow said.
Deakin University
Deakin’s microgrid was designed off the back of information gathered by other similar projects – namely the microgrids installed at ivy league Princeton University and the University of California, San Diego.
“When we started the project, we looked at other models and there were very few,” Panow explained. Part of Deakin’s strategy then was to identify other projects of relevance and visit them – which is precisely what Panow did, travelling the U.S. to see both university’s installations.
The knowledge Panow took from these was that if Deakin wanted to gather real world knowledge, its microgrid had to be big enough to be relevant not only for the university, but also for the district. Secondly, if the microgrid were to double as a source of research and knowledge, it needed to be considered from the get-go.
How Deakin went about its battery selection is indicative of the university’s approach more generally. Rather than primarily opting for external consultation, the university used its internal battery research group to select a battery chemistry (it decided on for Lithium iron phosphate).
The university then got members of its arts and philosophy departments to write an ethical procurement statement – which specified the battery should contain neither cobolt, nor any other conflict materials.
Going to market with these specifications, Panow explained, took longer and limited the market, but ultimately was far truer to the institution’s goals. “It speaks to the university’s sustainability program.”
Deakin has now installed a 2 MWh BYD battery, which is physically larger than a traditional set up, but more environmentally friendly, according to Panow.
It is the first grid-connected battery of its chemistry and scale in Australia, which has meant the process has been more interactive and has afforded a greater learning curve for network operators.
Deakin University recently brought forward its carbon-neutral target by five years, aiming for 2025. The university now wants to be carbon negative, that is to abate more carbon than it generates, by 2030.
Its microgrid is just part of that solution – but one which will have implications beyond the university’s campus. The research which is being, and will be, conducted there is rarely just research for research sake, Panow said. Rather, it is and will continue to be industry and application focused.
“You don’t solve the bigger energy issues with a widget, you solve them with a transaction,” Panow said.
Armed with a plethora of devices, minds, and constellations, Deakin University hopes to become a hub discovering not just what’s possible, but what’s ideal when it comes to using renewable energy.

Today, Trojan H2 Logistics, which has team members in both Sydney and Melbourne, announced two separate agreements it hopes will position it as the forefront of green hydrogen transport business in Australia.
The company is working to create a carbon-free logistical transport chain along Australia’s east coast. To do this, it is introducing Fuel Cell Electric Trucks to transport Australian project’s soon-to-be renewably produced hydrogen. These movers will be supported by a series of refuelling and storage stations along major transit routes.
Turning this from vision to reality, Trojan has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the delivery of 100 LH2 Fuel Stations as well as a $US2.8 million (AU$3.6 million) agreement to immediately acquire two liquid hydrogen trailers capable of holding around 55,000 litres, or nearly four tonnes.
Trojan H2 Logistics said it views this as the beginning of a planned 1,000 fleet of H2 trucks Australia wide.
Trojan has also signed a second MoU with a industry leading supplier for the supply of 50 hydrogen prime movers, with a plan to purchase another 1,000 trucks if demand remains.
The company’s press release does not name the partnering companies for either of the MoUs, although the companies website says it has agreements in place with both Chart Industries and Hyzon Motors.
Chart Industries lists itself as having expertise in hydrogen fuelling stations and storage. It also provides transport trailers, and is presumably the company which will provide Trojan with its refuelling stations and initial trucks. Hyzon Motors, on the other hand, produce 50 tonne trucks with power density fuel cells, which Trojan mentions in its release.

Zero-carbon supply chains have proven central in discussions around green hydrogen transport, according to peak body, the Smart Energy Council. If Trojan can manage to pull off its green supply chain, it could provide for industry desires that Australian governments are less keenly focussed on.
Last week, Australia’s federal government committed a further $275.5 million to develop four new regional hydrogen hubs in Australia. The funding follows a windfall of similar announcements made this year by state governments, which are eager to set themselves up as major hydrogen export hubs.
“With the acceleration in the establishment of hydrogen hubs around Australia comes the need for a secure, reliable and affordable logistics solution to transport hydrogen,” Trojan said.
It hopes to be the one to provide this “yet unmet need,” noting that global consulting firm PwC expects the total domestic infrastructure investment required to store, transport and distribute hydrogen to take full advantage of Australia’s opportunity to become the dominant East Asian exporter could reach $80 billion by 2030.
Domestically, hydrogen is expected to be transported by pipelines – either newly built or modified existing pipelines – or via storage and transport of hydrogen in the form of gas, liquid or fuel cells. Which is presumably where Trojan hopes to come in.
In terms of export, companies like West-Australia GEV are vying for the international transport market. It is well underway with its plans to build a compressed hydrogen cargo ship to transport the future-fuel produced in West-Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland projects.

After all, the Solar Homes Program battery rebate stream has been expanded to offer an aggregation option for Victorians. 
The program will see the creation of local networks of houses with solar plants and batteries, whereby the excess energy generated by solar PV and stored in the home energy storage systems as aggregate to be utilised by the grid at peak demand. 
Minister for Solar Homes Lily D’Ambrosio wants to see applications made to the pilot program which focus on consumer benefits and protections, innovations in energy management and market solutions, in sum, applications which emphasise the value produced by VPPs for solar households and the reliability of the grid. 
Successful applicants get access to rebates provided by the Victorian Government and have their services listed on Solar Victoria’s website. 
“The pilot aims to bring the benefits of solar to all Victorians,” said D’Ambrosio, “reducing pressure on the grid and boosting reliability when demand is highest.” 
One of the main objectives of the pilot program is the development of an “Approved aggregation provider list” to inform its “Battery Aggregation Strategy,” a path to Victoria’s future VPPs and microgrids. 
Moreover, Solar Victoria is supplementing the program with a consumer literacy program, an attempt to help people better understand home batteries, aggregation, the potential benefits open to them, and as a result, the wider grid. 
“We’re working closely with industry to drive innovative solar solutions for customers” continued D’Ambrosio, “and create good outcomes for the wider electricity network.” 
Applications for the Solar Homes Program Battery Aggregation Pilot close in early June 2021.

The largest photovoltaic complex under development in Europe is taking shape near Guadalajara, in central Spain, and will be constructed by Spanish solar developer Solaria Energía.
The Trillo project is planned to have a capacity of 626 MW and construction is scheduled to start on May 7. Its completion should be achieved by the end of this year.
Solaria Energía obtained approval for the construction of the plant in October 2019, when the project was still sized at 450 MW. Just two weeks later, the company reported having obtained an additional favourable approval linked to the Trillo 400 kV node, and the enhancement of the plant to 626 MW.
Although the company presents the complex as a unit, it consists of several units, each with a capacity lower than 50 MW, that have been processed separately.
The “largest in Europe” label is currently being disputed by more developers in Spain. Iberdrola also defines its Francisco Pizarro project, with 590 MW of capacity, as the largest photovoltaic plant currently being developed in Europe. Construction work has already started.
Both plants, however, may fall short of the first place ranking, if the 1 GW project announced by Spanish developer Soto Solar last week will also see its construction begin. The company plans to link the huge facility, known as Erasmo, to energy storage and green hydrogen production.
