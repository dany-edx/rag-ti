Speaking to pv magazine Australia at Melbourne’s All-Energy conference last week, Array’s Director of Asia-Pacific, Michael Corio, said the Glenrowan project has been delivered ahead of schedule and has proven the US-based company can establish itself in the Australian market.
“It has been a big step for us to set up such extensive manufacturing in a new country,” he said.
“As a business, we decided to push ahead and make the investment to set up manufacturing here, and it’s never easy when you do that in a new country.

“It took a significant amount of time – at least eight to 12 months – for us to engage manufacturing partners and steel producers who were able and willing to partner with us to deliver our quality processes.
“It’s been a very exciting milestone for us and certainly one we want to replicate.”
Array’s Chief Revenue Officer, Travis Rose, said the Victorian Government’s local content requirements presented a significant challenge in being able to service the Glenrowan site.
“There were two things we were concerned about,” he said.
“We have a reputation as having a quality and reliable product, and you’re only as good as the components that go into your product. We took a lot of time to make sure that these had to be local suppliers, but also that they could meet our stringent quality criteria.
“The second important thing for us was looking at overall capacity and the ability to deliver on time.
“With the schedule actually coming in sooner than we expected, plus these new suppliers and manufacturing operations both meeting and exceeding our quality criteria, we met or exceeded both of those goals from a quality standpoint as well as the capacity and a timing standpoint.”
Mr Corio said that Array is “engaged and involved” in discussions about other projects in the VRET2 program, and is looking further afield to renewable projects in other states.

“With the kind of investment that the states are making, it’s kind of an energy revolution,” he said.
“We want to see more benefits in terms of Australian job creation, and developing an industry that can actually manufacture and capture some of that value for this massive energy transition that is underway.
“We think that this is just the beginning, and we’re proud to be the first company to actually set up and show that we’re here to stay.”
The 102 MW Glenrowan project was one of six announced last year by the Victorian Government under its VRET2 auction. 

The scheme is designed to fast-track 623 MW of renewable energy generation as part of the government’s commitment to achieving 100% renewable consumption for its operations by 2025.
The Glenrowan solar farm is located in Victoria’s Central North Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), and is owned by infrastructure developer Pacific Partnerships. It is expected to be operational in late 2023.
The Victorian Government expects that the Glenrowan project to create 150 full-time jobs and generate enough renewable energy to power 45,000 homes.
The Glenrowan site was visited last week by Victoria’s Minister for the State Electricity Commission, Lily D’Ambrosio, as part of an announcement to reinstate the State Electricity Commission (SEC).
D’Ambrosio confirmed that the Glenrowan solar farm will become part of the SEC, and will sell power to the Victorian Government as its first customer.
“Our next big build is the renewable energy transition – and the SEC will help attract and train the renewable energy workforce Victoria needs,” D’Ambrosio said.
“The SEC will help create 59,000 jobs and will help deliver an unprecedented workforce of highly skilled renewable energy professionals.”
Under its 10-year strategic plan, the SEC will invest $1 billion (USD 630 million) towards building 4.5 GW of renewable energy projects.

Powerlink will do these alongside construction partners UGL and CPB. The Queensland government says the funding will get the $5 billion project ready for construction to commence mid-2024.

CopperString 2.0 is an 1,100-kilometre, high voltage electricity transmission network that would connect Mount Isa and the North West Minerals Province to the national electricity grid near Townsville in North Queensland. The government expects 6 GW of renewable capacity to be opened up by CopperString, and is hoping this will kickstart a chain of renewably-powered manufacturing in the region.
On Monday, the government said CopperString will be “calling for response to tenders from local North Queensland companies.”
“It builds on more than 40 works packages that have been release for Expression of Interest,” the announcement said. “The packages cover a range of activities and services such as engineering, construction, environmental management, logistics, camp construction, haulage and communications.”
“We are proud to invest in this historic project, which will connect $500 billion in critical minerals with the largest renewable energy zone on the east coast of Australia unlocking the next mining boom and jobs across the North West Minerals Province and North Queensland,” the Queensland government added.

The lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, battery comes in 2 MW / 4 MWh units which fit into a 20 foot shipping container. Like most utility-scale batteries, the units can be added in parallel to increase project capacity. 

The Elementa 2 launched in China on October 24, and was unveiled at All-Energy just a few days later. Australia is expected to be the second market after China to receive the battery, with the company aiming for it to become commercially available in Q2, 2024.
The Elementa 2 is the second generation version of the Elementa battery the company launched in 2022. The new generation almost doubles the storage capacity of the previous model, which stored 2.2 MWh. The increased density comes from the fact the first generation Elementa battery used third party cells, whereas the second generation uses Trina’s own cells. 
Trina has opted for full vertical integration on its storage products in order to control its production costs as well as ensure it can deliver orders on schedule. This includes in house research and development, cabinet design and component manufacturing, Trina officials told pv magazine Australia.
Trina Storage began in 2015, but the company’s cell manufacturing line only became operational in 2021. It has two bases in China, and is aiming for 12 GWh of cell production capacity by the end of 2023, and 25 GWh by 2025. While the company will supply cells for its own product ranges as the priority, it may also sell its battery cells into the broader market depending on surplus levels.
To support the uptake of its new battery storage product, Trina is offering design engineering services to help integrate its Elementa 2 line into planned projects.
The company is understood to be in discussions around deploying the technology in Australian projects, though no formal announcements have been made to date.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/31/quinbrook-proposes-green-polysilicon-manufacturing-plant-in-north-queensland/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 31, 2023",Quinbrook announces green polysilicon manufacturing plant in North Queensland,"Australian-owned renewables player Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners is looking to fund and develop a major polysilicon manufacturing plant in Townsville, North Queensland. The proposal would see Quinbrook have a hand in establishing alternate supply chains for the solar and battery products it purchases.
For the project, Quinbrook is partnering with Queensland company Solquartz, which has itself also been allocated a site at the Lansdown Precinct to develop a metallurgical silicon metal processing plant. The co-location of these facilities, Quinbrook says, will “enable Solquartz to accelerate and integrate its project into Quinbrook’s larger polysilicon manufacturing facility.”
This polysilicon manufacturing facility would ultimately source silica quartz from around the Townsville region and process it to manufacture polysilicon wafers for use in solar panels as well as battery technology. The proposed capacity of the polysilicon manufacturing plant has not been made public.
Quinbrook on Tuesday announced that it had been conditionally allocated a 200-hectare portion of the total 2,200-hectare Lansdown Precinct site through a council-run competitive tender process. Quinbrook says the “state-of-the-art polysilicon manufacturing facility” will be powered by a large-scale solar and battery storage project it plans to build on land adjacent to Lansdown.
Polysilicon is a basic building block for solar panels and has been the cause of much controversy in solar manufacturing as forced labour is suspected to be used in its production, which is also an emissions-intensive process. The polysilicon supply chain is today highly concentrated in Xinjiang, China.
While Australia has an abundance of silicon in the form of quartz, it currently does not produce any polysilicon – something which is widely considered a weak spot in terms of decarbonisation. In 2022, a report from the CSIRO, authored by PwC, highlighted the urgent need for Australia to develop a domestic silicon and solar cell supply chain.
Quinbrook’s plan seems to be answering these calls, with Townsville Mayor, Jenny Hill, saying “this is an especially exciting announcement because Quinbrook are not only the developers and sponsors, but also the project funders, which means the money is on the table.”
“Once the right operating partner is chosen by the company, the project can move forward at a rapid pace, subject to the normal government approvals,” Hill added.
Exactly what kind of “operating partner” Quinbrook is searching for is not yet known, nor have any exact timelines for the facility’s development been provided. Quinbrook did, however, note that the conditions of its land allocation include a strict timeline to develop the project as well as contributing to critical Lansdown infrastructure.
Quinbrook’s Senior Director Brian Restall said the company had targeted Lansdown because of its clear competitive advantages as a site for large scale manufacturing powered by renewables, logistics, site infrastructure and port access for export.
“Lansdown is close to the source of some of the best silica quartz resources in the world and it has the land and site infrastructure we need to build a truly state of the art manufacturing facility that will be powered by renewable energy,” Restall said.
“Close proximity to the port and multiple transport corridors make it a very compelling location for energy intensive, export driven ‘green’ manufacturing.”
“We have strong relationships with and are a major customer of leading solar and battery manufacturers across the globe – meaning components manufactured here in Townsville will be exported to these leading manufacturers and made into finished solar modules and batteries.
“Our aim is that Quinbrook will ultimately purchase that equipment for our global power generation projects with total confidence in the supply chain that produced them,” Restall added.
The Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct is seeking to co-locate clean energy generation with industrial and manufacturing facilities across 2,200 hectares of dedicated land south of Townsville. It was declared a project of state significance by the Queensland government in March this year, 2023.
The Precinct is aiming to be Northern Australia’s first environmentally sustainable advanced manufacturing, technology and processing hub. Among the companies working on projects at Lansdown are Edify Energy and Queensland Pacific Metals.
In 2022, renewables developer Edify Energy became the first to be granted development approval to build and operate a green hydrogen production plant of up to 1 GW, as well as a behind-the-meter solar and battery storage facility within the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct.

Meanwhile, Queensland Pacific Minerals is developing a project dubbed the Townsville Energy Chemicals Hub (TECH) project, seeking to refine ore to produce battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulphate for battery manufacturing. The TECH project is aiming to refine approximately 1.6 million tonnes of ore annually.
Magnis Energy Technologies, an Australian graphite miner turn integrated lithium battery company, had initially announced plans to build an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facility at Lansdown, but quietly abandoned that plan in February, 2023.
Nonetheless, the Queensland government is throwing its support behind Lansdown, and on Monday announced a $1.3 billion package to progress work on CopperString 2032, a transmission project which would connect Queensland’s North West Minerals Province to Australia’s national grid around Townsville.
With Lansdown located in Townsville, the CopperString 1,100-kilometre, high voltage electricity transmission network would open up tracts of land previously closed to solar and wind development to enable more green energy, and ultimately more green manufacturing, in the Northern Queensland region.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/31/investigators-still-uncertain-about-cause-of-30-kwh-battery-explosion-in-germany/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,GERMANY",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"OCTOBER 31, 2023",Investigators still uncertain about cause of 30 kWh battery explosion in Germany,"From pv magazine Global
Around three weeks ago, the explosion of a 30 kWh battery storage system caused a stir in Lauterbach, in the central German state of Hesse. The system owner is an electronics technician specialising in energy and building services, with 20 years of professional experience.
His home was destroyed in the explosion and it has not been habitable since. It is now in acute danger of collapsing, which is why police and insurance investigators do not dare to enter. This makes it impossible to determine the cause of the explosion with 100% certainty. The house will soon be demolished.
The homeowner told pv magazine that the battery energy storage system consisted of three battery packs from Shenzhen Basen Technology. He bought two in June 2022 and an additional one in June 2023 via the Alibaba platform. They are the “BR-48200B” and “MY-381” models, each with 10 kWh of capacity based on LFP technology housed in a 19-inch cabinet.
The battery system was coupled with a 15.47 kW photovoltaic system, which the homeowner was about to expand to 19.565 kW, and two different inverters: Victron’s Multiplus II 5000 and Solax X1 4.2. The cause of the explosion has yet to be clarified, and there were no electrical clues, according to the homeowner. Right before the accident, the battery’s state of charge (SOC) was 90.2% and the voltage stood at 52.41 V.
After the explosion, the basement – which housed both the boiler and the battery system – was filled with white smoke. However, there were “hardly any signs of fire” near the battery storage unit, according to the homeowner. “The inverters on the other side of the room look like new,” he said.
Long after the incident, the homeowner noticed an odour that he described as the smell of lithium. He is now trying to determine whether it is makes sense to carry out safety tests outdoors for outdoor-use devices, as the smoke can evaporate and be overlooked. Now, the question is which gas caused the explosion, whether it originated inside or outside the battery, and how it happened.
pv magazine contacted two scientists, but the were unable to comment on the specific incident due to the ongoing investigation. Egbert Figgemeier, chair of ageing processes and battery lifetime prediction at RWTH Aachen, said that it is conceivable that the electrolyte in the cells broke down and an internal short circuit ignited the gases.
“An external ignition source is not necessary,” said Figgemeier.
He described the white smoke as the decomposition products of the electrolyte, which can also contain dangerous gases. Soot formation is not necessarily to be expected, as many components of the cells could burn without leaving any residue at high temperatures. So-called thermal runaway could have preceded the explosion and may have been the trigger.
Axel Durdel, a researcher at the Technical University of Munich, told pv magazine that in a “worst-case scenario,” an LFP battery could leak hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ethene, methane and other gases. There has been a lot of discussion about the possible formation of hydrogen with a subsequent explosion. In principle, this is possible, but whether the conditions for spontaneous combustion have been reached cannot be estimated, according to Durdel.
He said it is not known that batteries could cause such an explosion without a thermal reaction. In the case of thermal reaction, the internal pressure could increase due to undesirable side reactions, leading to an explosion and the release of hot gases.
“In the case of batteries with a lower energy density or a low state of charge, it is entirely possible that the gas does not ignite directly when it exits the battery, but that the ignition occurs through external ignition sources,” said Durdel.
In that case, there should be traces on the battery. However, this can no longer be verified because no one is allowed to enter the home due to the risk of collapse.
The storage owner has noted the problem of carrying out safety tests with lithium-ion storage devices outdoors. Figgemeier confirmed that such experiments are carried out in semi-open bunkers, rather than in closed rooms.
Durdel said that the standard-compliant safety tests for the lithium-ion cells are carried out almost exclusively in test rooms with appropriate filter systems. In principle, it is conceivable that gases could accumulate in the basement without an appropriate exhaust system. However, the scientist from the Technical University of Munich could not say whether this was sufficient for self-ignition.
Battery storage is generally safe when professionally installed and certified, with compatibility between systems ensured through testing and approval by inverter and battery manufacturers.
For integrated systems, this is done by the system integrator. The safety of these systems is evident in the low number of accidents reported among more than 1 million home battery storage installations in Germany. Monitoring systems, common among established manufacturers, further assist in the early detection of critical conditions.

JinkoSolar said it has achieved a “major technological breakthrough” with its 182 mm n-type monocrystalline silicon solar cell, reaching 26.89% maximum solar conversion efficiency.
The Chinese PV module manufacturer said in a press release that the efficiency results have been independently confirmed by the National PV industry Measurement and Testing Center. pv magazine was unable to contact the National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center to verify the claim, as its website was down.
The research and development team developed “advanced metallisation enhancement technology, high energy bulk material passivation technology and high-performance light trapping passivating contact technology” to achieve the milestone, said the company.
Jin Hao, chief technology officer for JinkoSolar, said the new conversion efficiency rating has broken previous n-type monocrystalline silicon solar cell company records. He said the company will continue to invest in research and development.
