Etex Australia, which manufactures Siniat plasterboard at the factory, says the solar system will provide about 20% of the factory’s power demand, and is expected to cut roughly 6% of Altona’s gate-to-gate emissions.
The company is also planning to install a smaller solar system at its Matraville plant in New South Wales, though no timeframes for that project have been provided.

Unlike our Asia-Pacific neighbours, commercial and industrial (C&I) solar installs have traditionally lagged residential installs in Australia. This dynamic, however, has been changing in recent years.
According to solar and storage analyst SunWiz, Australia’s C&I solar segment had a “record month” in December 2022. Australian businesses are increasingly turning to solar to offset the sharp rises in electricity costs, and to boost their increasingly important ESG (Environmental and Social Governance) reporting.
Etex Australia is the manufacturer and distributor of Siniat products in Australia, and belongs to the Etex Group headquartered in Belgium.

The Ardandra storage and solar site, as it is referred to, sits adjacent to Octopus’ existing Dulacca Wind Farm and will connects into the same line, the company says. That is, the projects will sit in Queensland’s south, just under 400 km west of Brisbane.
“When constructed in 2025, Ardandra in combination with Dulacca will create the ‘Western Downs Energy Park,’” Octopus Australia says, though it is not clear whether 2025 will mark the beginning of construction or the project’s completion.
While the announcement does not explicitly say the 400 MWh battery and 175 MW solar plans were formulated by Juwi, the company’s Regional Director for Asia-Pacific, Christian Cronje, is quoted as saying: “We are happy to have Octopus Australia take on the continued development.” Juwi appears not to have previously announced the projects, and no further details about the proposed battery’s chemistry or power capacity have been released.
In May, Octopus also acquired a 400 MW Hay Plains wind project in southwestern New South Wales from Juwi.
Coming back to Octopus’ Western Downs Energy Park plans, the company says the hub would be one of the first “truly integrated multi-technology renewable energy parks” in Queensland and Australia. 
“Integrated renewable and storage technologies allow clean energy to provide ‘firmed’ energy offerings, providing energy when customers need it most,” Darren Brown, co-head of investment and development at Octopus Australia, said.
Sam Reynolds, Octopus Australia’s managing director, has previously highlighted the importance of diversification both in terms of the company’s renewable energy asset portfolio and its investor base.
“We think it’s better to have a portfolio – and that’s what the platform is, a portfolio of assets – wind, solar and storage – that look after the fluctuating nature of renewables but also the fluctuating nature of the daytime energy prices,” Reynolds previously told pv magazine Australia, referring to Octopus Australia’s two new investment platforms launched in 2022.
The Western Downs Energy Park currently consists of the 43-turbine Dulacca Wind Farm, which hosts some of Australia’s largest wind turbines and is backed by a 70% offtake deal with the Queensland government’s CleanCo.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/07/brookfield-flags-30-billion-investment-public-benefits-of-decarbonisation-via-origin-in-accc-application/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,CANADA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 7, 2023","Brookfield flags $30 billion investment, ‘public benefits’ of Origin decarbonisation to ACCC","Canadian investment giant Brookfield, in a consortium with US investor EIG Partners, has told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) its acquisition of Origin Energy, Australia’s second largest energy generator and retailer, would “contribute materially” to Australia’s decarbonisation and “does not raise any material competition concerns.”
Brookfield’s recent acquisitions in Australia, most notably its takeover of Victorian network AusNet Services in 2021, have been flagged as a potential roadblock to the Origin plan. The Canadian company also holds a stake in smart metering company Intellihub. 
Brookfield says its $18.7 billion Origin takeover will “provide substantial public benefits because we intend to invest between A$20 billion and A$30 billion in rapidly expanding and accelerating the renewables build out.”
Brookfield has previously pointed to investing “at least” $20 billion in Australia’s transition using Origin as a vehicle, but this submission to the ACCC appears to be the first time it has flagged a figure as high as $30 billion.
The Canadian company says it plans to develop up to 14 GW of new renewable generation and storage assets within the Origin Energy business by 2033, having previously given the date of 2030. These figures, Brookfield says, are 10 GW over and above what it estimates Origin is likely to develop in that timeframe in its current listed company ownership structure.
This extra capacity, Brookfield says in its submission, comes from the global fund’s access to capital, as well as its international supply chain and technology partnerships. Indeed, the Origin acquisition will be made via the Brookfield Global Transition Fund, which claims to be the world’s largest private fund focused on the net-zero transition, and is headed up by Mark Carney, one of the world’s most influential climate change power brokers.
On the other hand, the company’s ownership of AusNet Services falls under Brookfield Asset Management. This is of vital importance, the company claims, noting these two arms are separate and have different backers.
This separation is the backbone of Brookfield’s argument around why the Origin transaction doesn’t raise material competition concerns. “The Proposed Transaction to acquire Origin Energy will not be detrimental to competition in any market given the intensely regulated nature of the electricity generation sector, reinforced by the fact that AusNet and Origin will remain separate stand-alone companies with separate investor groups,” Brookfield Asia Pacific CEO Stewart Upson said.
The company also notes there is a “lack of any ability or incentive for AusNet to foreclose Origin’s generation competitors” due to the high degree of regulation of both transmission and distribution in Australia.
Brookfield goes on to note: “Origin, AusNet and Intellihub will remain separate companies, with separate investor groups. Different Brookfield funds hold majority stakes and the unaffiliated co-investors in each business are different.”
The ACCC is expected to advise on its decision after 90 days following a process of industry and stakeholder feedback. It is possible the watchdog could require Brookfield to enter “undertakings” which would place strict controls around its business behaviour, or require it to sell some assets.
Under the brokered deal, Brookfield, GIC and Temasek will take over Origin’s retail and generation business, which currently has a 24% market share in Australia’s national electricity market. Meanwhile, partner MidOcean Energy, managed by US investment giant EIG Partners, will take control of Origin’s gas assets and business.
In 2023, Brookfield also acquired the remaining 50% stake in Spain-based renewables developer X-Elio from its joint venture partner, investment firm KKR. X-Elio owns a number of renewable assets in Australia.
It also recently announced a partnership with little-known developer Greenleaf Renewables. The partnership, Brookfield says, will help enable its decarbonisation plan for Origin.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/07/us-researchers-beam-solar-from-space/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JUNE 7, 2023",US researchers beam solar from space,"From pv magazine USA
Space-based solar power has been studied for decades because, theoretically, it could tap into a virtually unlimited supply of solar energy in outer space. Caltech researchers estimate that solar from space could yield eight times more power than solar panels at any location on Earth’s surface, and in January the Caltech Space Solar Power Project (SSPD) launched into orbit a prototype to beam power to Earth.
The SSPD deployed a constellation of modular spacecraft equipped with PV to collect sunlight, convert it to electricity, and then wirelessly transmit the electricity over long distances wherever it is needed. Caltech said the technology could be useful to remote areas that do not have supportive transmission infrastructure.
Wireless power transfer was demonstrated by Microwave Array for Power-transfer Low-orbit Experiment (MAPLE), developed at Caltech. It is one of three key technologies being tested by the Space Solar Power Demonstrator (SSPD-1), the first space-borne prototype from Caltech’s SSPP.
MAPLE includes lightweight microwave power transmitters driven by custom electronic chips that were built using low-cost silicon technologies. It uses the array of transmitters to beam the energy to desired locations.
“Through the experiments we have run so far, we received confirmation that MAPLE can transmit power successfully to receivers in space,” said Ali Hajimiri, Bren Professor of electrical engineering and medical engineering and co-director of SSPP. “We have also been able to program the array to direct its energy toward Earth, which we detected here at Caltech. We had, of course, tested it on Earth, but now we know that it can survive the trip to space and operate there.”
Beaming solar from space has been studied by groups around the world for decades. Like any futuristic technology, it has its naysayers. In this case, some worry that the high energy beam will fry anything in its path or cause destruction when it fails to hit its target.
In the Caltech project, there is a transceiver array that beams the energy and two separate receiver arrays to receive it.
The signal appeared at the expected time and frequency, detected by the receiver located on the roof of the Gordon and Betty Moore Laboratory of Engineering on Caltech’s campus in Pasadena. The signal also had the right frequency shift as predicted based on its travel from orbit.
To be sure that the energy reaches its intended destination, the transmitter array uses precise timing-control elements to dynamically focus the power on the desired location using the coherent addition of electromagnetic waves.
Once the receiver arrays receive the energy, they convert it to direct current (DC) electricity, and use it to light up a pair of LEDs to demonstrate the full sequence of wireless energy transmission at a distance in space. MAPLE tested this in space by successfully lighting up each LED individually and shifting back and forth between them.
“To the best of our knowledge, no one has ever demonstrated wireless energy transfer in space even with expensive rigid structures. We are doing it with flexible lightweight structures and with our own integrated circuits. This is a first,” said Hajimiri.
The next steps for the team are to assess the performance of individual elements within the system by evaluating the interference patterns of smaller groups and measuring difference between various combinations. The researchers say the process, which can take up to six months to fully complete, will allow the team to sort out irregularities and trace them back to individual units, providing insight for the next generation of the system.
“The flexible power transmission arrays are essential to the current design of Caltech’s vision for a constellation of sail-like solar panels that unfurl once they reach orbit,” said Sergio Pellegrino, Joyce and Kent Kresa professor of aerospace and civil engineering and co-director of SSPP.

The SSPP team also has to design solar power energy systems that are lightweight and flexible, according to Harry Atwater, one of the principal investigators of the project. Individual SSPP units will fold up into packages about 1 cubic meter in volume and then unfurl into flat squares about 50 meters per side, with solar cells on one side facing toward the sun and wireless power transmitters on the other side facing toward Earth.
“In the same way that the internet democratised access to information, we hope that wireless energy transfer democratises access to energy,” said Hajimiri. “No energy transmission infrastructure will be needed on the ground to receive this power. That means we can send energy to remote regions and areas devastated by war or natural disaster.”
In addition to the support received from the Brens, Northrop Grumman Corporation also provided Caltech USD 12.5 million over three years through a sponsored research agreement between 2014 and 2017 that supported for the development of technology and advancement of science for the project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/07/saltwater-redox-flow-battery-with-integrated-ultracapacitor/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",MARIJA MAISCH,"JUNE 7, 2023",Saltwater redox flow battery with integrated ultracapacitor,"From pv magazine Global
US-based startup Salgenx has integrated ultracapacitors with its saltwater redox flow batteries (SRFBs), resulting in enhanced power response, increased efficiency, and improved energy density.
The company unveiled its scalable SRFB earlier this year. The system features two separate tanks of electrolytes, one of which is regular saltwater. It does not use any lithium or vanadium and is membrane-free, unlike other flow batteries, thus promising big gains at the levelised cost of storage level.
The company claims that material costs of USD 5/kWh, USD 257kWh for system infrastructure, and a total system cost of USD 500,000, or USD 166/kW for the 3,000 kWh battery. The technology purportedly has a life expectancy of more than 25 years and a round trip efficiency of 91% at 10 mA/cm². With 125.7 Wh/L, its energy density outstrips that of most other flow battery solutions available today.
The Salgenx system circulates saltwater and a proprietary electrolyte through electrodes, which regulate the input and output of electricity from the battery. The battery is said to be suitable for an array of applications including grid scale power storage (both standalone or with solar or wind power), demand support, grid arbitrage, microgrid deployment, voltage and frequency regulation, co-generation, electric vehicle charging stations, and desalination, as well as thermal storage.
Now, with the integration of ultracapacitors, SRFBs are expected to deliver even greater benefits. The integrated system is said to ensure rapid power output within milliseconds, compensating for the slower response time of SRFBs and significantly boosting the overall power output of systems.
With the addition of ultracapacitors, the SRFB system is now able to efficiently handle short-duration high-power demands, according to Salgenx. This increased efficiency extends the lifespan of the SRFB and enhances the overall performance of the system.
SRFBs are known for their high energy density, while ultracapacitors excel in power density. Therefore, SRFB provides long-duration energy storage, while the ultracapacitors supplement it with high-power bursts when needed, resulting in a more comprehensive energy storage solution, according to the manufacturer.
“The successful integration of ultracapacitors with SRFBs will be a significant milestone for Salgenx and the renewable energy industry as a whole,” said Greg Giese, CEO of Salgenx.
