Essential Energy, whose electricity network covers 737,000 square kilometres, and services regional, rural and remote communities across 95% of New South Wales (NSW) and parts of southern Queensland, is investigating the introduction of SPS as part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen network efficiency and resilience.
The distributed network service provider said SPS, usually a combination of solar PV, batteries and a back-up generator, offer a continuous power solution without the need to be connected to the network. Depending on the size and power demand, the SPS can support the full electricity requirements of residential households, telecommunications, and agricultural sites.
Essential Energy said the deployment of SPS can provide significant benefits for customers, particularly those in regional and remote locations. Transitioning eligible customers to energy supplied by SPS allows the ‘poles and wires’ of the traditional electricity infrastructure to be removed. This provides a significant reduction in costs which delivers savings to all network users.
“The scope for savings through providing off-grid supply to some customers will also grow as the costs of solar panels, batteries and other technologies continue to decline,” it said.
Essential Energy corporate affairs executive general manager Chantelle Bramley said moving to off-grid supply can also provide additional benefits such as reduce bushfire risk as well as embed resilience in the network to withstand extreme weather conditions.

Bramley said the survey, to be facilitated by Taverner Research Group (TRG) and The Behavioural Architects (TBA), will provide insights to develop a detailed engagement strategy for potential SPS customers.
“This research will help us unpack what our customers’ expectations and concerns might be about disconnecting from the grid; how we can create a compelling customer proposition for the range of commercial and residential customers for whom a SPS may be viable and what support Essential Energy will need to provide,” she said.
“While we understand the reliability and cost benefits of this technology, we need to step back and really understand what is important to our customers.
“We want to get this transition right and involve our customers in the development of these new offerings.
“There are a range of benefits from this technology but unless they deliver what customers want, we won’t get the sort of scale deployment we need to realise all those benefits.”
Bramley said the behavioural insights research, which commenced this month with in-depth interviews with a range of customers including farmers, large industry and residents who live at the “edge of the grid”, will involve qualitative and quantitative research.
Essential Energy has been investigating SPS for a number of years, commencing in 2018 with the installation of a system at a property at the end of a 5.5-kilometre spur line near Bulahdelah on the NSW Mid-North Coast.
The spur line, which serviced just two customers, traverses a high bushfire risk zone through a national park. In the nine years leading up to the installation, the property experienced more than 25 outages. In the same period, Essential Energy spent more than $100,000 in network refurbishment and more than $150,000 in vegetation management while receiving little more than $1,000 per annum in revenue from the two customers connected to the spur.
Essential Energy said it had also deployed SPS following the Black Summer bushfires of 2019/2020 with systems installed at nine sites to support telecommunications towers and residential customers while waiting for the full network to be rebuilt.

While Essential Energy is progressing its survey, Western Australian (WA) regional utility Horizon Power is continuing its roll out of SPS, announcing on Thursday it has partnered with telecommunications giant Telstra to transition a remote mobile tower from an overhead power supply to an off-grid power system.
In what it said was an “Australian first”, Horizon Power last week installed the SPS at Mount Ney, east of Esperance.
The SPS, delivered by Boundary Power, comprises an 8 kW solar array coupled with a 16.8 kW battery backed by a 26 kW diesel-fuelled generator. It is able to deliver 12 kW of continuous power.
Horizon Power chief executive officer Stephanie Unwin said the installation will see the telecommunications tower able to continue operating in the event of a natural disaster and resulting interruption of power delivery by poles and wires.
“Bushfires, floods and cyclones can have a devastating impact on our network infrastructure, which provides power to other essential services like these mobile phone towers,” she said.
“We know how important reliable communications is in emergency situations, and how frightening it can be for our customers and our people when the phone lines are down.”
The installation is part of the state government’s $10 million Renew the Regions Standalone Power Systems project, due to be completed by mid-2022.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said, in addition to this program, the state government has committed to delivering 1,000 SPS over five years across regional WA.

Ratch Australia, which has assumed ownership of the Morwell project from original developer ARP Australian Solar, said it is yet to secure a connection agreement for the project but expects to begin construction in the second half of 2022 with the asset to come online in 2024.
Ratch Australia communications officer Mieka White told local reporters last week the company was preparing to call for expressions of interest for construction tenders and will now focus on furthering the technical design of the project.
The $105 million project will comprise an estimated 230,000 solar PV modules and associated infrastructure spread across two sites totalling 170 hectares. The planning approval also allows for a 5 MW-30 MW battery storage system which could be constructed during stage two of the project.
The asset is expected to generate enough electricity to power 23,000 average Victorian households a year, saving more than 146,500 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.
The sites are less than one kilometre from the shuttered coal-fired Hazelwood Power Station and will link via an underground cable. The solar farm will connect to the grid via another underground cable to the nearby Morwell Terminal Station.

The Latrobe Valley has long been considered the heart of Victoria’s coal country and is home to four coal-fired power stations including the Loy Yang A, Loy Yang B and Yallourn facilities and the decommissioned Hazelwood which was shuttered in 2017 and demolished late last year.
Loy Yang B power station which is owned by Alinta Energy is scheduled to close in 2047. AGL owns Loy Yang A and has flagged closing its facility by 2048 while Energy Australia has set a closing date of 2028 for the Yallourn facility.
White said the Latrobe Valley’s legacy of coal-fired power generation had left an abundance of grid connection infrastructure in the district, which made for an ideal site.
“The site is flat and this is perfect for us, and it is surrounded by industrial sites that we will liaise with to arrange power purchasing agreements,” she said.
“The grid is also very strong with capacity from the former Hazelwood Power Station just there, which makes the site very attractive.”
ARP said in its planning application the Morwell Solar Farm would help “fill the void” left by the decommissioned coal-fired power stations.
“The Latrobe Valley area has played a key role in Victoria’s power generation and ARP wish to continue this with producing modern, clean, green renewable power,” the company said.
“Hazelwood has been switched off, and Yallourn will be switched off, this is a much-needed development, we need many of these projects to fill the gap left by coal-fired power stations.”
Ratch has built a 1.2 GW portfolio of renewable energy projects and gas-fired power stations since its arrival in Australia in 2011.
The Morwell Solar Farm is however just its second solar asset in Australia, adding to the operational 42.5 MW Collinsville Solar Farm in Queensland.
The company’s main focus has until now been wind energy, with six wind farms included in its generation portfolio.

The NSW Government conducted a ROI process in October and November for the South-West REZ, one of five designated clean energy areas detailed in the state government’s electricity roadmap, which is expected to support more than $32 billion of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission.
Energy Corporation (EnergyCo) of NSW chief executive James Hay said on Friday the response from industry and existing and proposed renewable energy developers to the ROI process had been “outstanding”.
“There were 49 registrations totalling over 34 GW from potential generation and storage projects – 13 times the intended capacity for the South-West REZ, which will be no less than 2.5 GW,” he said.
“This project will bring an economic boost to the region and with interest from a variety of established and innovative technologies including wind, solar, battery and hydrogen projects.”

The South-West REZ, centred around the inland town of Hay in the western Riverina region, is one of five REZs planned to help replace the state’s ageing coal-fired power stations, with four of its five fossil-fuelled power plants expected to close in the next 15 years, starting with the 1,680 MW Liddell Power Station in 2023-24.
REZs will also be developed in the New England, Hunter-Central Coast, Illawarra and Central-West Orana regions and are expected to bring 12 GW of renewable energy and 2 GW of storage online.
The Central-West Orana REZ, centred on the inland town of Dubbo, was the first of the REZs to be launched with the call for registrations of interest in 2020 attracting 27 GW of proposals when it sought 3 GW.
The ROI process for the New England REZ, based around Armidale, was also flooded with expressions of interest, with investors tabling 34 GW of proposals for a likely capacity of 8 GW.
EnergyCo, the statutory authority established by the NSW Government to lead the delivery of the state’s REZs, said the capacity of the South-West REZ will be no less than 2.5 GW with the area chosen due to “an abundance of high-quality wind and solar resources, relative land-use compatibility and existing strong investor interest”.

Its proximity to the 900-kilometre EnergyConnect project, an interconnector being built by Transgrid and ElectraNet between the NSW town of Wagga Wagga and Robertstown in South Australia, with a connection to Red Cliffs in Victoria, is also considered key. The project will also upgrade the 330 kV transmission line to 500 kV between Wagga Wagga and Dinawan, which links to the eastern edge of the REZ.
Hay said the information provided in the latest ROI process will inform the timing, capacity, design and location of the South-West REZ.
“Through this process, the NSW Government will take the important first steps to ensure all voices are heard as this vital piece of clean energy infrastructure is delivered for NSW,” he said.
“The number of responses to the ROI reflects the strong level of interest in the south-west and helps ensure only the best projects which benefit the community and maximise local renewable jobs and investment in the region will be picked.”
Hay said the South-West REZ is a significant undertaking and will take several years to plan, design and build and will most likely be delivered in stages.

Scientists from the Nankai University in China have fabricated an integrated solar rechargeable zinc battery (SRZB) powered by perovskite solar cells that could be used for wearable smart electronics, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and other electrically powered equipment.
The system was built in a 4-layer configuration including a perovskite light absorber, a sandwich joint electrode, an aqueous alkaline electrolyte, and zinc metal. “Benefiting from the integrated device structure, specially designed components and narrow-range voltage-matching mechanism, our inexpensive SRZB shows remarkably high specific energy, high specific power, high safety and high overall efficiency,” the researchers stated.
The sandwich joint electrode was embedded in the device to integrate the aqueous zinc battery with the water-sensitive perovskite solar cells. “Intrinsically, the sandwich joint electrode possesses a hydrophilic-hydrophobic-hydrophilic structure feature, which ‘hides’ the impermeable protective layer internally and exposes two external hydrophilic interfaces to simultaneously achieve protection and electrical performance,” they further explained.
One of the two hydrophilic sides of the electrode was doped with nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) to improve its compatibility with the other layers, while the other side acts as the counter electrode of perovskite solar cells to obtain better interfacial contact.
The electricity generated by the perovskite solar cells is fed into the fluorine-doped tin oxide (TiO2/FTO) substrate and is transferred to the Zn electrode to reduce zinc ions. Holes can then spread through the sandwich joint carbon layer to achieve an oxidation reaction on the positive electrode. “In this way, the SRZB can harness the infinite power of solar irradiation and store this solar energy in terms of electrochemical energy,” the Chinese group stated. “The as-stored electrochemical energy can be subsequently released with controllable and steady output according to the demand.”
After measuring the system performance, the scientists found it can achieve high specific energy of 366 Wh/kg, high specific power of 54.01 kW/kg, an overall efficiency of 6.4%, and a steady operation for more than 200 cycles with little performance degradation. “High safety and low-cost demands are also satisfied owing to the use of cost-effective materials, a safe aqueous electrolyte and a special photocharge mode,” they concluded.
The device is presented in the paper Coupling aqueous zinc batteries and perovskite solar cells for simultaneous energy harvest, conversion and storage, published in nature communications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/07/western-power-switches-on-australias-largest-microgrid/,"COMMUNITY,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 7, 2022",Western Power switches on Australia’s largest microgrid,"Western Australia grid operator Western Power this week announced the $15 million Kalbarri microgrid, which will utilise wind and solar PV power, battery energy storage and the grid to improve the reliability of electricity supply to the remote community on the state’s mid-west coast, has been switched on.
“It’s ‘power on’ for the Kalbarri microgrid,” Western Power said in a social media post.
“Today our renewable microgrid in Kalbarri, the largest of its kind in Australia, was officially launched.
“The local wind farm, residential solar panels and a big battery power this high-tech microgrid, dramatically improving power reliability in this edge-of-the-grid town. And it’s already saved hours of power outages.”
The microgrid, developed by Western Power in partnership with state-owned gentailer Synergy, is powered by 1 MW of feed-in from residential rooftop solar and a 1.6 MW wind farm, backed by a 5 MW/2 MWh battery energy storage system. The smart system is connected to the grid and will be able to reverse power flows overnight when stored energy is insufficient to meet demand and disconnect from the larger network should a fault occur.
Western Power said the project is one of Australia’s largest microgrids capable of operating in complete renewable mode.
“It can run independently or connect to the main electricity network. During an outage the microgrid maintains supply to the community using both solar and wind, and stored energy in the battery,” the grid operator said.

First announced in 2016, the microgrid was originally scheduled to come online more than three years ago but it has been beset by multiple delays, during which the Kalbarri community has been forced to deal with ongoing energy supply problems and extended outages.
The coastal tourist town, about 600 kilometres north of Perth, is at the end of a 140-kilometre-long rural feeder line connecting it to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) at Geraldton.
About 1,500 customers and more than 100,000 visitors to the town each year are served by the 33 kV feeder line which is exposed to the elements and susceptible to interference which can cause extended outages.
Western Power said the microgrid is expected to eliminate 80% of outages experienced by the town and can significantly reduce the length of outages.
“The microgrid uses leading-edge technology to minimise disruptions, and in the event of a network interruption can run independently from the main electricity network,” Western Power said.
“This advanced system will address even momentary outages, responding in milliseconds to maintain a seemingly uninterrupted power supply.”
Western Power said the modular design of the $15 million project, the state’s fourth microgrid, allows for future renewable generation sources to be integrated as they become available.

Energy Minister Bill Johnston said improving how energy is delivered in regional areas and delivering better power reliability for Western Australians is a key part of the government’s Distributed Energy Resources Roadmap.
“The Kalbarri microgrid is an important step towards improving power reliability for the local community,” he said.
“It also paves the way in delivering greater renewable energy solutions across WA, particularly in regional areas, as we move forward in achieving net zero emissions by 2050.
Mining and Pastoral Region MLC Peter Foster said the microgrid would serve as a blueprint for the delivery of innovative energy solutions throughout the state.
“The new microgrid is one of Australia’s most sophisticated and will be used as a blueprint for other regional areas to support the provision of stable, secure and clean energy into the future,” he said.
The launch of the microgrid coincided with the announcement that Kalbarri District High School (DHS) had been included in Synergy’s Schools Virtual Power Plant (VPP) project.
A 40 kw solar system and a 180 kWh battery energy storage system will be installed at Kalbarri DHS before the end of the year as part of the $8.8 million project.
The Schools VPP regional expansion now includes seven new locations, including in Geraldton and Kalgoorlie, bringing the number of participating schools to 17.
