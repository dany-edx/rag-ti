Rather than treating them as “waste”, though, these panels could be a source of social, environmental and economic value. Our new industry report outlines how we can realise that value.
PV panels contain a variety of valuable materials. The panels can also be put to new uses, such as on uninhabited community and sports club buildings, for agricultural irrigation pumps, or for camping and caravanning.
However, at present, they tend to follow a linear, “take, make, dispose” lifecycle. This results in many PV panels being sent to landfill or stockpiled. Much of their value is wasted.

The University of Queensland and Circular PV Alliance have assessed the market for used and surplus PV panels, with funding from Energy Consumers Australia. Our goal was to understand potential customers and value streams for used PV panels. We also wished to identify market or policy barriers to reusing, repurposing and recycling these panels.
We reviewed the academic research on the topic and conducted a series of interviews. Thirteen organisations with diverse interests in solar energy and PV panel reuse and recycling participated. A series of recurrent themes emerged that indicate potential or perceived opportunities and challenges for PV panel reuse.
Overall, there was broad concern among interviewees that PV panels are being decommissioned before the end of their productive lives. A few key reasons stood out:
These issues contribute to the already large amounts of discarded panels coming from solar farms, and warranty and insurance claims.
However, we also found reclaimed PV panels offer low-cost, clean energy options for households and community energy projects.

Even when not reusable, PV panels include valuable materials that can be recovered. The average silicon panel contains silver (47% of recycled materials value), aluminium (frame, 26%), silicon (cells, 11%), glass (8%) and copper (8%).
And PV panel recycling is becoming more efficient. This has led to better-quality outputs and higher recovery rates. For example, nano-silicon created by processing recovered silicon can sell for over $44,000 per kilogram.
A shift towards viewing a PV panel as a valuable resource or asset, rather than “waste”, will improve both consumer and industry understanding of its inherent value, even when it’s not brand new.
 
We can keep used PV panels out of landfill by treating them as an asset through a value-capture system. This will create a variety of benefits and opportunities.
The circular economy model loops the “take, make, reuse” phases into a self-sustaining cycle. It provides a foundation to grow markets for used PV panels. This will tap into consumer demands for credible and sustainable products and services.
There are already successful examples of similar solutions for other products in Australia and around the world. Australian examples include the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme and Tyre Stewardship Australia, as well as state-based beverage container deposit schemes.
So how do we set up a circular economy for PV panels? We found a combination of policies, regulations and commercial services can overcome the obstacles to reuse and recycling.
A consistent, national approach is needed to establish successful markets for used PV panels. Standards for testing and certifying these panels, as well as repair warranties, are essential to build consumer trust in this product.
Industry reporting and accreditation requirements as well as product traceability, so the reused and recycled panels can be accounted for, are all important elements of product stewardship and used PV panel markets.
Targeted engagement with a broader range of potential consumers, insurers and PV panel manufacturers will help overcome their perceived barriers to reusing panels.
Taken together, these actions are the building blocks of creating a circular economy for PV panels in Australia. The looming volumes of used panels and ever-increasing amount of solar energy being installed in Australia compel us to do this. Consumers, industry and the environment will all benefit.

The EnergyConnect project, a joint venture between ElectraNet and NSW network operator Transgrid, will link Robertstown, in SA’s mid-north to Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW via Buronga, with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria.
Identified as a priority project in both AEMO’s Integrated System Plan and the NSW Government’s Transmission Infrastructure Strategy, the EnergyConnect project is expected to improve energy security in both states and help accelerate the transition to a grid based around wind, solar and storage. The interconnector will provide 800 MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions and is forecast to unlock some 5.3 GW of new renewable energy projects.
ElectraNet Chief Operating Officer Rainer Korte said work on the high-voltage interconnector is progressing well with “more than 50% of construction on the South Australian component of Project EnergyConnect now complete.”
“We remain on track for construction to be completed by the end of 2023,” he said, adding the first stage of commissioning between Robertstown in SA and Buronga in NSW will take place early next year with release of initial power transfer planned for mid-2024.
Completion of the second stage from Buronga to Wagga Wagga is expected by the end of 2024, which will be followed by inter-network testing and planned release of full transfer capability by mid-2026.
ElectraNet said construction partner Downer Utilities is continuing to assemble the 330 kV transmission towers that will carry the line from the border to the new Bundey substation, with conductor stringing now taking place.
Work is also continuing on the Bundey substation with Consolidated Power Projects installing three 275 kV/330 kV transformers supplied by South Korean manufacturer Hyosung Corportation.
“The arrival and installation of the transformers is another important milestone for the project, with Bundey substation now approximately 75% complete,” Korte said, adding that once installed and commissioned, the new transformers will be the largest electricity transformers in operation on the SA network.
“The transformers will play a critical role in enabling the flow of power across the new energy highway between SA and NSW,” he said. “They are big pieces of equipment, with each one weighing more than 250 tonnes when operational.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/08/australia-warned-of-over-mining-risk-in-rush-to-secure-critical-minerals/,"EV,POLICY,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 8, 2023",Australia warned of over-mining risk in rush to secure critical minerals,"A new report from the Sydney-based Jubilee Australia Research Centre warns the race to capitalise on “staggering” demand projections for key transition minerals and to ensure the security of supply chains means Australia could be digging up more critical minerals than necessary.
The release of the report, which questions global mineral demand projections, comes as the Australian government prepares a revised critical minerals strategy, with a plan to accelerate the growth of the sector as part of efforts to reach net-zero emissions and break China’s domination of the sector.
Jubilee Australia Research Centre Executive Director Dr Luke Fletcher has however urged the government to pause and reflect so the new mining push does not repeat the mistakes and damage of past mining booms.
“It is critical that we adopt a smarter and more efficient approach as we look to exploit another resource,” he said.
“While the government’s strategy to make Australia a renewable energy superpower will validly speed up the transition from a fossil fuel-based export economy, extracting these key transition minerals will cause significant social and environmental damage if we don’t manage it correctly.”
Transition minerals, such as lithium and copper, will be vital to provide the technological components – including wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries both for storage and for electric vehicles (EVs) – that will make global decarbonisation possible.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected that mineral demand for clean energy technologies will increase four-fold by 2040, while the rate of demand for lithium could outpace supply as early as 2031.
Australia has understandably become a site of extreme interest when it comes to the acquisition of transition minerals. It is the world’s largest producer of lithium, a leading producer of cobalt and rare earth elements, and has abundant reserves of other key transition minerals such as manganese, nickel and copper.
Jubilee said the mining industry in Australia and elsewhere is using the narrative about the need for new mining for the energy transition to justify a new boom but said “there are three equally important reasons why we should pause and reflect before we rush headlong into a new orgy of mining extraction on this continent.”
“First, the amount of minerals needed for the transition remains contested,” the organisation said. “Second, we must consider the social and cultural impacts of a ‘mine first, ask questions later’ policy. Third, it will be important to weigh up the environment impacts of a new rush to mineral extraction in this country.”
The Jubilee report calls for the federal government to interrogate demand projections, investigate social and environmental impacts, and develop strategies and policy alternatives to viably reduce mineral demand.
Fletcher, lead author of the report, said that recycling minerals in lithium-ion EV batteries, which are up to 90% recoverable and are recycled in Australia at a rate of under 10%, could cut demand by half and generate another viable industry, while policies that reduce car dependence and improve mass transit could slash dependence on the batteries by a staggering 71%.
“EV batteries are a clear example where demand for lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese could all be reduced by a much stronger commitment to recycling, reducing the size and type of EVs available, and developing batteries based on minerals that are more abundant and less damaging to mine, such as potassium, sodium and carbon,” he said.
“While it makes economic sense to create jobs and wealth for Australians by keeping more of the processing of our critical minerals onshore, we need to make policy choices now that uphold the sustainable extraction of natural resources.”

Sungrow has also signed a new contract with Brisbane-headquartered wholesaler Raystech Group to supply another 250 MW of its inverters and 50 MWh of its ESS solutions.
Sungrow Australian Country Manager Joe Zhou said the supply contract with Solar Juice is a major milestone for the company, revealing it is the biggest battery distribution contract yet signed by the Chinese company.
“The partnership with Solar Juice is a significant step as it’s the largest battery project signed with our distributors,” he said.

The agreement builds on a three-year deal signed by the two parties last year for a 2 GW supply contract. Sungrow said that annual target has been beaten already and the new deal will continue to help accelerate the adoption of solar energy in Australia and create new opportunities for growth in the renewable energy sector.
Zhou said Australia’s ongoing transition to a low-carbon economy means the need for innovative and reliable renewable energy solutions, in particular energy storage has never been greater.
“Energy storage systems are essential technologies because of the support they provide in times of need to overcome supply-demand balance challenges,” he said.
Sungrow has also signed a new distribution contract with Raystech which includes the supply of 250 MW of its inverter range and 50 MWh of its ESS solutions. The agreement builds on an initial 150 MW sales contract signed last year.
Zhou said the partnership with Raystech, which has a distribution network across both Australia and New Zealand, will allow Sungrow to increase its penetration into more segments in both markets.
In other developments, Sungrow recently announced has achieved product certification in line with South Australia’s soon-to-be-introduced flexible solar exports requirements.
From 1 July 2023, the South Australian government will require new rooftop systems be fitted with software that allows electricity distributor SA Power Networks to dynamically control solar exports.
The new Dynamic Export Limit (Flexible Exports) will require all new installations up 30 kW to have CSIP (IEEE 2030.5) communication built in to allow the network operator to adjust systems’ export limit remotely.
The government has said the program is aimed at encouraging the uptake of rooftop solar, while also ensuring that the grid can handle the influx of energy during periods of high solar generation.
SunGrow said while some of its products have already completed the necessary compliance with the state’s Flexible Export Program, all of its inverters will complete the necessary development and listing process before the 1 July 2023 deadline.
Sungrow said in the future, all of its inverters will natively support dynamic export function, without requiring additional controllers, aggregators or subscription fees.
