The final investment decision comes after ACEN signed a connection agreement with infrastructure service provider Lumea and the execution of a PV module supply contract and comes just weeks after the parent company committed $800 million towards the construction of the project.
“ACEN Australia is pleased to kick off the construction of the Stubbo solar farm,” ACEN Australia chief executive officer Anton Rohner said in a statement. “Again we have been able to close and commit to a project on a merchant basis and, in the case of Stubbo, do this on our balance sheet.”
This plant will be ACEN Australia’s second 400 MW solar farm, after the New England Solar Farm currently being commissioned.
The 400 MW solar project is located within the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) in the Mid-Western Regional Council region and will connect to the existing 330 kV network between Wollar and Wellington.

It is expected the project will generate enough clean, renewable energy to power more than 185,000 average Australian homes.
The project’s development approval also includes provisions for a 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage system, allowing for the project to eventually be adapted to dispatch energy when it is most needed during peak hours and provide grid stability services.
Rohner said the finalisation of the connection agreement with Lumea, the commercial arm of transmission network operator TransGrid, was a major step in moving to the committed stage.
“It was good to work with Lumea to achieve this major milestone and confirm the connection of Stubbo Solar to the 330 kV Transgrid network,” he said. “The ability to get the connection agreement done illustrates the value of ACEN Australia’s strategy of connecting into secure and robust parts of the Transgrid network.”
Lumea chief executive Richard Lowe described the Stubbo solar project as a “vital” part of the state’s energy transition.
“This is an important milestone in the transition to a cleaner grid and delivering cheaper energy for consumers into the future,” he said.

Construction of the Stubbo Solar Farm proper is due to commence before the end of the year while a notice to proceed for the road works to site was issued last week to council. It is expected the project will generate up to 400 jobs during construction.
This FID announcement comes just days after ACEN secured $75 million of debt funding from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
The support of the federal government’s green bank is part of a $600 million debt raise from ACEN to help fast-track the delivery of its 8 GW Australian renewables pipeline of solar, wind, battery and pumped hydro.
ACEN International chief operating officer Patrice Clause said the company’s recent string of successes in Australia all contribute to its goal of 20 GW of renewable energy by 2030.
“We are fully committed to our net-zero ambition and are thankful to all our collaborators like Lumea, our local communities, our EPC contractors, module suppliers, and financing parties for joining us on this very important journey,“ he said.
ACEN Australia said it has more than 1.5 GW of projects under construction or at an advanced stage of development, including the New England Solar Farm, New England Battery, and Valley of the Winds projects in the NSW New England and Central-West Orana REZs, as well as the Robbins Island and Jim’s Plain Wind projects in north-west Tasmania.

The 30 MW agreement is Flow Power’s first PPA in Queensland and increases the retailer’s total renewable energy portfolio to more than 400 MW across the national electricity market (NEM).
Flow Power chief operating officer Byron Serjeantson said the 8.5-year agreement will enable the company to provide Queensland commercial and industrial electricity users with access to a low-cost, renewable energy supply, and is expected to generate close to 180,000 MWh of renewable energy per annum.
Flow Power, which first introduced corporate renewable PPAs in 2017, said it has seen a significant demand increase for renewable energy in the last year as energy prices have risen sharply across the NEM.
“Flow Power is delighted to be partnering with Wirsol for our first PPA in Queensland,” he said. “This PPA will enable us to continue providing energy users access to leading renewable energy projects while supporting our nation’s renewable energy transition.”
Wirsol Energy managing director Sigi Psutka said the agreement was a major milestone for the Clermont Solar Farm, which has been generating clean energy since 2019.
“We are thrilled to partner with Flow Power for this PPA with our project … and to provide Australian businesses access to supply arrangements linked to affordable, environmentally sustainable energy,” he said.
“Our team at Wirsol share Flow Power’s vision of accelerating the clean energy transition and this agreement continues our mission of creating positive impact by protecting and promoting what matters most.”

AEMO Services, serving as the NSW Consumer Trustee, said it has been directed by the NSW Energy Minister to conduct a competitive tender for long-term energy services agreements (LTESAs) for firming infrastructure under the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
An independent subsidiary of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), AEMO Services said details of the eligibility criteria for the firming tender, including duration, will be released before the end of the year but it is anticipated that firming infrastructure in the Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong sub-region will be eligible to participate.
The tender, the second in a rolling schedule that will continue over the next 10 years, is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2023 with the firming infrastructure LTESAs operational by summer 2025-26.
AEMO Services executive general manager Paul Verschuer said the timing of the firming tender had been driven by Origin Energy’s announcement earlier this year that the 2,880 MW Eraring power station at Lake Macquarie in the NSW Hunter region will be closed in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.

“A key element of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap is its flexibility and adaptability in response to changes in energy supply and demand, and this is a clear example of where it’s bringing forward additional capacity in response to an identified need,” Verschuer said.
“A firming capacity gap was identified in the May 2022 Energy Security Target Monitor Report, and new modelling was commissioned to determine the extent of the requirement, which is now reflected in the tender.”
The firming tender is designed to select projects capable of delivering new large-scale energy infrastructure as the NSW government looks to implement its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
The Roadmap, launched in 2020, sets out a path to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by 2030 as the state prepares for the exit of its coal-fired generators.
Verschuer said the firming LTESA would be similar to the agreements offered in the inaugural tender for generation and long duration storage, currently underway. While the second tender does not affect the first tender – which is seeking 2,500 GWh of annual generation and 600 MW of long-duration storage – the size of the generation and storage tenders may be altered dependent on the outcome of the inaugural tender process.
Detailed design of the second tender, including draft term sheets, is expected to be released before the end of the year.
“The mechanisms of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap recognise the dynamic operating environment of the energy transition, the benefits of the amazing innovation, and we realise how important it is to be responsive to changing needs in the marketplace and amongst investors and project proponents,” Verschuer said.
“We’re confident that the flexibility provided by the Roadmap will continue to provide us with the right tools to ensure the reliability, affordability and sustainability of electricity for NSW consumers.”

The push to establish new long duration storage and additional firming capacity comes as the state government strives to get ahead of the retirement of coal-fired generators.
All of NSW’s five operating coal-fired power stations are due to close by 2040 at the latest, with AGL’s Liddell plant in the Hunter the first go with a scheduled close in 2023.
Delta Electricity ‘s Vales Point plant is due to be decommissioned in 2029. AGL’s Bayswater coal-fired power plant is set to close “no later than” 2033 while EnergyAustralia’s Mount Piper plant near Lithgow is scheduled to shut in 2040.
The NSW government has already announced plans to build the Waratah Super Battery, a 700 MW/1,400 MWh facility that will allow consumers in the state’s main load centres access to more energy from existing electricity generators while maintaining network security.
Origin Energy has also secured planning approval for a 700 MW/2,800 MWh grid-connected battery to be developed at the site of its Eraring power station in the Hunter Valley.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/07/novel-redox-flow-battery-paves-way-for-low-cost-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 7, 2022",Novel redox flow battery paves way for low-cost storage,"From pv magazine Global
Redox flow batteries are one of the most attractive technologies for large-scale stationary storage applications due to their low capital cost, excellent safety, and environmental credentials. Their most unique feature is the independent scalability of energy and power. However, the latter is normally not possible in hybrid flow battery systems.
Now, researchers at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio, have come up with a concept for a slurry iron redox flow battery. It offers the potential for very low-cost, large-scale energy storage with safe and sustainable materials. By incorporating a conducting carbon slurry into the negative electrolyte of an all-iron flow battery, the researchers have ensured that the iron plating reaction occurs in such a way that makes the decoupling of power from energy possible for their hybrid flow battery system.
“Our iron slurry battery has advantages over the hybrid iron flow battery, where metal is plated into the electrochemical cell,” Nicholas Sinclair, research engineer at the CWRU Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, told pv magazine.
The slurry electrode allows for the plated metal to be directed into tanks for long-duration energy storage, Sinclair said. The hybrid system is limited in how much energy they can store by how much metal fits into the cell.
“In the slurry system, you can simply add more electrolyte and make the tanks bigger without changing the size of the electrochemical cell, which determines the power output,” Sinclair said.
The researchers described the scalability of the novel redox flow battery in “A perspective on the design and scale up of a novel redox flow battery” which was recently published in MRS Energy and Sustainability. They said that while the scaling of flow batteries is simple due to their modular nature, it becomes complicated when making large-scale increases in a single step. Nonetheless, their  proposed battery technology is now edging toward commercialisation.
“The battery technology was developed under an ARPA-E program for several years. During that project the technology matured to a point where commercial scale units are now being designed and tested by a company who licensed the technology from us,” said Sinclair. “We have follow-on funding for developing the technology further and expanding it to other battery chemistries as well.”
While the final price tag of the novel battery could change when it is commercialised, cost estimates calculated under the ARPA-E project stand at around USD 50/kWh ($78/kWh).
