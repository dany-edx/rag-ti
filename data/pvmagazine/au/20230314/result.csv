Australia is undergoing a globally significant renewable energy transformation. Rapid growth in large-scale renewable installations in recent years through solar and wind farms and sustained growth in the rooftop solar market has transformed Australia’s energy mix.
For brief periods in 2022, renewables powered two thirds of the (nearly national) electricity grid when just five years ago peak renewables maxed out around 30%. In South Australia, 70% of electricity comes from wind and solar, and for 180 days in 2021 the state was able to meet its total electricity demands from renewable sources, aided by batteries. As the Clean Energy Council states, a renewable energy future in Australia is both urgent, but also now ‘inevitable’. The different institutional, regulatory and market bodies that govern Australia’s electricity and infrastructure now work towards a shared goal of supplying affordable, reliable and low-emissions electricity to the grid.
This was the celebratory mode and mood of the recent State of Energy Research Conference. NSW Treasurer and Minister for Energy, Matt Kean, promoted the work of the NSW Government with its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, Renewable Energy Zones (REZs), and plans for critical mineral extraction, which pave an ambitious pathway for the state to become a global ‘Energy Superpower’.
Conference organisers and panellists exclaimed: “we’re actually doing stuff!”; so much stuff, in fact, that the current Australian energy market is now one of the most dynamic in the world, particularly at the household scale. Different presenters showed graphs depicting Australia’s future energy mix, with growing proportions of wind and solar in the decades ahead, eclipsing the soon miniscule role of fossil fuels in powering the nation (see here). They argued: 2022 was the year in which wind, solar and batteries were “settled” as the power source of the future, with their rise assured by the rapidly decreasing costs of new renewable installations. While not ready to declare Australia’s “Climate Wars” over, the message of the conference was: the renewable energy transition is happening now, so get on board.
There are many reasons that regulators, engineers and politicians might promote this self-congratulatory account of the current state of the renewable energy transition in Australia. But, away from the main stage – and within the growing body of research examining the unfolding transition across Australian homes, workplaces and landscapes – fractures in this view emerge. While many of the conference participants acknowledged – indeed, fixated on – the technical problems with managing peak load in distributed electricity systems and the scale of transmission needs, there are more fundamental challenges for Australia’s renewable energy transition. In particular, the renewable energy transition must grapple with the politics of land, labour and finance in the transition to net zero emissions. Let’s briefly consider each in turn.
The renewable energy transition is happening on First Nations lands and waters: “Indigenous peoples have recognised land interests over more than half of the continent… with more under claim”. This is a point not well communicated in, for instance, AEMO’s step-wise Integrated Systems Plan (see here), which maps development for the nearly national grid, and locates the large scale installations and transmission lines that will be necessary to reach net zero emissions. Nor is the Aboriginal land estate considered in the State’s plan for critical mineral exploration, extraction, processing and value add hubs (see here).
But, as First Nations renewable energy advocates remind us, Indigenous-owned land will be an essential component in a variety of requisite technologies for renewable energy generation, storage and transportation. The NSW REZs do stipulate engagement, employment, and benefit sharing as part of an Indigenous Procurement Policy. At a minimum, then, the renewable energy transitions creates new economic opportunities and access to services for Aboriginal peoples, but can it more expansively works towards self-determination, and even decolonisation? Can there be not only First Nations participation, but control?
Who is going to build this transition? Infrastructure Australia describes an “unprecedented” pipeline of infrastructure investment across the nation. Over the next decade, as each state looks to significantly expand its capacity for large-scale renewable energy installations, this infrastructure crunch will intensify with significant impacts on skilled labour availability.
Researchers at UTS have recently demonstrated that labour demand exceeds supply acutely during peak construction periods in each of the REZs. A shortage of skills supply will become even more pronounced as renewable energy infrastructure construction booms globally. Some commentators remain sceptical as to whether planned installations will be built as projected.
‘Just transition’ programs aim to shift workers in highly polluting industries to greener ones, where coal communities in, for instance, the Hunter and LaTrobe Valleys, are revitalised through access to employment in renewable energy industries. One of the goals of the REZs is to secure employment for affected workers. However, projections of construction activity in renewable energy industries indicates that there will be a boom in work over the next decade – which labour projections indicate will not be easily met – and then a rapid decline as more minimal operations and maintenance requirements continue.
Meeting these jobs will require an increase in training programs and detailed planning of timelines. In addition to the quantitative questions of work are more important ones about quality: much of the labour force constructing renewable energy installations face temporary and precarious positions in their employment contracts and residency rights, and patterns of gendered and racialised exploitation are emerging across the supply chain. Not all green jobs are good jobs.
In our previous research, we’ve considered who will pay for climate infrastructures, and what these financial relations mean for the social and environmental impacts of how infrastructure is built. In short, who pays – whether the state, a combination of state and market through public-private partnerships, or new collectives in community-based renewables – matters for renewable energy installations. However, these considerations were curiously absent from the conference, despite Australia hosting one of the world’s largest green banks, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which has acted as a global model for blending public and private finance.
NSW and Victoria have adopted contrasting financing models in their ambitious renewable energy investment pipelines. Victoria aims to reverse many key instruments of privatisation undertaken in the 1990s in pursuit of public ownership of energy, and will re-establish the much maligned State Electricity Commission. In contrast, while the NSW Government has been key to the establishment of the REZs and the turbo-charging of renewables more generally, it positions the role of governments as subsidising and ‘de-risking’ the private sector, which will finance, build and operate these installations. Understanding the financial, social and environmental effects of financing models for renewable energy will be a crucial area of future research.
While the last year has seen dramatic changes in the renewable energy landscape of Australia, the social, environmental and economic stakes of these changes remain high. The renewable energy transition is far from settled.

At the recent Tesla Investor Day at its Texas Gigafactory in Austin, the electric vehicle (EV) and battery storage manufacturer revealed some interesting tidbits about its Megapack energy storage business. The March 1 Investor Day saw Megapack Senior Director Mike Snyder set a goal of reaching 100 GWh in global Megapack installation in 2023.
Snyder has worked at Tesla for nine years, much of which has been spent in the gruelling work of ramping up Tesla’s Megapack production facilities in the US to meet the increasing demand for its utility-scale stationary storage product. Its Megapack factory in Lathrop, California, fittingly referred to as the “Megafactory” though its the smaller cousin to the four Gigafactories Tesla runs in Austin, Fremont, Berlin and Shanghai, which together churn out 40,000 EVs per week. 
According to Snyder over 16 GWh of Megapacks have been installed globally to date. But Snyder sees 100 GWh as the annual run rate for the next few years – a big ramp up after just 16 GWh in the initial 10 years. The latest product is the sixth generation Megapack XL, packing 3 MWh per unit of the lithium-ion battery. Snyder calls the Megapack XL the stationary battery storage product with the highest energy density on the market, capable of packing up to 300 MWh on a single acre of land. According to Snyder that’s twice the power density of a typical gas peaker plant. 
Snyder was joined onstage by Drew Baglino, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering. Both Baglino and Snyder highlighted Tesla’s mastery of power electronics, with the company “delivering more power electronics than the solar and wind industries combined on an annual basis.” The cumulative output so far has been 1.4 TW across Tesla’s vehicle and stationary storage products. Coupled with Tesla’s extensive in-house capabilities in software development, the Megapack can function in “virtual machine mode,” providing synthetic inertia to the electricity grid.
According to Baglino, it’s no longer simply a matter of injecting clean energy to the grid, but “adding power stability” to the mix. As Megapack costs continue to decline, these utility-scale energy storage units will replace conventional fossil fuel power plants to provide both energy and stability to power grids. 

While the 2030 goal on the EV front is to produce 20 million vehicles annually, the 2030 goal on the energy storage front is to hit the 1 TWh mark. According to Tesla this will require an investment of up to $262.5 billion (USD 175 billion), which is actually less than one third of Tesla’s current market capitalization. On the other hand, it’s about five times the amount of Tesla’s cumulative investment so far (USD 28 billion). 
As on the EV side, Tesla’s ambitions for its Megapacks are impressive: the long-term goal is to boost annual output to 1 TWh, which would represent 25 x the annual production capacity of the current factory in Lathrop. Lathrop itself was quite an achievement, after Tesla took less than a year to transform a JC Penney distribution center into a state-of-the-art Megapack manufacturing facility. 
Speed is also of the essence when it comes to getting Megapack projects built. Snyder highlights the plug & play nature, and notes that Megapacks can be easily strung together to form massive and intelligent power blocks that can readily connect to electricity grids across the world.
In the past four years alone Tesla has increased the installation speed of Megapack projects fourfold, while at the same time reducing the required workforce by a factor of three. 
Tesla’s Investor Day also covered developments on the distributed storage front, where Tesla’s Powerwall is the flagship product. Both the Megapack and Powerwall are key elements in Tesla’s vision to get, as Elon Musk phrased it on the day, to a “sustainable energy earth.”

PNL Indonesia Power (PNL IP), a unit of Indonesian utility PT PLN (Persero), has invited potential investors to submit their expression of interest in participating as equity partners in the Proyek Hijaunesia 2023 project, an initiative aimed at the construction of several large scale ground-mounted and floating solar plants, as well as wind farms.
The company said it will retain a majority stake in each tendered project and that the plants will be located in the islands of Java and Bali, as well as in the Aceh semi-autonomous province on the northwest part of Sumatra Island.
“Furthermore, in line with the direction of the Ministry of Industry to support the development of the national Solar PV industry, PLN IP would also support the invitation of Tier-1 Solar PV manufacturers who intend to set up factories in Indonesia to contribute towards meeting the local content requirements,” PNL IP said in the tender document.
Interested investors and manufacturers will have time until March 16 to submit their proposals.
In January, PT PLN Nusantara Power, another unit of PT PLN, launched the pre-qualification process for a tender to deploy a 100 MW floating solar plant. In 2020, PLN tendered two floating PV projects with capacities of 60 MW and 90 MW. The final prices came in at USD 0.0374/kWh and ISD 0.0368/kWh ($0.056 – $0.055) respectively.
Indonesia began supporting large-scale PV via a law issued in April 2017. The country’s cumulative installed PV capacity remains negligible, at roughly 211 MW by the end of 2021, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
The Indonesian government wants the country to deploy 6.5 GW of solar by 2025 and 45 GW by 2050.

In early March, Solartech Indonesia 2023 took place at the Jakarta Convention and Exhibition Center, attracting around 20,000 visitors and 300 industry exhibitors from 20 countries.
The event is the country’s largest green energy trade show, and despite Indonesia’s relatively small solar market, the event highlighted the region’s increasing interest in new solar investment.
“We think Indonesia is still in the starting years and utility companies are now beginning to develop their first PV projects,” said Jimmy Shen, brand manager at Chinese module maker JinkoSolar, who added that while the show attracts fewer visitors than other countries, potential clients can still be found.
According to Lorca Wei, ASEN marketing manager at Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow, most of the Indonesian companies active in the solar business were present at the event. “We invited and met our major clients at this trade show, which we hope may have a higher number of visitors next year,” he said.
Growatt Sales Manager Anna Kang told pv magazine the event is an opportunity for the company to meet new and existing clients and, at the same time, showcase some of its new technologies. “We are among the three largest inverter suppliers in this country and we will definitely come back to this show next year,” she said.
The event also showed the attractiveness of Indonesia for solar module manufacturing. “We see the government as ready to transform the energy sector and the renewable energy industry,” said Elaine Zhu, marketing manager at Chinese PV production equipment supplier Autowell. “We also already have some clients here.”
Irene Li, sales manager at Chinese mounting system provider Mibet, added that Indonesia is an interesting market for floating PV, for which demand is constantly growing. “This event is a good platform to understand what Indonesia really needs.”
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Indonesia had around 211 MW of installed PV capacity at the end of 2021. The agency expects that the country may reach 66 GW of solar by 2030.
According to recent data published by IESR based on the solar resource mapping of NREL Re Explore, Indonesia has the technical potential to deploy up to 655 GW of cumulative rooftop PV capacity.
