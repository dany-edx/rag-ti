In their submissions, Transgrid and ElectraNet said if they were unable to access customer payments earlier, their credit rating would deteriorate, making it difficult for them to secure financing for the large-scale transmission infrastructure projects outlined in the ISP.
Projects include the $1.53 billion Project EnergyConnect which will see the construction of a new 330 kV double-circuit interconnector between South Australia and New South Wales.
Other large-scale transmission infrastructure projects identified in the ISP include an upgrade to the existing Victoria ‒ New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) and the construction of HumeLink, a 500 kV transmission upgrade to increase transfer capacity from the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme.
The AEMC however disagreed, saying the current rules do not prevent these projects attracting finance and the proposed changes would have had “significant downsides” for consumers and “would likely substantially increase costs to consumers in the near to medium term”.
AEMC’s decision announced on Thursday mirrors that outlined in the draft determination published in February when it said it had found no barrier to financing large-scale transmission projects under current energy rules and proposed to keep existing rules in place to protect consumers from higher up-front costs.
“These TransGrid and ElectraNet proposals would cost consumers money and expose them to greater risks,” AEMC chief executive Benn Barr said at the time.
“Effectively it wants consumers to pay for energy assets as they are being built – like asking motorists to pay tolls on roads before they can be built and used.”

The AEMC said in the short- to medium-term, the TransGrid and ElectraNet proposal would at a minimum increase the network charge component on household consumer bills by $6 a year in NSW, and $4 a year in SA, just for Project EnergyConnect.
Significant reductions in wholesale electricity prices as a result of Project EnergyConnect are not expected to occur until after 2030, meaning consumers now will be paying more for the project than consumers in the future, despite consumers not receiving the benefits now.
The AEMC said applying the TransGrid and ElectraNet proposal to other ISP projects such as Humelink and VNI minor would increase costs even further. And while the intention is for costs to decrease in later years, this would not apply until 2040.
“The intergenerational wealth transfer caused by the proposed changes to the rules would be unlikely to be in the long-term interests of consumers, particularly given that current consumers would be paying for benefits enjoyed by future consumers,” the AEMC said in a statement.
The AEMC said the requests would also make the regulatory framework more complex, increasing the costs of regulation and reducing incentives for networks to build projects on time.
“Based on the evidence we have gathered, the Commission does not believe there is a need to change the rules,” Barr said.
The AEMC said the final determinations came after consultations and consideration of submissions from a range of stakeholders including the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).

The installation comprises 128 Trina Solar HoneyBlack DD06M.05(II) 325 W modules which are expected to generate 30 MWh of electricity. The modules have been installed on the core walls of the tower and cover 158m².
Melbourne-based essential services provider b.energy was responsible for the design and construction, and operations and maintenance of the system and opted for is labelled a ‘verticality renewables strategy’ as a way to overcome limited space on the roof of the tower
B.Energy chairman James Dunstan said the 42kW system outperforms similar developments in terms of emission reduction, cost reduction and green energy sustainability.
“The combination of a painted lift core and stylish HoneyBlack modules has not only markedly complemented the building design aesthetics, but will assist in reducing common property electricity costs,” he said.
“Whilst electricity production would generally be closer to c56 MWh for flat or degree mounted systems, generating c30 MWh far exceeds the renewables that could otherwise be achieved on the constrained rooftop.”
While b.energy has used traditional modules for the Paragon install, the project adds weight to a report released by the Australian PV Institute (APVI) which declared the business case for building-integrated PV (BIPV) is stronger than ever, identifying it as one of five key avenues for increased market penetration of PV.
BIPV is yet to enjoy the same widespread deployment as roof-mounted solar modules that adorn more than 2.56 million homes across Australia, but the APVI believes the versatility of BIPV means it has enormous potential for growth.
The business case recommendations are detailed in the International Energy Agency (IEA) report on BIPV which was released late last year and highlights that “building-integrated PV offers huge potential to exploit roofs and facades as a local energy source”.
Beulah executive director Adelene Teh said the inclusion of the solar PV power plant as part of the Paragaon project was important in ensuring the company continues its journey towards sustainable developments with reduced carbon footprints.
The company said the utilisation of the tower’s vacant space is not only innovative but is also an attractive value-add that differentiates the tower’s embedded renewables offering which, in turn, is an enticing cost-saving to prospective residents and the developer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/08/qem-to-complete-solar-pv-study-as-part-of-green-hydrogen-plan/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 8, 2021",QEM to complete solar PV study as part of green hydrogen plan,"The ASX-listed QEM has engaged technical consultant DNV Australia to conduct a pre-feasibility study focusing on the potential of solar PV and wind farms to power a green hydrogen production facility at the remote location.
The announcement comes after QEM last month confirmed it had commissioned E2C Advisory to investigate the capital and operating cost requirements for the company to produce green hydrogen at the Julia Creek site using a solar-powered electrolyser.
QEM managing director Gavin Loyden said on Thursday the exploration and production mining company is proactively progressing its green hydrogen strategy.
“Engaging DNV demonstrates that we are swiftly laying the foundations for green hydrogen opportunities at Julia Creek,” he said.
“The Julia Creek site receives significant sun exposure and DNV has already noted that the site is substantially flat, which bodes well for installation of wind power generation.”
DNV, formerly DNV GL, will complete solar farm resource mapping and modelling, as well as a preliminary solar PV system design. DNV will also develop a preliminary wind turbine layout and assess wind farm resources.
The study will help QEM assess how complementary wind and solar are at the site as potential renewable energy sources for the electrolyser to produce hydrogen.
The pre-feasibility study is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter and will be followed by more solar resource monitoring and wind resource measurements.
“The commissioning of these studies will lay the groundwork to advance our green hydrogen strategy at Julia Creek, amid increasingly buoyant market conditions and the project’s optimal location and resource profile to produce hydrogen on-site,” Loyden said.

The Julia Creek project is located in Queensland’s North West Minerals Province. The region is not connected to the National Energy Market (NEM) but the CopperString 2.0 high voltage transmission line is set to connect Mount Isa with Townsville.
It is envisaged the green hydrogen would initially be used as a support to the energy needs of other resource projects in the region but would ultimately be used for the hydrogeneration of QEM’s raw oil into transport fuels.
QEM’s pursuit of its green hydrogen production strategy comes amid growing interest in the renewable energy source from both the private and public sectors.
The Queensland Government has been active in its support of the renewable energy source,  committing $25 million as part of an industry development fund.
The State Government has also appointed Australia’s first dedicated minister for hydrogen, with Minister for Energy Mick de Brenni taking on the portfolio. And last month it named a seven-member team of industry experts to fast track the establishment of a sustainable hydrogen supply chain.
“The Hydrogen Taskforce’s primary job will be to work with industry across the supply chain to help accelerate the growth of the hydrogen sector in Queensland,” de Brenni said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/08/solar-pv-powered-megawall-to-charge-electric-bus-fleet/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,EV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 8, 2021",Solar PV powered ‘megawall’ to charge electric bus fleet,"Transdev has continued its transition to zero emission vehicles in Australia, adding two more electric buses to its fleets in both Brisbane and Sydney after Melbourne-based bus manufacturer Volgren earlier this month delivered four of its electric vehicles to the public transport operator.
Transdev, which operates public transport systems in 17 countries, has already introduced five new electric buses to its fleets in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.
Transdev Australasia CEO Luke Agati said the Brisbane buses would be 100% powered by sustainable solar energy after the company installed a rooftop solar facility and battery storage system at its Capalaba depot.
The company said the solar PV powered ‘green mobility megawall’ can generate up to 159,000 kWh of renewable energy annually and is combined with 135 kWh hours of battery storage.
“Averaging more than 280 days of sunshine per year, Queensland well and truly lives up to its reputation as the Sunshine State, and we are excited to be bringing this clean, green, modern vehicle to Brisbane,” Agati said.
“Globally, Transdev is a leader in zero-emissions mobility and work is underway to introduce new fleet and innovations to Australia and New Zealand over the coming months.
“Research, testing and design for our future zero-emissions fleet will be led from our newly opened Maintenance and Engineering Centre of Excellence, also based at our Capalaba depot.”

The new electric buses were built at Volgren’s factory in Dandenong in Melbourne’s east, using all Australian parts other than the chassis and the 348 kW Lithium Phosphate battery, which were manufactured by Chinese company BYD.
Volgren engineering manager Brenton McCallum said the 39-seat buses have an average range of 250km over the life of the battery, and up to 300km earlier in its life.
The Volgren bus which is being trialled in Melbourne in partnership with the Victorian Government has however exceeded that estimation, travelling nearly 1,000km on just two charges.
Agati said the decision to manufacture the buses locally was an acknowledgement of the skill and expertise of Australia’s local bus manufacturing sector.
“Australia is on the cusp of an e-mobility revolution in public transport,” he said. “We want to see more Australians travelling on zero-emissions electric and hydrogen powered buses, and we want Australian bus manufacturers to lead the journey with us.”
The delivery of the new buses comes just weeks after the first fully Australian designed and built electric bus was put to the test in Sydney.
That trial is part of the New South Wales Government’s push to replace all of its 8,000 diesel buses with electric ones by 2030.
The Victorian Government is also accelerating its switch to electric buses, announcing last year a $20 million, three-year statewide trial aimed at transitioning to a zero-emission bus fleet.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/08/tasmanian-labor-installs-solar-at-the-top-of-its-campaign-promises/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 8, 2021",Tasmanian Labor installs solar at the top of its campaign promises,"Tasmania (TAS) is going to the polls on May 1, and the opposition Labor Party has put forth a $20 million plan to fund loans for Tasmanians to buy solar and energy storage for their homes and businesses, in an effort to win the election. Not only that, but TAS Labor has also promised $5 million for solar in State schools and $17.5 million for solar installations and energy efficiency upgrades in social housing. 
The plan will see $20 million used to fund loans of up to $15,000 for batteries and solar for residential and commercial properties. Labor Leader Rebecca White said that Premier Peter Gutwein and his Liberal Party have fumbled feed-in tariffs and she aims to ensure Tasmanians who invest in solar keep the value of their investment. 
“Solar owners have been badly let down by the Liberals and have seen the value of their investment crumble after the feed-in tariffs were cut,” said White. Of course, one could argue that it is hard to keep feed-in tariffs with Tasmania already having achieved 100% renewables. 
Nevertheless, White notes that “the controversial new ‘solar tax’ proposed by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) will further hit the value of feed-in tariffs with people set to be charged for exporting solar power to the grid.”
Since this means the reinstatement of feed-in tariffs is now almost impossible, White believes the only solution is battery storage. “Battery storage is the equivalent of receiving a feed-in tariff equal to the retail rate charged by Aurora,” continued the Labor Leader. 
These loans would be over ten years in which the first three years would be interest free and a low interest for the rest. “Tasmanians need to feel secure in their solar investment and under the Liberals this has not been the case,” argues White. 
According to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia’s 2021 Renewable Superpower Scorecard, Tasmania leads Australia in the energy transition, having already achieved 100% renewables, legislating the largest renewable energy target in the world, and is ambitious in its progress toward green hydrogen production. 
Solar for schools and social housing 
In addition to the loan plan, TAS Labor is also promising to deliver $5 million for the installation of solar panels at state schools. The savings the panels would provide said schools would also be kept by said schools. 
White estimates “that by installing solar panels, each school could save around $22 thousand a year from their power bill. Under Labor’s policy this is a significant saving that can be poured back into increasing the learning outcomes of students at each participating school.” 
The Solar Schools Fund is an initiative building on Labor’s $17.5 million plan to install solar panels on social housing.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has crunched the numbers for its annual survey of new clean energy capacity and said 2020 saw solar–photovoltaics and concentrating solar power–reach rough parity with the amount of wind power capacity worldwide.
Helped along by 78 GW of new grid-connected solar facilities across Asia, IRENA said, solar caught up with wind, and the two non-hydropower sources of clean electricity now account for more global capacity than hydro plants.
IRENA confirmed China again led the solar charge, with 49 GW of new grid-connected plants, with regional neighbours Vietnam (11 GW), Japan (more than 5 GW) and India and South Korea (more than 4 GW each) also adding to the Asian total.
With the world adding 127 GW of solar capacity in 2020–the vast majority of it photovoltaics–IRENA said more than 80% of the new electricity plants installed worldwide generate energy from renewables, with solar and wind projects accounting for 91% of that contribution.
The U.S. added 80% more renewables capacity last year than it did in 2019, including 15 GW of solar, according to IRENA’s Renewable Energy Capacity Statistics 2021 report. Africa added 2.6 GW of clean power projects and Australia did the heavy lifting as Oceania posted an 18.4% rise in the volume of clean energy capacity added.
With the world reaching 2.8 TW of clean power generation capacity, according to the study, photovoltaics hit 707 GW, led by Asia, where China accounts for 254 GW of the regional total of 406 GW. At the other end of the scale, Bhutan has no PV capacity as it generates more than 99% of its electricity from hydro facilities.
Europe, which generates 49.8% of its electricity from renewables, boasted 161 GW of PV capacity, with Germany contributing 53.8 GW, according to IRENA. The Faroe Islands is the only nation in Europe without any PV capacity, according to the report.
North America is the third biggest region for PV, with the U.S. supplying 73.8 GW of its 82.8 GW of photovoltaic projects and hydro-reliant Canada only 3.33 GW.
Australia hosts virtually all of its region’s PV, reaching 17.63 GW of the regional 17.98 GW at the end of the year. New Zealand is the next biggest market, with 142 MW, and tiny Niue and 88%-clean-power Tokelau, along with Papua New Guinea, have only 1 MW of photovoltaic projects each. Brazil dominates South American solar, with 7.88 GW of the region’s 12.67 GW of photovoltaic capacity. Paraguay and disputed British territory the Malvinas islands have no solar generation capacity, with the former almost entirely reliant on hydro.
South Africa supplied 5.49 GW of its continent’s 9.5 GW of solar capacity with IRENA estimating there was no on-grid solar capacity in hydro-powered Lesotho or in Sao Tome et Principe, Equatorial Guinea, Djibouti, Chad or the Central African Republic.
The 6.67 GW of solar capacity in Turkey dominated the 8.23 GW installed in Eurasia by the end of the year, with another hydro-powered state, Georgia, having just 1 MW of solar arrays. The UAE accounted for 2.44 GW of the Middle East‘s 6.52 photovoltaic capacity, with war-torn Syria estimated to have just 2 MW of operational, grid-connected facilities. The nations of Dominica, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands had no solar capacity at the end of the year, according to IRENA, in a Central America and Caribbean region which hosted 2.39 GW, led by Honduras‘ 514 MW of installed capacity. The French overseas territory of Saint Barthélemy and the island of St Martin–split between France and the Netherlands, similarly, had no grid-connected solar at the end of the year.
IRENA also estimated the world reached 4.31 GW of off-grid solar capacity in 2020, with India the only gigawatt nation, thanks to 1.13 GW of non grid-connected facilities. That figure was unchanged from 2019 whereas Kazakhstan added 199 MW of off-grid arrays last year to reach 807 MW as Asia reached 2.8 GW of standalone projects. Africa is the only other gigawatt scale off-grid market, according to IRENA, with 1.05 GW of projects, 423 MW of them in Algeria.
Some 2.8 MW of off-grid solar was added despite the conflict in Yemen last year to take the nation to 253 MW of such facilities, with the Middle East hosting 306 MW of off-grid projects.
Peru supplied 45.7 MW of South America’s 86.4 MW of off-grid solar capacity and the Dominican Republic 21 MW of the standalone generation facilities in Central America and the Caribbean. The 3.2 MW of off-grid solar in French Polynesia made the biggest contribution to the 18.9 MW installed across Oceania.
