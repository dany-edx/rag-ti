Matt Penfold, Fluence’s commercial – digital vice president, described Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) as one of the most complex energy markets in the world, with energy and ancillary services requiring assets to trade at five-minute intervals while integrating ever-higher amounts of variable renewable energy penetration.
“As the number of grid-scale wind and solar farms has increased in recent years, so have the challenges of operating them profitably in a more dynamic wholesale electricity market,” Penfold told pv magazine.
“In addition, batteries have additional capabilities and complexities of operation that also need to be factored into trading strategies.”
Penfold said renewables and battery asset operators are having to deal with exposure to negative prices, physical grid constraints, frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) costs, and managing trading strategies.
He said the challenges of today’s fast-moving market means a growing number of asset operators are adopting software-based bidding tools to help them participate in the market more actively and respond more dynamically to the NEM’s price signals.
Data provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) shows that 30% of grid-scale solar and wind assets had started using automated bidding solutions in the past two years to optimize performance and reduce exposure to negative pricing.

Seyed Madaeni, chief digital officer at Fluence, said the rapid uptake shows significant appetite for this type of software to boost the value of renewable energy assets and/or utility-scale batteries.
“Trading renewables and energy storage in merchant markets is now so complex that it requires AI-based software to manage decision-making,” he said.
“Sophisticated bidding and optimization software not only provides powerful tools to complement trading desk operations and increase asset revenue, but also supports greater efficiency at the grid level by improving the operation and dispatch of renewable and storage assets.”
United States-headquartered Fluence acquired Advanced Microgrid Solutions’ (AMS) software and digital intelligence platform in October as part of push to assist its utility, developer and commercial and industrial customers optimize their energy storage and renewable assets.
In the six months since it acquired AMS, Fluence’s Trading Platform has been selected to help manage 1.5 GW of wind and solar projects in Australia, including projects by Spark Renewables and BJCE.
It is being used to manage approximately 18% of the NEM’s grid-scale wind and solar assets, or 60% of those asset owners who are already using software for bidding.
Among the projects utilizing Fluence’s Trading Platform is Tilt Renewables’ 100 MW Snowtown 1 wind farm in South Australia.

Edify Energy has also adopted the Trading Platform to help manage a portfolio of five solar farms totalling 438 MWp, including the 180 MWp Daydream Solar Farm in Queensland and the 69 MWp Hamilton and 60 MWp Gannawarra solar farms in Victoria.
Fluence said its Trading Platform utilizes artificial intelligence to analyse thousands of variables to forecast market prices and anticipate grid conditions that are likely to cause negative prices. The platform provides the asset owner with optimal economic bids, which tell the grid operator the prices at which the asset is willing to continue generating. The company said the resulting market-compliant bids can increase revenue for wind and solar asset owners by up to 10% over a 12-month period.
“Fluence’s AI-powered Trading Platform provides better forecasting so that solar and wind operators know when to ramp down, reducing losses from negative pricing events and making renewable energy more competitive and lucrative,” Penfold said.
“We have created proprietary, probabilistic price forecasts that have consistently proven more accurate than the only publicly available alternative, the pre-dispatch price projections provided by AEMO.”
Fluence said its Trading Platform can integrate with battery energy storage systems from any original equipment manufacturer or technology provider, as well as a range of renewable energy assets, including wind and solar.
“This flexibility enables Fluence to provide more value to a broader set of customers, optimizing portfolios of diverse assets and accelerating the adoption of renewables and energy storage, either separately or together,” Penfold said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/21/ampol-unveils-renewable-hydrogen-plan-for-oil-refinery-site/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 21, 2021",Ampol unveils renewable hydrogen plan for oil refinery site,"Irish-headquartered hydrogen technology company Fusion Fuel confirmed on Friday it had executed a Heads of Agreement with Australia’s biggest fuel supplier to develop a renewable hydrogen production plant at Ampol’s Lytton oil refinery site in Brisbane.
While details of the project are scant, it has been confirmed it will feature Fusion’s GreenGas technology, a solar-to-hydrogen power plant which uses concentrated PV (CPV) solar modules in combination with the company’s HEVO technology, a miniaturized polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer.
Reuters reported the hydrogen production test will be very small, producing only 1.5 tonnes of hydrogen from 10 units a year. Lytton already produces 30 tonnes of hydrogen a day from the oil product naphtha.
Fusion Fuel chairman Jeffrey Schwarz Fuel said the technology allows for the production of renewable hydrogen at costs comparable to fossil-fuel hydrogen.
“Early on we identified Australia as a key market for us,” he said.
“Australia’s abundance of solar energy makes it among the absolute best geographies for our HEVO-solar solution, which combines concentrating photovoltaic technology with our proprietary microelectrolyzer, allowing us to produce green hydrogen at costs comparable to grey and brown hydrogen.”
The plant is expected to be commissioned within the next 12 months and, if successful, will provide the framework to pursue renewable hydrogen opportunities in the region on a joint-venture basis.
Fusion’s announcement comes after Ampol this week revealed it would invest at least $100 million on developing new fuels over the next five years, including renewable hydrogen and increased electric vehicle (EV) charging options.
The company’s renewable strategy also includes plans to use 50% equivalent net renewables by 2030 and to reach net-zero carbon emissions at its operations by 2040. It will also team with Tesla and Enerven to pilot a virtual power plant (VPP) project at three of its petrol stations in Adelaide.
Ampol said the VPP project, featuring Tesla Powerwall batteries and up to 99 kW of solar PV modules at each of the sites, would allow it to assess potential integration of EV fast charging with solar and battery storage and test the potential for these initiatives to be scaled nationally across the company’s retail network.
Ampol chief executive Matt Halliday said the company was well positioned to develop new energy opportunities.
“We needed to do this. This is responding to a strategic issue around the energy transition and the role Ampol plays,” he said.
“We expect traditional liquid fuels to play a key role in Australia’s energy mix for years to come. However, we also know our customers’ needs are changing and they are seeking lower emissions alternatives. Accordingly, we must continue to evolve, innovate and adapt to help them deliver viable low emissions solutions for the future.”
Ampol outlined its decarbonisation strategy just days after receiving a huge support package from the Federal Government worth up to $1.1 billion over nine years, protecting it from refining losses and helping it upgrade its Lytton refinery.
The Federal Government on Monday finalised a deal that will keep Ampol’s Lytton facility going for at least another six years at a cost to taxpayers of more than $100 million a year.
Viva Energy’s Geelong plant in Victoria is also set to benefit, remaining open up until 2030 as part of the agreement designed to maintain at least some refinement capacity in Australian hands.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/21/neoen-signals-start-of-construction-for-queensland-green-energy-hub/,"EMPLOYMENT,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 21, 2021",Neoen signals start of construction for Queensland green energy hub,"Neoen announced on Friday construction of the $373 million Kaban Green Power Hub will commence after Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk had earlier confirmed the state will invest $40 million to upgrade transmission lines in the state’s far north as it looks to develop the Northern Queensland Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
The Premier said the 320-kilometre transmission line upgrade would strengthen the network in Far North Queensland and allow renewables developer Neoen to push ahead with its Kaban wind farm and battery project to be built near Cairns.
Neoen said on Friday financial close is expected in the coming months but it has already provided notice to proceed to principal contractor and wind turbine manufacturer Vestas, signalling the start of construction of the green energy hub. Energy generation is scheduled to commence in 2023.
Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy said the announcement was an important milestone for the project which has already secured a long-term power purchase agreement with CleanCo.
“We are also grateful to those in the wider community who have advocated for the project and the benefits it will bring,” he said.
“We look forward to Kaban contributing to Queensland’s energy transition.”
The wind farm will comprise 28 turbines and is expected to generate 457 GWh of clean energy annually, enough to power about 100,000 homes. It will connect via a new substation into the existing overhead transmission line.
Powerlink will in turn upgrade the transmission line between Cairns and Townsville from 132 kV to 275 kV, a move that Palaszczuk said would not only allow Neoen to proceed but would also open the region up for more solar and wind energy projects.
“Our investment in new transmission line infrastructure today won’t just enable Neoen to forge ahead with their Kaban project – it has potential to leverage hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of new investment in renewable energy in North Queensland in the future,” she said.
The state funding for the transmission line upgrade comes just weeks after federal resources minister Keith Pitt blocked a $280 million loan facility from the government-operated Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (NAIF).
Pitt said he was not convinced the Kaban green energy hub would provide “dispatchable” generation into the national electricity market (NEM) or that it would lower power prices.

State minister for energy Mick de Brenni took a swipe a Pitt on Friday, saying the government had turned its back on the Kaban energy hub which he said would be the cornerstone for the Northern Queensland REZ.
“Pitt’s veto announcement just doesn’t stack up,” he said.
“The Morrison Government is hopelessly conflicted on renewable energy, even going so far as to ignore large-scale storage in the region to veto Kaban under the guises of dispatchability.”
The project is expected to create 250 jobs while the transmission line upgrade would deliver another 97 jobs.
“Renewables create jobs and put downward pressure on power prices,” Palaszczuk said.
“That’s why backing our renewables sector is an important part of our economic recovery plan.
“Along with the Kidston Pumped Hydro Storage Project, this wind farm will power the North and keep Queensland on track to meet our 50% renewables target by 2030.”

A company spokesperson told pv magazine that the plant will produce hydrogen from seawater and will be powered by a 30 MW solar plant and a 20 MWh storage system with an autonomy of 4 hours.
The facility will be based on double-reverse osmosis treatment with energy recovery followed by electrolysis of deionised water through proton exchange membrane (PEM). Furthermore, secondary electrolysis of concentrated brine will be implemented by cell membrane electrolysis.
The main electrolyser at the facility will have an installed capacity of 20 MW and an estimated production of 1,000 tons per year. The produced fuel will be then stored in trucks for pressurised gas at 400 bar pressure.
Hydrogen will be used as fuel for public transport at the port and urban cleaning vehicles in the city of Almería. It will also be utilised to feed the port’s unloading machinery, the national and international transport of goods, and part of the energy demand of local manufacturing industries.
The project has a required investment of €80.5 million (AU$126 million) and is scheduled to be built by the end of 2024. Gransolar confirms that it has the interest and commitment of the Almería City Council, as well as multiple companies from different professional sectors, without providing further details.
Almería will not be the only Andalusian port with plans to produce hydrogen. The Port of Malaga is also expected to host green hydrogen production through a project that also contemplates the use of artificial intelligence.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/21/kidston-pumped-hydro-reaches-financial-close-given-green-light/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 21, 2021","Kidston pumped hydro reaches financial close, given green light","Australia’s first pumped hydro energy storage system to be built in 37 years, Genex Power’s Kidston Clean Energy Hub, is set for construction with the reach of financial close on its Kidston Stage 2 project. To put that in context, 37 years ago it was 1984, Bob Hawke was Prime Minister, Elton John married Renate Blauel in Sydney, and Advance Australia Fair became the national anthem. 
The green light for the $777 million pumped hydro project (including transmission infrastructure), is a boon to Queensland’s (QLD) renewable energy ambitions. The 250 MW / 2,000 MWh (baseload) hub at the former 
Kidston Gold Mine will possess the equivalent of eight hours of energy storage and support the introduction of new renewable energy generation in the state. 
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is chipping in $47 million on top of the $9 million it has already spent on feasibility and development of the project, and $8.9 million for the original 50 MW Kidston Solar Project back in 2016. 
The large part of the financing comes from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF), with $610 million, and as pv magazine has previously reported, EnergyAustralia will operate the envisaged 250 MW pumped storage asset for up to 30 years.  
The project requires a 187km transmission line to connect the North Queensland Hub to the NEM. The QLD government has committed to support this infrastructure. 
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the Kidston project “will supply dispatchable, renewable energy to the grid when and where it is needed and provide a blueprint for how we store excess solar and wind energy at scale.” 
Miller said the financial close on the project was a significant milestone and pointed to the significant role projects like Kidston have in progressing Australia’s energy transition. “Storage solutions such as pumped hydro and large scale batteries are a key part in providing back up power and grid stability as highlighted in the Australian Government’s first Low Emissions Technology Statement,” Miller said. 
The project is expected to be completed by 2024, generate 500 jobs in the meantime and 20 permanent positions.

Malta Inc. and Duke Energy, using a Department of Energy grant, are partnering on a one-year study to assess the socioeconomic, environmental, and operational issues behind converting retiring coal units into long-duration, zero-emissions energy storage systems.
The two companies will look at integrating Malta’s 100 MW, 10-hour pumped heat energy storage system into existing infrastructure at a Duke Energy coal plant in North Carolina.
Malta’s system stores electricity either directly from a power plant or from the grid. It does this by converting electricity into thermal energy (heat and cold). The heat is stored in molten salt, a proven method of storing thermal energy, and the cold is stored in an antifreeze-like solution with components and subsystems derived from the liquefied natural gas industry.
In practice, the system operates like a conventional power plant. When electricity is needed, the thermal energy powers a heat engine to energy. Because the system leverages well-understood concepts in a novel energy storage application, the companies said they are confident in safe and resilient operations, while hoping for an approach that eventually can become a viable commercial storage solution.
Malta said that its system can be configured to store up to 200 hours of energy; the study will focus on the energy industry’s current need for 10-12 hours of storage.
The Department of Energy announced the grant in March, and the team is currently identifying which of Duke Energy’s six coal plants in North Carolina is best suited to serve as the test site. Once a site is finalised and the study is complete, the team will deliver a list of findings, including an engineering conceptual study, a technology maturation plan, and a socioeconomic report on potential benefits.
