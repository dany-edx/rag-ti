The proposed solar pre-cooling concept, which the scientists developed in previous research, considers the thermal mass of buildings as a virtual battery that could be used to shift or shave peak demand caused by AC systems. It can be implemented in all kinds of buildings that have an AC unit and can be more beneficial if the surplus PV generation during the day is used to pre-cool the building instead of importing electricity from the grid. The AC unit is switched on before peak demand hours with lower thermostat setpoints to pre-cool a household’s thermal mass and indoor air.
“In our previous study, we only simulated pre-cooling,” the research’s lead author, Shayan Naderi, told pv magazine. “The novelty of our new work consists of using measured AC demand, PV generation, and household load profile, and clustering households based on their load shape. We also calculated the benefits of solar pre-cooling for different groups of households and building types.”
The analysis considered the feed-in tariffs (FITs) that are currently paid in Australia for residential rooftop PV generation, three different categories of residential building types dubbed 2-, 6-, and 8-star homes representing old, new, or renovated houses, respectively, and their net demand profiles. For each star rating, three different construction weights were simulated for Adelaide, Melbourne, Sidney, and Brisbane.
The analysis also considered maximum demand reduction, minimum demand mitigation, peak import reduction, self-consumption improvement, and cost savings. It was carried out with a dataset provided by monitoring and energy management services provider Sydney-based Solar Analytics which includes hourly data for net demand, AC demand, and PV generation of 349 households during the period from December 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019.
“The temporal pattern of PV generation and household demand are contributing factors to solar pre-cooling potential,” the researchers emphasised. “There is a significant difference between the overall magnitude of average hourly AC excluded net demand profiles across the houses.”
They identified four dominant clusters of AC excluded net demand profiles across the 349 households and said only one of the clusters, representing only 3% of the households, does not provide solar pre-cooling technical and economic potential.
“The other three clusters, representing 97% of the solar homes analysed, have a duck shaped AC excluded net demand and offer demand profile improvement through solar pre-cooling,” they said, noting that these results are achieved regardless of the building’s energy efficiency.
The improvement of ‘flattening’ demand profile is mainly due to minimum demand mitigation, with a maximum PV system capacity of 4 kW. The action of solar pre-cooling, meanwhile, was found to be mainly limited by AC size and surplus PV generation, and not by the thermal comfort of occupants.
The research’s findings were detailed in the paper “Clustering-based analysis of residential duck curve mitigation through solar pre-cooling: A case study of Australian housing stock,” published in Renewable Energy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/15/horizon-turns-on-solar-and-storage-solution-in-remote-wa/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Horizon turns on solar and storage solution in remote WA,"Western Australia regional energy provider Horizon Power has announced that the new centralised solar farm and battery energy storage system in the town of Sandstone, about 700 kilometres northeast of the state capital Perth, is now operational following the completion of reliability testing.
Horizon said the 163 kW ground-mounted solar facility and 759 kWh battery energy storage system will provide a sustainable and efficient alternative for the town that until now has relied entirely on diesel generators for its energy needs.
The new solar and battery system will integrate with the existing diesel-fuelled power plant which will be used to ensure supply.
“The excess electricity generated by the solar panels during the day can be stored in batteries for use during the night or on cloudy days, ensuring a consistent power supply even when the sun isn’t shining,” Horizon said. “The existing diesel system can then serve as a back-up.”
The Sandstone solar and storage project is part of Horizon’s Midwest Solar Program which entails the installation of centralised solar and battery storage systems in six regional WA towns.
Solar and battery solutions have already been delivered in the Midwest towns of Wiluna and Yalgoo while similar systems are due to be installed in Cue and Meekatharra later in 2023 and in Norseman in the Goldfields in early 2024.

Horizon Chief Executive Officer Stephanie Unwin said the solar and battery installations offer an effective alternative energy solution in remote locations, providing annual operating cost savings and carbon emissions reductions.
“Towns in remote parts of Western Australia are heavily reliant on diesel for energy generation, which have high operational costs and associated emissions,” she said.
Unwin said by generating and storing their own electricity, the towns will be able to significantly reduce diesel consumption. The overall program, supported with $13.5 million (USD 8.76 million) in federal government funding, is expected to save an estimated $900,000 per annum.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/15/adelaide-firm-commissions-molten-silicon-energy-storage-system/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Adelaide firm commissions molten silicon energy storage system,"Adelaide-based 1414 Degrees has completed the commissioning of a 1 MWh SiBox pilot unit that utilises the company’s proprietary molten silicon energy storage solution – known as a SiBrick – to store intermittent renewable energy to produce clean, high-temperature heat for industrial settings.
1414 said the SiBox is a complete thermal energy storage system comprising a heating element and the SiBricks that are contained within an insulated heat store, integrated with an energy recovery system. The heat is then available for use, providing a potential zero-carbon heat source for industries requiring temperatures above 800°C. This is a requirement of minerals processing and manufacturing industries – including the cement, alumina and iron and steel sectors.
The company said the commissioning phase of the demonstration unit had involved extensive trials that showed the SiBox storage system’s ability to convert electric energy into a controlled very hot air stream.
1414 said the unit had successfully undergone 32 cycles of phase change, operating at outlet temperatures ranging from 700°C to 850°C and delivering 6-12 hours continuous output at each set point.
“Data from these trials closely align with the expectations from the engineering design tools and models developed, providing confidence for scale-up designs of SiBox technology,” it said. “The 1 MWh of internal SiBricks performed robustly and were found in excellent condition on visual inspection.”

1414 said the demonstration unit is now operating autonomously and is ready for continuous cycling and discharge testing over the next 12 months to complete the validation phase.
“In the coming months our engineers will use the performance results from the demonstration module to design a commercial scale SiBox of up to 100 MWh,” the company said.
1414 Degrees Chairman Kevin Moriarty said the SiBox has been designed to be retrofitted into industry processes and offers a cost-efficient sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.
“Over the next 12 months, we anticipate that SiBox will emerge as an important emissions reduction solution for the industrial sectors that manufacture the infrastructure of our societies,” he said, adding that the company “well-positioned to make significant contributions to industries’ transition to clean energy.”
The development of the demonstration unit has been backed by oil and gas giant Woodside which contributed up to $2 million (USD 1.3 milion) for the project. As part of that deal, Woodside now has the opportunity to jointly develop and commercialise the SiBox technology.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/15/us-agency-says-microgrid-could-provide-model-for-png/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MICROGRID,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,PAPUA NEW GUINEA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 15, 2023",US agency says microgrid could provide model for PNG,"The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will partner with Singapore-based clean energy company WEnergy Global to install a renewable energy microgrid that it hopes will serve as a model for rural electrification in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
While no specifics about the size of the Central province microgrid have been provided, USAID Administrator Samantha Power, who announced the funding during a visit to PNG at the weekend, said the off-grid system will connect at least 800 households and 30 businesses to electricity, thereby improving clean energy access for at least 4,800 people in the region.
The launch of the Central province project comes after USAID earlier this year helped fund a microgrid featuring a 90 kW rooftop solar system at the Pimaga Rural Hospital in the Southern Highlands province.
Both microgrids are part of the USAID’s PNG Electrification Partnership, a five-year project launched in 2018 to spark investments from the private sector in off-grid areas and support the PNG government’s goal of connecting 70% of the population to electricity by 2030 and 100% electrification by 2050.
PNG has one of the Asia Pacific region’s lowest electrification rates, with only an estimated 13% of the population connected to the national power grid in 2020.
Challenging terrain, poor infrastructure, and a largely rural and remote population has made it difficult to pursue large-scale electrification via a national grid. But with the costs of renewable energy technologies decreasing in recent years, USAID said off-grid electrification presents a viable alternative to providing baseline electricity services.
“We know that expanding access to clean electricity is a key priority in PNG,” Power said, adding that the new microgrid is expected to “demonstrate the commercial viability of such projects and serve as a proof point for additional private sector investments.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/15/top-five-solar-inverter-vendors-accounted-for-71-of-shipments-in-2022/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Top five solar inverter vendors accounted for 71% of shipments in 2022,"The top 10 global solar inverter vendors accounted for 86% of market share in 2022, increasing by 4% year-on-year since 2021, according to a recent study by Wood Mackenzie.
The market grew 48% year-on-year, attributed to the ease in supply chain challenges, coupled by strong government support, as seen in the United States with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Wood Mackenzie noted that the top five vendors shipped more than 200 GW and accounted for 71% of total global PV inverter shipments in 2022, up 8% from 2021. The report notes that 2022 top vendor Huawei shipment increased 83%. Ginlong Solis posted growth of 86%.

For the eighth consecutive year, the top two vendors were Huawei and Sungrow. Huawei held the first position with a 29% market share in 2022. Sungrow, winner of the pv magazine award in 2021 and in the “highly recommended” category in 2022, increased its market share two percentage points, from 21% in 2021 to 23% in 2022. Ginlong Solis moved up to third place in 2022, driven by the company’s shipments in China.
The top eight vendors of 2021 were very similar to the lineup in 2022, with only Ginlong Solis and Growatt swapping third and fourth positions from 2021. Aiswei and Sofar jumped up three ranks to enter the top 10 ranking, holding the ninth and tenth positions respectively in 2022.
In the APAC region, China led the market with 78% of inverter shipments as solar experienced unprecedented growth. India retained its position as the second largest inverter market in APAC in 2022, but Wood Mackenzie estimates that it had a 25% decrease in shipments year-over-year. Japan had 7 GW of inverters enter the country, overtaking Australia as the third strongest market with growth of 23% year-over-year growth.
The European region experienced the highest shipment growth with an 82% increase in 2022, following its 44% year-over-year growth in 2021. Wood Mackenzie attributes this to the move toward carbon neutrality by 2050, as part of the European Green Deal plan. Europe accounted for 28% of the global market with 92 GW shipped.
While the U.S. market is beginning a strong growth trajectory, it accounted for only 13% of the global market with 42 GW shipped to the country. Solar-plus-storage hybrid inverters made up 10% of the regional shipments as the curtailment of net metering in some markets are leading to a strong energy storage market.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/15/novel-ai-based-tech-to-identify-rooftop-solar-systems-from-aerial-images/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"AUGUST 15, 2023",Novel AI-based tech to identify rooftop solar systems from aerial images,"Swedish scientists have created a new automated model that they claim offers “superior performance” in identifying small, decentralised solar systems from aerial images. Such an automated system is said to be a useful tool to assist many stakeholders in the PV industry, as it can supply policymakers, authorities, and financial evaluators with accurate data.
The novel method utilises deep learning and image processing techniques to detect solar thermal and photovoltaic systems, and according to its authors, a follow-up study might even enhance the model to differentiate between the PV and solar thermal technologies.
“This is a challenging task as the two technologies share similar texture and colour appearance,” the article explains. “However, we believe that with the right modifications and improvements, it can be effectively adapted for multi-class segmentation of solar energy systems.”
In the study “Identifying small decentralised solar systems in aerial images using deep learning,” published in Solar Energy, the academics explained that they used a U-net architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a convolutional network method for fast and precise segmentation of images, explaining that the key strength of this technique is that it requires a smaller number of input data and lower hardware usage compared to other approaches.
“The utilisation of the U-net model for solar energy systems detection provides a data-driven and automated solution with enhanced complexity, enabling precise detection,” they said. “Its accurate segmentation and identification of solar energy systems from aerial images hold substantial practical value, facilitating efficient assessment of panel performance, maintenance requirements, and energy production estimation.”
The new model was trained and tested on two databases – one from Germany and another one from Sweden – and a mixture of the two was used for higher generalization of its abilities. When compared to other CNN architectures, the researchers said the U-Net model stood out, especially in image segmentation tasks.
They also noted that the U-net model can be trained on aerial images with a resolution of 128 x 128 pixels, and achieve accuracy that is not significantly poorer than it does with a higher 256 x 256 pixel resolution. Its ability to use lower resolution, in turn, results in lower computer hardware usage.
“This study has proven that a U-net model can assess the area of solar energy systems in aerial imagery with high accuracy,” the authors said. “However, the tilt of the modules is also needed for a correct area estimation. Calculating the tilt can be done either from 3D building data or high/low-resolution LiDAR data. Combining the latter with the method of this study is the planned next step.”
