In the meantime, the Clean Investor Energy Group last week released its inaugural Clean Energy Investment Confidence Survey, which shows that Australia’s net-zero by 2050 commitment had not shifted the dial on a now long-term malaise in investor confidence in the Australian renewables landscape.
CEIG CEO Simon Corbell summarised results of the survey saying “Investor confidence remains stalled, with a deterioration in terms of the cost of equity and risk… Investors consider there remains a lack of sufficient scenario planning in the NEM [National Electricity Market] around coal closures and emissions targets.”
Scaysbrook said that Quinbrook, an investment manager that specialises in new asset creation — infrastructure and business development — as opposed to mergers and acquisitions, was never expecting anything to come out of COP26 that would heighten the investability of renewables in general.
But he says that other countries’ commitments made at COP26 — such as the UK going for zero coal within two years and for zero carbon in its power sector by 2025 — “stand in very stark contrast to what we’re going to see, at least with this current government, in near-term propulsion of new investment activity in the Australian market.”
Quinbrook has about 20% of its portfolio in Australia, including two 30 MW plants producing biogas from sugar cane waste in Byron Bay; a specialist green energy retailer called Energy Locals that provides businesses with the tools to set up their own energy plan and is also partnered with Tesla in the SA VPP; Energy Trade, one of Australia’s largest behind-the-meter, community energy network businesses; and APAC Green Data, a developer of data centre campuses — so far one in Queensland and another in New South Wales — which deliver low-cost 24/7 renewable power to help customers meet their carbon-reduction targets.
Its investments reflect Quinbrook’s identification of two strong themes: that Australia’s vast and growing number of distributed energy assets in the form of rooftop solar and battery energy storage create a compelling environment for the development of energy-management technologies; and that industry decarbonisation, where switching to renewably generated electricity is the first step towards company net-zero targets, is a “systemic driver of more interesting investment opportunities”.
But he describes the United States as “the most opportunity-rich market in the energy transition” with the UK running a very close second, whereas “Australia is really a bit of a non-event in terms of the scale and volume of investment opportunity, particularly for institutional investors”. 
Part of this assessment is due to the level of transition achieved in the US relative to its carbon-reduction ambitions. Scaysbrook describes the US as so far behind in decarbonising its power sector that the funding required to repower with renewables is “staggering”; as for the UK, an island that has chosen to totally eradicate coal-generated electricity by 2024— “that naturally creates new opportunity.”
In comparison, the CEIG survey identified that “Australia is not planning for a fast enough transition to clean energy”, which makes it “a risky destination for investors focused on net-zero outcomes”, says Corbell.
Both Quinbrook and CEIG acknowledge the leadership of Australian state governments in accelerating policies that support decarbonisation, but, says Scaysbrook, “You can’t ignore the Federal Government because the National Electricity Market is a confederation of interests, but the Federal Government has the constitutional power to regulate interstate power flow.”
He adds, “You can have as many renewable energy zones as you like, but if we’re all investing in an integrated and interconnected power market, the power has to go somewhere; f you flood or saturate that market with power, investors are going to lose a lot of money. We’ve already seen that in Australia and we’re going to see more of it.”
The CEIG survey reveals that among the organisation’s 18 members, which have combined operational portfolio of 11 GW of renewable energy across 70 power stations, only two new projects — wind farms with a total of 553 MW capacity — have achieved financial close in the first quarter (July-September) of the new financial year.
CEIG research released in August this year showed that the cost of equity for clean-energy investments in Australia is some 100-250 basis points higher than in other OECD countries, a difference it puts down to “climate and energy risks”.
Scaysbrook adds to this analysis, saying that for the first time in decades, the future value of electricity “is a great conundrum, because we are seeing not only policy change, but technology change, technology advancement, in circumstances where our power markets are poorly designed for the world we find ourselves in.”
He says that as a result the power market designs will change “in ways that are difficult to predict”.
Structuring of investments in long-term assets — across 25- to 30-year investment horizons — therefore becomes complicated, and perhaps “matters more than what you think the headline return is going to be”.
Opinion at Quinbrook is that in the coming Federal election the most effective combination of policies will be to introduce a well-structured emissions trading scheme — “Price drives capital in just about every other industry, and I think we need to put a price on carbon,” says Scaysbrook; and to boldly incentivise new green industries.
“We have this unique opportunity where we can create vertical supply chains in Australia … whether it’s for green steel, green aluminium, green hydrogen,” he says. The country’s abundance of cheap land, solar and wind resources “is an exportable value”.
Corbell says the two market reform priorities for the coming 12 months are still, “fixing grid access rules to remove arbitrary risks for generators wanting to connect”, and streamlining the building of new transmission infrastructure to enable clean energy to replace ageing coal-fired generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/15/when-evs-cant-get-a-purchase/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 15, 2021",When EVs can’t get a purchase …,"Australia’s latest electric vehicle policy makes me wince, especially when you consider some of the alternatives that came out of the COP26 conference.
Yes, Australia is installing chargers across the country. And yes, various state governments have also put in place some incentives for purchasing an EV. But Australia is one the few remaining developed countries without a cohesive national EV strategy. Instead, we’re left with tokenistic policy announcements timed to placate the international community. Although they acknowledge the issue of emissions-free transport, they won’t drive real change. 

Others countries, such as Japan, France, Germany, and the UK, have pledged to ban the purchase of petrol cars by 2030 — a policy proposal that has done the rounds in Australia since 2019, but never gained traction. They are also incentivising the purchase, manufacturing and importation of EVs.

Our laggardly approach is disappointing given we have a significant horse in this race — that is, Australia is globally one of the biggest users of cars per capita. We rank well above the UK, Japan and many other countries in this regard. Our only competitors are the US and a number of very small nations.

Moreover, according to the Grattan Institute, Australia can’t reach net zero emissions by 2050 unless we ban petrol and diesel cars by at least 2035. It’s that simple.

Australia has surged ahead on one point: How it will tax EVs when they are rolled out. That’s largely because EVs escape the fuel excises that governments have in place to pay for building and maintenance of the nation’s roads.
Other countries take the opposite position on taxing EVs: In the UK, for example, EVs currently are and will continue to be exempt from road taxes  — which are pegged to CO2 emissions. EV drivers in the UK are, however, subject to congestion taxes. This may change in the future as EV adoption becomes mainstream, but given that we should be minimising barriers to adoption, lowering the cost of owning and running an EV is key.

On the flip side, there has never been a greater demand for EVs. In the past few months, Carbar has doubled the total proportion of EVs in its fleet from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, in response to a dramatic shift in subscriber preference for EVs over petrol cars. By 2025, we anticipate that 1 in 3 requests for a car through our subscription service will be for an EV.

But, as every founder/would-be disruptor knows, it’s difficult to grow this new segment of our business while the policy surrounding the sector remains uncertain and is becoming increasingly political.

For instance, if other states follow Victoria’s lead and introduce a travel-based tax on EVs — charging for every kilometre travelled — it will add more complexity, admin and costs to an already complex industry. It will slow EV adoption, especially within subscription services.
The other pain point is that existing Federal Government support for EV adoption is myopic: it focuses on charging stations, but offers little in the way of incentivising availability of EVs in Australia. At a state level, grants are focused towards the purchase of an EV rather than alternative means of accessing them.

A study by Boston Consulting Group found that by 2030, up to 15 per cent of US total new car sales will be through subscription. Evidence is also emerging that subscription services will play a key role in the broader adoption of EVs, allowing consumers access to an EV without needing the upfront capital to pay for one outright.

We can turn a corner here if our Federal Government simply takes charge of this discussion and sets the agenda.

COP26, the nemesis of the Australian coalition government is over and all 197 participating nations have pledged to “phase down” rather than “phase out” coal, the number-one cause of climate change.
This morning, government backbencher Matt Canavan chose to interpret the softening of language around the global coal commitment as “a big green light” for Australia “to build more coal mines, supply the world with more coal, because that is what brings millions of people out of poverty”.
Commenting yesterday afternoon on the Australian Science Media Centre website, AusSMC, Professor John Quiggin, Australian Laureate Fellow in Economics at the University of Queensland interpreted the revised coal terminology in a broader context when he said, “The compromises made to reach a final text have been disappointing, but relatively minor. For example, while “phasing down” coal is less satisfactory than “phasing out”, either contrasts sharply with the view of the Australian government (at least until recently) that coal demand will remain strong indefinitely into the future.”
In a statement from the Australian Conservation Foundation today, the organisation’s Climate Program Manager, Gavan McFadzean said that the gap in climate policies and commitment  between “Australia and some of its closest allies and trading partners – like the US, UK and the EU – has widened and it will result in dire consequences for our climate, economy and jobs.”
Speaking on ABC Radio National this morning McFadzean contextualised the overall achievement of COP26 in the light of recognition and mitigations achieved since the Paris agreement of COP21: “People need to remember that before Paris, we were heading to five or six degrees of global warming; between Paris and now we were heading for three to four degrees, and now, this agreement brings us within two degrees, so there’s no doubt that significant progress is being made to get emissions down.”
Outcomes of the summit continue to elicit a variety of responses from experts and commentators in Australia. The following is a selection from the Australian Science Media Centre’s stream of informed opinion:
“It’s extremely disappointing to see COP26 end like this — coal has to be abandoned for us to secure a safe climate future. Simply phasing down rather than eliminating our reliance on coal is fundamentally at odds with a commitment to net zero by 2050. Net zero cannot be achieved without urgent action to leave the world’s reserves of fossil fuels in the ground.”
“Side agreements have been much more impactful: 23 countries increased their emissions targets and agreements were announced to phase out coal in rich countries by 2040, end deforestation by 2030 and reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. 
Even more importantly the finance sector is driving change across whole economies and the companies that operate within them. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero (GFANZ), 450 financial firms with $130 trillion of assets under management, committed to net zero for both their operations, and their lending and investing. This will impact the financing practices of every bank and lender globally.”
“All countries can now transition to a 100 per cent renewable grid by at least 2035, so the discussion around coal and the last minute softening of the language requested by India seems quite pointless and unnecessary. The hard to abate sectors are all outside electricity and light transport now, with electric vehicles showing a rapid pathway to total decarbonisation of about 50 per cent of global energy use as early as 2035. Hence many of the obstacles seem to now be more political rather than economic.”
“With the emissions projections released on Friday leaving lingering questions on how we transition from rhetoric to action, the Government need look no further than existing mature technologies ready for widespread deployment.
It’s time for a credible and robust plan which maximises Australia’s global leadership position in low-carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage (batteries and pumped hydro), combined with electrification of transport and sustainably designed buildings.”
“From a human rights perspective the COP agreement is a failure. 1.5 is the only target that keeps the world safe, including our Pacific neighbours and most of northern Australia. This is not a “near enough is good enough” kind of deal.
The Article 6 carbon market provisions failed to incorporate human rights standards. The fossil fuel provisions have too many carve outs. 
This was the moment to accept a “loss and damage” mechanism for rich countries to compensate poor countries and accept the injustice of emission impacts but that chance was lost. 
We need to kick fossil fuel lobbyists out of the next COP in Cairo. 
Australians need to vote climate. We need to understand what is in the balance here for our own increasingly short-term futures: Livable summers, insurable homes, water security, healthy cities, preparedness for weather events. Not to mention the ability to look your grandchildren in the eyes.

It is currently manufacturing and deploying some 50 customised SAPS in regional and remote WA, but in the new year it expects to jump the deserts of central Australia, cross the boundary into New South Wales and take that state’s strung out customers at the edges of the state’s grid by storm — dazzling them with the power of its reliable power supplies. 
Reliability is the stand-out quality of the Boundary Power range of systems company Director Rod Henderson tells pv magazine Australia.
In October, Ampcontrol won the 2021 Hunter Manufacturing Award for Excellence in Product Design for Boundary Power’s Solar Cube, an integrated, foldout, solar-battery-generator combination that can be installed and providing electricity within 90 minutes of hitting the ground.
The clever Cube also took out the prestigious 2021 Australian Good Design Award for the Engineering Design of its Solar Cube. And Boundary Power shone at the WA Energy Awards, winning the Energy Innovation of the Year for its entire range — Nano SAPS, Solar Cube, R-series SAPS and Kiosk SAPS — of standalone solutions.
All that celebrated innovation and excellence is channeled into reliability and safety of systems that must provide utility-standard energy supply to homes, businesses and communities at the edges or beyond the reach of Australia’s stretched grids.
As Henderson points out, if rooftop solar in the suburbs stops working for some reason, those properties are connected to the grid, “but in the case of our standalone power supplies, they’re the only energy source those consumers have, so the right technology, the right components, the right partnerships are all-important aspects of our designs”.
He also cites Horizon Power’s flexibility, as a government trading entity, to enter into a partnership with a private company as one of the true innovations behind Boundary Power: “You know that’s innovative thinking led by Stephanie Unwin. It makes a big difference when you’re working with people who are really on the front foot,” he says of the unique arrangement.
In 2018, when Ampcontrol was in the process of acquiring CPS National, a company providing SAPS to telcos, utilities, resources companies and the rail sector in remote areas of Australia, Horizon Power was seeking to address the risks, cost and reliability of providing energy to its most far-flung customers.
After the fires in WA in 2015, ageing electricity infrastructure was identified as one potential spark for disaster, the cost of providing and maintaining new infrastructure at remote homesteads and agribusinesses was prohibitive, so Horizon Power investigated the viability of a renewables-led solution and found it promising. 
It approached Ampcontrol, with its new CPS subsidiary, to tender for the supply of the first 17 proposed Horizon Power SAPS, but quickly decided that a separate venture combining Ampcontrol engineering expertise with Horizon Power’s energy-utility expertise and customer understanding could have a great future in the transitioning Australian energy scene.
“We sat down with Horizon engineers and analysed many of their customers’ needs, we looked at their electrical loads,” says Henderson, who is also CEO and Managing Director of Ampcontrol,  in order to come up with the range of capacities now in Boundary’s product offering.
They include the small-load generation supplied by Nano SAPS to power water pumps, electric fences and small dwellings, up to the modular extendability of Kiosk SAPS that deliver up to 120 kW of three-phase power from a 239.4kWp – 319.2kWp solar array and up to 310 kWh of battery storage.
Boundary Power
The initial 17 SAPS delivered to regional Western Australia proved a hit with recipients: some farmers celebrated not having to plough and harvest around electricity poles; other remote customers were enabled by the improvement in electricity supply from their new hybrid solar-battery-generator system.
“The the single-wire earth return, or the SWER system, that a lot of these customers were previously on was developed in the middle of last century,” says Henderson, “and the electrical loads that customers have now are obviously very different to what they were 60 or 70 years ago, so the system had not been meeting their needs.”
To now have the reliability of a generation source that can run chillers or a three-phase welder, and air-conditioning, as well as power electronics for charging phones and running TVs, was a revelation to many.
Reliability of power supply, Henderson feels, will open opportunities for new enterprises in the regions, and the SAPS, maintained by Horizon Power, and charged out at a kilowatts-consumed rate the same as if they were being served from the grid, are scalable to provide for growing businesses; businesses which are now primarily powered by renewables.
Boundary Power
In 2019, Horizon Power estimated that a diesel generator working in tandem with suitably sized solar and battery, and programmed to kick in when renewable energy sources are exhausted, would operate for fewer than 500 hours a year, delivering a carbon reduction on gas-generated energy from the grid.
Since then the government-owned utility has set a 2025 cut-off date for the addition of any new diesel generation to power its customers, and Boundary Power is investigating alternative backup generation, including a number of green-hydrogen-fuelled technologies.
In July, Boundary Power announced a new strategic partnership with hydrogen technology company LAVO and Ampcontrol, which it said would develop power solutions for remote energy users, data centres, and energy-intensive industries.
Alan Yu, LAVO’s Chief Executive Officer, said at the time, “LAVO’s hydrogen storage technology is ideally suited for integration with remote standalone power systems and for other containerised and mobile power solutions.”
As Boundary Power now rolls out a further 45-50 SAPS in the Esperance and Kimberley regions as part of the Western Australian Government’s $5 billion WA Recovery Plan, it has its eye on efforts in Australia’s eastern states to change utility regulations to allow electricity retailers there to also meet customer needs with SAPS where appropriate.
“It’s just getting through the legislation process, and New South Wales is very close — if we don’t see that before the end of this calendar year we’ll see it very early in the new year,” says Henderson, “and it’s on the drawing boards for Victoria, Queensland and South Australia to come online over the next few years as well.”
In a 2020 report by the Australian Energy Market Commission — Updating the regulatory frameworks for distributor-led standalone power systems — Essential Energy in NSW said it had identified some 2,000 customers for whom SAPS could represent the lowest-cost to serve; and AusNet Services in Victoria said it may be economic to deploy SAPS solutions for between 300 and 400 of its customers in bushfire-prone areas.
Boundary Power will likely target export markets sometime after successful SAPS deployments on the east coast of Australia, with Ampcontrol’s network of sales offices and agents ready to assist the deployment of these Australian standalone, low-carbon energy solutions into Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim.
Boundary Power
“I think we have a very competitive, well placed product in that space,” says Henderson, who adds, “For Fiji and other Pacific nations that are prone to cyclones and the like, we have a high-quality, well-engineered, reliable, tested and certified product.”
At the same time, Ampcontrol subsidiary CPS National is working to solve the ongoing challenge of providing remote communities with clean water. The company has developed and installed its first two systems — one near Alice Springs and the other in the East Pilbara — that integrate water treatment with reliable, renewably powered SAPS.
“There are up to 300 communities in the Northern Territory alone that don’t have access to clean drinking water,” Henderson says, and CPS National “has a cost effective solution. We need governments to get behind it to make sure that they’re giving all our citizens access to what is a basic human need”.
Henderson has taken but a brief moment to bask in the sunny glow of Boundary Power’s awards bonanza. He says, “We have fantastic engineers on both sides of the Boundary Power equation, and the awards are due credit for those teams who have worked so hard to get these terrific outcomes.”

Researchers at Engie Laborelec, a unit of French energy giant Engie, have developed a new way to determine the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) generated by alkaline electrolysers powered by offgrid, utility-scale solar power plants.
“The study is exclusively based on off-grid electrolysers as this is a use-case that we have experienced,” researcher Jonathan Lehmann told pv magazine. “In a grid-constrained environment, due to the cheap cost of PV electricity, powering up a 50 MW electrolyser with a 100 MW off-grid PV plant coupled to a battery might be cheaper than investing in a grid connection upgrade to purchasing electricity from the grid.”
The current LCOH produced from fossil fuels ranges between $1.34 and $2.4 per kg, depending on the technology and location. Solar-powered hydrogen may already compete with blue hydrogen in certain locations, according to the researchers – particularly in Australia, where an LCOH of $2.36 per kg is already considered achievable.
The researchers studied the LCOH impact of the data used to simulate the PV production. When designing a photovoltaic plant coupled to an electrolyser, the consideration of irradiance or hourly typical meteorological year (TMY) measurements does not accurately represent the dynamic behaviour of the plant. This can cause an underestimation of the power produced by the solar plant and, as a consequence, an overestimation of the LCOH.
Their analysis was conducted on a seven-month set of historical data from a 36 MW photovoltaic plant located in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Norte state. The LCOH was calculated using power production simulated by two different methods, both based on irradiance measurement.
One of the two methods is the system adviser model (SAM) developed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This modelling software combines time-series weather data and system specifications to assess the electricity production of a renewable energy system.
The second method, described as a transfer function method, was developed by the Engie research group on a model conceived by researchers at the Universidad Pública de Navarra in Spain to assess PV plant variability. It purportedly can precisely simulate the output power of a PV facility from incident irradiance measurement by considering the plant itself as a low-pass filter in the frequency domain.
Indeed, short-term fluctuations of power production are caused by cloud passage. Because of the large spatial distribution of solar panels on a utility-scale PV plant, the impact of cloud passage on the power output is significantly lower than the impact of cloud passage on the irradiance measured by a single sensor. As a consequence, the power produced by a solar plant can be simulated from irradiance measurement by using a low-pass ﬁlter transfer function.
The researchers calculated the LCOH for alkaline electrolyser capacities from 0.1 to 1 times the DC capacity of the solar park. They assumed the inverters of the PV facility would be linked to the grid and that the grid connection would not be sufficient to power the electrolyser without additional onsite power generation. The cost of the PV plant was assumed to be €600 per kilowatt installed.
The SAM method underestimates the capacity factor of a project and as a result, it overestimates LCOH. The transfer function method, by contrast, more effectively determines the low pass filter nature of the solar plant and was closer to the values provided by the analysis conducted on historical power production.
“It was demonstrated that, with the hypothesis considered, the lowest LCOH were obtained for electrolyser sizes between 0.6 and 0.8 times the size of the PV plant,” Lehman explained. “On average, a LCOH 4.2% higher was obtained when using the transfer function method as compared to the historical power production whereas a LCOH 7.3% higher was calculated with SAM.”
The researchers noted that several aspects of the LCOH calculation, such as the price of the battery, were not included. This is because the study mainly focused on the power produced by the PV plant. They will soon conduct follow-up research. They described the novel methodology in “Levelized Cost of Hydrogen Calculation from Off-Grid Photovoltaic Plants Using Different Methods,” which was recently published in RRL Solar.

With electric vehicle (EV) sales rising rapidly, U.S.-based business intelligence group Bloomberg has said the world’s roads hosted 8.5 million truly zero-emission vehicles by the end of June.
In a report published at the request of the U.K. government, as it hosts the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, Bloomberg New Energy Finance included a graphic which showed central business district the City of London, and Bergen, in Norway, lead the way in commitments to phase out the sale of fossil-fuelled vehicles.
Both cities, according to BloombergNEF, have committed to halt new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales by 2025. The Zero-emission Vehicles Factbook indicates the Norwegian government has also committed to halt new ICE sales by that date but the graphic has the capital, Oslo, with a 2030 cut-off date.
A press release issued by BloombergNEF yesterday to publicise the report stated carmakers which account for 32% of global sales have committed to 100% zero-emission new vehicles by 2035. That is the final cut-off date to ban the sales of ICE vehicles if the world is to reach zero-emission road transport by mid century, according to Aleksandra O’Donovan, lead author of the report.
If that estimate is correct, the coalition of governments and auto manufacturers at COP26 which was set to commit to 100% zero-emission new cars, vans and HGVs by 2040, has not set an ambitious enough target.
Similarly, while BloombergNEF lauded the many municipal, state-level and national targets for eliminating the sale of new ICE vehicles, the 2040 date set by the Canadian province of British Columbia, and by France, Spain, Hong Kong, and Singapore, needs to come in by at least five years, even though the cities of Paris and Barcelona have set a more ambitious, 2030 deadline. Hawaii will also miss the cut for zero-emission roads in 2050 as it is committed to ending new ICE sales in 2045 and, with that cut-off date not even arriving until mid-century in Costa Rica; in the U.S. state-level authorities of Connecticut, Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont; and in the Texan city of San Antonio, more work clearly needs to be done.
The U.S. state-level commitments account for a quarter of sales in the country, according to BloombergNEF and, when national goals and zero-emission vehicle sales targets are thrown in, the analyst estimated 41% of sales across China, India and the U.S. are committed to be zero-emission units.
The report states improving battery technology and falling costs, faster charging point roll-out, a wider choice of car models, and longer ranges plus faster charging have amped up EV sales this year.
When fuel cell vehicles and part-fossil-fuel plug-in hybrids are included in the numbers, BloombergNEF said, sales will be expected to hit 5.6 million this year, to a cumulative 13 million such autos on the world’s roads.
Perhaps even more impressively, the analyst has predicted 18% of the world’s municipal buses will be zero-emission vehicles by the end of the year.
The rising popularity of such vehicles has prompted BloombergNEF to raise its 2040 estimate of the extent of the world zero-emission vehicle fleet, from 495 million to 677 million. The analyst noted the International Energy Agency and OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) have also raised their expectations, for 2030 and 2040, respectively.
