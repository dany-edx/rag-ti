After working on the technology for the last three years, co-founder and CEO Jekaterina Viktorova tells pv magazine Australia the startup will shortly be seeking feedback on its initial printer, which can be used to build electronic prototypes.
“We call it a printer for electronics but really its a multi-material additive manufacturing technology. You can literally make anything you want,” says Ben Wilkinson, Syenta’s head of research and development.
Syenta prints with electrochemistry, using a purely additive method. “We basically use electricity to deposit patterns of material,” Wilkinson explains. 
Syenta prints with electrochemistry, using a purely additive method. This approach holds potential to reshape manufacturing costs due to simplicity, but also because the printer uses what are essentially precursor materials. That is, if someone wants to print with copper, the “ink” would actually be a copper ink. “Our method turns the raw material into copper as we’re printing it,” Wilkinson says.
“The other really exciting thing is that our process can work in reverse. So we [can]  turn the [for instance] copper back into copper salt, and that just becomes new ink that we can reuse,” he adds. “It’s getting much closer to how biology does it – where every resource can be reused again and it’s fully circular.”
For CEO Viktorova that’s the beauty of electrochemistry, “It’s reversible and it’s highly efficient compared to other methods.”

The approach strips away many of the process layers associated with traditional manufacturing, thereby reducing the amount of both energy and materials that go into producing electronics. It also liberates technologies from their supply chains, which in the renewables industry is looking increasingly valuable.
The other side of the proposition is what the additive manufacturing can offer to industries like photovoltaics, PCB, antennae, sensor and others. “For instance, we can make much more sophisticated designs faster and have complex geometries which improve performance of solar cells as well as reducing cost,” Wilkinson says.
“The geometry of those two technologies [solar and batteries] very strongly determines the performance. So how far physically do ions in batteries have to move to charge or discharge? Or, in solar cells, what is the resistance of electrons moving through the solar cell? If we can make that really, really small, on a nanoscale, we can dramatically reduce that resistance or time to charge.”
Potential applications aside, Syenta’s current printer – which is focused on enabling its customers to build technology prototypes – fits on a desk. “The next step is actually releasing the product,” Viktorova says. “We’re actually actively looking for people who are willing to prototype using our tech and have this inform our future full product building activity, which will be the product that ends up on our website and shipping worldwide.”
Eventually, the company’s ambition is to target large-scale electronics manufacturing. “We think we can do better at a lot of existing manufacturing steps for electronics,” Wilkinson says.
“The potential of our technology is really high in terms of how fast it can go but at the moment the way we do it is quite slow,” he adds. “It’s focussed on prototyping but we think we can do large scale manufacturing and the process is really suited to that but there’s just a lot of engineering that has to happen to build out that capability.”
To date, the vision of scalable additive manufacturing from 3D printing remains unfulfilled.
The core of Syenta’s tech started with a late night email between Viktorova and her then PhD supervisor – now co-founder – Professor Luke Connal. The next day in the ANU lab, Viktorova started to experiment.
While several academics had tried a similar approach before, Viktorova says no one had done it in quite the same way and, perhaps more importantly, her PhD meant she could dedicate years to refining and testing to get it right.
“The timing and combination of skills was just right for us to get it to the next commercialisation step,” she adds.
Syenta, which recently changed its name from Spark3D, is now separate from ANU, though close collaboration with the university and the research continues.
To explain how the startup’s approach works, Wilkinson points to the chrome hubcaps donned by fancy cars. That plating, he says, is a form of electrodeposition. “What we do differently is we don’t have to use chrome, we can use lots of different materials and also we print in a very small area. We can do complex patterns with this kind of plating of material.”
In terms of the “additive” component, this refers to an approach of only adding materials. This is different from most manufacturing processes, which both add and subtract materials.
“I think that’s a unique value proposition in itself,” Viktorova says, referring to the additive approach. “You don’t have as much literal waste.”
Syenta’s current printer prints with metals, alloys, conductive and insulating polymers and semiconductors.
The printer can do a single layer printed circuit “in minutes,” Viktorova says, “as opposed to other developed technologies spending hours doing that.” 
Wilkinson points to silicon solar cells and microchips as interesting ways to think through Syenta’s approach. Silicon microchips require high resolution, as in highly complex patterns on a small space, whereas silicon solar cells require far less detailing, making them “low res,” but are manufactured across far larger areas.
“The potential of our technology is to be able to do both of those things at same time – so have the nanoscale, resolution complexity at the speed and area of solar cells,” Wilkinson says.
Viktrova adds that the technology has “quite an interesting relationship between precision of fabrication and speed – it’s quite linear, which is a very unique thing to have. That’s why we believe there is a unique scalability even in our prototyping product that is intrinsic to the technology itself.”
Viktorova describes solar as a particularly interesting market for Syenta thanks to the similarity of set up; “They just use different technology [to manufacture] – usually additive in combination with subtractive. So we’re very keen to save this extra step for someone.”
Beyond solar, the 3D printer has a huge range of other manufacturing applications. “A lot of the designs that people currently make devices in are limited by the constraints of the current manufacturing landscape, or even prototyping landscape,” Viktorova says.
“Imagine you unleash that creativity and allow people to make something they could not make before because they did not have access to the right tool.”
Making more stuff generally translates to more pollution. But Wilkinson says using the emissions scope equation, the Scope 1 emissions from the printer are nothing – at ANU at least the printer runs on renewable electricity. 
In terms of Scope 2, the printer’s additive approach means no more materials are used than absolutely necessary. What is deposited is deposited well and fast and in a way that makes it recyclable, meaning each finished, printed product has the least embodied energy it can for its output, he says.
As for Scope 3, Wilkinson notes the technology gives people the ability to make better, cheaper devices that can increase the uptake of renewable technology, whether it be batteries, solar, smart devices or ways to connect to the Internet of Things (IoT). “If that’s really cheap, more people adopt it,” Wilkinson says.
The reversibility component of the technology is particularly important for the startup. “We’re building towards being able to recycle whatever we print in the same product in the same system,” Viktorova says.
In this year’s round of the global Climate Launchpad program, Syenta (then Spark3D) made the global semi-finals – the furthest any Australian startup has progressed. Its success in the competition secured Syenta a spot in the ClimateLaunchpad accelerator program, aimed at helping startups successfully commercialise into businesses. 
Syenta will participate in the program in 2023.
In terms of big picture vision, the Syenta team thinks their technology holds much promise for large-scale electronics manufacturing, with Wilkinson saying he believes the “bulk” of electronics manufacturing could be done better using its method.
Europe has a rich printed electronics manufacturing ecosystem, Viktorova says, and this is is something Syenta is hoping to delve into and learn from in the near term.
“We would like to make a product that sits in existing supply chains, or existing production lines that would be faster and cheaper and has this resolution patterning benefit,” Wilkinson says. “I’m sure it will happen, but it just takes time and effort to get that done.”
It will also require a fair amount of resources and financing, something not lost on the team. Building on the recent seed capital raising, Viktorova says the company will look to fundraise for the next commercialisation stages in the coming years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/21/hydrogen-dominates-australias-energy-value-future-while-earnings-from-critical-minerals-rocket-resources-report-finds/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 21, 2022","Hydrogen dominates Australia’s energy value future as earnings from critical minerals surge, resources report finds","The Australian federal government has released two major reports on Australia’s energy and resources sector, forecasting exports will earn a record $459 billion (USD 307 billion) in 2022–23. 
While a large portion of this value comes from the surging price of fossil fuels, the reports have, since 2021, begun to cover new energy industries like critical minerals used in batteries and renewable technologies, as well as hydrogen projects which dominate the development pipeline.

There appears to be vast differences in footings of these growing “new energy” categories. The forecast earnings from critical minerals pipelines have much lower dollar values compared to hydrogen, where the value of projects in the investment pipeline range to $705 billion. But the government points out just one hydrogen project has made it into the “committed” stage so far, with the majority falling off the radar following the feasibility stage.
Demand for key battery materials is driving interest and investment in mine capacity and processing facilities in Australia, with the Resources and Energy Quarterly report, published by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, forecasting export earnings from critical minerals like lithium, graphite, copper, nickel will reach almost $33 billion in 2022–23, compared with $22 billion in 2021–22, a 50% increase.

The Resources and Energy Major Projects 2022 report from the Office of the Chief Economist in conjunction with the Commonwealth department, is even more optimistic, forecasting estimated value from new energy metals and minerals could reach $42 billion in 2022-23, which would amount to almost doubling value in one year.
Of the critical minerals, lithium understandably leads the pack with its export earnings forecast to increase more than ten-fold in two years, from $1.1 billion in 2020–21 to $16 billion in 2022–23 and $17 billion in 2023–24. This would make lithium Australia’s sixth largest “resources and energy” export commodity.
Such export chains are already well established in Australia, but there is also major growth in more emerging minerals like vanadium.
While Australia’s critical minerals list currently comprises 26 minerals or mineral groups, investment in major critical minerals projects is driven by five key commodities — lithium, cobalt, rare earths, heavy mineral sands and vanadium. Combined, these minerals accounted for over 80% of total investment, the report noted.

In total, Australia’s critical minerals major project pipeline sits at 81 projects, with around a quarter at the earliest “publicly announced” stage. Those are worth between $6.5 billion and $11.6 billion.
Projects at the feasibility stage account for more than half of all critical minerals’ projects — worth $16.3 billion to $22.9 billion. A total of 13 projects were at the committed stage ($6.7 billion), and 3 projects with a capital value of $800 million were completed during the year, according to the report.
Interestingly, the report notes an increasing diversity in the products these projects are developing, ranging from mineral concentrates to vanadium electrolyte for rechargeable vanadium redox flow batteries, instead of simply raw material export – though this form still dominates.

Hydrogen projects accounted for an estimated $266 billion worth of potential investment, according to the Resources report, lifting the estimated total value of projects in the investment pipeline to a range of $572 billion to $705 billion.

“Hydrogen projects make up the largest single component by value in this year’s report,” said its authors. “They have almost doubled from an estimated range of $133–185 billion in 2021 to $230–303 billion in 2022 — corresponding to some 48 projects, or 32 more than in the previous year. This does not include three regional ‘hubs’ with a combined estimated worth of nearly $1 billion, which have been classified as hydrogen-related infrastructure.”
Of the projects behind this lift, the major drivers are two Western Australian megaprojects worth $150 billion. Those are the Australian Renewable Energy Hub (which until recently was called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub) and the Western Green Energy Hub.

While the potential investment from hydrogen is staggering, the government also notes the industry has “high uncertainty for individual projects.” Only three out of 16 projects included in last year’s report progressed beyond the feasibility stage — of which one was a pilot program.
The availability of (public) seed funding has allowed many early feasibility studies to be conducted, the report says, but these have largely found that significant government support is still required for low-carbon hydrogen projects to be commercially viable.
“Hydrogen is a new field and, while progress can be expected for the industry as a whole, the landscape of projects is expected to change rapidly … These circumstances are not unusual in the resources sector, especially in a field where dominant technologies are not yet established,” the Resources and Energy Major Projects report adds.
The report also points out there has been “little follow up” on fossil fuel-based hydrogen generation, often named blue or grey hydrogen, following the shipment of blue hydrogen from Victoria to Japan as part of the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain pilot.
“Wind and solar are expected to power over 95% of projects in the pipeline,” it says. “Apart from one project — which utilises waste or biomass — all the renewable energy projects rely on electrolysis.”
While the push for blue hydrogen has cooled, the focus of most projects remains on the export market, with the majority seeking to capitalise on Australia’s availability of land and isolation. “However, the best option for transporting hydrogen is currently unclear — particularly over long distances — both from an economic and a technological perspective,” the report says.
In terms of the form these hydrogen projects will take, the majority are aiming to produce either hydrogen (63%) or ammonia (27%). Methanol, while mentioned, remains fairly ignored.

FRV Australia selected Gransolar to carry out the construction of the project in a joint venture with CHINT Solar.
Walla Walla Solar Farm represents the fifth solar farm developed by FRV Australia in NSW and the 10th solar farm in Australia. The company’s portfolio now sits at a total power capacity of more than 1 GW.

Funding for the project is being provided by bank ING, the government-backed Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Export Development Canada in the form of a green loan. The company said instrumental to securing the loan was the 15-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed with Microsoft. Once operational Walla Walla will provide renewable energy to Microsoft’s data centres in Australia.
FRV Australia also noted the project is located in a “strong and strategic part” of Australia’s notoriously tricky grid, seemingly addressing potential concerns about connection delays, and adding it had signed the connection agreements with Transgrid’s Lumea.
The company has also recently secured funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency for its 250 MW / 500 MWh Gnarwarre battery project in southern Victoria, which will deploy grid forming inverters.
Earlier this year, FRV Australia was also awarded funding from the Victorian government to support its 100 MW / 200 MWh Terang battery project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/21/lowering-grid-costs-with-voltage-support-from-pv-inverters-at-night/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INVERTERS,RESEARCH,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 21, 2022",Lowering grid costs with voltage support from PV inverters at night,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University in the United States have proposed the use of PV inverters instead of expensive voltage compensators to provide voltage support at night. They said this will reduce costs for grid operators and remove a barrier to integrating renewable energy in loosely connected power networks.
The use of PV inverters instead of compensators might provide additional sources of revenue for PV plant owners, although the supply of voltage support from a utility-scale PV plant would require the addition of an augmented voltage controller to the facility, which would also have to be replaced within the lifetime of an asset.
“There is a good case to be made that PV plant operators should be paid for providing voltage support at night,” researcher Jay Apt told pv magazine. “Without additional compensation, it would not be a good business decision for  PV plant operators to take on the additional costs.”
He said local ancillary services for reactive power could be created, with generators bidding on reactive power capability on an hourly basis – much like regulation ancillary services. An ancillary service would thus create an efficient market for reactive power prices and provide the revenue needed for PV plant operators to recoup their costs.
“With adequate incentives, PV plant operators can add a revenue stream by providing reactive power support at night,” said researcher Yamit Lavi. “PV plant operators already accept approximately a one-year lifetime reduction of their inverters for currently-mandatory reactive power requirements. Providing reactive power at night will reduce their lifetime by only one additional year and increase benefits to the grid, potentially furthering the adoption of PV.”
Voltage compensators are commonly known as static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) or flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS). They cost between USD 30 million and USD 100 million ($45 – $150 million), depending on the size and location. PV inverters are also expensive assets, but they remain unused for about 50% of their lifetimes and the usual voltage support such devices provide during the day is not available at night.
“PV providing reactive power at night has been successfully field-tested in East Sussex UK by National Grid and Lightsource BP argue that using a group of PV inverters for voltage support is about 50 times less costly than installing a FACTS device,” the researchers explained, noting that their work involves quantifying the cost of reactive power from a solar PV power plant. “We make the first comparison of the total cost of utilising a PV inverter as a substitute for a STATCOM to that of a STATCOM, including wear and tear on the inverter and necessary equipment.”
The academics used a model developed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to determine whether PV inverters can prevent night-time voltage excursions. They also compared costs based on a discounted cash flow model.
They found that PV inverters have an average cost of USD 20.20 per kilovolt-amperes reactive (kVAR), which they said is between USD 56/kVAR and USD 269/kVAR less expensive than STATCOMs.
“This difference has a large range due to the large range in STATCOM costs, which are due the STATCOM size, environmental conditions of the location, and the equipment necessary for installation and interconnection,” they said.
The researchers presented their findings in “Using PV inverters for voltage support at night can lower grid costs,” which was recently published in Energy Reports.
“Our analysis showed that operating PV inverters at night is 4 to 14 times less costly,” the scientists concluded. “The cost difference is due to a shorter lifespan of PV inverters as well as a more detailed discounted cash flow model that accounts for controller replacements.”

EODev has launched packaged hydrogen generators in the 10 kVA to 1,750 kVA range, with the first models to enter production in 2024. The French developer told pv magazine that they will be available to order from the first half of 2023, with first deliveries from the third or fourth quarter of 2024. It is developing plug-and-play solutions for the telecoms industry, airports, hospitals, water treatment plants, and data centres. Other generators will target sea applications, especially for energy-intensive vessels. EODev said it is helping customers to source hydrogen and is signing contracts with hydrogen suppliers throughout the world to “guarantee the availability and price of hydrogen” for its customers, with a focus on North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.
Gascade, Ontras, and terranets have agreed to create Flow, a hydrogen pipeline system connecting five European countries from the Baltic Sea to southwestern Germany. “The project partners will convert existing gas pipelines,” the companies said. “At a length of more than 1,100 km and a feed-in capacity of up to 20 GW (depending on the pressure level), the pipeline system will already be large in dimension at the start – and will be expanded going forward.” They plan to convert the first hydrogen pipelines in Germany from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to Thuringia by 2025, followed by a line from Hesse to Rhineland-Palatinate in 2028, which Gascade said will make it possible to transport hydrogen to Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria from 2030.
Nikola has agreed to sell up to 75 Nikola Tre fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) to Plug Power over the next three years, with the first trucks being delivered in 2023, under a new strategic partnership. Plug will pair the FCEVs with its liquid hydrogen tankers and will provide integrated liquefaction systems for Nikola’s recently announced hydrogen hub project. The companies have also signed a supply deal for 125 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. In addition, Nikola said it will work with E.ON to develop integrated mobility solutions, from the supply of green hydrogen and demand-based fuelling station infrastructure to the provision of hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks, with a focus on the city of Essen, Germany. 
The Port of Rotterdam is leading 18 companies in a study into the potential establishment of a large-scale ammonia cracker in the port area to convert imported ammonia back into 1 million tonnes of hydrogen per year targeting North-West Europe. The initiative includes Air Liquide, Aramco, bp, Essent/ E.ON, ExxonMobil, Gasunie, GES, HES international, Koole Terminals, Linde, OCI, RWE, Shell, Sasol, Uniper, Vopak, VTTI.
IHI Corp. has signed a memorandum of understanding with Gentari Hydrogen, a subsidiary of Petronas, to evaluate the feasibility of using the abundant solar resources of Malaysia to produce and sell green ammonia derived from renewables.
