Yallourn is Australia’s dirtiest power plant and its retirement will cut 60% of EnergyAustralia’s carbon dioxide emissions in one fell swoop. Originally scheduled to close in 2032, the power station will now be retired by mid-2028, with its 500-person permanent workforce given a $10 million support package. Yallourn currently supplies about 20% of  Victoria’s electricity demand or eight per cent of the National Electricity Market.
Greenpeace Australia has labelled the announcement a ‘death knell’ for the country’s struggling coal industry. “EnergyAustralia’s revised timeline for closure shows that the operators of Australia’s coal-burning power stations can read the writing on the wall,” Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior campaigner Glenn Walker said.
Reading the signs, Victoria’s Labor Government has put renewable energy at the heart of its Covid recovery plan, investing $1.6 billion in clean energy in its 2020-21 Budget. By 2028, an additional 5 GW of new renewable energy is scheduled to come online in Victoria.
Baseload electricity prices have plummeted in the last 12 months as new renewable energy projects have come online both in Victoria and across Australia, outing coal-fired stations as not only the dirtiest form of electricity generation but increasingly the least economically attractive – undoubtedly hastening imminent retirements like Yallourn’s.
Eager to not be left behind in the transition, EnergyAustralia has committed to delivering the big battery by 2026, claiming it would be “larger than any battery operating in the world today” – which seems unlikely given both Neoen and Origin announced plans for 500 MW and 700 MW batteries respectively in January. Nonetheless, the shift is seismic and follows moves similar to those made by energy giants Origin and AGL, which both have massive amounts of energy storage proposals in their project pipelines.

“The energy transition is too important to leave to chance – a plan that supports people, the Latrobe Valley and locks in energy storage capacity before Yallourn retires will ensure the smoothest transition possible,” EnergyAustralia’s Managing Director, Catherine Tanna, said in a statement today.
“EnergyAustralia is determined to demonstrate that coal-fired power can exit the market in a way that supports our people and ensures customers continue to receive reliable energy.
“Meanwhile, our new battery will help to secure Victoria’s energy supply and enable more renewables to enter the system.
“Customers want affordable, reliable, cleaner sources of energy and as Yallourn has proudly supplied energy for 100 years we want to harness our history, and the expertise of our workforce, to repower Victoria.”
Given Yallourn’s current generation capacity sits at around 1480 MW, EnergyAustralia says it plans to ensure storage is built to firm increased renewable energy in Victoria before Yallourn exits the system.
“Today is really Day One of a long-term plan that brings together many people across the energy sector to work together to deliver the clean energy transformation for all,” Tanna added.
Greenpeace is calling for AGL to follow EnergyAustralia’s lead and bring forward the closure date of its Loy Yang A coal-fired state which is also in the Latrobe Valley. “Dirty, inefficient and unreliable coal power stations like Yallourn and Loy Yang A have no place in a modern electricity grid – and what’s more, they’re driving up electricity prices and delivering poor returns for investors,” Walker said.
Such news hardly seems like it would be welcomed by the region’s mayor, however. “The Valley can’t sustain these hits,” La Trobe City council mayor Sharon Gibson told the Sydney Morning Herald today. “For every direct job, there’s three or four indirect jobs lost.”
Victoria’s Minister For Energy, Lily D’Ambrosio, released a statement hours after EnergyAustralia broke the news, saying the Andrews Government will work with the company to transition the Yallourn workforce.
“The truth is we’re seeing these old, coal fired power stations creaking to a stop right around the world as countries and companies are switching to new, clean, more reliable and more efficient forms of energy,” the statement read.
“We can’t ignore that change or pretend it’s not happening – and we owe it to these workers to build a modern energy network that creates and supports thousands of Victorian jobs.
“We’ll make sure this workforce is at the heart of our long-term response to today’s announcement, and we will deliver a dedicated support package.
“Our focus will be on helping workers retrain, reskill and find new opportunities. We’ll design worker and supply chain transition programs, a worker transfer scheme and ongoing support services – delivered in consultation with workers, unions and the local community.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/10/nsw-company-wins-prestigious-global-hydrogen-award-for-pioneering-heat-reaction-technology/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 10, 2021",NSW company wins ‘prestigious’ global hydrogen award for pioneering heat reaction technology,"Star Scientific’s Chairman, Andrew Horvath, said the company is “deeply appreciative” of having won the “prestigious award.” The New South Wales-based company took out the top spot for the inaugural global award’s Industrial Application category, chosen by the Sustainable Energy Council.
The company’s Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser (HERO) technology garnered interest from governments worldwide last year, with the company signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Philippines’ Department of Energy and plunging into discussions with leaders across Northern Europe.
“All round the world we are seeing governments starting to grapple with the hard question of how to adapt fossil-fuel driven industries to sustainable energy; specifically, how to help industry generate industrial quantities of heat without combustion,” Horvath said.
“Heat is the key input into most human endeavours. HERO® is the missing link in the hydrogen supply chain, turning green hydrogen into continuous industrial heat without combustion. It can be used from the heaviest of industry such as coal-fired power stations, through to scaled down local assets for specific locations such as district heating and desalination.”

Discovered accidentally, the technology was actually born out of an aberration observed during the company’s hydrogen research a few years ago. “We kept seeing this weird artefact,” Horvath told pv magazine Australia in an interview last December. Intrigued, the company put “every instrument we had on it” to observe and isolate the occurrence.
Curiosity paid off – ultimately leading the company to HERO, a coating substance which can be applied to ceramics or certain metals and which, upon contact with hydrogen and oxygen, goes from zero to over 700 degrees Celsius in three minutes.
“Because it’s not burning, it’s a reaction, all that energy is excitement energy and it goes straight through the substrate. So our energy transfer is above 90% into whatever you’re transferring it to, whether it’s water, CO2, whatever medium,” Horvath said.
“HERO allows us to make saturated steam for energy production, or in fact any sort of heat-driven energy production – be it in industry, be it in food or be it in mass energy production.”
The potential applications of the technology has seen Star Scientific, which has a 8,500 square metre research and development facility in Berkeley Vale on the New South Wales Central Coast, inundated with calls from global energy ministers.
With its MoU, the Philippines’ government wants Star Scientific to retro-fit existing coal-fired power stations with HERO systems powered by green hydrogen. The agreement will also see both parties explore whether the Philippines’ large resources of offshore wind could be utilised toward this green hydrogen end as well as looking into how the technology might provide clean, quick, desalinated water.

As reporter Natalie Filatoff noted, the true power of HERO technology is as a demand activator. HERO gives us a frame to consider how hydrogen can be used, in turn stimulating demand for production as applications come into sharper focus.
In his award acceptance video posted on Tuesday, Chairman Horvath says the research facility is in the “final phases of pre-production,” and pv magazine Australia reported in December the company is seeking a nearby site to house its first manufacturing plant.
“This is an exciting time to be pioneering hydrogen technology. We are seeing a shift toward hydrogen as the energy choice of the future and we are very excited by the opportunities that HERO® will bring,” Horvath said.
Chris Hugall, Managing Director of the Sustainable Energy Council which selected Star Scientific for its World Hydrogen Award, said the Council was delighted with the outstanding projects nominated. “The World Hydrogen Awards are the only truly global awards to recognise excellence within the Hydrogen industry and we look forward to continuously serving the industry and celebrating its fast-paced advancements.”

Researchers from Egypt’s Benha University and the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom have a developed a new passive technology to cool off solar modules, based on saturating hydrogels beads that use nanofluids instead of water. 
Hydrogels beads are micro-sized particles with cooling properties that are made from natural or synthetics polymers and are commonly applied in biomedical, drug delivery, and biological studies. Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) water-based nanofluids with three different concentrations were used by the scientists as a saturation agent for the hydrogels beads.
Dry hydrogel beads were mixed with the nanofluids through a sonication process, which applies sound energy to agitate particles or discontinuous fibers in a liquid. “Three nano particles weights were measured in fume cabinet and mixed with water to get three percentage’ weight concentrations of (0.1%, 0.25% and 0.5%),” the academics explained.

The saturated beads were then placed below the back surface of simulated PV panels and the cooling solution was tested at standard test conditions radiation with a temperature between 30 and 3 degrees Celsius, relative humidity between 40 and 50% around the panels’ surface, and a wind speed close to near zero. “The panel temperature was measured using 3 K-type thermocouples attached to each back surface and connected to data loggers,” the British-Egyptian group specified.
The experiment showed that the simulated panels with the hydrogels beads exhibited better thermal performance compared with both the uncooled panel and the hydrogel solution that was saturated only with water. “The optimised concentration of 0.5%wt. Alumina-water based nanofluid could significantly reduce the temperature by 17.9 and 16.3 degrees Celsius compared with the uncooled panel at radiation intensities of 800 and 1000 W/m2, respectively,” the academics affirmed. “The optimised concentration could enhance the electricity efficiency of the panels by approximately 10.1%.”
The additional analysis of the costs of the proposed technology showed, the researchers went on to say, that payback time ranges from 16.1 and 12 years at radiation intensities of 800 and 1000 W/m2, respectively. “It can be noticed that due to the expensive cost of the nano material, by increasing the concentration of the nanofluid, the payback period increases,” the research team explained.
“The technology is already viable for commercial production,” research co-author, Saber Abdo, told pv magazine.
The passive cooling technique is presented in the study Effect of using saturated hydrogel beads with alumina water-based nanofluid for cooling solar panels: Experimental study with economic analysis, published in Solar Energy.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans to install a solid-state battery at the International Space Station this fall.
Cold temperatures can reduce battery performance, but it remains unclear how batteries will fare in extreme space conditions. This is why JAXA called for research proposals in 2016 and chose to cooperate with Hitachi Zosen to develop a solid-state battery that can operate in space.
JAXA will send the solid-state battery to the ISS and attach it the IVA-replaceable Small Exposed Experiment Platform (i-SEEP) on the outside of the “Kibo” Japanese research module. The team will conduct tests for six months to gain conclusive data on the performance of the solid-state battery.
JAXA will use 140 mAh batteries for the test. They will be connected with 15 cells to create a 2.1 Ah power supply. If successful, the batteries will be a lot easier to handle in space, because they won’t need thick temperature protection shields. This could help to miniaturize and lighten battery designs.
In addition, the batteries won’t require heating, which could improve the power consumption of battery-powered equipment in space. The team hopes to eventually use the technology to power Lunar and Mars rovers, as well as observation equipment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/10/hybrid-operational-strategy-to-use-lithium-ion-storage-in-commercial-pv-arrays/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MARCH 10, 2021",Hybrid operational strategy to use lithium-ion storage in commercial PV arrays,"From pv magazine Global.
An international research group has defined a hybrid operational strategy to combine commercial PV systems with lithium-ion batteries, from a cost and revenue perspective.
The integrated strategy includes 24-hour ahead forecasts to improve profit generation from batteries, a Monte Carlo analysis considering battery costs, and different electricity profiles for different climatic zones such as South Africa, Sweden, and Italy. “The main novelty of this study relies on the parametric investigation of the profitability of li-ion batteries in commercial buildings, by modelling the savings from both peak shaving, price arbitrage, and PV self-consumption, when different sensitive parameters are considered,” the scientists explained.
Three locations were considered in the study: Stockholm, with an annual global horizontal irradiation of 961 kWh/m2; Rome, with 1,640 kWh/m2; and Johannesburg, with 2,020 kWh/m2. For each city, the electricity prices correspond to the commercial loads, and the same building–with the same characteristics–was taken into account for the three locations.
In their simulations, the academics used a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to provide a better control, compared to a simple on/off-type control. This device is commonly utilised in industrial control applications to regulate temperature, flow, pressure, speed, and other process variables. The simulated PV system had a capacity of 150 kW and was sized to avoid the overproduction of solar power. The battery was designed to have a capacity of 50 kW/200 kWh. The battery price was assumed to be $500/kWh.
The sensitivity analysis considered different parameters including electricity cost components, the capacity of the PV system, the battery capacity, the targeted peak to be shaved, the battery upfront cost, the discount rate, tax rate, and the escalation rate of the electricity price. The operational strategy was implemented through the analysis of a year’s worth of hourly PV production and load profiles, which usually showed that solar power generation was higher than consumption from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. for any PV installation that was slightly oversized.
The simulations showed, according to the scientists, that the proposed hybrid operational strategy was able to considerably reduce power peaks while producing significant annual savings. However, they specified that with the assumed battery price, the net present value of the storage system does not lead to a profitable investment. “Positive net present values can be achieved with optimal design of PV and battery capacities for specific battery prices below $250/kWh,” they further explained.
The novel strategy, presented in the paper Li-ion batteries for peak shaving, price arbitrage, and photovoltaic self-consumption in commercial buildings: A Monte Carlo Analysis, published in Energy Conversion and Management, is claimed to be suitable to all markets where no incentives for distributed storage are granted.
The research team comprises scientists from Sweden’s Mälardalen University and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Italy’s Università Telematica eCampus, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, in the United States.
