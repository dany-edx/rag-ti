The report also urged Victoria to commit to a cut-off date for the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles, consider a ban on gas connections in new homes and consider reviewing and removing regulations that mandate gas connections in new buildings.
The Legislative Council Environment and Planning Committee tabled its report on renewable energy in Victoria this week. The committee’s final report, which made 32 recommendations, found the state’s electricity demand is likely to double by 2050 as a greater uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) coincides with a decline in household gas usage.
Committee chair Sonja Terpstra said while electricity usage is predicted to increase significantly, the state already has sufficient access to the clean energy resources needed to transition the state’s electricity system to 100% renewables.
“The Victorian government has the governance and policy structure in place to meet the increase in the demand for energy to 2050 with renewable energy sources,” she said. “Renewable energy zones, the renewable energy development plan, renewable energy auctions and the creation of VicGrid will help transform the state’s energy system to accommodate the increased production of renewable energy that this state needs.”
The upper house inquiry was tasked with investigating a blueprint for the state to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050. Victoria currently has a series of renewable energy targets in place, including a 40% uptake by 2025, and a 50% target for 2030.

While the report makes no recommendations on the state government’s net zero emissions target by 2050, Victorian Greens party leader Samantha Ratnam said that on current forecasts the state is on track to beat the target of 50% renewable energy by 2030, and argues the government should revise the target to be more ambitious.
“This inquiry has shown we have the resources and technical know-how to transition Victoria to 100% renewable energy by 2030, we just need the political will,” she said. “Victoria must be as ambitious as possible in the climate action we take in the next critical years to 2030. This means stopping new fossil fuel production, transitioning our coal and gas to renewable sources, and eliminating emissions from other sectors like transport.”
Environment Victoria policy and advocacy manager Bronya Lipski said the state government could use the inquiry’s recommendations to speed up the roll out of renewables to 100% by the end of the decade.
“With a federal government now committed to facilitating rather than obstructing the transition, it’s increasingly clear that now is the time for fast-tracking the renewable transition,” she said.
“Victoria needs to get on with the job of creating thousands of new direct renewable energy jobs and leaving Victorian households financially better off. This inquiry makes it clear that Victoria must move quickly and boldly to get to 100% renewable power this decade.”

Labor could repair Australia’s tattered reputation on climate change, if it gets these things right","In his first encounter with world leaders at the Quad meeting in Japan earlier this week, Australia’s new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that the country was ready to take ambitious action on climate change.
But how well does this claim hold up? Will an Albanese government repair Australia’s tattered international reputation on climate change, and its strained relationships with the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Pacific Island countries over this issue?
The Albanese government has taken crucial steps this week to mend Australia’s international standing on climate change. But Labor’s insistence on maintaining a booming coal export industry will hamper its comeback, and questions remain about whether it will do enough to boost funding for climate action internationally.
In their first week in office Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have placed climate change diplomacy firmly on the agenda.
In Albanese’s opening address to Quad partners – India, the United States and Japan – he stressed the importance of tackling climate change for national security, saying it will build “a stronger and more resilient Indo-Pacific region”.
Wong has travelled to Fiji in the government’s first efforts to pick up the pieces of Australia’s fraught relationship with Pacific Island nations, pledging to boost development assistance to the region already hit hard by climate change impacts.

Arguably the most prominent step towards redeeming Australia’s standing on climate change is boosting its national emissions reduction targets.
The Coalition’s climate target was to reduce emissions 26-28% compared to 2005 levels – the same target it had in 2015. This was widely viewed at home and overseas as an insufficient contribution to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2℃.
Image: Facebook
Labor’s pledge to boost the 2030 target to a 43% reduction is a significant improvement. But it still falls short of the 45% target it took to the 2016 and 2019 elections, and is far less ambitious than those proposed by the Greens and teal independents.
Even if Labor gains a majority in the House of Representatives, it won’t have a majority in the Senate. While this gives crossbenchers an opportunity to exert upward pressure on Australia’s climate performance, incoming Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen has ruled out lifting the 2030 target.
The crossbenchers will need to pick their battles. In the short term, they may have more success negotiating measures that will help Australia to beat its existing 2030 target, rather than formally set a new one.
As the impacts of climate change intensify and the global race towards renewables accelerates, domestic and international pressure on Australia’s targets will only increase.
Countries are due to announce their next round of contributions to the Paris Agreement’s goals by 2025. In the interim, Labor and the crossbenchers will need to lay the groundwork for a higher target for 2035 or 2040.

Australia’s climate policy record will remain vulnerable on a number of fronts, perhaps most glaringly as one of the world’s top fossil fuel exporters.
At last year’s UN climate summit, Australia refused to join a coalition of countries aiming to phase out coal. While Labor’s energy policy, Powering Australia, seeks to reduce Australia’s reliance on coal, it does not commit to a phase-out.
Albanese has envisaged that coal exports could stretch beyond 2050 and has supported opening new coal mines. This is out of step with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report, which finds keeping temperature rise to 2℃ or below will require “cancellation of new coal power projects and accelerated retirement of existing coal plants”.
While coal remains, for now, an important feature of Australia’s trade relations with major economies in Asia, it will increasingly become a liability, especially now that all of Australia’s 10 major trading partners have net zero targets.
Beyond coal, there’s much Australia could do to expand or revive partnerships with other industrialised economies on areas of innovation, such as green hydrogen and clean energy supply chains.

Also important is how Australia supports lower-income countries to reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change impacts.
Following drastic cuts to aid under the Abbott government, Australia’s international climate finance has gradually risen again, with Australia pledging A$2 billion from 2020-25. However, this pledge falls well below Australia’s fair share.
The Morrison government decided not to make any further contributions to the UN’s flagship Green Climate Fund, which aims to finance emissions reductions and climate resilience in developing countries.
The fund has attracted around US$20 billion in pledges to date, with France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom the largest contributors (Australia pledged A$200 million in 2014).
Labor has promised to boost Australia’s aid budget to reach 0.5% of Gross National Income over time (it currently sits at about 0.2%) and launch a partnership to finance climate-resilient infrastructure in the Pacific. But it did not commit in this campaign to return to the Green Climate Fund.

A final key element in resuscitating Australia’s global profile is re-engaging constructively in UN climate talks.
Labor’s plan to reinstate the position of Ambassador for Climate Change is a positive step. The government will also seek to host the annual UN climate conference in 2024 in Australia for the first time.
Hosting such an event in partnership with Pacific neighbours would send a high-profile message to the international community that Australia is back in the game.
Still, there’s a cautionary tale from past UN conferences, where some hosts (such as Poland in 2018) have used the occasion to showcase their ongoing reliance on fossil fuels.
Overall then, a change of government offers hope Australia will be regarded globally as a more enthusiastic partner on climate change. But as long as Australia remains a major exporter of fossil fuels, its claims to become a “renewable energy superpower” will come with a catch.

As part of the agreement Mondo, which specialises in commercial and community distributed energy offerings, will partner with Victorian solar installation company RACV Solar to deliver the solar PV systems on city-owned properties in Bendigo, about 150 kilometres north-west of Melbourne.
Bendigo Mayor Andrea Metcalf said through the agreement Mondo and RACV Solar would install and maintain solar PV systems on up to 78 city-owned facilities, with ownership of the solar panels reverting to the city after 20 years.
“The renewable electricity generated by the solar system will be billed back to the city and community tenants of the buildings at a competitive fixed cost for the life of the contract,” she said.
“This will result in power cost savings to the city and the city’s tenants of approximately $2.4 million over the full 20 years and is possibly one of the largest solar deployment programs for a Victorian council.”
Metcalf said the PPA is a key action of the city’s environment strategy, which set a target to install solar PV systems on 90% of city-owned buildings by 2026.
“By entering into this agreement, we can achieve the target without funding it through rates or borrowings,” she said. “In addition to achieving power savings for both the city and the tenants of city-owned buildings, it will also increase the supply of renewable energy throughout Greater Bendigo for the benefit of the community.”

Australia’s fifth largest inland city with a population of more than 100,000, Bendigo has emerged as a solar PV hot spot with network service provider Powercor including the region in a major works program designed to alleviate grid congestion in areas of high rooftop solar PV penetration.
Greater Bendigo City is also among a group of 46 councils which last year signed an agreement with Melbourne-based energy retailer Red Energy, an offshoot of the federal government-owned Snowy Hydro, to supply the councils with a combined 240GWh of renewable energy each year until the end of 2030.
The first four city-owned facilities to have solar panels installed as part of the new PPA with Mondo will be Bendigo Library, Bendigo Livestock Exchange, and the city’s Depot and Heathcote Service Centre, which will equate to 147kW of solar PV.
The PPA comes at an opportune time for RACV Solar which only last month completed its acquisition of Bendigo-based Cola Solar, central Victoria’s largest dedicated solar retailer.
RACV Solar chief executive Andy McCarthy said in a statement the addition of Cola Solar’s almost 40 employees to RACV Solar will provide another great boost to a business which is fast expanding.
‘We’re looking forward to working with the staff to grow the business over the coming months,” he said. “We’re excited to extend the RACV Solar business into this region, support local residents through this acquisition, and create employment and economic benefits for the regional economy.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/27/frontier-pushes-ahead-with-green-hydrogen-production-plans/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 27, 2022",Frontier pushes ahead with green hydrogen production plans,"Western Australian renewables developer Frontier Energy has nominated alkaline water electrolysis as its chosen technology to produce green hydrogen using clean energy supplied by the proposed Bristol Springs Solar (BSS) project being developed near the town of Waroona south of Perth.
The solar farm, to be built next to the Worsley alumina refinery about 120 kilometres south of Perth, would have an initial generation capacity of 114MWdc but Frontier said additional land acquisition opportunities are available that could allow for an increase up to 500MW. The company is also exploring the potential of adding a battery energy storage system and the development of green hydrogen production using clean energy from the BSS project.
Frontier managing director Mike Young said the company remains on track to commence construction of the Bristol Springs solar project in 2023 while a study into the production of green hydrogen incorporating clean energy generated by the solar farm is due to be completed mid-year.
The study, being conducted by Xodus Group, has already assessed the most appropriate hydrogen plant design, including the timeframe to first hydrogen production, initial plant size and scalability, input power characteristics and preferred technologies.

Frontier said alkaline water electrolysis technology (AWE) had been chosen for the hydrogen production process due to its lower cost, technical robustness and “technical maturity” compared to alternative methods. Another advantage of AWE is the modular nature of its installation which “allows for hydrogen production earlier than originally anticipated and for staged future expansion”.
The Perth-headquartered company also announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Norwegian company Nel Hydrogen, a division of Nel ASA, and Victorian-based gas transport and storage business ENGV, to assist in the development of the production plant and market distribution.
“The development of our Bristol Springs project is well advanced, but the current project is only the first stage of our long-term vision,” he said.
“We aim to become one of the first commercial green hydrogen producers in Australia.
“The MoU with Nel and ENGV ensures that our green hydrogen strategy is carried out in the most efficient manner.”
Under the terms of the MoU, Nel and ENGV, which teamed up to deliver the hydrogen microgrid for Canadian gas giant ATCO at Jandakot in WA, will assist with the advancement of Frontier’s hydrogen study including furthering the development of the green hydrogen production plant, compression and storage, and distributing to market. Nel is expected to provide the hydrogen technology solutions while ENGV will provide integration services.
Frontier said construction on the initial stage of the Bristol Springs Solar project is expected to commence in early 2023 and it remains on track to release both the renewable expansion and the complete green hydrogen study by mid-year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/27/ja-solar-introduces-n-type-solar-panel-with-22-4-efficiency/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 27, 2022",JA Solar introduces n-type solar panel with 22.4% efficiency,"JA Solar has launched its first solar module series based on n-type wafers.
“The DeepBlue 4.0 X Panel is based on low-oxygen n-type wafers with 182 mm size. We utilized a self-developed bifacial solar cell with optimized passivation and contact technologies,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The  DeepBlue 4.0 X panels are available in three different versions, with 54, 72 and 78 cells. The smallest product has a power output of 435 W and a power conversion efficiency of 22.3%. It measures 1,134 mm x 1,722 mm x 30 mm and weighs 21.5 kg. The mid-sized panel measures 1,134 mm x 2,278 mm x 35 mm and weighs in at 31.8 kg. Its efficiency rating is 22.3% and its power output is 575 W.
The largest module measures 1,134 mm x 2,465 mm x 35 mm and weighs 33.4 kg, with efficiency and nominal power levels of 22.4% and 625 W, respectively.
“The smallest panel is for residential PV and the larger two are for C&I and utility scale PV plants,” the spokesperson said.
All three panels operate with a maximum system voltage of 1,500 V and a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius. They come with a 12-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty, with minimum annual degradation of 0.4% per year.
The modules were encapsulated with round welding and a specially designed cushion, which the manufacturer ensures minimizes cell gaps close to zero while increasing efficiency by 0.2%.
“Our n-type panel shows a bifaciality of 80%, which is much higher than 70% for p-type PERC products,” the spokesperson said. “A PVsyst simulation showed it achieves 0.9% more power generation due to this factor.”
JA Solar said that mass production of DeepBlue 4.0 X will start in the third quarter of 2022. The total production capacity preserved for this new product will be 6.5 GW by end of 2022 and 15 GW more in 2023.

Capital costs for 100 MWdc solar projects are set to rise 6% this year, according to one analyst.
US-owned Wood Mackenzie issued a note this week which also estimated China will add 75 GW of the 110 GW of new solar to arrive in the Asia-Pacific region in 2022.
The world will pass a terrawatt of solar generation capacity this year, the Edinburgh-based company added, and North America will see its share of the world’s new solar capacity double from the 11% recorded last year.
It was not clear from the note whether the project capital cost rise predicted would apply solely to the US.
The analyst said it had observed a “substantial amount of [solar] module volumes for utility scale projects” postponed after Californian manufacturer Auxin Solar in February lodged an anti-circumvention petition to the authorities.
Auxin has claimed Chinese companies are manufacturing products on home soil and only putting the final touches to them in Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia before labelling them as made in the latter-named nations to get around US anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
An anti-circumvention investigation is under way and Wood Mackenzie said the development is also prompting some manufacturers to shift “importer of record” responsibility onto panel buyers.
Germany will lead the European push for solar this decade, Wood Mackenzie predicted, because of a new governing coalition and the nation’s dependence on Russian gas.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means the Russia and Caspian Sea regions will add no new solar capacity this year, the analyst said.
Rising solar costs will be partially offset by plans to add, this year, production lines sufficient to produce an extra 200,000 metric tons of polysilicon per year, plus 1 GW more cells, 1 GW more wafers, and 500 MW more modules.
The analyst noted moves by India this year to tax solar imports and bolster domestic production would also “shift the pricing and supply dynamics in the US and India.”

Israeli solar inverter and battery manufacturer SolarEdge this week announced it has started producing test battery cells at a new factory in South Korea.
SolarEdge said it expects to ramp to full production at the 2 GWh-per-year-production capacity Sella 2 fab in Chungcheongbuk-Do this year.
The company’s Kokam Ltd lithium-ion battery subsidiary will operate the facility, which can be scaled up.
The site, at Eumseong Innovation City, will produce battery cells for SolarEdge’s solar-plus-battery residential systems, electric mobility, stationary energy storage facilities, and uninterrupted power supply products, the manufacturer said in a press release this week.
SolarEdge chief executive Zvi Lando, quoted in the release, said: “The opening of Sella 2 is an important milestone for SolarEdge. It allows us to own key processes in the development and manufacturing of advanced energy storage solutions for our solar core business and additional applications while further securing the resilience of our supply chain.”
