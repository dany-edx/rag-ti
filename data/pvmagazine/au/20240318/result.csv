Synergy said the four-hour battery energy storage system – scheduled for completion before the end of 2025 – will help ready the state’s power grid for the retirement of coal-fired power stations by improving system security and supporting increased renewable energy generation in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
WA Energy Minister Reece Whitby said the battery will absorb excess energy generated by rooftop PV systems when the sun is shining and discharge when demand for electricity peaks usually in the evening.
“This is an exciting milestone for Western Australia’s decarbonisation journey,” he said. “When complete, this battery will support reliability and more renewable energy on WA’s main electricity grid.”
Synergy is building the $1.6 billion (USD 1.05 billion) Collie big battery approximately 200 kilometres southwest of state capital Perth, just north of the existing coal-fired Collie Power Station that is to be retired by 2027. The facility will connect to the SWIS via Western Power’s existing 330 kV Schotts Terminal.
Collie-based earthworks specialists Cardinal Contractors has been awarded the contract to complete site preparation earthworks for the battery facility, with up to 500 jobs expected to be created at the peak of construction.

The Collie battery will be Synergy’s third large-scale battery energy storage system with the government-owned energy generator and retailer planning to build 3 GWh hours of storage by 2025.
Synergy said the 100 MW / 200 MWh first stage of the Kwinana Battery Energy Storage System, built at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana Power Station about 30 kilometres south of Perth, has been providing power to the SWIS since it was completed in May 2023.
Work is continuing on the 200 MW / 800 MWh second stage of that facility and is due to be completed in late 2024.
The WA government has estimated that the SWIS may need about 50 GW of new renewable electricity and storage infrastructure to support increased demand over the next 20 years.
Synergy’s big battery is one of two grid-scale energy storage systems being constructed at Collie.
French renewables giant Neoen is in the process of building the first stage of a planned 1 GW /4 GWh battery at Collie with the developer predicting the facility will be operational “by or before 2025.”

The program provides $1,000 off the cost of installing a heat pump hot water system and up to $400 a year on electricity bills. The state government has now expanded the plan in response to the uptick in demand with 8,000 additional rebates.
The office of the Premier of Victoria, Jacinta Allan, has said that more than 350,000 Victorian households have received a rebate or loan to take up rooftop solar, home batteries, heat pump hot water systems, and other energy-efficient appliances since 2018.
In terms of energy storage, the Victorian state government has also announced the first round of projects as part of the Neighbourhood Batteries Program. A total of 4.2 MWh of new storage capacity is to be added with funding of over $6 million for 25 neighbourhood batteries across the state. These are meant to help households generate and consume more energy locally, which enables them to lower their power bills.
In this current round of projects now moving forward, the largest battery project, which is to deliver 1,750 kWh storage, is Mondo Phillip Island, where seven 100 kW/250 kWh batteries are to be installed across the island. These should protect network reliability and deliver financial benefits for locals by means of a community dividend payment.
Four batteries will be installed at Queenscliff, delivering 1,000 kWh of storage, Indigo Power will install a Wodonga Neighbourhood Battery with 200 kWh storage; Totally Renewable Yackandandah will install a battery with 200 kWh storage; AusNet is installing ten batteries across the east and northeast of Victoria with a total of 850 kWh storage, and GV Community Energy has received support to install a neighbourhood battery at Tatura and one at Wangaratta representing a total of 216 kWh storage.
D’Ambrosio, noted, “We’re building 100 neighbourhood batteries across Victoria to make sure all families can share the savings from the massive uptake of solar.”  The Victorian government has said the next round of applications will open in August 2024.
Earlier this year, Origin Zero announced it would install and operate three battery energy storage systems with a combined capacity of 450 kW / 1 MWh as part of the City of Melbourne’s Power Melbourne community battery scheme. City of Melbourne Environment Portfolio Lead Rohan Leppert noted: “Storage is the missing piece of the puzzle when it comes to providing residents and businesses with access to affordable renewable energy.”

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/18/coalition-of-clean-energy-stakeholders-call-for-measured-and-considered-local-content-in-renewables-projects/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",CARRIE HAMPEL,2024-03-18,Coalition of clean energy stakeholders call for “measured and considered” local content in renewable energy projects,"A coalition now calling for local content requirements in renewable energy projects want the federal government to embed requirements for locally produced and supplied components into all renewable energy supply chain manufacturing and development. The group says this will ensure that the energy transition’s benefits resonate through local communities, businesses, workers and “the Australian domestic economy as a whole.”
The diverse coalition includes unions and renewable energy industry associations, and investor groups. The coalition includes the AMWU, Weld Australia, the Smart Energy Council, Climate Energy Finance, Climate Capital Forum, and the First Nations Clean Energy Network.
The call for local content comes at a time when unique opportunities are arising as a result of last year’s boost to the Australian government’s Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) and its 32 GW of tenders for renewable energy capacity.
The coalition of interest groups says that a “measured and considered” local content requirement (LCR) will support the maturation of domestic clean energy and technology supply chains. The coalition believes that now is the time to act to reap the benefits of local content requirements.
Some of the benefits that would result from local content requirements, the coalition argues, would be to underpin investor confidence in and by Australian companies, as well as to build jobs and an essential skills base for Australian clean technology industries. An additional benefit would be the facilitation of social license.
Steve Murphy, National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, noted: “A successful net-zero transformation needs the buy-in of everyday Australians to succeed. This means Australian workers and communities – not just foreign companies and shareholders – need to benefit materially from the transition.” He said that the promise of jobs and benefits to local communities is an essential element of winning community support for transition.
The idea is not new and is currently unfolding in a number of different regions across the globe. Most famously, the United States has attracted investment and much sought-after skilled workers with its local content requirements as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Europe responded with its own local content requirements, in various forms, and similar policies are being pursued in India, Brazil, and South Africa.
“Experience in other countries, such as Canada, for example, has demonstrated that First Nations consent, participation, inclusion, ownership and equity can safeguard projects,” said Karrina Nolan from the First Nations Clean Energy Network. This is evident in the approach taken by Fortescue with green hydrogen projects in Canada.
Beyond sparking international competition for investment and personnel, if Australia was to support local content in the multiple large projects now incoming, it would bolster local supply chains, strengthening resilience.
The importance of local supply chains was laid bare during the Covid-19 pandemic, but there are additional benefits in  the avoidance of geopolitical disruption and limiting emissions resulting from long-distance shipping.
In Australia, similar sentiments have already been voiced from other quarters. A recent House of Representatives committee report iterated the need for the Australian government to identify the way in which locally manufactured content can be increased in renewable energy projects. Queensland and Victoria already have such mechanisms in place.
National resilience, preparedness and security expert and Chair of the Institute for Integrated Economic Research, John Blackburn, said: “Supporting local content in these tenders is a powerful mechanism that can contribute to building capacity and resilience across all three tiers of government – local government, state and federal.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/18/evaluating-profitability-of-vanadium-flow-batteries/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,2024-03-18,Evaluating profitability of vanadium flow batteries,"From pv magazine Global
Vanadium flow batteries are one of the most promising large-scale energy storage technologies due to their long cycle life, high recyclability, and safety credentials. However, they have lower energy density compared to ubiquitous lithium-ion batteries, and their uptake is held back by high upfront cost.
Now, researchers led by the University of Padua in Italy developed a techno-economic model, using experimental and market data, which can better inform investment decisions for this type of technology.
Their model considers the present and future competitivity of industrial flow batteries in operating specific services, which have not yet been developed to an accurate grade, and yields economic performance indicators such as capital costs, operative costs, levelized cost of storage (LCOS), and net present value.
To perform their calculations, the researchers used technical parameters taken from large-area multi-cell stacks, rather than from small single-cell experiments, to better characterize the behavior of real industrial-scale systems. They also used data from real financial markets and economic patterns of some major manufacturers.
The assessment was performed considering a lifespan of 20 years with a charge/discharge cycle per day. Each component affecting the capital and operative costs was analyzed, and the impact of side phenomena on capacity losses was considered.
As a result, their model showed where the economic indicators are heading and which parameters have a greater affect on investment profitability, thus tracking a possible roadmap for system optimization.
Their estimations indicate that technological and market evolutions are heading to much more competitive systems, with capital costs down to €260 ($431.4)/kWh at an energy/power duration of 10 hours. Namely, this is the breakeven point where the present values of total costs equate the present values of total revenues and no economic result is obtained.
“This is to be compared with a break-even point in the net present value of €400 kWh ($663.7 kWh), which suggests that flow batteries may play a major role in some expanding markets, notably the long duration energy storage,” the researchers stated.
Their results are published in the study “Techno-economic assessment of future vanadium-flow batteries based on real device/market parameters,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
