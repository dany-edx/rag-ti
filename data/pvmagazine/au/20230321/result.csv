The Emerald battery is a similar install to that completed in Tanby on the Queensland mid-coast, where a 4 MW / 8 MWh battery come online last September.
The rollout is part of state government-owned Energy Queensland’s Local Network Battery Plan announced following the explosion of the Callide coal generator in 2021.

The strategy will eventually see at least 15 network-connected batteries installed across the state. “We now have 8 MWh batteries at Bohle Plains and Black River near Townsville, Kleinton near Toowoomba, Bargara near Bundaberg, Tanby near Rockhampton, and at Torquay near Hervey Bay,” Energy Queensland CEO Rod Duke said last September.
Duke said at the time the remaining nine batteries – including Emerald – would be spread across major centres in regional Queensland near communities that have significant rooftop solar generation “because we know that’s where they will have the greatest overall benefit.”
This all fits into a broader scheme from the Queensland government, with the state’s Minister for Energy, Mick de Brenni, saying in 2022 that the state’s publicly-owned power companies are investing in 720 MW of batteries. These include large-scale batteries like the 200 MW/400 MWh Greenbank project in Brisbane’s outer southern suburbs, as well as the mid-scale batteries like that slated for Emerald.
In line with the state’s Energy and Jobs Plan, a central focus is being placed on fitting Queensland out with with publicly-owned energy infrastructure. In this particular instance, the Emerald battery is owned by Ergon Energy, a subsidiary of Energy Queensland.

“This new battery at Emerald will ensure that the energy generated locally stays locally, instead of putting pressure on upstream infrastructure,” Energy Queensland’s General Manager for Energy Storage, Glenn Dahlenburg said.
“As we connect more renewables for our customers, battery storage will give us greater flexibility to connect rooftop solar, balance supply and demand, and keep voltages in check, which is vital for the security of the network that powers Queensland.”
While the state government is not referring to this fleet as ‘community batteries,’ it seems the rollout is looking to deliver on many of the promises the concept holds, and, being publicly-owned, the financial model also holds clout.
Community battery ownership models take many forms, ranging from projects owned by community members or councils to distribution network service providers (DNSPs), energy retailers, or other renewables investors.

In a recent feature in pv magazine, the Australian National University’s Bjorn Sturmberg argued the case for using community batteries as solar shifting devices is weak, but where the technology can really deliver is as a means to improve reliability, daily voltage control, reverse power flows, and energy resilience in the face of natural disasters – issues which simply can’t be worked out on the continental electricity system and have to be addressed locally.
Energy Queensland seems to also be pointing to these functions as a key case for its regional batteries, alongside unlocking additional solar capacity for local communities.
With Queensland looking to perform a massive energy U-turn in the next decade, as outlined in its Energy and Jobs Plan, the state government is seeking to drive its impressive solar uptake even higher. 
Queensland has one of the highest penetrations of rooftop solar in Australia and indeed the world, with one in three homes fitted with systems. Collectively, the energy produced by Queensland rooftops is already the largest renewable generator in the state.
Congestion on the local grid is stifling solar uptake in some areas however – and the government is clearly looking to batteries to help address this. 
Coming at the issue from another direction, the Queensland Competition Authority also proposed a 40% increase in the solar feed-in tariff for regional customers on the Ergon Energy network earlier this month. The move will undoubtedly help drive more solar uptake – placing an even higher imperative on ensuring local grids can handle the load.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/21/investment-boom-in-australia-sees-utility-scale-backing-jump-50-targets-within-reach/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 21, 2023","Investment ‘boom’ in Australia sees utility-scale jump 50%, puts targets within reach","Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator says the level of renewable investment last year is a “good start” to achieving the national target of 82% renewable penetration by 2030. Renewables met an average of 35% of demand in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2022, though that figure lifted to an average of 42% in November and December. That boost came on the back of solar performing at a record level in December, reaching 23% of total generation, the Regulator’s report noted.
In terms of the investment spread, last year saw 4.3 GW of large-scale solar and wind projects reach final investment decision (FID) – a 50% jump from the previous year – and 2.8 GW of rooftop investment. The Regulator also noted for large-scale projects, 2.1 GW of the 4.3 GW investment was committed in the fourth quarter alone. For comparison, an average of just 2.8 GW of utility-scale projects reached FID annually over the 2019 to 2021 period.

While these 2022 results tip the scales between small and large-scale projects, small-scale still leads for actual installation, with 2.5 GW of utility-scale projects coming online compared to 2.8 GW of rooftop. The boom in utility-scale investment nonetheless suggests the change in federal government last May, and subsequent change in national rhetoric around renewables, is indeed encouraging far greater confidence in the sector.
Among the key investment drivers the Regulator pointed to was Australia legislation of its 2030 emissions reduction target, the setting of a 82% renewable target, commercial demand for renewable energy, acceleration of coal closures, high wholesale electricity prices, and government’s acceleration of grid and battery storage projects.
“The increase in FID capacity announcements is expected to continue in 2023,” the Regulator forecast, even going so far as to say Australia may be on the precipice of a new investment boom cycle, similar to that observed in 2016–2018. It did, however, note such a boom would depend on whether clean energy supply chains successfully rebound from the disruptions induced by the pandemic.

The Regulator pointed to predictions from analyst Rystad to support its rosy outlook, noting Rystad had found over 12 GW of large-scale renewable projects currently have development approval with another 15 GW at earlier stages in the approval process.
Australian analyst Sunwiz has a less optimistic forecast for the utility-scale segment this year however, predicting the massive growth in 2022 will be upended. It noted the large-scale segment was buoyed by a small number of particularly large projects in 2022, saying the amount of solar farms actually under construction has dropped markedly. “Meaning 2023 will almost certainly be a year of contraction,” Sunwiz said.
It is worth noting here that Sunwiz is analysing actual installations, while the Regulator is pointing to investment. It is possible both sets of analysis could hold true, since most large projects take years to come online, even after reaching FID.

Path to 82% renewables by 2030
The Regulator expects renewables could reach an average of 40% of total NEM generation during 2023, up from the 35% average in 2022. Coupled with the promising investment numbers, this increase puts the country on a decent trajectory to meet its 2030 renewables target. 
“If current electricity demand stayed the same to the end of the decade, renewable generation share must increase by 6 percentage points each year and annual added capacity must increase to at least 7 GW on a sustained basis,” the Regulator said.
Electricity demand is, however, expected to grow this decade as industry and households electrify and begin adding new loads to the grid with technologies like electric vehicles.

The startup has signed a polysilicon supply contract with Munich-based chemical group Wacker, with Schröder saying its polysilicon will start being used as early as April. Polysilicon is a component of solar panels and is an industry currently highly concentrated in China. Forced labour is suspected to be used in polysilicon production, which is also an emissions intensive process.
1Komma5 claims by using Wacker’s polysilicon it will save more than 50% of carbon emissions from its value chain compared to commercially available materials from Asia. “The savings are from efficiency,” Schröder said, “and also since Germany’s energy mix, especially electricity, is almost 50% renewable energy and Wacker has focused on clean energy very early on.”
Image: 1komma5°
In terms of 1Komma5’s new modules, the company is already producing its 415W, TOPCon Full Black modules. They are set to become commercially available in Germany from June and in Australia from the third quarter of this year, according to Chris Williams, founder of Natural Solar and now the CEO of 1Komma5’s APAC arm.
1Komma5’s modules and wafers are currently being manufactured in China, but the startup is already searching for a location to house its module factory in Germany. It says this relocation will allow it to make all parts of its supply chain sustainable, including socially sustainable, as well as protecting it from geopolitical risks – a major trend in the Western world.
Australians are expected to be able to order 1Komma5’s new panels in the 10 weeks or so, Williams told pv magazine Australia. “Lots” of these news panels will be destined for Down Under, he added.
Image: 1komma5°
1Komma5 is aiming to become something of an “Apple store of energy” retailing and installing solar, batteries, electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps and the energy management platform to integrate them into a fully optimised home energy ‘ecosystem.
After starting up in Europe in 2021, the company entered the Australian market in October 2022 by acquiring a majority stake in one of Australia’s biggest home solar and battery installation companies, Natural Solar, followed by Solaray Energy in January. Having allocated $100 million (USD 67 million) for Australian growth, Williams said “we expect to announce further acquisitions in the next six to eight weeks.”
With this strategy, the company is seeking to leverage economies of scale to supercharge its procurement abilities and improve operational efficiencies through centralised logistics and warehousing. 
Image: 1komma5°
Williams confirmed 1Komma5 will not exclusively be selling its own brand of solar panels, saying “we want to sell what Australian customers want.” While it is too early to quantify, Williams forecasts the in-house panel line could make up as much as 70% of the company’s sales in Australia. 
Williams believes there is a strong push towards “reputable” products, with concerns around problematic supply chains growing markedly in the last years. While residential is the primary focus of the 1Komma5 group, Williams noted the huge demand from commercial customers for products that meet modern slavery standards. “In a saturated market, that point of difference is critical,” he said.
It seems the company has also shifted its global strategy somewhat with the introduction of its own brand of panels. “The real news for us is that also companies that are not part of the group may apply for exclusive regional partnerships to resell both the module and our energy management system Heartbeat in combination with our CRM [customer relationship management software] and working capital tools,” Schröder said. Such an arrangement would allow the startup to grow its reach without the massive capital outlay on acquisitions.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/21/relectrify-gets-global-green-light-for-modular-battery-tech/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 21, 2023",Relectrify gets global green light for battery tech,"Relectrify is claiming a world first after the Switzerland-headquartered International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) announced the company’s 36 kW/120 kWh modular battery energy storage system has been certified as compliant with international technology standards and to specific grid connection codes.
The ReVolve battery energy storage product, which uses second-life Nissan Leaf electric vehicle (EV) battery packs, features Relectrify’s patented cell-level control technology which combines an integrated battery management system (BMS) and inverter hardware solution.
The hybrid system replaces conventional BMS and inverters with a single electronic solution that allows for control of individual cells to generate grid-compliant alternating current (AC) directly from a battery pack.
Melbourne-based Relectrify said the IEC certification marks the first time a commercial and industrial-scale energy storage product using cell-level control has been certified to the internationally recognised IEC standards.
The company said it is also the first stationary battery energy storage product using repurposed second-life EV batteries to be certified for on-grid deployment in Australia.
Relectrify co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Valentin Muenzel said the certifications prove that the company’s technology can work safely and in accordance with global technology standards, clearing the way for the company to supply the technology for grid interactive operation in the surging European and the United States (US) energy storage markets.
“We’re extremely proud to receive this strong validation that our technology is ready for wide-spread integration and global impact,” Muenzel said.
“The ReVolve demonstrates that our BMS+Inverter technology meets performance, safety, and grid compliance needs, supporting the technology’s integration in collaborative projects with leading global battery companies for residential, industrial and grid-scale applications.”

Relectrify said the combined inverter and battery management technology revolutionises battery storage, increasing the cycle life of a lithium-ion battery by as much as a third, and reducing power electronic costs by up to 30% compared to traditional battery systems.
The technology, which can be used across residential, industrial and grid storage, using either new or second-life batteries, has already been trialled in numerous technical pilot projects around the world, including with major US utility American Electric Power, Nissan North America and New Zealand-based electricity provider Counties Energy.
Counties Energy Group Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer Moonis Vegdani said the distribution network owner will now expand its roll out of Relectrify’s storage technology to assist it with the integration of distributed energy resources in a safer, less expensive, and time efficient way.
“As an early adopter of Relectrify’s BMS+Inverter technology in a pilot program for a network scale battery system, we are thrilled to see that the Relectrify team has gained certification for grid connection,” he said. “We look forward to bringing this technology to New Zealand this year.”
The IEC certification comes just weeks after Relectrify secured financial backing from a group of international heavyweights including Japanese car giant Toyota’s venture capital firm.

Spanish energy company Iberdrola is using a real dog and a robotic dog to detect faults in one of its ground-mounted PV plants.
The real dog uses its olfactory abilities to detect problems in the electrical network that could lead to power outages. It was trained by technicians from ScottishPower, Iberdrola’s subsidiary in the United Kingdom, to find the faults. The company claims it had a 100% success rate in a test conducted in December.
“Not only has it found all the problems that had been prepared, but he has also detected some that he was not expected to find,” Iberdrola said, noting that the dog saves time and eliminates unnecessary work by helping to fix faults as quickly as possible. “The training of the dog is not accidental, since it is part of a pilot project that joins other actions that the company has planned to deal with inclement weather in the country.”
In addition to the services provided by the real dog, Iberdrola is also using a robotic dog at the PV facility. The device has a built-in thermal vision system that generates thermographic reports on the status of the different PV plant components, as it walks between the panel rows following a programmed route. According to the robot developer – US-based Boston Dynamics – the big benefit of the robotic legs is that they are terrain-independent.
Iberdrola says the robotic dog is able to detect and analyze faults in substations.
“The advantages of this small technological assistant are several,” it explained. “On the one hand, it takes high-resolution photos that it compares with images taken previously, which makes it possible to detect changes in the infrastructures that escape the human eye.”
The company added that the robot can collect large amounts of data, which can help it to increase the number of inspections that are carried out every year.
Boston Dynamics sold its first robot dog in 2020 for USD 74,500 ($111,000). Thus far, it has been used by various industries for a wide range of applications. Initially, the robotic dog was used to inspect the construction of active infrastructure tunnels, according to the US manufacturer.

Sheep grazers, bee pollinators, solar-tracking hardware vendors, and solar project developers were among the diverse stakeholders represented at the inaugural US agrivoltaics conference last week in Chicago.
The choice of location for Solar Farm Summit 2023, the American heartland, was a focal point of the attendees. Recent policy initiatives promoting active agriculture projects below 10 MW in size include sheep and cow grazing and vegetable and fruit production.
The first Solar Farm Summit, which took place March 14 to 15, drew sheep grazers, seed vendors, and community solar project developers. On the first day of the conference, the summit recorded 460 attendees with printed badges. However, Solar Farm Summit Executive Producer Dan French told pv magazine USA that the real number was likely above 500.  
Most attendees expressed a mixed zeal to disbelief that the emerging solar plus farming niche was really taking off, in the form of a conference and small trade show that is, while many attendees hailed from Corn Belt to Mid-Atlantic region universities sought to learn about the various facets of solutions from energy to seed harvesting. 
Large-scale developer Silicon Ranch, based in Nashville, showed its first mover advantage in using methods of agrivoltaic solutions over the last few years on southeast to midwestern projects which range from 50 MW to 150 MW and above. The conference appeared to draw new entrants to agrivoltaics, such as EDF Renewables and Savion, which have hired agriculture professionals over recent years to branch into the nascent agrivoltaics market.  
Utility-scale sheep 
The utility solar market’s presence at the conference showed the initiative and willingness to promote sustainable farming methods and use agrivoltaics technologies like sheep grazing in large solar development. However, a caveat emerged of the dual-use nature of agrivoltaics, which combines on-site solar arrays and producing crops or livestock underneath panel arrays. As a method of creating farm and energy production from a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) perspective, agrivoltaics is best utilised from smaller distributed generation projects like community solar projects that range from about 2 MW to 10 MW on average. 
Independent power producers and project developers on projects from 100 MW to 200 MW in power capacity will spend USD 750,000 to USD 950,000 ($1.2 – $1.42 million) on average per year to mow grassy fields and hilly terrain where rows of solar panels can stretch as far as the eye can see, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.   
Using solar grazing with the deployment of up to 100 sheep on a solar project site, the use of agrivoltaic solutions would reduce the utility-scale developer’s mowing needs to two mowings per years, and reduce the cost of traditional mowing services to about USD 200,000 from the use of ewes alone, said Loran Shallenberger, director of regenerative energy operations at Silicon Ranch. 
Shallenberger told pv magazine USA that scheduled traditional mowing is still required for utility solar projects, especially as the size of such projects continues to grow above 200 MW per project. But capital costs that can range up to USD 1 million on average mowing costs for a large project can be reduced by 20% or about USD 200,000 from the use of sheep herds or other grazing livestock, he said. 
Solar grazing in its southeast region typically involves two ewes per acre, so a sample 100 MW solar project that sits on approximately 1,000 acres would require about 2,000 ewes to provide year-round grazing services, Shallenberger said.  Silicon Ranch uses ewes on just shy of half of its U.S. solar portfolio, he added.  
Various grazers and sheep herding organisations spoke throughout the two-day conference’s sessions, with various farmers showing capacity of up to a few thousand sheep available for dispatch on a variety of regional 10 MW sized projects in the Midwest, Virginia and Pennsylvania.  
J.R. Howard, owner of sheep and livestock rancher Texas Solar Sheep and donning an over-sized bucket hat, conveyed the age-old adage of “everything is bigger in Texas,” remains true even for the nascent agrivoltaics market. A previous West Texas oilfield energy foreman, Howard now says his ranching company manages a sheep count of up to 10,000 ewes, able to be deployed across a variety of solar sites across Texas. 
In partnership with lightsource BP, Howard’s business grazes up to 2,000 ewes at a 260 MW(DC) utility solar project in Lamar County, Texas. Sheep are grazed in groups of 50 on average, while in rare cases 250 to 500 head may be deployed at one time, Howard said during a Solar Rancher’s Forum panel discussion on March 15. 
At the Lightsource BP project, the sheep fleet grazes on 18 pastures across the 260 MW project year-round, with the solar panels providing shade and relief for the sheep grazing crew. The global renewable energy business partly owned by BP reduces its service costs and lowers carbon emissions from solar grazing.  
Under grazing agreements, service providers deploying sheep herds on solar sites must adhere to a 24-inch maximum vegetation height on land that is groomed by dozens of ewes, said Silicon Ranch’s Shallenberger. 
While Shallenberger and Howard agreed the use of sheep as an agrivoltaic tool for servicing large project down to rural community projects could cause a shortage of sheep over the next year, they pointed to the resilient nature of the sheep’s ecosystem, and require minimal supervision and fencing systems while grazing quadrants of large projects.  
Canines such as Border Collies are the go-to pick for solar grazing field shepherds, said Howard and Marcus Gray of Gray’s LambScaping, a regional sheep herder in Virginia. With minimal supervision required, Border Collies are typically able to direct sheep back to a paddock or central location, though occasionally Gray will attach a GPS tracking device to his dogs’ collar, if one of his shepherds is guiding a ewe in a far corner of a thousand-acre solar field and can’t be heard.  
Solar grazers said that from community projects located at Susquehanna University to utility-scale solar projects in Texas, annual insurance premiums to cover sheep herds ranges from USD 4,000 to USD 10,000 on average, said Caroline Owens from Owens Farms, a Pennsylvania herder managing a 40-head ewe count, and Lexi Hain, director of agrivoltaics and land management for lightsource BP, a former farmer from Ithaca, N.Y. Byron Komenick, owner of the first U.S. agrivoltaic project, Jack’s Solar Garden, in Longmount, Colo., said in Boulder County his firm pays upwards of USD 25,000 per year to insure his grazing operation.  
The burgeoning community solar market in New York state could command an increase in sheep husbrandy and livestock promotion as a solar operations and maintenance solution, as the Empire State currently has about 80,000 sheep, Hain said.
