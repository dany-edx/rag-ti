The acquisitions were part of its takeover of Elliot Green Power for an undisclosed amount.
The move will see Atmos Renewables take ownership of a portfolio with 302 MW of combined capacity. Each of the three solar farms have “well-advanced” co-located battery developments totalling 125 MW/250 MWhs, Atmos’ owner Igneo Infrastructure Partners said. Construction of the battery projects is slated to commence in 2022.
The takeover is expected to be officially completed by the third quarter of this year.
“This marks the fourth successful acquisition by Igneo since Atmos Renewables was established in 2020,” Igneo’s head of asset management for Australia and New Zealand, Daniel Timms, said.
Upon completion, Atmos Renewables claimed it will become the fourth-largest owner of operating renewable energy assets in Australia.
The Elliot Green Power portfolio will sit alongside assets Atmos already owns, including the Hayman and Daydream solar farms in Queensland, the Cherry Tree and Kiata wind farms in Victoria, as well as its stake in the Hornsdale wind farms in South Australia. In total, the company holds interests in seven operating wind farms and five operating solar farms with a total capacity of 865 MW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/27/180-mw-solar-farm-and-possible-battery-unveiled-for-queenslands-western-downs/,"UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 27, 2022",180 MW solar farm and possible battery unveiled for Queensland’s Western Downs,"Brisbane-based Renewable Energy Partners (REP) has announced its Warrego project, which it says will involve a 180 MW solar farm to potentially be colocated with a 50 MW/200 MWh big battery.
It expects construction to commence in the first quarter of 2024, though it is unclear how developed the plans are in terms of approvals. 
It is the fourth renewable energy project REP has originated in the Western Downs region, west of Brisbane. The company adds the Warrego project to its 500 MW Wambo Wind Farm being co-developed with Cubico Sustainable Investments, the 250 MW Hopeland Solar Farm and the 150 MW/300 MWh Ulinda Park battery energy storage system (BESS). 
“With the fantastic sunshine, strong grid and great support from both the Queensland government and the Western Downs Council, we are excited to deliver yet another renewable energy project in [the Australian Energy Market Operator’s] Darling Downs [Renewable Energy Zone] 6,” CEO of REP, Luke McDonald, said.
“With the growing demand for clean energy to fuel the Queensland government’s stated ambition of developing large scale hydrogen hubs, we see Warrego being uniquely suited to support this ambition,” he added.
Earlier this month, the company also announced the development of a massive 900 MW wind project north of Mackay in Queensland.
REP expects the Warrego project will create over 200 jobs during construction.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/27/more-than-half-of-aussie-solar-installers-offering-storage-handful-of-big-names-continue-to-dominate/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,EV,HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 27, 2022",Over half of Australian solar installers move into storage as top industry brands named,"German-based research company EUPD Research has released new findings from its annual survey of Australian solar installers inquiring into which brands of modules, inverters and storage are preferred and how companies are diversifying their offerings.
The 2021 survey saw EUPD Research speak to 200 companies here, with its research supported by Australian analyst SunWiz. The data supports claims from industry about its changing direction driven by growing saturation.
In the two years from 2019 to 2021, EUPD Research and SunWiz found Australia’s solar capacity expanded at a compound annual growth rate of 26.7%. The residential segment accounted for most of this growth, with the utility-scale sector a close second while commercial and industrial lagged. 
EUPD Research
Notably, the last year saw a significant jump in the number of companies offering storage solutions, growing from 41% in 2020 to 54% in 2021. Moreover, a further 30% of companies said they planned to include storage solutions in their portfolio by the end of 2022.
The remaining 16% of the sample group currently neither offer energy storage, nor are planning to do so in the foreseeable future. The primary reason given for that reluctance was economic, with companies saying storage prices remain too hight and, as a result, margins too low. A lack of expertise and the consequent high demand for training was also a leading factor.
These numbers confirm what Kosta Bourandanis, sales manager at wholesale distributor Supply Partners and co-founder of industry group Solar Cutters, recently told pv magazine about the saturation of the solar market in the country. 
For him, self-consumption is today the primary selling point for most solar systems, with feed-in tariffs no longer a drawcard. 
This is hardly surprising given SunWiz estimated Australia’s cumulative installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2021 was 26.9 GW. For reference, the National Electricity Market’s demand since 2020 has sat at just over 30 GW, leaving very little room for other generation types during daylight hours. 
Australian Energy Regulator (AER)
Bourandanis said he is increasingly hearing of solar companies diversifying into electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries as a means of ensuring customers can get the most out of their solar, since exporting back to the grid holds little promise.
While EUPD Research’s ‘Market Briefing Australia’ presentation did not speak at length on EVs, presenter Saif Islam noted 12% of Australian companies are already offering “electric mobility solutions” with a further 33% planning to add this technology to their portfolio of offerings in 2022.
In Australia, one third (35%) of installation companies accounted for 89% of all of Australia’s installed PV capacity in 2021.
The remaining 65% of ‘low volume’ solar companies accounted for just 11% of installations. 
For Platinum Solar Designs’ general manager Scott Mason, this signals at a larger issue in the industry. Mason told pv magazine Australia monopolisation is a growing problem and is exacerbated by the current governance structure.
He believes the current rules around installer accreditation have created a landscape where a handful of big companies aggressively market low priced system, poaching accredited installers from smaller companies by contracting them as sole traders. This, he says, limits the number of installs smaller boutique companies can make and lowers the overall quality of installs.
The vast majority of solar companies, 88%, procure their equipment from wholesalers, with just  7% purchasing directly from manufacturers. This, Islam noted, made Australia a “very interesting” space for wholesalers.
Australia’s most popular wholesaler among those surveyed in 2021 was MM Electrical, which took almost a quarter of the market at 24.7%. It is worth noting that all the subsidiary trading companies including Haymans Electrical, TLE Electrical, AWM Electrical and D&W Electrical were included under the umbrella of MM Electrical.
Tradezone and One Stop Warehouse came in second and third, taking a 20.4% and 19.9% stake in the market each.
EUPD Research also looked at brand awareness in among installs for solar modules, inverters and storage systems, asking installers which manufacturers they could name directly off the top of their heads.

For solar modules, the resounding winner for brand awareness was Jinko Solar. The Chinese manufacturer was named by 64% of respondents.
In second place was Trina Solar with 47% of respondents listing the brand unaided. 
LG was the third most listed brand, an indication of why the industry was so dumbstruck at the news in February that the Korean brand would be exiting the solar module market.
Canadian Solar grew its brand awareness considerably in 2021, taking out fourth position.
Unsurprisingly, there was much crossover between the most recognisable and most widely stocked brands in solar, with Jinko converting its visibility to a leading position in many installers product portfolios.
Jinko modules featured in 35% of surveyed installer portfolios, with 23% of those companies offering Jinko products exclusively. 
Trina was a close second, offered by 32% of installers while Canadian Solar featured in 21.6% of portfolios.
Sunwiz
Fronius continued its dominance in the inverter space and was “by far” the most listed brand name, with 84% of respondents referring to the Austrian company. Its inverters were stocked by 57% of surveyed installers.

In terms of brand awareness, SMA, Sungrow and SolarEdge were all mentioned by around 45% of installers. 
SolarEdge was stocked by 34.8%, Sungrow by 24.5%, Enphase by 20.6% and SMA by 20%.
In terms of brand awareness, LG (including LG Chem and LG Energy Solution) was actually the most frequently named manufacturer, with 56% of installers pointing to the manufacturer while slightly less, 54%, referred to Tesla by name.
BYD was a distant third in brand awareness, named by 26% of respondents.
Coming to distribution, LG solutions were offered by 43.1% of the installers who have expanded into the storage market. 40.4% offered Tesla, while 18.3% offered BYD solutions and 17.4% offered Alpha-ESS.
The vast majority of installs (76%) were new systems, 18% retrofits while 6% of installers did not answer.
In terms of installed capacity, 83% were below 15 KWh and just 12% were more than 15 KWh. The final 5% was unknown.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/04/27/full-extent-of-sun-cable-megaproject-revealed/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SINGAPORE",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 27, 2022",Full extent of Sun Cable megaproject revealed ,"Singapore-based Sun Cable, the company planning on building the world’s biggest solar and battery energy storage project in the Northern Territory (NT) and exporting it to Singapore, has lodged an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Summary revealing the full extent of its enormity.
According to the EIS, the $30 billion-plus Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPL), which already has financial support from Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, is set to generate its renewable energy via a 17-20 GW solar farm with 36-42 GWh of battery energy storage called the Powell Creek Solar Precinct, occupying 12,000 hectares in the NT’s Barkly region.

The Maverick prefabricated and pre-wired system, designed by Sydney manufacturer 5B, has been named as the preferred solar technology supplier for the AAPL project. Arrays will be arranged in blocks of approximately 23-28 MW DC peak capacity and tied into about 60 MWh of storage.
From the Powell Creek site, an 800 km 6.4 GW overhead transmission line will carry the solar energy to the Darwin Converter Site at Murrumujuk, where approximately 800 MW of it will be supplied to Darwin and for private industry offtake. The rest will push on to Cable Transition Facilities at Gunn Point Beach where up to six 4,200 km subsea cable system laid parallel will transmit the energy to Singapore.

The document presents the project’s key benefits as being the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 480 million tonnes over the project’s 70-year lifespan (equivalent to the average electricity used by more than 2.5 million Australian homes annually, and saving 10% of the NT’s greenhouse gas emissions). 
Moreover, the megaproject will create 1,750 construction jobs in the NT as well as 350 long-term operational jobs. 
Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin told the ABC: “The lodgement of the EIS to the NT [Environment Protection Authority] is a significant milestone for the AAPowerLink.”

Of course, no megaproject is without potentially negative environmental impacts. The EIS report identified impacts on vulnerable plant species including Darwin Cycads and Typhonium pratermissum at the Converter site. 
According to the ABC, the project’s proponents said it was unlikely to affect fauna, such as the Greater Bilby, the Yellow-spotted Monitor and eight threatened species of migratory shorebirds. Nor are the cables said to have impacts of extra noise and electromagnetic fields on turtles, dugongs, pygmy blue whales and whale sharks. 
United States-based engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) giant Bechtel, North American transmission specialist Hatch, professional services firms Marsh and PwC Australia, and Australia-headquartered engineering outfit SMEC, a member of the Singapore-based Surbana Jurong Group, have been listed as members of the project delivery team.
The AAPowerLink is the latest in a long line of renewable energy projects SMEC has worked on in Australia. The company said it has been directly involved in the development of more than 6.4 GW worth of utility-scale solar farms in Australia, including Risen Energy’s 100 MW Yarranlea Solar Farm in Queensland and the massive 720 MW New England Solar Farm being developed in New South Wales by UPC/AC Renewables Australia.
SMEC is also involved in Project EnergyConnect, a 900km proposed electricity interconnector being delivered by network operators TransGrid and ElectraNet and the $4.6 billion Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project, which when complete will provide 2 GW of dispatchable, on-demand renewable power and approximately 350 GWh of large-scale energy storage to the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Sun Cable believes the project will have the capacity to supply 15% of Singapore’s energy requirements. The financial close of the project is expected in late 2023, with construction beginning as early as 2024. An Indigenous Land Use Agreement is under negotiation with the native title holders through the Northern Land Council. 
The EIS is open for public submissions until July 15.

Japanese EPC contractor Shizen Energy announced that its Malaysian unit, Shizen Malaysia Sdn Bhd., has joined the Nusa Baiduri Consortium, which is planning to build a 150 MW floating solar power plant at the Durian Tunggal Dam in Melaka, a state in Malaysia located in the southern region of the Malay Peninsula.
Shizen Malaysia will conduct the feasibility study for the project and will cooperate directly with the consortium’s largest shareholder, Malaysian real estate manager Nusa Baiduri Sdn Bhd. “A feasibility study of floating solar equipment will be conducted from March 15, 2022, for a maximum duration of 12 months, and following a favourable result, the floating solar facility of 150 MW will be constructed in a sequence of Phase 1 and later Phase 2,” Shizen said in a statement.
The facility will sell power under unspecified conditions to the local utility Syarikat Air Melaka Bhd (SAMB).
“Should the feasibility study yield positive results, the completion of the 150 MW floating solar project would mean Malaysia having one of the first and largest floating solar plant in Southeast Asia. This is an initiative to support the state government towards green technology, and zero carbon by 2030,” said SAMB CEO Abdu Rashid Abdul Rahman. “Floating solar is an exciting opportunity and we can clearly see the benefits of our contribution to the water utility sector across Malaysia,” said Shizen Malaysia CEO Alvin Koh. As such, the company will continue to focus on materialising these projects, he added.
Shizen Malaysia has developed renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 200 MW in Malaysia to date. The country’s largest floating PV plant is a 13 MW array deployed in the state of Selangor on the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The plant is selling power to local utility TNB under a 21-year PPA. The project’s levelised cost of energy is MYR 0.21608 ($0.051).

With renewables developers Quantum Power Asia and Ib Vogt having recently announced plans to invest $5 billion into a 3.5 GW/12 GWh solar-plus-storage project in Indonesia, the governor of the nation’s Riau Islands has signed up for more utility scale solar generation and energy storage capacity.
Singaporean clean energy company Sunseap on Tuesday announced it had signed a deal with Riau governor Ansar Ahmad to develop an unspecified volume of “large-scale solar and storage” across the Riau Islands and is already considering 1.38 GWp of solar and 3 GWh of storage on the island of Combol, and 1.62 GWh of solar plus 3.5 GWh of storage on Citlim.
Sunseap’s largest shareholder is European utility Energías de Portugal, whose own largest investor is state-owned power company China Three Gorges.
The recent project announced by Singaporean developer Quantum and its German peer aims to export all the projected 4 TWh of solar electricity to be generated to the city state, to help meet 8% of its electricity demand.
By contrast, Sunseap says its facilities will provide clean power to Indonesia as well as Singapore, without specifying volumes.
Sunseap has already signed a deal with government entity Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority to invest $2 billion in a floating solar and storage project on the Duriangkang reservoir on the Riau island of Batam.
In January last year, state-owned Emirati developer Masdar signed an agreement with Singaporean peer Tuas Power, French energy company EDF, and Indonesian state-owned utility PT Indonesia Power to explore the development of 1.2 GW of solar generation capacity, with the potential for energy storage, on Indonesian territory, also for export to Singapore.
