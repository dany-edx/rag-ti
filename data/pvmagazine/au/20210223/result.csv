In other words, competition can drive down quality as much as it can prices.
“A lot of the problems we’re seeing are cheap products, cheaply installed. This leads to very poor results for everyone,” Fisk told pv magazine Australia.
“Over time, these systems start degrading or failing, leaving many consumers with no recourse or remedy as often the installers have long since left the market.”
The easy come, easy go solar landscape, which Fisk believes is also a product of hyper competition, continues to plague the industry, even as it matures. “To a large degree, it’s as much of an issue now as it ever has been.”
“The cost of entry of setting up a solar company is negligible. Put up a good website, claim to be Australia’s leading solar installer with years of experience and there’s no recourse around that.
“If we go back a handful of years, Australia’s largest solar installer is no longer trading and we’ve seen this happen three or four times over the last six or seven years. And generally the largest installer in Australia is the one that sells systems at the cheapest possible price, or at least advertises the cheapest possible price.”
In their wake, these companies leave ordinary Australians to pay the price for cost-and-corner cuttingly cheap solar.
The solar industry’s notoriously difficult-to-collect warranties also play into this issue. While most modules come with generous warranties, actually cashing those in when something goes wrong ranges from extremely difficult to straight up impossible, especially if the retailer the customer used are no longer in the game.
While Australians disgruntled with their PV systems make up about 20% of the enquiries Solaray receives, Fisk says there’s little the company can do apart from ripping out the old system. “If the system is of poor quality or has been installed cheaply in the first place, trying to fix it is often just pouring good money after bad,” Fisk said.
With rooftop solar setting new records in Australia, Fisks suspects the trend is only going to worsen in time.
“This has been building over a number of years, but today it is more prevalent than it has been because the number of solar systems that have gone in over the last five years is infinitely higher than it was the previous five years.”
As for how widespread Fisk’s experience is, the Solaray director couldn’t definitively say. “I can’t speak for other people, but among my colleagues it seems very common.”
The remedy? Fisk says its as simple properly designed and installed systems, and the increased use of Module-level power electronics (MLPE) products. “Those will last 30 years and we don’t end up with a whole bunch of landfill.”

The company has pledged to have its operations 100% powered by renewable energy in Australia and New Zealand by 2025, with plans to achieve Scope 1 & 2 net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, meaning it will have net-zero emissions from company-owned and controlled resources as well as net-zero indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy.
Coca-Cola Amatil’s Group Head of Sustainability, Mary Ann van Bodegraven, says the company plans to do so with a range of measures.
“To help us achieve our 100% renewable electricity goal in Australia we will need to look at all options, including expanding our use of on-site solar, further wind or solar PPAs, as well as smaller GreenPower contracts – and of course the best way to reduce our emissions and costs is to focus on energy efficiency – so we will continue implementing more efficient equipment, lighting, and HVAC in our facilities.  In New Zealand we are already purchasing electricity generated from renewable sources,” she told pv magazine Australia.

With the announcement, Coca-Cola Amatil joins a growing list of Australian corporations committing to switch to 100% renewables, which already includes Woolworths, Telstra, Bunnings, Officeworks, Aldi and more.
Greenpeace, which have been pressuring Coca-Cola Amatil and other corporates to switch to renewable energy through its Australian REenergise campaign, as well as its global RE100 push, applauded the move.
“Greenpeace is the last organisation you’d expect to find cheering on an announcement from Coca-Cola Amatil. But in this instance we think they’re doing the right thing,” REenergise Campaign Director Lindsay Soutar said.
“Coca-Cola Amatil is one of Australia’s major energy users. Coke committing to 100% renewable electricity will reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and put pressure on other major businesses to make the switch.”
Greenpeace’s tactic of pressuring corporates to switch to renewables has proven fruitful. So far, cumulative clean energy commitments from Australia corporations have driven around 2.8 GW of demand for renewable energy projects. The retail industry is leading the corporate race with almost double the clean energy commitments of the next best performing industry, which was telecommunications.
Greenpeace
Despite the surge in commitments from both private companies and State and Local Governments in the last 12 months, Australia’s Federal Government continues to drag its feet.
“As our Federal leaders dither over an inadequate net-zero by 2050 emissions reduction target, they’re being out-run by Australian businesses who are rapidly transitioning to renewable energy, and setting net zero goals for ten years earlier. When even Coca-Cola’s doing more for the environment than our government is, it shows it’s time for Australia to up its climate ambition,” Soutar said.
Soutar added that while the Greenpeace Australia Pacific welcomes the company’s renewable energy announcement, it’s not letting Coca-Cola off the hook on other environmental issues.
“While this is a welcome step, Coca-Cola Amatil still has a lot of work to do on its environmental impact, such as banning single use plastic drink bottles, one of the biggest contributors to harmful plastic pollution ” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/23/wa-deploys-stand-alone-power-systems-at-properties-affected-by-perth-hills-bushfire/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MICROGRID,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",WA deploys stand-alone power systems at properties affected by Perth Hills bushfire,"Previously only used in regional and remote locations, Western Australia has now brought stand-alone systems, which include a solar array, battery and back-up generator, into the metropolis. The deployment is part of a major electricity network rebuild in areas affected by the Wooroloo bushfire, with crews working overtime to restore power to 220 properties.
Metropolitan as they may be, the two Perth Hills properties where the SAPS units, also known as SPS units, have been deployed are located on challenging terrain. Mutually beneficial, deploying the off-grid system removes the need for Western Power to repair over 2 kilometres of poles and wires connecting the properties, while improving power reliability and quality for the landowners.
“The bushfire was devastating for people in these areas and decimated much of the network assets out there with around 579 poles, 47 transformers and 56 underground assets damaged or destroyed,” Western Power CEO Ed Kalajzic said in a statement.
“We had a good look at where we could use technology and alternative solutions to replace these assets to improve both power supply and operational efficiencies for the benefit of the community.”
Stand-alone power systems have become somewhat of a darling in the state. Just last week, the state government announced it will rollout another 1000 SAPS if re-elected in March. The systems are a natural fit for the state, which is vast but sparsely populated. The units reduce the need for traditional poles and wires to cover expanses, and simultaneously offer customers more reliable and greener power.
“During the last five years we’ve made significant progress to transform the grid using innovative technology and incorporating renewable energy, so we wanted to use this where we can for those affected,” Kalajzic said.
Over the last few years, the state has facilitated the roll out of hundreds of stand-alone systems in rural properties. The state-owned energy supplier Horizon Power, alongside Western Power, have already transitioned properties throughout the Mid West, Goldfields, eastern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions. It calculates that even with servicing the systems throughout their expected life cycle, the utility will save $6 million dollars on not having to refurbish the network to ensure reliability of supply to those properties.
Now WA is embracing the solution not only overcome distance, but also fire damage – something the Climate Council pushed for following the Black Summer fires in 2020.
Today, over 200 Western Australian households still remain without power due to damage caused by the Wooroloo Perth Hills bushfire, which burned for a week and destroyed over 85 houses between February 1st and 8th. In response, Western Power have set up a temporary depot in the area, supported by local businesses.
“This has been one of the largest rebuilds we’ve ever undertaken and we‘ve had around 270 employees and 200 light, heavy and support vehicles on the ground every day for the past two weeks,” Kalajzic said.
“We expect to complete the restoration by the end of February and will continue to work as quickly and safely as possible.”
“It’s been a fantastic collaborative effort and we’re proud to work alongside the Department of Fire and Emergency Services and other emergency and support services, to support the community during the bushfire and moving forward.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/23/unsw-flicks-the-switch-on-100-renewable-electricity/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",UNSW flicks the switch on 100% renewable electricity,"From Inside UNSW. 
In 2018, President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Jacobs announced that UNSW Sydney would achieve net zero emissions from energy use by 2020. In November, the University made this vision a reality when the Sunraysia Solar farm started exporting electricity to the grid. The solar farm supplies UNSW’s energy through an innovative solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). In addition to renewable electricity, UNSW purchases additional carbon units to offset emissions from natural gas and other fuels.
This landmark will see the University save 1.25 million tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the 15-year term of the PPA.
“This is the next step on the journey UNSW has taken over recent years to help in addressing the climate crisis, both as a world-class academic institution and as an organisation with a significant carbon footprint. Switching to provision of our entire on-campus electricity supply through solar renewable energy is a landmark step for UNSW,” said Professor Jacobs.
“It is fitting in the context of UNSW’s long history of pioneering work in the development of solar photovoltaic technology, which has just been recognised by the award of the Japan Prize to Scientia Professor Martin Green,” he said.
Tackling climate change is a key focus in UNSW’s 2025 Strategy and Environmental Sustainability Plan 2019-21. The move follows a UNSW announcement in 2020 that it would divest of all fossil fuel company investments by 2025.
Jeff Peers, UNSW Chief Technology and Infrastructure Officer, said that switching to renewable energy is a major step in the University’s response to climate change.
“Through the solar farm we are switching to 100% renewable electricity, by retiring Large-scale Generating Certificates received under the PPA equivalent to our total electricity consumption. In addition to energy efficiency and onsite solar initiatives, we purchase additional carbon credits to offset our remaining emissions from gas and other fuels,” Mr Peers said.
UNSW has spearheaded research into solar PV technology
UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) was particularly eager to see the farm go live: it is their PV technology which is now used to light up and power their offices and the rest of the University.

The hundreds of rows of perfectly spaced, blue solar panels now cut a striking image against the flat dry yellow grass of the outback. This is a vision UNSW researchers had decades ago in the 1980s.
UNSW researchers in SPREE, led by Scientia Professor Martin Green, pioneered the world’s first 19% and 20% efficiency solar cells in 1983 and 1985 respectively, eventually taking efficiency to 25%.
Forty years later, their dream of using solar power to provide affordable and reliable electricity is a reality.
“The research was commercialised in the 1990s in China by UNSW researchers, which later allowed solar panels to become affordable at scale,” said SPREE Head, Professor Alistair Sproul.
In 2001, Scientia Professor Martin Green and the late Professor Stuart Wenham helped the team of UNSW Sydney graduates – Zhengrong Shi, Ted Szpitalak, Fengming Zhang, Huaijin Yang, and Chengrong Xu – to set up the first commercial solar cell company in China: Suntech Power.
The team then founded another solar panel manufacturer, China Sunergy, with further recruits from SPREE, with the process repeated for JA Solar and Sunrise Global.
The industry grows through the global financial crisis

In the largest technology float of 2005, Suntech sold shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2004 and raised $396.5 million.
By 2008, nine Chinese photovoltaic companies were listed on the NYSE, six with Chief Technical Officers from UNSW’s pioneering team.
“America financed these solar companies, all set up in China, through the NYSE and NASDAQ,” Professor Green said. “With total investment of $10 billion in cell shipments, we went from 60 megawatts in 2005 to 11,000 megawatts in 2011.”
Suntech grew to become the world’s largest manufacturer in 2010 with JA Solar in second place. Both companies are founded by UNSW Sydney alumni.
Solar cells become cheap enough to farm sunshine at scale
In 2016, UNSW President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Jacobs went out to the arid, sun-drenched landscape to see one of UNSW’s remote field stations in north-western New South Wales.
This bleak landscape held the potential for an entirely solar-powered UNSW.
UNSW Vice-President of Operations Andrew Walters and UNSW’s Energy Manager Nicholas Jones researched the market and developed a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Chinese-Australian developer Maoneng and Origin Energy.
“With the 15-year PPA, UNSW Sydney will utilise up to 52-megawatts of electrical power from Sunraysia Solar Farm to generate 125 gigawatt hours a year,” Mr Jones said.
“In round terms that means we’ll save about 85,000 tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Over the 15-year life of the PPA, UNSW is on target to save 1.25 million tonnes of carbon emissions. With all energy coming from the power of the sun, solar power is the cleanest form of energy we can use.”
UNSW to draw on 25 per cent of solar farm’s total output

The 1000 ha Sunraysia Solar Farm in Balranald south-west NSW is owned by John Laing and Maoneng, and is one of the largest in the world. Construction finished in late 2019 and it was connected to the electricity grid in November 2020.
The 755,000 ground-mounted solar panels now track the sun’s rays and generates up to 65 megawatts of solar energy. However, it will ramp up to 200 megawatts – its maximum power output – once the network commissioning process is completed.
This means that over a year the farm will generate enough electricity to power 50,000 homes, the equivalent of 12 suburbs.
UNSW uses just a quarter of the farm’s capacity to meet 100% of its electricity needs, reducing its energy-related carbon emissions to net zero.
A tribute to UNSW’s Professor Green and his team of researchers

The PPA specified that the UNSW-dedicated section of Sunraysia Solar Farm, Block 13, comprised the UNSW-developed Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) solar technology.
“When they were building the farm, it’s likely that there was a module which was cheaper. But now, PERC really is the cheapest to make,” Professor Sproul said.
“I feel really proud of the global impact we have been able to have on the solar panel industry with our research,” Professor Green said.
“Not only have my former students set up the companies that have now made solar the cheapest source of electricity, but our PERC cell now accounts for 80% of worldwide manufacturing capacity, with this still increasing.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/23/pv-can-cover-almost-half-of-typical-office-buildings-electricity-demand/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,MARKETS & POLICY,GERMANY,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 23, 2021",PV can cover almost half of typical office buildings’ electricity demand,"From pv magazine Germany
How much of the electricity needs of an office building can be met with a photovoltaic system installed on-site? A group of researchers at the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW), in Germany, is now seeking to give an answer to this question by using its own data, coming from a PV facade and a rooftop array based on CIGS module that are installed on its building in Stuttgart.
The scientists transferred the yield data into a model and found that the electricity from the roof and facade modules can cover almost 40% of the total requirements of a standard office building, assuming that no battery storage is installed.
The researchers based their modelling on a typical five-floor administrative building. Assuming that a quarter of the entire facade and 30% of the roof area are covered with photovoltaics, the PV system should have an installed power of 131 kW and generate around 115,000 kWh of electricity per year.
“The facades alone provided 29% of the electricity consumed over a period of one year,” explained Dieter Geyer, project manager at ZSW. Around 80% of the generated solar power could be used for this purpose, the rest of the system can be fed into the power grid. “The combination of photovoltaics on the facade and on the roof even increased the self-sufficiency share to 39%,” says Geyer, adding that about 58% of the produced solar power can be used locally.
Photovoltaic facades provide a lot of electricity in winter
The high self-consumption rate is possible without battery storage. “This is due to the fact that office buildings mainly need electricity during the day, so a good part of the solar power generated can be used immediately throughout the day,” said Geyer. In addition, with a suitable orientation, solar facades generate electricity primarily in the morning and evening hours, whereas the roof systems primarily generate electricity at midday. There is a permanently high supply of solar power in the consumption-intensive period between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
According to the ZSW, roof and facade systems also go well with each other across the seasons: while the highest performance values for the roof system occur, as expected, in the summer months, the photovoltaic facade ideally complements the annual generation profile, with its highest output during the winter months. Facade systems make better use of the low sun in winter than roof systems, due to their vertical alignment.
In addition to generating electricity, photovoltaic facades offer other advantages, according to the ZSW. They protect them from wind and weather, provide shade, reduce heat losses and replace conventional components. Last but not least, according to the German scientists, they have a sound-insulating effect.
