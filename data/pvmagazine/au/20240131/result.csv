With grid instability comes the potential for blackouts and I expect many families and businesses have already suffered in darkness.
Last summer Western Australia (WA) experienced 49 consecutive days without rainfall. The Bureau of Meteorology said the longest dry spell of similar length was more than a decade ago in 2010. This summer was WA’s third driest on record (since 1876) with mean max temperatures generally above average.
The challenge we have now in Australia, is time is against us: we need solutions quickly to stem grid instability, and the need for rolling blackouts to manage demand.
We’re part way there but we are scrambling to fully transition to a clean energy solution. According to the International Energy Agency, Australia installed the most solar panels per capita of any country in the world in 2022, followed by the Netherlands and Germany. In WA, solar accounts for 21% of power generated for our grid, ranking us second to South Australia amongst the states. It’s something we can be proud of, but solar panels only do half the job and solar power pushed onto the grid is difficult to control. Additionally, only about 7% of solar installations include a battery.
So, what does that really mean for us and the future of our powering our homes, not just in WA but across Australia? We’re clearly great at installing solar panels, aided somewhat by the then incentive of feed-in tariffs, but now we have an audience conditioned to only putting solar panels on their roof. People think they have done everything they can to control energy costs and be part of the renewable energy transition.
Our research indicates people are generally unaware of the benefits of complementing solar panels with a battery system. Like the feed-in tariffs that transformed Australia into a solar panel powerhouse, we need a similar incentive to encourage households to install home battery systems. Because now it’s bigger than just installing a battery system into your home.
That single home battery system when integrated into a Virtual Power Plant (VPP), has the potential to revolutionise our future power grid demand. The VPP introduces flexibility, efficiency, and resilience into the energy ecosystem. It transforms the traditional model of centralised energy generation and distribution, paving the way for a more sustainable and adaptive power grid.

A VPP is a collection of associated individual, independent household solar and battery systems, known as distributed energy resources (DER), that are united remotely to form a VPP. The Plico VPP uses cutting-edge technology including Amp X which provides its proprietary VPP digital energy platform to enable monitoring, control and optimised dispatch of Plico’s systems.
VPPs can be managed to bring the grid back into balance under both minimum demand and peak demand scenarios. When there is minimum demand, energy supply to the grid is high and energy demand on the grid is low. This can occur in the middle of mild sunny days when solar exports to the grid are high but there is low demand from homes, business and industry. Peak demand is when the opposite occurs; energy supply to the grid is low and demand is high. This usually occurs on hot summer evenings when energy demand increases just as solar exports start to decrease.
When the VPP is activated in a peak demand scenario, Plico assumes control of the customer’s battery remotely, and set it to store and conserve energy during the day. This enables the systems to export energy back to the grid later when it was most needed between 5.30pm and 7.30pm.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identified a potential reserve shortfall of 326 MW in WA’s main power system over summer and sought additional capacity from energy providers, like Plico, to cover this shortfall.
We shouldn’t call it’s a ‘virtual’ power plant – that is misleading. It’s real, it’s a success, and it’s the way of the future in transitioning away from fossil fuels.
This is the second summer Plico’s VPP has been on peak demand standby, with the first successful activations occurring in January and February 2023. In 2024, it’s been activated again and this time for an unprecedented three consecutive days from 14-16 January by AEMO, and we provided additional MW capacity to the grid through our more than 1,900 customer’s solar and battery systems.
Nine MW of power storage capacity was dispatched each day, and we estimate the additional power we sent to the grid saved 2,000 households (equivalent to the number of dwellings in the suburb of Mount Claremont, WA) from a potential blackout. That’s 6,000 homes saved in total, across the three days.
Without a doubt, this is one of the most significant contributions ever made by a residential VPP aggregator (outside of trials) to the energy market across Australia.
This is also great news for all levels of government. As the infrastructure already exists, we don’t have to invest millions into new hardware or infrastructure. It’s also flexible to be able to be activated with minimal notice.
But we need to do better. Instead of 1,900 customer solar and battery systems, it could be 1.9 million systems. Imagine if we had this amount in every state across Australia, and we could connect and switch them on when we needed them the most. To stabilise not just the grid, but the cost of energy in the future.
The only way we will get there with speed is more government support. While Australia leads the race on solar panels, we could also win in the expansion of batteries and the use of widespread VPPs.
The good news is now that we have proven it works, the race to broaden the virtual power plant is on, and it’s a race we will all benefit from, particularly if you have a solar and battery system. We’ve even worked out how to retrofit or pair a battery with a household’s existing solar.
We have all the ingredients, we are one of the sunniest localities, you can install batteries without big upfront costs, and we have some of the best battery technology in the world. Now we need a home solar and battery revolution to really power towards net zero.

Genex said the agreement will lead to terms being agreed later in the year for a full form engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the project being developed about 150 kilometres southwest of Toowoomba in Queensland’s Western Downs region.
“At up to 775 MW, the Bulli Creek Solar Farm is expected to be the largest solar farm connected to the National Electricity Market which makes the selection of our construction contractor critical and an important development milestone,” Genex CEO Craig Francis said.
“PCL is a globally reputable EPC contractor in the large-scale solar industry, having installed a total of 3,044 MWdc globally and 474 MWdc in Australia, with another 631 MWdc capacity currently in construction in Australia.”
“During the tender process, we were particularly impressed with PCL’s on-the-ground capability in Australia and their impressive safety record.”
Genex and its partner J-Power, which bought the Bulli Creek solar and battery project in 2022 from co-developer Solar Choice, are working towards a final investment decision on the project by the second half of 2024.
The development rights for Bulli Creek extend to 2 GW of capacity, with the project’s planning, environmental and heritage approvals already secured. The original plan was to prioritise the delivery of a standalone battery energy storage system, but the initial stage of the project will now comprise up to 775 MW of solar capacity after Genex landed a long-term off-take deal with Fortescue to supply its proposed hydrogen operations at Gibson Island.
The agreement with Fortescue, announced in late 2023, is for 337.5 MW over a 25-year timeline.
Genex said the agreement with Fortescue would provide about 75% of the contracted revenue stream to support the first stage of Bulli Creek, and it was in talks with other parties about offtake deals that “may allow the initial capacity of the project to be increased up to 775 MW.”

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/31/market-analyst-calls-for-change-as-solar-farm-development-slows/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-01-31,Market analyst calls for change as solar farm development slows,"A new report from solar and storage market analyst SunWiz reveals that residential PV remains the mainstay of the Australian solar success story with rooftop systems representing a combined 68% of the total solar power installed nationwide.
According to the latest Annual SunWiz Australian PV Report, 2.5 GW of residential solar power was installed in 2023, along with 0.9 GW of commercial rooftop systems – just 4% and 0.2% respectively down on the record levels rolled out in 2021. The STC commercial market grew by 25% in 2023 while the residential market climbed by 11%.
But while rooftop solar installations reached near record levels in 2023, it wasn’t enough to make up for a downturn in new large-scale solar coming online with Australia’s PV industry posting an overall annual contraction for the first time since 2013.
The amount of new solar power installed in Australia in 2023 was 4.6 GW in total, down on the 5.6 GW installed in 2022 and the lowest level since 2019.
SunWiz said 10 new solar farms totalling 1.1 GW came online in 2023, a 60% reduction on the 2.9 GW that started producing energy in 2022, and the worst year for solar farms since before their rollout began in earnest in 2018.
Queensland had the most solar farms energised in 2023 with four projects coming online in 2023, while NSW had two new solar farms start producing energy.
SunWiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston said while the figures are no surprise – the 2.2 GW under construction in January 2023 was less than half the 4.9 GW being built in January 2022 – they underline the need to rebuild momentum in the solar farm development pipeline.
Johnston said a “decade of inaction and blocking by the previous federal government,” combined with grid congestion and grid connection challenges have resulted in reduced construction activity.
“While we expect continued growth in rooftop PV deployment, the number of solar farms likely to come online in 2024 looks set to further contract,” he said.
“This demonstrates the need for federal and state governments to implement policy changes that accelerate the development and construction of solar farms, while swiftly acting to support the rollout of commercial solar power and home energy storage systems.”
Johnston said he expects all market segments to grow in 2024 but cautioned that the development pipeline of new solar farms remains sluggish.

The amount of large-scale solar under construction has increased marginally to 2.6 GW but there is little change in the volumes of committed projects, and a decreasing number of projects progressing through the various project development hurdles and obtaining the necessary approvals.
“Instead we see a growing volume of proposed projects, plus a leap in the volume of projects that have been shelved,” Johnston said, noting that Australia needs the low-cost bulk energy provided by solar farms to achieve its renewable energy targets.
Australia currently has 16 solar farms larger than 10 MW under construction that total 2.56 GW. Most of this capacity is in NSW. This is a modest increase on the amount under construction at the start of 2022 when work had started on 15 projects totalling 2.2 GW.
Australia’s cumulative total deployment of solar power has now climbed to 36.7 GW. Residential systems comprise more than 19 GW, or 52%, of this overall total.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/31/edp-snaps-up-local-developer-as-it-targets-australian-market/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,2024-01-31,EDP snaps up 1.5 GW portfolio in Australian market move,"EDP Renewables (EDPR), the clean energy arm of Portuguese utility EDP, has acquired ITP Development for an unspecified sum as part of its broader strategy to capitalise on Australia’s renewable energy targets.
EDPR said the transaction delivers more than 1.5 GW of renewables capacity, with ITP Development holding a pipeline of wind and solar projects at various stages of development. The projects, mostly located in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland, also include options to co-locate battery energy storage systems.
ITP Development has primarily focused on sub-5 MW solar projects but the portfolio absorbed by EDPR also includes a 480 MWp PV and 200 MW battery project in Queensland that is at an “advanced stage” of development. EDPR said the facility is expected to enter into operation by 2026.
The company said its acquisition of ITP Development allows it to expand its Asia Pacific presence and tap into Australia’s substantial growth prospects in renewable energy.
The Australian government has set a target of 82% use of renewable energy across the power system by 2030 – an ambition that seeks to boost renewable energy generation and storage capacity by 32 GW by the end of the decade.
“Australia is one of the markets with higher potential in the region,” EDPR said, adding that it is also “one of the most advanced countries in storage regulation and implementation.”
EDPR Australia Country Director Simon Franklin said the company is increasingly focused on markets with favourable decarbonisation opportunities and Australia aligns closely with this strategy.
“As a market, Australia presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong fundamentals – including a clear route-to-market, regulatory stability, robust climate targets and market depth in renewables,” he said.
“These fundamentals enable value maximisation in renewables and positions Australia as a strategic growth area for EDPR.”
“We aim to leverage these favourable opportunities to drive sustainable growth and contribute towards a cleaner energy future in Australia and the APAC region.”
Franklin said EDPR, which has already installed 905 MW in solar capacity across the APAC region, will now look to capitalise on ITP Development’s local expertise as well as deploying its global scale, technical proficiency, and energy management know-how to Australia.
The company’s focus in Australia is expected to be on greenfield development of large-scale wind and solar projects coupled with energy storage solutions.
APAC is one of EDP’s four regional hubs, which together account for more than 26 GW of installed capacity worldwide. The company is targeting 50 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.
EDPR’s buyout of ITP Development follows the recent decision by a NSW court to reject the developer’s application to build a 10 MW solar farm in the state’s mid-west.
ITP Development was contacted for comment.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/31/akaysha-preps-for-arrival-of-superload-at-waratah-battery-site/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MANUFACTURING,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",EV FOLEY,2024-01-31,Akaysha preps for arrival of ‘superload’ at Waratah battery site,"Australian battery and renewable energy developer Akaysha Energy said a 477-tonne ‘superload’ carrying a high voltage 350 MVA transformer is on its way to project site at Munmorah on the New South Wales (NSW) Central Coast.
A transport combination measuring approximately 125 metres in length and about 5.8 metres wide departed from manufacturer Wilson Transformer Company’s facility at Glen Waverly in Victoria earlier this week carrying the transformer that will weigh in at more than 300 tonnes when it is installed.
Akaysha Chief Executive Officer Nick Carter said the convoy is due to arrive at the site of the now-demolished coal-fired Munmorah power station on 5 February 2024.
“It’s exciting to see one of the largest BESS high voltage transformers begin its journey to Waratah,” he said.
Carter said the 350 MVA 330/33/33 kV transformer is a key piece of infrastructure for the Waratah Super Battery that is the centrepiece of the state government’s plan to ensuring the security of electricity supply in NSW ahead of the anticipated closure of coal-fired power stations as early as 2025.
Origin Energy’s 2,880 MW Eraring coal-fired generator is set to shut down in August 2025. Origin will build a battery energy storage system at the site, but the NSW government has fast-tracked the Waratah battery to provide greater grid security.
Akaysha will own and operate the battery, which will start operations backed by a near-five-year contract from NSW’s EnergyCo that requires continuous active power capacity of at least 700 MW and a guaranteed useable energy storage capacity of at least 1,400 MWh.
Akaysha has opted to deliver an 850 MW / 1,680 MWh battery that will be the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere and one of the largest in the world.
The oversizing of the battery allows for degradation of the battery over time to ensure security of supply. It also allows Akaysha to utilise the excess capacity to tap into additional revenue streams.
Construction of the Waratah battery began in late May and completion is slated for 2025, ahead of the earliest possible closure date for the Eraring power station.
