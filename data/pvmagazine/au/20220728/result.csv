Transgrid said the QNI project, identified as a priority by the Australian Energy Market Operator in its Integrated Systems Plan (ISP) which outlines the path towards a net-zero grid amidst the retirement of coal-fired power, will allow an additional 460 MW of additional energy to be transferred into Queensland and 190 MW more into NSW and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) when required.
Transgrid chief executive officer Brett Redman said on Thursday the QNI upgrade is the first ISP project the network owner has delivered and “is a critical piece of infrastructure to support Australia’s energy transition” and will “make a significant difference to the National Electricity Market”.
“Transgrid is leaning into the acceleration of the energy transition by building the major projects which will enable the integration of renewables, increase competition among generators, drive down electricity prices and support the decarbonisation of Australia’s economy,” he said.
The QNI project involved the upgrading of the existing 330 kV transmission lines between the Liddell power station and the Tamworth substation. Activities included the replacement of existing pole structures with taller structures to enable the transmission of more energy as new generation comes online.

New technology was also installed at the Armidale, Dumaresq, Muswellbrook and Tamworth substations to strengthen the transmission network including new capacitor banks, Static Volt Amp Reactive compensators (SVC), transformers and 330 kV switch bays. Transgrid said the capacitor banks will provide additional reactive power, while the SVC regulates the reactive power on the grid to keep it stable.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean, whose government joined with the federal government to contribute $102 million towards the QNI upgrade, said the project is an important step in the state’s transition to cleaner, greener energy.
“We identified the QNI project as a priority in the NSW Transmission Infrastructure Strategy because it supports our vision to provide affordable and reliable energy for NSW households,” he said.
“The interconnector upgrades will also support the development of renewable generation in new energy zones across both states, as coal-fired generators retire and we transition towards a grid predominately supplied by renewable energy sources.”
The QNI project is one of a number of major transmission upgrade projects that Transgrid is either leading or contributing to, including the soon-to-be-completed Victoria NSW Interconnector (VNI), which is expected to increase transfer capacity into NSW from Victoria by 170 MW at times of high demand.
Transgrid is also building the 700km NSW section of EnergyConnect, from Wagga Wagga to the South Australian border. The 900km electricity interconnector will link power grids across NSW, South Australia (SA) and Victoria, unlocking gigawatts of new wind, solar PV and storage. South Australia’s transmission network owner ElectraNet is constructing the SA section of the new interconnector from the border to Robertstown.
Transgrid is also developing the HumeLink and VNI West Kerang transmission projects, which together with EnergyConnect will reinforce the southern grid and support the energy transition and cater for forecast increases in energy demand.

Grace said the result had outstripped expectations for the program, which had been expanded in February 2022.
“I am particularly proud that we exceeded our original target of 180,000 panels at 872 schools and have instead delivered 200,000 panels at 912 schools,” she said. “This equates to a $26 million saving on energy bills every single year and is enough renewable energy to power 25,000 homes.”
Grace said the solar installations would make a significant contribution to the Palaszczuk Government’s 50% renewable energy target by 2030, with the 200,000 solar panels expected to generate an average of 280 MW of electricity per day.
Queensland Environment Minister Meaghan Scanlon said the program was good news for schools and great news for the state government’s renewable energy target.
“ACES is making a significant contribution to the Palaszczuk Government’s 50% renewable energy target by 2030, with the 200,000 solar panels on state school rooftops expected to generate an average of 280 MW of electricity per day,” the Gold Coast-based minister said. “The 17,000 panels in the Gold Coast alone can generate around 23,000 kW of electricity per day.”
The Nerang State High School in the Gold Coast’s northern suburbs is among the schools to receive rooftop solar with 484 panels installed as part of a $310,000 investment.
Principal Scott Ison said the solar system, which has been operating since last year, can generate around 630 kW of electricity per day.
“These new solar panels will not only deliver significant energy savings for the school but will also allow us to redirect these savings into important teaching and learning activities that will benefit every student,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/28/industry-backs-climate-bill-to-accelerate-investment-in-renewables/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 28, 2022",Industry backs climate bill to accelerate investment in renewables,"The Albanese Government has formalised Australia’s renewed climate goal with the introduction of a new bill into parliament that it claims will demonstrate to renewable energy investors and developers that “Australia is open for business and raring to go”.
The Climate Change Bill 2022, introduced in the lower house by Energy Minister Chris Bowen on Wednesday, would enshrine Labor’s commitment to a 43% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 as well as its commitment to reaching net zero by 2050.
Bowen said the bill delivers “the strongest possible signal” to industry and investors about the country’s collective commitment to decarbonising the economy and becoming a renewable energy superpower.
“This legislation is important not so much because of what it obliges governments and ministers to do, although there are significant elements of that in the bill, but more because of the message of stable, clear, coherent and necessary policy it sends to the private sector, to private investors, when it comes to investing in renewable energy,” he said.
“It sends a message that Australia now has a government and a parliament that wants Australia to be a renewable energy powerhouse.”
As well as enshrining Labor’s emissions reduction targets, the bill hands power to the Climate Change Authority to monitor Australia’s progress against those goals and inform the setting of future targets, including Australia’s next target under the Paris Agreement, for 2035. It would also require the minister to provide regular updates on how the government is meeting its targets. The legislation would also embed the targets in the objectives and functions of a range of government bodies including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and Infrastructure Australia.

Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC) policy director Erwin Jackson said the bill could help unlock hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of investment in climate solutions across the economy.
“The proposed bill includes many of the elements that will support the efficient allocation of capital to Australia,” he said. “Investors seek best practice legislative frameworks that include legislated targets, and independent advice on the policies needed to ensure an equitable transition to net zero.
“These measures will reduce the risk of continuing the chaotic climate policy making which has increased investment risks and costs in Australia.”
The IGCC said coherent policies that deliver on stronger emissions targets will provide the opportunity to unlock an estimated $131 billion in new investment this decade.
Economist Nicki Hutley, a member of the Climate Council, backed the new legislation, saying clean energy represents an enormous economic opportunity for Australia, supporting job creation, growing businesses and driving a sustainable energy future.
“The economic opportunities for a country like Australia are boundless,” she said. “Clean energy exports could be worth $333 billion each year, that’s almost triple the value of Australia’s existing fossil fuel exports.”
While negotiations are continuing to ensure the bill can pass through the upper house, Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said in its current form the legislation represents a “very big improvement on the status quo” – and the broader the support for the bill, the stronger the basis for investment will be.
“Industry weighing up big decisions about where, when and how to invest need the clearest steer they can get about national goals and public policy,” he said. “Too often we’ve seen climate policy flip back and forth with political winds; governments pursue contradictory goals via uncoordinated action; and industry and other stakeholders shut out from having a clear say on policy and progress.
“The process set out in the bills would greatly improve that, with clear goals for all relevant arms of government and the public to refer to, strong transparency and independent advice drawing on public input to shape the future of targets.”
The climate change bill is set to reach the Senate by September. With the Coalition expected to vote against the draft laws, Labor will need the support of the Greens, which hold 12 seats in the Senate, plus one crossbencher for the legislation to pass.
Bowen said on Wednesday that negotiations on the climate bill are ongoing, but he remained confident the legislation would pass through the upper house.
“The world’s climate emergency is Australia’s opportunity,” Bowen said. “We have the resources, the capability and the know-how to become a renewable energy superpower, not just in one part of Australia, but across multiple sectors of our economy. In clean energy, in battery manufacturing, in commodities, and in value-adding such commodities as aluminium, lithium, copper, cobalt and nickel.
“This bill may be simple in what it lays out, but it’s significant in what it will achieve.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/28/how-to-release-the-handbrake-delivering-the-workforce-australia-needs/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 28, 2022",How to release the handbrake: Delivering the workforce Australia needs,"At Sterling & Wilson Renewable Energy (SWRE) we wholeheartedly support the words of the Prime Minister at the recent Sydney Energy Forum, when he said that this is “a new era”, one with “new clean-energy industries and jobs as its foundation”.
The government’s plan to allocate up to $3 billion for existing industries to adapt and new industries to grow, and to implement settings that will unlock $52 billion worth of private sector investment, are all crucial ingredients for Australia to become a renewable energy superpower.
However, if we really want to achieve this goal, we must release a hidden handbrake.
Australia’s current renewable energy workforce is not fit for purpose in this new era. To date, our sectors delivering the critical infrastructure for renewables have been dependent on a massively casualised workforce. Whilst this was reasonable in an environment of unstable and inconsistent project-based investment, where work was only available in short bursts, the practice comes with real costs to businesses, projects, staff and customers. Every new project requires new and complex contracts to be established, operational experience relearned, and a new workforce recruited and trained. The resulting costs and inefficiencies represent a critical risk to the government’s aspirations.
If Australia is serious about harnessing the economic and social opportunities that renewable energy offers, we need to work towards the de-casualisation of the renewable energy workforce. The government is promising 604,000 extra jobs, but we need to talk about the kind of jobs we’re creating. What we need is renewable energy careers.
There is a dire need for a review of the workforce with support via apprenticeships, training to reskill workers from other sectors (including coal), skilled migration and incentives for local workers. By investing in training and upskilling we ensure that we have the skills and know-how to develop the renewable energy infrastructure Australia needs and give further confidence to investors.

The government’s New Energy Apprenticeships and the New Energy Skills Program are a good start. We should be supporting employment pathways for those entering the workforce for the first time, offering a permanent, secure career that is enticing to young Australians. But we should also be not wasting the talent and expertise of those who have careers in the fossil-fuel industry – re-skilling them into a new energy career. Strategic skilled migration is going to be critical in the short-term, though this must happen in tandem with incentives that develop and retain our local workers in renewable careers, not just casual jobs.
We welcome the recent announcement of the upcoming Jobs and Skills Summit, to be led by the Prime Minister and Treasurer in September. Addressing the issues faced by the renewable energy workforce – in particular, how we move away from casualisation and towards upskilling – must be a key discussion point. Further, a clear plan of meaningful action to actively support a skilled workforce for the renewables and infrastructure sector needs to be established and followed.
At SWRE we are looking forward to delivering some of the massive projects that are going to feed the next resources boom in Australia: the era of renewables. We support looking for ways to create greater collaboration between business partners in the EPC market to help improve quality, turnaround and productivity, which in turn attracts greater investment.
It is our aspiration that there be permanent, secure, career pathways for renewable energy in Australia. Without this, the workforce will not be equipped to deliver on the promises made.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/28/maxeon-partners-with-reclaim-pv-to-save-panels-from-landfill/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 28, 2022",Maxeon partners with Reclaim PV to save panels from landfill,"Singapore-headquartered solar manufacturer Maxeon Solar Technologies, which sells in Australia under the SunPower Maxeon brand, said the partnership with Reclaim PV will ensure its panels that have come to the end of their useful lives will be recycled and not discarded into landfill.
With the rollout of rooftop and large-scale solar PV in Australia showing no signs of slowing, the number of end-of-life solar panels is destined to grow exponentially. Analysis from international consultancy firm Rystad Energy indicates that solar PV waste will grow to 27 million tonnes per annum by 2040. The Federal Government projects that in Australia, more than 1.5 million tonnes of solar PV waste will be generated each year by 2050. Currently, almost all broken or expired solar panels go into landfill.
Reclaim PV, which launched its first recycling facility in Adelaide last year and expects to collect more than 90,000 panels or the equivalent of 3,000 tonnes of PV modules in 2022, is among a suite of Australian companies looking to re-use or recycle solar panel materials.
Reclaim PV director Clive Fleming said the partnership with Maxeon is an important step forward in the responsible recycling of end-of-life solar panels.
“Maxeon is one of the first manufacturers to adopt responsible recycling in their supply chain and to partner with Reclaim PV to help solve the PV recycling challenge that Australia is facing,” he said. “We look forward to continuing to work with them to keep solar panels out of landfill.”
Reclaim PV uses a recycling process known as pyrolysis – a thermal deconstruction technique which breaks down and separates PV panels into their component parts by passing them through a high-temperature furnace. Upon completion of the thermal extraction process, the recovered components are sorted and placed into collection bins for delivery to materials companies, ensuring all recoverable materials are available for re-use.
Reclaim PV Recycling
Fleming said Reclaim PV also provides services beyond collection and recycling with the company also compiling and storing information on the materials in the panels it recycles.
This additional data collection service will help to build a complete and transparent picture of the materials being extracted from the solar panels and where they are supplied back into Australian supply chains, with a carbon offset value calculated to show the positive effects of recycling.
“The importance of the data recording and supply mapping process is that we are able to bring transparency to the material recovery and supply process and can now make informed decisions on how we can in part replace the use of virgin mined materials within other industries with recycled materials from solar panels,” Fleming said.
“This is something that both Reclaim PV and Maxeon see as having huge potential for both the solar panel supply chain and the entire circular economy.”
Maxeon’s APAC vice president Chris O’Brien said the manufacturer’s partnership with Reclaim PV is a sign of the company’s commitment to a circular solar economy.
“We take sustainability very seriously and continue to innovate by developing more efficient, more sustainable and longer-lasting panels that ease the burden of the recycling process and ensure a positive impact on people and the planet,” he said. “Our partnership with Reclaim PV in Australia is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to ESG principles and goals.”

“Typical applications are large-scale solar plants dedicated to solar heat for industrial processes (SHIP), providing pressurised hot water or steam up to 180 C to industries such as food and beverage, chemical, textile, paper, oil and gas, mining, and automotive,” TVP Solar’s vice president business development, Guglielmo Cioni, told pv magazine. “All of these industries have a major share of fuel consumption to produce heat below 180 C of temperature.”
The company said its MT-Power panel exhibits minimal thermal losses and no degradation over time, with an average thermal efficiency of up to 64.5% and a peak thermal efficiency of 68.6%.
“The efficiency can also be higher, depending on temperature,” Cioni said. “It may be a real booster for thermal output, by combining solar thermal to photovoltaics and heat pumps to provide enhanced output per square meter, in particular for low-temperature applications such as district heating.”
The panel has a flat design and was developed with a high vacuum flat panel (HVFP) technology developed by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN).
“No other non-concentrated solar technology can claim such performance,” Cioni said. “TVP Solar’s super-performing flat collectors produce heat throughout the year in most climatic conditions and geographies cheaper than liquid fossil fuels.”
The panels are built with heat absorbers with heat transfer fluid pipes welded to coated absorber sheet, a glass cover with an embedded peripheral frame, and a lightweight metal backplate. The modules are initially encapsulated with glass-to-metal sealing, which ensures durability of more than 25 years, according to the manufacturer. They then go through automated vacuum-type welding of the peripheral frame and a differential exhaust process via a tunnel oven.
The panel has an absorption area of 1.96 m2 and a weight of 27kg per square metre. It is reportedly able to generate up to 1,200 kWh of thermal energy per square metre per year depending on solar irradiance and operating temperature.
TVP Solar is currently operating a 5,000 m2 manufacturing facility in Avellino, southern Italy. The factory has a fully automated line with a capacity of 110,000 m2 per year. Several systems built with its modules are currently operating across several demonstration sites.
“The size of our projects did not exceed 1 MW until 2021, but now we are only targeting projects over 1 MW, and we believe that, especially in combination with thermal storage and advanced control and management systems, our module technology may be used in projects of up to 100 MW,” Cioni said. “Further standardisation of the Balance of System (BoS) is being designed for such projects, including the expansion of the existing supply chain for the BoS.”
The existing plants were installed in Italy, France, Switzerland, UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, USA, Brazil, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands.
“Our target is to continue to operate in these markets and to expand globally within five years,” Cioni said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/28/labor-introduces-controversial-climate-bill-to-parliament-heres-how-to-give-it-real-teeth/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JULY 28, 2022",Labor introduces controversial climate bill to parliament. Here’s how to give it real teeth,"Labor has updated Australia’s obligations under the Paris Agreement. So we’re already committed to a 43% emissions reduction by 2030, based on 2005 levels.
Enshrining the target in law might send a message that the new government is committed to reducing emissions. But as I explain below, the law will have little material effect.
Labor needs the support of the Greens and one other crossbencher to get the bill through the Senate. Labor won’t concede to the Greens’ core demands, but a climate “trigger” on new developments could ensure the bill has real force.

Introducing the bill to parliament on Wednesday, Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said Labor’s emissions reduction target of 43% was “ambitious but achievable”. But in fact, the goal is far from ambitious – and in all likelihood will be easily met.
Even before the election, Australia was on track for a 35% emissions reduction – well above the commitment of the Morrison government. This was mainly due to state government action, and rapid take up of clean energy by households and businesses.
Former prime minister Scott Morrison could not publicly admit this, or adjust the government’s official target accordingly, at the risk of antagonising climate denialists on his own side.
But it means Australia is likely to be well on track to achieve the 43% target by the next election – with a little help from Labor’s modest proposed policy changes, and steep increases in the cost of coal, oil and gas. So legislating the target isn’t really necessary.
Nor does Labor need new laws to prevent a future Coalition government from scaling back the emissions reduction target.
Under the Paris Agreement, there is no process to go backwards. Nations are expected to rachet up their pledges until, it is hoped, global emissions fall to a trajectory consistent with global temperature goals.

Unless Australian withdrew from the agreement altogether – as the Trump administration did in the United States – the 43% commitment is almost impossible to reverse.
Even ignoring our international commitments, the Coalition is unlikely to propose backtracking on the 43% target.
Even if it went to the next election promising no further action on climate change, Australia would still be on track to hit the target. So modifying the target would bring no policy benefit – and would kill off any chance of recapturing seats lost to teal independents and Greens at the last election.
Labor has proposed to tighten the so-called “safeguard mechanism” established by the previous government. But this policy is achievable under existing law and did not require inclusion in the bill now before parliament.
The mechanism is supposed to prevent big industrial polluters from increasing their emissions beyond a certain cap – a move necessary to protect gains in emissions reduction made elsewhere in the economy.
In theory, polluters receive a financial incentive if their emissions fall below a previously established baseline, and incur a financial cost if their emissions exceed it. But under the Coalition, many polluters were allowed to increase their baselines to avoid being penalised.
Labor has proposed to implement the scheme more effectively. This relatively modest policy will proceed regardless of the climate bill’s passage.
The Greens have made two key demands in exchange for supporting Labor’s climate bill in the Senate: increasing the 43% target and a ban on new coal and gas projects.
There is virtually no chance Labor will agree to a higher target – given both its election commitments, and the political imperative of not being seen to cave in to the Greens.
Nor is the government likely to accept an explicit ban on new coal and gas projects, even though the International Energy Agency says such a ban is needed.
There is, however, room for compromise. The Greens have called for the legislation to incorporate a “climate trigger”, which would mean development proposals are not approved unless their impact on climate change has been considered.
The trigger would mean new coal and gas projects could be rejected on the grounds of potential damage to the climate, without Labor having to commit to such a ban.
Labor did not rule out the trigger before the election, and elements of its grassroots membership are calling for the policy to form part of the government’s planned overhaul of federal environment laws.
The election in May of an unprecedented number of independent and Green MPs reflected a groundswell of community feeling on the need for climate action. The federal government must take account of this, if the current parliament is to land on a sustainable climate policy.
The Greens and other crossbenchers should not rubber stamp a purely symbolic statement of Labor’s targets. But for their part, they should seek a sensible compromise on measures to help decarbonise the Australian and global economies.
And what of the Dutton-led opposition? The Coalition’s embrace of climate denialism produced one of its worst electoral defeats in history. Even if it votes against the legislation now before parliament, the Coalition’s political recovery depends on it taking a more constructive climate position in future.
