The CEC said the construction activity has been overshadowed by a significant fall in new financial commitments in large-scale renewable projects with quarterly investment in financially committed generation and storage projects slumping to $400 million. This is the second lowest quarterly result since data collection began in 2017 and a dramatic fall from the $4.3 billion seen in the previous quarter.
While the CEC data indicated no generation projects reached the critical stage of financial commitment in the quarter, Pacific Partnerships achieved financial close on the 102 MW Glenrowan Solar Farm in northeast Victoria.
The only storage project to reach financial commitment was the 200 MW/400 MWh Rangebank Battery Energy Storage System being developed in Victoria by Shell Energy Australia in partnership with Green Investment Group.
CEC Chief Executive Officer Kane Thornton said the shortage of projects reaching financial close is “cause for concern”, saying Australia needs to increase the pace of its renewable energy rollout if it is to meet legislated targets.
“A slowdown in the rate of new projects reaching financial close is at odds with our need to accelerate deployment,” he said.
“Australia needs to double the rate of renewable energy deployment to ensure we have enough new supply to drive down power prices, replace exiting coal generation and ensure we achieve the target of 82% renewable energy by 2030 and put Australia on a path to achieve net-zero by 2050.”

Thornton said energy investors are enthusiastic about investing in clean energy in Australia but that confidence is being undermined by a “variety of headwinds.”
This includes the global competition for clean energy as many countries follow the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and dramatically increase the scale and incentives for clean energy projects.
Thornton also pointed to challenges with connecting to the grid, supply chain and workforce constraints and delays in planning and approvals.
“These risks and challenges need urgent and coordinated attention to ensure Australia gets back on track to delivering new clean energy supply critical in managing the energy transition,” he said.
The CEC said the federal government has made significant progress in managing the energy transition, including allocating $2 billion in the budget to support green hydrogen production, but urged the government to abandon plans to phase out Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET).
Thornton urged the government to consider an extended RET to provide certainty for investors and support more large-scale investment.
“No policy has delivered as much abatement, given as much certainty and unlocked as much investment as the RET,” he said. “Extending it beyond 2030 would be simple and fast, and the costs associated with this extension will be far outweighed by lower energy prices that we know will follow.”

Among the seven generation projects that began construction in the Q1 2023 was the 290 MW Wollar Solar Farm being developed near Mudgee in central west New South Wales by the Australian arm of China-headquartered clean energy company Beijing Jingneng Clean Energy (BJEI).
The 300 MW/800 MWh Blyth Battery, being developed by France-headquartered renewable energy developer Neoen in South Australia’s mid-north, was the only storage project to commence construction over the same period.
The total capacity for the eight generation and storage projects combined was 1,014 MW. Quarterly investment in financially committed generation and storage projects reached $400 million, the second lowest quarterly result since data collection began in Q1 2017.
Two projects were commissioned in the first three months of 2023 including the 400 MW first stage of the New England Solar Farm in northern NSW, and Fortescue’s Pilbara Generation Project battery energy storage system in Western Australia.
In terms of new installed capacity added, this was 2,023 MW less compared to the previous quarter, and 1,379 MW less than the same quarter 12 months ago.
The CEC said there are currently 108 generation and storage projects with a combined total of 16.7 GW of generation capacity and 13.9 GWh of storage, that have either reached financial commitment or begun construction.
Since 2017, 193 large-scale generation and storage projects have been commissioned in Australia, contributing 15.5 GW of installed capacity, 1.7 GWh of storage, and more than $27 billion worth of investment.

The 20 MWh battery energy storage system will be paired with a 5 MW solar installation as part of a $50 million renewable energy microgrid which will provide power for the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians in northern California.
Redflow said it will supply, supervise installation and assist with the commissioning and maintenance of 2,000 of its 10 kWh 48 V ZBM3 batteries in modular energy pods. Shipping of the 200 kWh pods, to be manufactured in Redflow’s factory in Thailand, is expected to begin later this year with practical completion and commissioning of the system expected in 2025.
Redflow Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Tim Harris said the 20 MWh system is the company’s largest single sale and deployment of batteries to date and is an important step in the execution of the company’s plans to expand into the U.S. market.
“This 20 MWh project is one of several large-scale opportunities in our pipeline and represents the start of the next phase of our growth strategy, validating our focus on large-scale systems in the U.S. and Australia,” he said.
“The market for long-duration energy storage solutions is rapidly accelerating and this project will firmly establish Redflow’s presence in California, which is leading the development and support of non-lithium technologies to achieve its net-zero goals.”
California, which is targeting more than 400% growth in clean energy in the next two decades, is expected to require 45 to 55 GW of long-duration energy storage by 2045 to support grid stability and the state’s clean energy transition targets.
Harris said the new microgrid project follows on from the 2 MWh system that Redflow installed in California for biowaste tech company Anaergia in 2022 that has been successfully operating for more than a year.

Harris said Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow technology is capable of providing up to 12 hours of flexible energy capacity for both commercial and utility-scale energy storage applications.
“For this project, Redflow’s battery system is designed to charge from solar and discharge throughout the remainder of the day, reducing grid demand and boosting the energy security of the Paskenta Rancheria,” he said.
The project will be funded by the California Energy Commission’s $215 million long-duration energy storage grant program which is supporting the development of non-lithium technologies to help the state government achieve its net-zero goals.
Faraday Microgrids, a California developer and contractor that has deployed a number of California Energy Commission grant-funded microgrid projects, is the grant recipient and project lead, and will purchase the battery system from Redflow.
Faraday Microgrids CEO David Bliss said the “resiliency, operational performance, and safety” of Redflow’s zinc-bromine flow battery technology will play a key role in providing greater “energy sovereignty” for both California and the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians.
“Redflow’s strength of team, innovative approach to flow technology, and a strong track record of successful deployments is a welcome addition to our microgrid portfolio,” he said.
Faraday expects the definitive supply agreement will be formalised and a notice to commence issued to Redflow around the end of July 2023.

Sun Cable is seeking to develop a giant solar and battery energy storage complex on a 12,000-hectare site at Powell Creek in the Northern Territory’s (NT) Barkly region. The Australia-Asia PowerLink (AAPowerLink) project, backed by Australia’s federal and Northern Territory governments, includes a 17-20 GW solar farm and a 36-42 GWh battery storage development.
The project is to supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,500-kilometre high-voltage direct-current transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin where approximately 800 MW of the solar farm’s output will provide for private industry offtake. The rest is to be exported to Singapore via a 3,800km subsea cable system.
David Scaysbrook, Australian-based co-founder and managing partner of Quinbrook, said the “bare bones of the project look really attractive” but his firm, behind the largest solar and storage projects being delivered in the United States and the United Kingdom, is focused on the delivery of the solar farm and transmission line to Darwin as part of what could be a staged approach.
“We’ve got a good handle on the likely build cost for the onshore renewables part, given that’s kind of what we do for a living,” he said. “I don’t get carried away with all of the tags about this being the biggest renewables project in the world.”
“Where we feel we can add value is to bring the optimum project solution to the onshore renewables component of Sun Cable, and that makes really a lot of sense because at the end of the day getting the cheapest optimum solution into Darwin is mission critical.”
Scaysbrook said if solar can be delivered to Darwin at a globally competitive price, then it could help underwrite the export of renewable energy into Singapore and into other energy-intensive projects.
“With a project of this scale, you can deliver enough renewables into Darwin to do domestic green hydrogen manufacture. And you could also export enough of the power up to Singapore that was sort of bandied around as the amount that Singapore would want,” he said.
Quinbrook, which joined with Grok to acquire Sun Cable out of administration last week, said it will look to bring in additional investors from Europe, the UK, the US and Canada as it develops the Sun Cable project.
“This will be a United Nations of global capital represented investing in these projects,” Scaysbrook said.
Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners is pleased to be involved in the world’s largest renewables project.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/01/global-investment-in-clean-energy-nearly-doubles-that-of-fossil-fuels/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,RESEARCH,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 1, 2023",Global investment in clean energy nearly doubles that of fossil fuels,"From pv magazine Global
The global shift to clean energy is happening rapidly, with decarbonisation efforts no longer a future prospect, but a reality of today.
The annual World Energy Investment report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that for every US dollar invested in fossil fuels, USD 1.70 is invested in clean energy technologies. This marks a fast divergence from five years ago, when fossil fuels and clean energy investments were essentially even.
The torch is now being carried by solar, which is soon to overtake oil production said IEA. Almost 90% of new power generation investments are now tied to solar and other low-carbon technologies, said the report.
About USD 2.8 trillion is set to be invested in energy globally in 2023, USD 1.7 trillion of which will go to clean technologies, with PV leading the way as the largest contributor of energy generation. The remaining roughly USD 1 trillion is expected to be invested in fossil fuels. Annual clean energy investment is expected to rise by 24% between 2021 and 2023, driven by renewables and electric vehicles, compared with a 15% rise in fossil fuel investment over the same period.
Nearly USD 700 billion of investment is expected for renewable energy generation. Solar is the star performer with more than USD 1 billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023. IEA expects solar investment to total USD 380 billion for the year as a whole, edging this spending above upstream oil for the first time.
Along with wholesale move toward clean generation is a global shift toward electrification. Global heat pump sales are growing at double-digit annual growth rates since 2021, and electric vehicles are expected to leap one-third this year after already undergoing a landmark year of growth in 2021.
China is expected to continue as the global frontrunner in clean energy investment, with increased spending of over USD 170 billion. The nation is followed by the European Union, with about USD 150 billion in increased investment, and the United States, adding about USD 100 billion in increased investment. Costs for clean energy edged higher in 2022, but pressures are easing in 2023, and mature clean technologies remain very cost-competitive in today’s fuel-price environment, said IEA.
China alone added over 100 GW of solar PV capacity in 2022, almost 70% higher than in 2021, and annual installations increased by 40% or more in Europe, India and Brazil, despite inflation and supply chain issues.
“While solar deployment has been increasing year-on-year, the project pipeline for some other technologies has been less reliable,” said the report. “Investment in wind power has varied year-on-year in key markets in response to changing policy circumstances. Nuclear investment is rising but hydropower, a key low-emission source of power market flexibility, has been on a downward trend.”
This investment is gaining momentum due to a powerful alignment of costs, climate, and energy security goals and industrial strategies. The recovery from the slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to the global energy crisis have provided a significant boost to clean energy investment, said IEA.
While clean technology investments are rising worldwide, work needs to be done, especially in developing economies, said IEA. Many nations are being held back by higher interest rates, unclear policy frameworks and market designs, weak grid infrastructure, financially strained utilities, and a high cost of capital. However, IEA notes that dynamic investments in solar in India, Brazil, and the Middle East are driving forward these markets.
To help address some of the above-listed headwinds, the IEA release a new report entitled Scaling Up Private Finance for Clean Energy in Emerging and Developing Economies on June 22.
Fossil fuel producers made record profits in 2022, though much of this cash flow has gone to dividends, share buybacks, and debt repayment, rather than reinvestment back into traditional supply. IEA said that while a shift to renewables is underway, fossil fuels are expected to continue to drive growth – with oil and gas spending expected to rise 7% this year. Coal demand still remains high in some markets, and the shift from these assets may not be occurring fast enough, as coal investment is pacing to be six times above what IEA envisions for its 2030 Net Zero Scenario.
IEA notes that clean energy among major oil and gas producers is continuing to rise, with solar and wind holding a similar share. Clean energy investment by these fossil fuels companies doubled in 2022 to about USD 20 billion. This investment represents about 4% of upstream capital and 0.5% of net income. European oil majors are outpacing U.S. oil majors considerably in this category, said IEA.
In the United States, demand to adopt solar is strong. In its 2023 Solar Snapshot report, Aurora Solar reported that 45% of solar professionals reported increased demand as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, with another 40% expecting to see increased demand soon, and 70% noted their business grew in size. Nearly 77% of homeowners either have solar or are interested in purchasing it, said Aurora Solar.
In its 2021 World Energy Outlook report, IEA noted that the world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs. This year, it said, “this picture is starting to change: global energy investment is picking up, and the rise in clean energy investment since 2021 is leading the way, outpacing the increase in fossil fuel investment by almost three to-one.”
“If [clean energy investment] continues to grow at the rate seen since 2021, then aggregate spending in 2030 on low-emission power, grids and storage, and end-use electrification would exceed the levels required to meet the world’s announced climate pledges. For some technologies, notably solar, [investment] would match the investment required to get on track for a 1.5°C stabilisation in global average temperatures,” said IEA.

PV module maker Trina Solar announced it has signed an agreement with an unspecified state-owned entity of Shifang City, Sichuan province, to build a 25 GW monocrystalline ingot factory in the area. The company should invest around CNY10.7 billion ($1.55 billion) in the project, with Trina holding an 81% stake in the manufacturing facility and the state-owned entity holding the remaining 19%. The project should be finalised within 12 months, Trina said in a statement.
Solar manufacturer Longi said today it cut the prices of its wafer products by 30%. The company is now pricing its p-type M10 products with a thickness of 150μm at CNY4.36 per piece, down 30.8% compared to the price released at the end of April. Furthermore, it priced its p-type M6 products with a thickness of 150μm at CNY3.81, down 30.0% compared to the previous price release.
Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has revealed that the Chinese PV industry produced 39.92 GW of solar cells in April, with a year-on-year increase of 69.1%. In the first four months of this year, the country manufactured solar cells with a combined capacity of 144.35 GW, which is 56.7% more than the same period in 2022.
