Renewable energy is often hailed as ‘the future’, but some might also wonder why it’s not already here yet.
Wind farms, solar arrays, pumped hydro and electric vehicles are not brand new technologies – and yet, across Australia as a whole, fossil fuels still accounted for around 76 per cent of all energy produced in 2021.
However, Professor Alistair Sproul, Head of School of UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE), says the plummeting cost of producing renewable energy now makes it inevitable that burning coal and gas will soon be consigned to history.
Professor Sproul says basic economics will be the tipping point in the switch to renewables – and that the energy revolution will be completed much quicker than many expect.
“We can and will make the transition to 100 per cent clean, green, renewable energy and it won’t cost the earth,” he says.
“The dollars and cents are on our side now and the market is changing before everyone’s eyes, so I think it will likely happen faster than most people might think.
“Companies who are invested in coal were perhaps thinking they were viable for the next 10 to 15 years, but now they are losing money hand over fist – and that becomes the driving force behind some of the changes.”
Professor Renate Egan, who leads the UNSW activity in the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, agrees that cheap renewable energy can be the driving force for change.
But she also says that people’s personal choices will help accelerate the switch away from fossil fuels.
“Solar energy is now incredibly cheap to produce, so if you can use it, you should,” Prof. Egan says.
“Ultimately, we need to retire our fossil fuel plants, and people should have optimism that they can make a difference by changing the way they heat and cool their houses, or switching to an electric vehicle. All those choices have an impact.”
Here, Prof. Sproul and Prof. Egan help to answer some frequently asked questions about renewable energy both past, present and future.
The major reason is the sunk costs in the existing infrastructure which has been in place for many years.
But in the last 10 years the data shows there has been a growing reluctance to invest more money into that old infrastructure, and an increasing awareness that the future will be fuelled by renewable energy.
Building an entirely new energy industry takes time and it has indeed taken decades to grow renewable energy from virtually nothing to around 24 per cent of electricity production in Australia in 2021.
And while solar and wind are now competitive, there remain some engineering and market challenges before we can be 100 per cent renewable. None of them insurmountable.
Yes, and it is likely to happen much faster than most people expect.
Building solar and wind power energy systems is cheaper than any other option in 2021, and they are predicted to ultimately produce far more electricity than is currently demanded.
Any extra energy can then be exported or used to produce green hydrogen, which is expected to also play a part in the overall energy market of the future.
Australia is very well placed to deal with the problem of intermittency – which is the term used to describe the fact that renewable energy can often only be produced in certain specific conditions, such as when it is sunny or windy.
One major reason is the existence of the National Electricity Market, one of the longest interconnected electricity grids in the world, which links Queensland, New South Wales, ACT, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.
That means when it is sunny in Brisbane, the power can reach Melbourne. And when it is windy in Adelaide, the electricity is available in Sydney.
Australia’s weather systems also play a big part. Tasmania already produces 98 per cent of its required power from renewables, and South Australia met its entire electricity demand thanks to solar power for a period of one hour in October 2020.
Each region and each nation across the world will use different renewable resources depending on their location and which best suits them.
Having enough available land space can be an issue for some countries, but Japan and Singapore are solving this problem by building offshore wind farms.
Alternatively, companies such as Sun Cable are building intercontinental power grids which mean that solar energy produced in Australia, for example, can be exported across Southeast Asia.
Ten or even five years ago traditional lithium-ion batteries were the main technology available for storing energy, but were largely too expensive and too inefficient to be used at any kind of scale.
However, technology often moves with markets and developments in batteries have been growing in pace as renewable energy production has increased globally.
There are now many battery technologies being developed for all different types of purposes. Some will be better suited to longer-term storage of commercial renewable energy, while others will be ideal for home usage or to power electric vehicles.
As the technology improves, the prices are also expected to fall. Even traditional lithium-ion batteries have fallen in price by 97 per cent since 1991 when comparing cost per kilowatt-hour capacity.
The basic and simple answer is yes.
For one, research and development – such as that undertaken at UNSW – has resulted in cheaper and more efficient renewable energy technologies.
It is now much more cost-effective to build and run a wind farm or solar array, rather than a new fossil-fuelled power plant.
Once a wind or solar farm is in place, the generation of electricity from them costs virtually nothing. That obviously is not the case when coal and gas has to be continually extracted from the ground to provide power, as has been the case historically.
A 2021 report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance calculated that electricity from a brand new wind farm would cost $80/MWh to produce. That’s in comparison to $116/MWh from a new gas baseload power plant, and $143/MWh from a coal-fired power station.
Since 2008, electricity consumption across Australia has actually dropped, due in part to improved efficiency of devices.
There are still lots of improvements that can be made with regards to efficiency of such things as high efficiency air conditioning units, the heating of swimming pools using solar energy, and building regulations for houses – which will mean even less energy being used.
On the other side, world-leading research at UNSW on photovoltaic cells used in solar panels means we can expect much more than the current average of 25 per cent efficiency, ensuring that the same sized panels could produce a lot more energy in the near future.
But, in any case, some advocates of renewable energy argue that if it is extremely cheap and extremely green, then why should anyone care if more of it is being consumed?

The Warrego was just the first in a suite of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) the company is hoping to bring to market, which include more light cars all the way through to agricultural vehicles. The company says its 200 orders on the Warrego have come from “several significant energy companies and a number of private buyers” in Australia and abroad, including the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia.
“It obviously shows a pretty incredible demand across the board for vehicles of this kind,” H2X corporate affairs specialist, Tony Blackie, told pv magazine Australia.
Based on the Ford Ranger, Blackie said the Warrego was something of a concept car – a demonstration that a hydrogen-powered twin cab ute could work.
It has undeniably drawn attention, though questions do remain around how relevant the technology will be for light vehicles and passenger cars given electric vehicles (EVs) are far more mature, making them cheaper and visible today. There is also the little snag of where to refuel a hydrogen car, seeing as there are currently just four green hydrogen refuelling stations in Australia, not all of which (like Toyota’s Melbourne station) are even open to the public.
Another oft cited catch is the fact you need to generate twice as much electricity to produce hydrogen than if you just straight up charged your car. Such questions don’t seem to phase H2X execs though.
In its suite of new models, Blackie said Australia can expect a number of other light vehicles like small vans to heavier vehicles and eventually tractors.
“Hydrogen fuel cell capabilities cover all motor vehicles,” he said, noting the horizons aren’t just limited to buses. Brendan Norman, the company’s CEO, has has vision for a range of vehicles to be available for a broad spectrum of uses, Blackie said.

In the short term, the company wants to develop close to operations with hydrogen fuel capabilities, but in the longer term it wants to service the agricultural industry. That is, it wants to enter the farm machinery market, with Blackie saying those conversations are already happening.
“And it’s not just vehicles of course, there’s the generator set,” he added. Mobile hydrogen generators, he added, are also on the cards for H2X.
H2X’s ultimate ambition is to begin producing its own hydrogen fuel cells for its vehicles here in Australia, though the company is yet to start manufacturing on larger scale.
Well, the primary reason is hydrogen vehicles’ only emission is a clean puddle of water. So if you refuel with green hydrogen, that is hydrogen produced with an electrolyser powered by renewable energy, the car has no carbon emissions. If the car is fuelled with blue or grey hydrogen created using fossil fuels, that’s an entirely different story. But the point is, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have the capacity to be super clean – yes, cleaner than purely electric vehicles.
Batteries are predominantly made from pretty toxic chemicals and Australia isn’t particularly good at recycling them, so a lot end up in landfill. Even if we and the rest of the world get better at recycling batteries though, properly reusing the materials they contain, we will still inevitably need to dig up virgin minerals to keep up with demand. Which makes hydrogen as a form of energy storage (fuel) superior in that department.
It remains to be seen whether it’s enough for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles to displace EVs, but Australia is certainly banking big on hydrogen. As of March, Australia’s hydrogen project pipeline was triple the size of the next biggest, which belong to Germany and the Netherlands.
Many have speculated about why Australia is so infatuated with hydrogen – perhaps it feels like home for our gas-export nation, perhaps it’s the fact hydrogen can rehouse our increasingly obsolete fossil fuels, who knows – but not everyone is persuaded hydrogen is the clean energy panacea it’s marketed as.
Australian-American inventor and entrepreneur Saul Griffith knows the hydrogen landscape “intimately” and is far from convinced. “I’m not at all bullish on hydrogen,” he said at the Clean Energy Council’s It’s Electrifying webinar on Tuesday.
The sticking point for him, like many others, is how much energy hydrogen loses. He estimates about 25% is lost during electrolysis, compression loses a further 15%, and that’s before you even think about unloading and using the fuel. “I think Australia has a dangerous addiction to the hydrogen narrative and I think we need to be more realistic,” Griffith said.
To be fair, Australia isn’t alone in its hydrogen excitement. As Blackie explained when I asked about the reason for H2X’s many arms (H2X Australia, H2X global, H2X marine and counting), he said the company’s operations have move far quicker in some areas than others. The first cab off the rank? The Netherlands.
Australia can expect the company to launch its new hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle suite over the next 24 months.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/08/how-europes-carbon-border-tax-will-affect-australia/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,EUROPE,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",How Europe’s carbon border tax will affect Australia,"Exactly how the European Union’s carbon tariffs will look isn’t yet clear. What is clear is that they’re coming and they will impact Australia, especially if other countries follow suit.
Given federal resource minister Keith Pitt on Monday announced “reports of coal’s impending death are greatly exaggerated and its future is assured well beyond 2030,” it’s unsurprising our government’s reaction has been one of outrage and disbelief. While our leaders aren’t alone in their response (which has been a common thread among the world’s biggest fossil fuel exporters), the objections will likely be utterly irrelevant on a global stage.
The fact is, the EU (along with a number of other global superpowers) are radically upping their climate policy which, put simply, they need to make work. “The domestic politics are more important than the legal side of things,” Tennant Reed, a climate and energy expert at the Australian Industry Group (AI Group) said at yesterday’s webinar How will carbon tariffs affect Australian industry?
In all likelihood, Reed says the carbon border adjustments mechanism, or CBAM, could significantly increase profit margins for renewable players, buoying countries and companies who become early adopters of clean industrial processes.
As it stands, carbon-heavy industries including steel, iron, aluminium, cement, electricity and fertiliser will be the first affected.
Director of the trade analysis firm Article Three, Khalil Manaf Hegarty, said he doesn’t expect the new rules will affect “complex goods”, that is products with many different components, as the EU doesn’t have infinite reach. In the coming decades, however, Hegarty said it is fairly likely the EU will start looking further downstream, developing tariffs accordingly.
Compared to other global exporters in these industries, Reed said Australian isn’t tracking too badly in terms of Scope 1 or direct emissions. However, since our electricity grid remains, on average, quite carbon intensive, the electricity sector would need to continue rapid decarbonisation to ensure Australian industries remain competitive.
iI we can make our grid cleaner, Reed said: “we have every prospect of continuing to be fine no matter how many countries impose CBAMs.”
“If we fall behind, we could absolutely lose profitability, lose market share, and see industry go out the back door through others’ policies and a lack of our own,” he added.
CBAMs will inevitably increase the cost of goods from all of the above industries in the EU, Reed said. “How much the prices will rise for cement and steel, we’ll really have to wait and see but it won’t be nothing,” he added.
Given that this will be an across the board raise, affecting not only importers but also EU producers who will have to pay into the EU emissions trading scheme, the traditional extra cost of clean products will be far less visible to the market.
A fully clean producer, say a steel maker using green hydrogen, who is bearing the higher production costs associated with that clean technology, will find themselves at an advantage in future, according to Reed. Depending on how the mechanism works, that could mean their clean tech costs are offset, or if say Scope 2 and 3 (indirect emissions) are considered for something like aluminium, which is where most of the emissions lay, clean suppliers could find themselves with considerably higher profit margins.
Australia’s abundant renewable resources means we have massive potential to green our industries. Speaking at another webinar yesterday, the Clean Energy Council’s It’s Electrifying event, Australian-American inventor and entrepreneur Saul Griffith said:
“Australia has an enormous advantage in making the world’s lowest cost steel and aluminium because of our renewables,” adding that the potential will be squandered if we continue simply behaving like a global quarry and focussing our ambitions on exporting hydrogen, which requires monumental amounts of electricity to create.
At this stage, it’s difficult to say, but both Reed and Hegarty believe this is unlikely to stop the EU.
In terms of the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) rules, Hegarty said it doesn’t really matter if the mechanism is consistent with them. “They [the EU] are in a position where they can try things on and wait ten years to see if it gets knocked down.”
Australia exports considerably more carbon-intensive goods to the United States and Asian countries like Japan compared to the EU. If these countries also adopt carbon tariffs, it would be a “big deal,” Tennant said.
Neither Tennant nor Hegarty believe any meaningful level of global harmonisation of policies is likely though.  “One big CBAM is going to come about the same time as one big carbon price, which is never,” Tennant said.
Hegarty does expect supply chain regionalisation to be one of the mechanism’s major outcomes though.
Australia currently has nothing comparable to a carbon constraint, but we do have a safeguard mechanism which could be used, should leaders choose to, Reed said.
In terms of helping Australian industries facing tariffs, the most important thing, Reed said, will be for governments to supply industry with verified data, as data acceptance is the bulk of being involved in the scheme.
Outside of that, it’s crucial, he said, governments articulate goals and policies to help decarbonise on next three decades. More we can walk that path, the more confident we can be in being competitive in the carbon-adjusted future, he added.
Reed believes the aspiration for the policy is not for it to be a “cataclysmic change”  that destroys people, but rather for it to become part of the furniture. He posits that it’s not all too different from the normal border adjustments used globally everyday. Yes, the mechanisms are different but the hope is for it to become routine rather than controversial.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/08/wa-firms-as-green-hydrogen-frontier-mcgowans-new-50-million-fund-and-bps-plans-to-repurpose-oil-refinery/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",WA firms as green hydrogen frontier: McGowan’s new $50 million fund and bp’s plans to repurpose oil refinery,"Western Australia’s (WA) renewable hydrogen industry received a significant boost yesterday with the McGowan government’s announcement of new $50 million funding to drive green hydrogen ambitions. 
The funding builds on the $7.5 million commitment to kick-start the development of Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area as a green energy hub as well as $4 million for the State Government Renewable Hydrogen Unit in the state’s Mid-West and $900,000 toward three industry-led feasibility studies, including bp’s study into the production of green hydrogen at its Kwinana site. 
The Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area in the state’s Mid-West has some of the best solar and wind resources in the world. In September 2020 the WA government invited worldwide expressions of interest into its 1.5 GW green energy potential which attracted 65 responses, more than half of which came from international companies.
The $50 million of funding, included in the McGowan government’s 2021-22 Budget, is hoped to stimulate local demand for green hydrogen in both the transport and industrial sectors, to help WA meet its emissions reductions targets, and to progress in its ambition to become a green energy exporter.

“Hydrogen offers incredible potential for our State,” said Premier Mark McGowan, “with the capacity to sit alongside iron ore or LNG as a major export commodity – supporting local jobs and delivering wealth for all Western Australians. 
WA’s Hydrogen Industry Minister Alannah MacTiernan also highlighted renewable hydrogen as “a big opportunity for industries right across WA to reduce their emissions and embrace a cleaner future, and our funding commitment to demand stimulation will help companies take that leap.” 
bp’s Kwinana clean energy hub 
Along with $300,000 from the WA government’s existing $15 million Renewable Hydrogen Fund, and the support of Macquarie Capital, bp is set to embark on a feasibility study into the production of renewable hydrogen at its Kwinana Oil Refinery south of Perth. 
According to bp, the company’s plan is to repurpose the oil refinery into a clean energy hub for the production of renewable fuels. Frédéric Baudry, president of bp Australia and SVP fuels and low carbon solutions for the Asia Pacific, said the repurposing of Kwinana is “Guided by the Federal Government’s Low Emission Technology Investment Roadmap” and plans to advance “bp Kwinana’s contribution to the creation of domestic green value chains and the decarbonisation of Australia’s hard-to-abate sectors, particularly heavy industry, mining and transport.” 
Baudry added that “bp is committed to developing solutions that will help accelerate the energy transition in Australia. With our unique capabilities, bp can offer increasingly complex, multi-energy solutions to its partners and customers through their decarbonisation journey.”
Macquarie Capital’s co-head, John Pickhaver, noted that Australia, “and Kwinana in particular – has a number of use cases that support a meaningful green hydrogen industry.” 
Further studies 
In addition to bp’s feasibility study, APT Management Services and Global Energy Ventures (GEV) will each receive $300,000, with the former looking to study the conversion of the Parmelia gas pipeline into a 100% hydrogen pipeline, and the latter to evaluate the technical and commercial viability of exporting green hydrogen using compressed hydrogen shipping from the Gascoyne region in the state’s northwest to markets throughout the Asia Pacific. 
Global Energy Ventures
The Gascoyne is already the focus of global green hydrogen interest, including Province Resources’s HyEnergy Zero Carbon Hydrogen Project with French giant Total Eren. The project plans to install 8 GW of renewable energy in Gascoyne because of the region’s infrastructure, including the Dampier Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline and the North West Coastal Highway, both of which could prove crucial to a burgeoning green hydrogen export hub.
Toward that end, GEV is currently working on a 2,000t hydrogen carbon ship, although that would first require the successful build of its pilot-scale 430t C-H2 ship by the mid-2020s.

Beyond the batteries that will represent the bulk of the energy storage capacity needed to keep the energy transition moving forward, a variety of other chemical conversion processes promises to address needs for long-term energy storage, as well as a range of other smaller scale use cases in chemical production and other areas.
Hydrogen production is the leader in this space, and even this struggles to keep up with the costs and efficiency of batteries. However, a group of scientists working to understand the genetics of a bacteria called Shewanella oneidensis, say they have made a rare discovery that could open up pathways to engineering different bacteria to produce synthetic fuels from carbon dioxide and electricity.
“There are only a very small number of microbes that can really store renewable electricity,” said Buz Barstow, assistant professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We want to make one. And in order to do that we need to know the genes that are involved in getting the electrons into the cell.”
The group created a technique it calls ‘knockout sudoku’, where it inactivates individual genes to determine their function. Using this, they were able to identify a new set of genes that is central to the initial electron uptake process that would make energy storage possible. “We found a lot of genes that we already knew about for getting electrons out of the cell are also involved in getting electrons in,” Barstow said. “Then we also found this totally new set of genes that nobody’s ever seen before that are needed to get electrons into the cell.”
The pathway for these electrons is outlined in the paper Identification of a pathway for electron uptake in Shewanella oneidensis, published in communications biology. The group found that the electron uptake process is highly efficient and could easily be scaled up. They were also able identify similar genes in many different bacteria. Barstow says he plans to experiment with adding the newly discovered genes to E-coli – since this is one of the most studied and well understood bacteria. The researchers also state several other pathways – optimising the shewanella oneidensis bacteria, and studying other metal-oxidising microbes, will be opened up by this research.
“Engineered bacteria powered by electrons opens the door for using renewable energy for making biofuels, food, chemicals, and for carbon sequestration,” the group concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/08/australian-researchers-develop-direct-solar-to-hydrogen-generation-tech/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2021",Australian researchers develop direct solar-to-hydrogen generation tech,"From pv magazine Global
A group of researchers from the Australian National University and the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has developed a new technology for direct solar hydrogen generation (DSTH) which is claimed to achieve a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of around 20%.
In DSTH projects, the electricity generated by a PV unit is used to directly drive water-splitting redox reactions without the need for an electrolyser or complex power infrastructure. Commercial viability, however, is far from being achieved, despite efficiencies close to 19%, due to the use of expensive semiconductors and noble-metal catalysts. “Our demonstrated system uses inexpensive semiconductors and low-cost, Ni-based catalysts, presenting a great potential for scaling up,” researcher Siva Karuturi told pv magazine. “Further work on [the] design of large scale water splitting cells, together [with the] commercial availability of tandem perovskite-silicon solar cells could ultimately pave the way for industrial production.”
The integrated water-splitting cell developed by the Australian group is based on a “flower-stem” morphology and is planned to rely on a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode made of NiMo alloy, which is a non-noble-metal-based efficient catalyst for HER due to its appropriate hydrogen binding energy and excellent alkali corrosion. This electrode is then coupled with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode made of low-cost nickel-iron alloy (NiFE) that, in turn, offers an excellent OER catalytic activity.
DSHT systems are usually built with two or more single PV cells, due to the relatively high voltage requirements of the water-splitting reaction. The demonstrated system, by contrast, is powered by a single, 24.3%-efficient tandem perovskite-silicon solar cell based on a perovskite cell with a power conversion efficiency of 15.3%, an “unprecedented” open-circuit voltage of 1.271 V, a short circuit current density of 17.8 mA/cm-2, and a fill factor of 68%. “The high voltage obtained in our work proved to be decisive in optimal matching of the power generated by the tandem cell and the energy needed by the catalyst electrodes to split water, thereby resulting in high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency,” Karuturi explained.
The surface of the perovskite layer was passivated with an organic cation known as n-dodecylammonium bromide (C12H28BrN), which consists of a long alkyl chain. The tandem cell was linked to the cell catalyst electrodes with wired connections.
The scientists said their analysis demonstrated that the proposed system may achieve solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 20% at a levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) estimated at $4.10/kg. “Improving solely the perovskite cell could enhance the STH efficiency close to 25%,” they concluded. “Combined with future reductions in the PV panel and membrane costs, an LCOH of $2.30/kg-1 could be achieved, presenting a remarkable opportunity to realise cheap renewable hydrogen.”
The findings of the research can be found in the paper Direct Solar Hydrogen Generation at 20% Efficiency Using Low-Cost Materials, which was recently published in Advanced Energy Materials. “To make the DSTH technology practically viable, essential next steps are: reactor optimisation to produce H2 gas at scale in a cost-effective manner, and achiev[ing the] technology readiness needed for market adoption,” Karuturi concluded.
