https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/06/we-wont-sell-solar-in-the-south-west-changes-in-wa-force-installers-into-impossible-position/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 6, 2022",‘We won’t sell solar in the South West’: changes in WA force installers into impossible position,"It may seem innocuous, but a new mandate for Western Australian properties to install a main switch circuit breaker with any new or updated solar system is proving ruinous for both installation companies and households in the region, they claim.
Effectively the new rule means regional and rural households in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) can no longer use, for instance, induction cooktops while running air conditioning without tripping their grid connection, let alone even consider charging an electric vehicle (EV).
The problem here is not the solar systems, but properties’ electrical supply allocation, issued by the region’s sole network operator Western Power Corporation, owned by the state government. 
Why solar companies have been wrapped into this strange bind is that the property’s allocation limit only becomes visible when major “notifiable” electrical work, like installing a rooftop PV system, is completed.
“It’s crucifying the solar industry,” one installer tells pv magazine Australia. He, along with a number of other regional installers pv magazine Australia has spoken to, did not want to be identified for fear of deteriorating their already strained relationship with Western Power.
The installers believe they are far from the only ones adversely impacted by Western Power’s ‘Basic Embedded Generator Connection Technical Requirements’ which became mandatory in February this year.

“I don’t think the industry realised the implications [of the rule changes] until after it became mandatory,” Malcolm Scott, the Technical Services Officer for the Western Australia chapter of NECA, the National Electrical Contractors Association, tells pv magazine Australia.
NECA has already been hearing from vexed members, and Scott expects the issue will only grow as the circuit breakers begin to impact more households. “People in those areas aren’t going to put up with it,” he says, adding the changes could become something of a “political minefield” for the government.
As it stands, Ian Holland from Sunwise Energy Australia – one of the largest in the South West region, says the changes have wiped out between 20% to 30% of his market. 
On the household side, a customer of one of the installers, who we’ll call Bryce, can no longer put on their electric oven while the aircon is running without their circuit breaker disconnecting them from the grid. Until the situation is rectified, the customer is refusing to pay Bryce, leaving him on the hook.
This particular rule change is a measure to bring the amount of electricity households draw back into line with regional networks capacities. “Load creep and generation needs to be effectively managed to ensure the stability of the network and provision of a reliable energy supply for all users,” Western Power tells pv magazine Australia.
The problem for the solar installers is that while such measures may be necessary, today they primarily impact households and businesses installing renewable systems – the exact technology needed to realise Australia’s decarbonisation. 
Whether or not it was intentional, the rule’s effect “will drive people away from solar,” Scott notes.
The standard electrical supply allocation for households in Perth and major towns in Western Australia is 63 amps. The standard, however, drops by almost half, to 32 amps, for regional and rural households.*
Western Power says this allocation is “substantially more than the actual maximum demand used for most homes.” A claim one installer, who we’ll call Todd, described as “laughable.”
Malcom Scott and installers Ian Holland and Bryce all agree 32 amp is simply not enough to run a house today.

Todd calculates a household with an electric oven, an electric hot water system, a water pump and air conditioner would have a maximum draw of 65 amps. “To suggest that a ‘normal’ house has a maximum demand of less than 32 amps is simply not true. Why shouldn’t country residents be allowed to have air conditioning?”
Western Power’s electrical supply allocation for regional and rural households hasn’t changed (which may also be part of the problem), but until now their electrical systems have been set up in a way which allows them to draw considerably more power than their official allocation.
In other words, while the allocation has long been 32 amps, few households have run into problems because their main switch didn’t actually limit maximum demand. 
But as regional network capacities have stagnated, the amount of power households are draw has changed drastically.

In the regions, the rollout of the same electricity intensive appliances is more problematic than in the city. “Unfortunately, the infrastructure is not there to support it,” Scott says, noting the capacity of regional transformers is simply too small for modern – and electrifying – households. “It’s almost discrimination against country people,” he adds.
Unfair as this is, Western Power is also in a rather unenviable position. It is responsible for integrating the new two-way flows of energy from solar systems into a network not designed for it and which covers vast distances. “Nowhere else in Australia do they have such long lengths on line with so few customers,” Scott says.
This increase in the electricity properties draw, it seems, is becoming insurmountable for Western Power, and it has now enacted a measure to force households to stick to the official allocation.
Installers Holland and Bryce can see the logic here and agree regional households have likely been exceeding their electricity allotment – but note Western Power would have long known this. “If they don’t, then what are they doing?” Bryce says.
“They’ve known for long enough and they should have imposed these restrictions on these properties prior to now, prior to the people doing applications for solar,” he adds.
This is really the heart of the issue for the installers: households and their businesses are being punished for installing technology which decreases a household’s demand on the grid.
“Why are they allowing people who aren’t putting solar on to get away with it?” Bryce said.

“You’ve either got to make it a hard and fast rule across every property or give leeway to those putting batteries in to have a higher draw because they’re protecting the network,” Bryce says.
Since the installers see the rule changes as a deterrent for solar customers, they believe it will open the door to “unscrupulous operators” who won’t warn customers about the circuit breakers and instead leave them to find out when their power trips.
“Most retailers aren’t telling customers about this,” Todd says. For the last few months, he has spent countless hours explaining the implications. “I’m getting people looking at me flabbergasted,” he says. He’s had multiple customers pull the pin on installing big systems, sometimes in the order of $60,000. “It’s an absolute killer for us.”
Not telling customers their power will constantly trip following a solar installation is not something Holland, nor Todd nor Bryce, feel is ethical business practice though.
“We can’t ethically sell them this product because of the arrangement put in place by the network provider,” Holland says. Formerly, farming properties on two-phase 16 amp (Western Power later increased the amperage to 20) connection made up 20 – 30% of Sunwise’s market. Now, when Holland hears a property has this type of connection, he halts the quoting process, so as not to waste their time and his.

If it isn’t customers being left in the dark, Bryce thinks the alternative could see companies get curly with Western Power’s rules. “People work out ways of getting around it,” he says. “That’s what it’s going to create.”
“There’s no way around this, legally.”
This isn’t strictly true – there is a legal solution and it is for properties to officially increase their supply allocation through Western Power. That, or to go off grid. Both of these options would likely set customers back by tens of thousands of dollars.
“Nothing is going to be cheap,” Bryce said. “You’re talking about an $1800 application fee [for a Western Power supply increase] for a start. Then the next phase is another application costing $5,000, and then after that it’s going to be whatever the recommendations are.” He estimates his customer who currently can’t run two major appliances concurrently might be on the hook for as much as $250,000.
The other option, going off grid to install a renewables could be attractive to some properties, but Todd – who specialises in off grid systems – says for many this is a suboptimal solution. To get a property completely off grid requires about triple the equipment compared to supplying the majority of a household’s demand through behind the meter solar and batteries while remaining connected to the grid.
As Holland put it: “Customers are spending more money on more stuff to achieve less CO2 reductions.”
While that might be true for households, the picture looks different from Western Power’s end. The corporation is at the global forefront of rolling out what’s known as standalone power systems, off grid systems which typically comprise of solar PV panels coupled with a battery and, where necessary, a back-up diesel generator.

Western Power has had great successes with the systems, which are proving more reliable for customers and help decarbonise their network. 
It’s worth mentioning this because it highlights where Western Power finds itself: acutely aware that highly dispersed networks like theirs will radically change shape in the next decades of the clean energy transition. 
Instead of running long lengths of power lines, which are vulnerable to the elements and expensive to lay, renewable technologies make it possible to create smaller decentralised systems which are cheaper, more reliable and better for the environment.
The fact is, however, these transformations take time. NECA’s Malcom Scott believes Western Power probably do have a long-term plan in mind, but for the problems facing its grid now, there’s no quick fix.
He believes Western Power is going to have to upgrade its network, “but that’s not a quick solution either.”
“If people go off grid, that will alleviate the problem, to a degree.”

Installer Bryce, who has been working in the industry for 17 years, said he’s heard a number of his peers considering walking away from solar for regional customers. 
When asked how many local businesses have been impacted by the recent changes, he said: “show me a solar company that sells in regional WA that isn’t.” 
“The last 12 months have been the hardest in industry ever,” he says. “It’s getting time to walk away.”

* Depending upon customer’s supply arrangements they may have either 32 amp for single phase or 16 amp per phase for three phase connections. Two 16 amp connections was also the norm for two phase properties, but this was recently increased to 20 amps by Western Power.

 The 12 finalists, which have now been invited to submit full applications to ARENA’s $100 million Large Scale Battery Storage Round, were selected from a pool of 54 Expressions of Interest (EOIs). 
Aggregated, the shortlisted projects have a capacity of 3050 MW / 7000 MWh (or 3 GW / 7 GWh) and have a combined value of $3.7 billion.
“We are really encouraged by the number and quality of applications to the round; it’s shaping up to be very competitive,” ARENA Acting CEO Chris Faris said.
The funding aims to see battery storage projects with advanced inverters, also known as grid-forming inverters, rolled out across Australia. These inverters enable batteries to provide essential system services traditionally provided by synchronous generation such as coal or gas.
“Advanced inverters that can help stabilise the grid are the missing piece of the puzzle that will support the transition to 100% renewable energy penetration for short periods,” Faris added.
Under the competitive round, the shortlisted projects will ultimately be vying for up to $100 million in ARENA grant funding to support both new build projects and retrofits for existing batteries nationally, with each battery to be at least 70 MW.
AEMO’s 2022 Integrated System Plan, of which the final version was published just last week, identifies a growing need for storage in Australia, saying a trebling of firming capacity in the National Electricity Market with more than 60 GW of dispatchable generation and storage is required by 2050.
ARENA expects to announce the successful battery projects later this year.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/06/queensland-takes-out-14-of-the-top-15-performing-solar-assets-in-june/,"HIGHLIGHTS,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 6, 2022",Queensland takes out 14 of the top 15 performing solar assets in June,"The top performing solar farms in June were Genex Power’s Kidston solar farm, recording a capacity factor of 23%. It was followed by Pacific Hydro Australia’s Haughton stage 1 solar farm, at a capacity factor of 22.4%, and Adani Australia’s Rugby Run solar farm, with 22.4% AC CF,  Rystad senior analyst in renewables research, David Dixon, outlines.

All these solar farms are located in Queensland, where in fact 14 of the top 15 are housed. Just one, the 146 MW (DC) Gunnedah Solar Farm west of Tamworth, made it in from New South Wales.
It wasn’t only the utility segment where Queensland shone, but also residential. Recent analysis from SunWiz found the state, one of Australia’s most coal reliant and also most affected by the sky rocketing fossil fuel prices, saw a major uptick in small scale installations.
In June, installs rose 33% in Queensland, compared to just 9% in NSW.
If Queensland won solar in June, wind won Australia. “It was all about wind in June with all wind assets in the NEM and the WEM generating 2839 GWh, wind’s highest month on record,” Dixon said. 
“Wind generation overtook brown coal to become Australia’s second largest source of electricity generation in June.

“This is a trend that will continue over the next 24 months as a further 3.5 GW of wind assets at various stages of construction and commissioning become fully operational,” Dixon added.
Both Tasmania and Victoria set wind generation records, with Victoria becoming the first state to generate more than terawatt hour from wind within a month.

These communities pay far more for electricity than Australians living in cities and towns, although their connections are often disrupted, unreliable and extremely dirty – generated from on site diesel generator sets.
New technologies like solar and batteries available today mean remote communities can get better power more affordably, but turning the potential into reality is proving somewhat more difficult. 
Alan Langworthy, Managing Director of Power Systems Consultants, has long been working on this question and is critical of what he sees as the current approach of the Territory’s Power and Water Corporation, in which solar arrays are being built next to community’s diesel generator sets, feeding directly into this system and saving the generator diesel costs rather than providing any savings to the communities themselves.
“It’s ridiculous because there’s no benefit to the community at all,’ Langworthy told pv magazine Australia. None, that is, outside of communities seeing less smoke coming out the gen set’s exhaust.
The new report, funded by by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Australian Photovoltaics Institute (APVI), and conducted by Ekistica, a technical consultancy firm based in Central Australia, is also critical of this model.
While the question of community benefit was outside of the report’s scope, its authors Lachlan McLeod and Sandeep Nimmakayalu noted such considerations are vital. 

What the report does focus on is the cold, hard economics of which system is cheaper to install. The verdict is rooftop solar, according to the three communities where modelling was done: Kaltukatjara, Lajamanu, and Maningrida.
This comes with the caveat that if additional hardware like a battery or other expenses associated with integrating the rooftop systems exceeds $500,000, then rooftop loses its economic edge over ground mounted systems.
While Langworthy applauded the report, he also says rooftop systems may throw up challenges not only because connecting systems to social housing, like that in remote communities of the NT, is a regulatory nightmare, but also because there is a community equity issue. 
Not all roofs face in the right direction or are suitable for solar, for instance. And if a house becomes unoccupied, no one benefits from the system at all. 
If the community is coming together to pay for these solar systems, how do you get around the fact not everyone will benefit equally? 
The model Langsworthy suggests is communities install ground mounted systems which wirelessly connect to the prepaid meters used in remote communities so that each household can have their power allocation credited directly. “Nobodies ever done that before,” he adds. 
He proposes the amount of energy each household is allocated from the array be a percentage based on the number of the people living in the house. So a house with five people would be allocated more power from the array than a house with two people, though individually each person would have the same allocation.
Such a model, he says, mirrors the benefit of rooftop solar in that the power goes directly to the households in the community rather than the generator, but also gets around the issue that all roofs are not made equal.

“For us, agrivoltaics is above all a collective project,” Jean-Michel Lamothe, a farmer in France’s Landes department and vice president of the French Federation of agrivoltaic producers (FFPA), told pv magazine.
Lamothe is also leading the Pujo Arbouts Territoire Agrivoltaïsme (PATAV), an association of 35 farmers spread across the six municipalities of Castandet, Vignau, Maurrin, Hontanx, Pujo-le-Plan and Saint-Gein.
“In our area, hydrologists have traced a perimeter of 1,400 hectares, where groundwater shows a concentration of pesticide metabolites above the regulatory limit of 2 μg/L,” Lamothe explained. “This situation is the result of the intensive use that has been made in the past of phytosanitary products and herbicides on corn fields.”
According to Lamothe, the nature of the land currently makes it difficult to implement organic farming. “This is why we opted for an agrivoltaic solution,” he stated. Due to the low water quality, operators have no other choice but to cultivate new species, which will make it possible to recreate biodiversity but, at the same time, will offer less productivity. “We decided to grow plants rich in omega-3s, which respond well to our water quality problem and the climate of the region: flax, chia, camelina, rapeseed, and sunflower,” he further explained. “And we will compensate for the drop in productivity with revenues from photovoltaics.”

The group of entrepreneurs is now partnering with Green Lighthouse Development (GLHD) on solar projects. The company wants to use monofacial panels installed on trackers at a height of 1.2 m from the ground, with the module rows having a 9 m distance to allow the passage of the harvester cutter bars under the panels.“In May, we experienced an episode of high heat and drought,” Lamothe said. “Under the panels, which retained the evapotranspiration of the plants, we found that the plants were greener and better developed than between the rows. So we think the return will be higher than what we originally estimated.”
Only 700 hectares of the 1,400 hectares in the area will be equipped with solar panels. “Our ambition is indeed to maintain agricultural activity on our land, despite the decrease in water quality. This requires several sources of income.” Harvesting machinery and production packaging equipment will also be pooled.
The objective is also to create value for the whole territory through the taxes paid to the municipalities. At present, farmers hope to obtain authorisations in early 2023 for financing finalised in late 2023-early 2024 and commissioning in early 2025. “We will have to go to ‘zero-phyto’ on our crops,” Lamothe concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/06/german-consortium-plans-to-build-worlds-largest-heat-pump/,"HIGHLIGHTS,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JULY 6, 2022",German consortium plans to build world’s largest heat pump,"From pv magazine Global
German chemical producer Basf and Germany-based storage specialist Man Energy have unveiled a plan to build a large-scale, high-temperature heat pump at Basf’s Ludwigshafen site, in the Rhineland-Palatinate region.
The two companies said in a joint statement that they are currently conducting a feasibility study for the project, which is the world’s largest heat pump ever planned to date.
“The planned large-scale heat pump will enable production of steam using electricity from renewable energy, tapping waste heat from the cooling water system at BASF as a source of thermal energy,” the statement reads. “The residual heat in the water will be processed using compression to produce steam that will be fed into the site’s steam network.”
According to Basf, its industrial site in Ludwigshafen has an annual steam demand of 20 million MT. “By integrating the planned heat pump into the site’s production infrastructure, up to 150 metric tons of steam can be produced per hour, equivalent to a thermal output of 120 megawatts,” the company said. “At the same time, it would make the cooling water system more efficient and less dependent on climate and weather conditions.”
Basf utilises steam at the site to dry products, heat up reactors, and distilling. Currently, this demand is covered by heat coming from different production facilities located at the site, as well as gas and steam power plants.
The project is aimed at helping the two companies in gaining experience in the use of industrial-scale heat pumps and to assess the applicability of similar projects at other sites. “The feasibility study’s findings with regard to the economic viability, efficiency and competitiveness of the technology will form the basis for the subsequent decision-making process for the construction of the heat pump,” the two companies said, adding that the first results should be available by the end of this year.
