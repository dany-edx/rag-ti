The portfolio includes the 200 MW (dc) Wellington Solar Farm and the 107 MW (dc) West Wyalong Solar Farm, both in New South Wales (NSW), as well as the 210 MW (dc) Woolooga solar farm in Queensland. These plants are already in operation. Also included in the sale are the 400 MW (dc) Wellington North and 90 MW (dc) Wunghnu solar projects that are due to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2024.
Lightsource bp APAC Managing Director Adam Pegg said the sale is part of the company’s normal recycling of capital to accelerate renewable asset growth.
“There have been a number of headwinds facing the renewable industry over the past five years, and I am proud that to date we have been able to develop quality projects and deliver value in Australia,” he said.
“We will use the proceeds from this sale to accelerate the development of our pipeline across the APAC region, advancing exciting projects in New Zealand, Taiwan, and South Korea, as well as continuing to be a leader in Australia.”
Lightsource bp, which will be wholly owned by British oil and gas company bp under a deal announced earlier this month, has a solar and battery storage portfolio of more than 7.5 GW across Australia and New Zealand.
Among its projects are the 520 MW Goulburn River, the 840 MW Sandy Creek, and the 400 MW Gundary solar projects all in NSW, and the 364 MW West Mokoan Solar Farm in Victoria.
It is also exploring other investment opportunities in the sector, including wind, battery storage, and integration with green hydrogen production.
BJEI Australia Chairman Warwick Smith said the acquisition of the solar projects took the company’s Australian portfolio to more than 2 GW in planned, under construction and operational projects. Among its projects is the 290 MW Wollar Solar Farm which is being built near Mudgee in central west New South Wales
“The acquisition further underpins BJEI Australia’s commitment to the Australian renewable energy market,” he said. “Purchasing these five assets is an exciting next step in the Beijing Energy group’s growth in Australia and complements its current portfolio of solar and wind projects.”
Smith said the acquisition is part of the company’s long-term strategy to float the company on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2024 so it can be majority owned by the Australian public.
“Delivering a renewable energy company of this size and scale to the Australian market will allow for the continued growth of the business and for the Australian public to share in the long-term success of the company moving forward,” he said.

“We are pleased to have been able to successfully and safely execute another segment of our ‘pit to battery’ strategy,” AVL Chief Executive Officer Graham Arvidson said.
“Production of AVL’s first vanadium electrolyte will position the company to become a trusted supplier for battery projects in Australia and the wider region.”
AVL said the commissioning of the facility has already commenced with first vanadium electrolyte production targeted for 2024.
The facility, funded in part by a $3.69 million Australian government Modern Manufacturing Initiative grant, will utilise electrolyte manufacturing technology licensed from United States-based specialty chemical producer U.S. Vanadium (USV).
The vanadium pentoxide used for electrolyte manufacture will also be sourced from USV initially, prior to supply being available from AVL’s own Australian Vanadium Project being developed near the mining town of Meekatharra in Western Australia’s mid-west.
AVL said vanadium electrolyte produced at the new Perth facility will initially be employed in VFB projects being developed by subsidiary VSUN Energy and will allow AVL to qualify its product with key global VFB manufacturers.
VSUN has already inked a series of supply agreements including with Western Australia’s regional power provider Horizon Power which has signed an agreement for the purchase of a 78 kW/220 kWh VFB that will be installed at Kununurra as part of a long-duration energy storage pilot program.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/18/trina-lands-development-consent-for-200-mw-nsw-solar-farm/,"INSTALLATIONS,SUSTAINABILITY,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CHINA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Trina lands development consent for 200 MW NSW solar farm,"The New South Wales (NSW) Independent Planning Commission (IPC) has conditionally approved China-headquartered manufacturing giant Trina Solar’s development application for the 200 MW Glenellen Solar Farm to be built near Albury in the Riverina region.
The $250 million project, being developed on approximately 300 hectares of land near Jindera, about 16 kilometres north of Albury, had been referred to the commission for determination because at least 50 people objected to the proposed project.
The NSW Department of Planning and Environment, which completed its assessment of the Glenellen Solar Farm in October, received 107 public submissions, including 79 objections, many of them concerned about the impact on agricultural resources.
In assessing the merits of the project, the IPC found that the proposed site is “suitable for renewable energy development given its location close to existing electricity transmission networks, topography, solar resources, avoidance of major environmental constraints, access to the regional road network and that the agri-solar component [of the project] allows for the continued use of the land for grazing and cropping.”
The IPC said it acknowledged the concerns of community members but concluded the project is in the “public interest” and that the impacts of the development could be mitigated through strict conditions of consent. These include additional on-site vegetation screening and further consultation by Trina with nearby landowners on minimising visual impact.
The commission also determined that the developer must maintain the agricultural land capability of the site which has been predominantly used for grazing of sheep and cattle, with infrequent cropping of fodder to support the grazing.
Trina has already made a number of changes to the project design to address issues raised in submissions, including increasing vegetation screening around the project site, reducing the number of solar panels by about 23,000, and increasing the spacing between the rows of solar panels from six metres to nine metres to facilitate more sheep grazing.

Trina, which is aiming to deliver more than 6.5 GW of large-scale renewable projects in Australia, said sheep grazing and cropping of lucerne for fodder will be re-introduced ‘at scale’ once the Glenellen Solar Farm is complete, with the project only resulting in a 25% reduction in productive sheep carrying capacity across the site.
“Post construction, it is proposed that the balance of land that is not occupied by solar farm infrastructure would continue to be used for agricultural purposes such as sheep grazing, resulting in only a minor net change to the existing land-use situation,” the company said.
Trina also said construction of the Glenellen Solar Farm will bring considerable investment to the region with the project expected to generate about 200 jobs during the build, and up to 10 new jobs once the solar farm is operational.
The solar plant will include about 395,000 bifacial PV panels mounted on a single-axis tracking system. Once operational, the facility is expected to generate more than 440,000 MWh of clean electricity annually and will connect to the electrical grid via an existing 330 kV transmission line that directly crosses the proposed project area.
The project will be located in close proximity to the South-West Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), one of five REZs planned for NSW to host wind, solar and battery projects as the state transforms its coal-reliant energy system.
Approval from the IPC comes less than a week after it granted conditional approval for the 215 MW Oxley Solar Farm and coupled 50 MW/50 MWh battery being developed near Armidale in the state’s New England region.
The Riverina Murray region of NSW has attracted considerable interest from solar developers with three approved solar farms within 50 kilometres of the Glenellen project. These include the 130 MW Jindera Solar Farm which is located little more than 300m north-west of the Glenellen project.
Other nearby projects include FRV’s 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm, located approximately 18 km to the north, and French company Neoen’s 350 MW Culcairn Solar Farm and energy storage facility which is located about 21 km to the north.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/18/waste-heat-from-pv-panels-used-to-generate-residential-hot-water/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 18, 2023",Waste heat from PV panels used to generate residential hot water,"From pv magazine global
Researchers at the Multiphysics Interaction Lab (MiLab) in Los Angeles have developed a new photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system design that uses waste heat from PV panels to generate residential hot water systems. The system is based on parallel water pipes that are attached to the backside of the solar panels and reduce their operating temperatures.
“Our study introduces a simple and practical cooling approach that enhances the electrical efficiency of PV panels while simultaneously offering a sustainable solution to residential hot water needs,” the scientists said.
The experimental system relies on a south-oriented 250 W polycrystalline PV panel with a temperature coefficient of -0.45%/C and a tilt angle of 30 degrees. The copper cooling pipes are connected via upstream and downstream headers and are covered by an aluminum cover to secure them to the backside of the PV panel.
The experimental set-up includes a hot water storage tank and an 11 W centrifugal pump that maintains a constant flow rate of 3 L/min.

“The water flow rate is monitored using a flowmeter,” the scientists explained. “To gather accurate data, a set of thermocouples is strategically placed to simultaneously measure various temperatures, including the inlet and outlet water temperatures of the PV/T system, the PV panel’s surface temperature, and the ambient air temperature.”
The system also uses a multimeter to measure the PV module’s output power and a pyranometer to assess solar radiation.
The academics compared the performance of the cooled PV panel to a reference panel without cooling during May at the Notre Dame University-Louaize campus, located in Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon.

Their analysis showed that the PVT panel can generate 4% more power than the PV module, thanks to the cooling effect of the copper pipes. They also warned, however, that a saturation effect related to the hot water stored in the tank not being effectively utilized, may limit the ability to optimally cool the PV modules at a certain stage.
“This reduction is likely due to the absence of residential water demand in the waste heat recovery system,” the researchers further explained. “This absence causes the cooling water temperature in the hot water reservoir to gradually increase, reducing thus the rate of heat removal from the PVT system.”
The tests also showed that the PVT panel achieved an average electric efficiency of 11.5% while the PV panel without cooling reached an average efficiency of 10%. The scientists also revealed that the PVT system’s total efficiency reached around 75% and that of the reference PV system was only about 10%.
“The average thermal efficiency, representing the ratio of recovered waste heat to the solar energy absorbed by the PV panel, was approximately 60% in the cooled PV/T system,” they also stated. “The cooled PV/T system not only generated a higher fraction of electric power but also exhibited an approximately 40% higher rate of heat loss from the back side of the PV module, indicating the efficient waste heat recovery.”
The system was presented in the paper “An experimental analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic thermal system through parallel water pipe integration,” published in the International Journal of Thermofluids.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/18/solars-success-story-could-soon-be-over-says-solarpower-europe/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,EUROPE",ANGELA SKUJINS,"DECEMBER 18, 2023","Solar’s ‘success story’ could soon be over, says SolarPower Europe","From pv magazine global
Solar has been installed at “record-breaking” speed in the European Union for the third year in a row, said SolarPower Europe Chief Executive Officer Walburga Hemetsberger ahead of a recently published report.
According to the report, member states installed a combined total of 56 GW in the last 12 months – consistent with three years of 40% year-on-year gains. Germany took the top spot by installing 14.1 GW, followed by Spain with 8.2 GW, Italy with 4.8 GW, Poland with 4.6 GW and the Netherlands with 4.1 GW.
But this “success story” could soon be over, SolarPower Europe cautions, with the past three years of “extremely fast growth” expected to slow as energy prices dip to pre-crisis levels and the PV development landscape becoming increasingly “aggravated” by an “inflationary environment” plagued with high-interest rates. The association forecasts next year’s growth to only be 11%.
Residential demand for rooftop solar has also slowed, with a one-year minimum wait for utility-scale legislative instruments to take effect, said SolarPower Europe.
“Despite impressive achievements until now, solar is reaching a critical juncture at which the further growth path for the lowest cost, most versatile, and most simply deployable power technology will be decided on,” according to the report.
SolarPower Europe Policy Director Dries Acke said it is “fortunate” that extreme energy prices are not driving solar’s achievements but this means governments should pick up the slack.
“We cannot accept grid connection times of more than 4 years, we cannot allow slow local progress on permitting, we cannot risk trade barriers slowing deployment, nor miss the chance to re-shore European solar manufacturing,” he said. “That does mean; however, the onus is back on policymakers to ensure good investment conditions for solar.”
According to the report, the European Union’s total installed is currently 263 GW – a 27% increase from last year – with 2025 installation figures forecasted to be 73.8 GW followed by 84.2 GW in 2026 and 93.1 GW in 2027.
The association recommends policy amendments to support solar expansion in Europe. This includes the European Central Bank lowering the cost of capital for “green investments,” improving grid flexibility, nurturing the workforce, improving permitting processes, and scaling up sustainable, “diversified” solar supply chains.
SolarPower Europe said that trade defense “instruments” are not part of the solution as investigating and implementing trade barriers on solar is a “lose-lose strategy for Europe.”
SolarPower Europe and another major player in the solar debate, the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), have recently been at loggerheads over whether the European Union should limit products from entering the region made from alleged forced labor.
SolarPower Europe said in the report that it “looks forward” to the first European Commission’s environmental rules for solar taking effect, as well as the upcoming Forced Labour Ban Act and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. These initiatives will help the supply chain become “more sustainable, transparent and free of any links to forced labor,” it said.
The association also said it had called on EU decision-makers to recognize its Solar Stewardship Initiative (SSI) in legislation to ensure “transparency” across the global solar value chain.
