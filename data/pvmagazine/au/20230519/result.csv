Daisy Downs provides about 25% of the land BP estimates it needs for the proposed Geraldton Export-Scale Renewable Investment (GERI) which would eventually comprise 10 GW of renewable energy generation capacity used to produce renewable hydrogen and convert it to a carrier such as ammonia. BP is targeting sales to domestic and international markets in the 2030s.
“What we wanted to do here was really access one big tranche of land quickly to demonstrate that we are serious about developing this project,” BP spokesman James Foley told the ABC. “It also gives us some flexibility around what we can do on the land. Wind and solar will be the main aim [but] we may look at opportunities to turn it into hydrogen on the site.”
BP said phase one of the GERI project seeks to develop about 3 GW of wind and solar with the green hydrogen and ammonia expected to be exported from the state government’s planned Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area, about 20km north of Geraldton.
The company was recently granted 220ha of land alongside the proposed port at Oakajee as the state government looks to fast-track the development of green hydrogen projects in the area.
BP is also reportedly negotiating with landowners in the mid-west to access an additional 73,000 hectares to expand its renewable generation infrastructure further.
BP, which acquired a stake in the 26 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) project in WA’s Pilbara last year, has set its sights on establishing a similar project in the Geraldton region based on the positive findings of a feasibility study into the potential of the area.
When the findings of the study were released, BP Australia President Frédéric Baudry said they confirmed the potential for scaled-up green hydrogen production in WA.
“This looks particularly promising in the mid-west of WA, which has existing infrastructure, access to land and abundant renewable energy resources such as wind and solar,” he said. “Importantly, our study also confirmed strong demand from potential customers in the hard-to-abate sectors, and for both local and export markets.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/19/powerlink-extends-payment-plan-to-smooth-way-for-transmission-infrastructure/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 19, 2023",Powerlink extends payment plan to smooth way for transmission infrastructure,"The Queensland government-owned Powerlink has outlined a new payment framework that “significantly boosts” payments to an estimated $300,000 per kilometre for landholders hosting new transmission infrastructure on their properties and also provides financial packages to landholders with properties adjacent to newly constructed transmission lines.
Queensland landholders whose properties are traversed by a transmission easement are already entitled to payments but Powerlink said under the new SuperGrid Landholder Payment Framework, owners of properties neighbouring its new infrastructure will also receive payments.
Powerlink said the new framework will provide payments for owners of adjacent land within, or partially within, a one-kilometre radius of a new transmission line. The payment will be calculated on the amount of land located within this zone.
“We are the first transmission entity in Australia to offer a payment of this type,” the network operator said.
Powerlink said the revised framework also significantly boosts payments to landholders hosting new transmission infrastructure with the increase in payments based on property-specific values and impacts, as opposed to using only a flat rate. It will also improve flexibility around the timing of payments, offering an annual payment option, and giving payment estimates to landholders much earlier in the process.
Powerlink Chief Executive Paul Simshauser said the new payment framework was settled on after a review sparked by rising community expectations and the release of the Queensland government’s $62 billion Energy and Jobs Plan.
The state is aiming to supply 70% of its energy demand from renewables by 2032, and 80% by 2035. It plans to reach these targets by constructing what it’s calling the ‘Queensland SuperGrid’ – a massive fit out of solar, wind, battery and hydrogen generators connected through publicly-owned transmission assets.
“Increasing landholder and community expectations, together with the release of the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan, had prompted a review of Powerlink’s approach,” Simshauser said, adding the new framework will see landholders receive a fair payment to recognise the important role they have in allowing the network operator to deliver critical infrastructure.
“Providing landholders with greater flexibility around the timing of payments, with both up-front and annual payment options now available, was important – along with ensuring the new framework considered the variance in property values across different regions, rather than applying a blanket approach,” he said.
Simshauser said the new framework was guided by a reference group of stakeholders including representatives from local councils, the Queensland Farmers’ Federation (QFF), large energy user advocates and consumer groups.
QFF Chief Executive Officer Jo Sheppard said the new payment framework will ensure landholders receive payments that are more reflective of the use of their land.
“It is important that a process is in place to represent the interests of those who will be directly impacted by transmission lines and that the needs of landholders and the broader agriculture sector are considered as the complexities of integrating grid infrastructure are navigated,” she said.
Powerlink said the new payment framework will apply to all current and future transmission connection greenfield projects where landholder payment negotiations have not commenced.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/19/ige-does-deal-with-samsung-to-progress-arrowsmith-green-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 19, 2023",IGE does deal with Samsung to progress Arrowsmith green hydrogen project,"Perth-based Infinite Green Energy (IGE) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Samsung C&T to jointly develop and build the Arrowsmith green hydrogen plant which could eventually comprise 5 GW of renewable energy capacity and produce more than 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum for the domestic and international markets.
IGE said the Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant, being developed near the coastal town of Dongara about 300 kilometres north of Perth, is to be constructed in stages with the first phase capable of producing up to 25 tonnes of green hydrogen daily. IGE said the first stage would incorporate a 50 MW electrolyser powered by 65 MW of solar and 90 MW of wind generation capacity.
A planned second stage of the development would increase renewable hydrogen production to a projected 110 tonnes per day to help meet the expected growth in demand for green hydrogen in Asia Pacific markets such as a Japan and South Korea, as well as the domestic Australian market. The design also includes expansion options to deliver 5 GW of wind and solar energy and more than 300 tonnes of green hydrogen per day. First production from the facility is planned for early 2028.
IGE Managing Director and Chief Executive Stephen Gauld said teaming with Samsung C&T to progress the Arrowsmith project is an important step and builds on the partnership announced with the South Korean company earlier this year for the development of a commercial-scale green hydrogen project that will leverage the 11 MW Northam Solar Farm about 100 kilometres east of Perth.
“The announcement builds on the partnership we announced with Samsung C&T earlier this year for the development of our Northam MEG HP1 Project, which has established a strong foundation for our relationship,” Gauld said.
“Through this agreement, Samsung C&T will provide additional resources focused on delivering green hydrogen for export and domestic customers from our Arrowsmith facility.”

IGE Chairman Peter Coleman said Samsung C&T will bring “knowledge, skills and relationships that will be critical to the successful development of Arrowsmith.”
The announcement has been welcomed by the state government with WA Hydrogen Industry Minister Roger Cook saying the project would put the state one step closer to being a significant global producer, user and export of green hydrogen.
“Partnerships like these are vital to the delivery of the 2030 vision under the Western Australian Renewable Hydrogen Strategy and future opportunities that come with it,” he said. “It’s expected to support our own decarbonisation efforts in mining and heavy haulage transport and help our close trading partners such as South Korea decarbonise their own economies.”
Cook said the project is expected to create hundreds of construction and operational jobs and manufacturing opportunities in WA.

The plant, which is being built next to the existing 30 MW Wagga Wagga Solar Farm and will share common connection infrastructure, is now in commissioning phase and is expected to enter commercial operation later this year.
Zen Energy Executive General Manager of Future Energy Mark Sinclair said the new power purchase agreement (PPA) is just the latest for the company as it looks to accelerate the development of its renewable energy portfolio.
“We actively seek to work with innovative partners with a laser focus on delivering renewable projects as fast as we can,” he said. “Bringing on a series of mid-range assets enables us to support the regional aspirations of our customers. It means they can access offtakes where they are located, like regional distribution centres. We are continuing to focus on creating agreements with progressive companies like Mytilineos, taking on PPAs across regional Australia.”
Zen has offtake agreements in place with more than 20 solar and wind farms, including the 132 MW Nevertire, the 56 MW Moree and the 120 MW Hillston solar farm in New South Wales, the 100 MW Merredin Solar Farm in Western Australian and the 85 MW Tailem Bend 2 Solar Farm in South Australia.
The company has also unveiled plans to develop its first utility-scale battery energy storage system after acquiring the 111 MW/270 MWh Templers Battery project near Gawler in South Australia.
Zen said the project has already received approval to connect to the grid and expects to reach financial close in the coming months with construction planned to commence shortly after. The battery is expected to be operational before the end of 2024.
Zen is also pursuing plans to develop a large-scale hybrid solar and battery project in SA’s mid-north. The Solar River project, predicated to comprise more than 200 MW of solar generation and at least 300 MWh of energy storage capacity, has been issued a development approval and the company is now working through the final stages of a grid connection application process. Zen said construction is expected to commence later this year and renewable energy from the project will be delivered to the national grid in 2024.
For Mytilineos, the new deal is the latest in a series of long-term PPA it has signed for the output of its Australian assets.
More than half of the output of its 110 MW Moura Solar Farm in Queensland has been allocated through a long-term PPA with government-owned generator CS Energy while Smartest Energy, an electricity retailer owned by Japanese investment company Marubeni, has an offtake agreement in place for power produced at the 53 MWp Kingaroy Solar Farm, also in Queensland. Publicly owned telecommunications company NBN Co has inked a deal to acquire about half of the output from the 75 MW Wyalong Solar Farm in NSW.
Mytilineos has financed and built five solar farms across NSW and Queensland since entering the Australian market in 2019 and has two more under construction.

In November 2022, Qcells and a group of European research institutes in Thalheim, Germany, started a four-year research project to manufacture highly efficient tandem solar cells and modules.
The group established a pilot manufacturing line in Thalheim through the so-called “Pepperoni” (Pilot line for European Production of PEROvskite-Silicon taNdem modules on Industrial scale) project.
The company’s parent, Hanwha Solutions, has also announced plans to invest USD 100 million ($150 million) in the deployment of a pilot production line for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells at its factory in Jincheon, South Korea, by the end of 2024.
“This investment in Jincheon will mark an important step in securing technological leadership,” stated Qcells CEO Justin Lee. “With global R&D network spanning from Korea, Germany and the US, Qcells will ramp up its efforts to produce high-efficiency advanced tandem cells.”
Earlier this year, Germany’s Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin and Qcells presented a tandem cell with up to 29.3% efficiency rate. The results have been certified by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
The device is based on a silicon bottom cell relying on Hanwha Qcells’ monocrystalline Q.antum half cell technology and a perovskite-based top cell.
“This latest record efficiency result, of 28.7%, is an improvement of almost one percentage point compared with the 2020 record value of 27.8%,” the module maker said in a statement. “This boost in tandem efficiency has been enabled by improvement of both the perovskite and the silicon subcells.”
