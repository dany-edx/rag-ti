Despite falling module prices and high inventory levels in 2023, the industry has not focused solely on reducing costs and curbing losses. Instead, a resolute pursuit of high performance continued as solar and storage businesses used technical innovation to stand out from the competition. Technological ambition was evident across the board, including among entries for the new Projects category. Fifty-nine innovative solar and storage projects were entered and choosing a winner was no easy task.
A total of 19 independent expert jurors deliberated over this year’s entries, bringing a wealth of experience and expertise to the process. The pv magazine editorial team would like to thank each of them for kindly devoting time to the selection process.
Commenting on 2023’s entrants, pv magazine editor in chief Jonathan Gifford said the innovations on display represented true solutions to the major challenges facing the solar and storage industries. “Solar and energy storage companies continue to demonstrate genuinely extraordinary levels of innovation and roll out new products and services that meet the main challenges of cost, performance, and flexibility. The ever-expanding number of entrants to the eight award categories also speaks to the breadth and scale of the creativity and technical prowess inherent to our industries.”
And the winners are…

700 W-plus power output is a notable achievement in any solar module, but the 2023 Modules winner packs a heap of innovation inside to set it apart. Alongside its heterojunction (HJT) cell, Hyper-ion deploys Risen’s own patented version of busbarless (0BB) cell interconnection – branded Hyper-link, cell thickness at an industry-leading 90 to 100 micrometers, and the option of a steel frame to make a module that truly stands out.
The efficiency and power results are also notable. The module datasheet confirms the Hyper-ion comes with a power range of 680-705 W, in dimensions of 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm, at a weight of 41 kg. Inside are 210 mm half-cut HJT cells.
Beyond performance, Risen has beefed up its warranty, putting it ahead of TOPCon rivals. It offers a 15-year product warranty and 30-year power warranty, guaranteeing 90.3% of nominal power output.

German company Solar Cooling Engineering (SCE) has taken an innovative approach to refrigeration with its PV Cool Kenya project. SCE has developed solar-powered cooling technology that is based on a sustainable refrigerant (R600a) and insulation materials.
Unlike cold rooms that rely on traditional grid-tied cooling methods, the SelfChill system uses modular thermal storage to balance cooling peaks. Water is chilled and frozen, and stored in a water chiller that provides cold water to a fan coil inside the cold room. In this way, energy fluctuations can be balanced by energy stored in the form of ice.
Battery storage can be added if required, but it is not a necessary component of the system. The cooling unit itself was designed in-house, with SCE opting to create a DC unit that is powered by PV modules.

This year’s winner is Deye Technologies SUN-29.9-50K-SG01HP3 – a hybrid inverter for the C&I market. It is available in power classes from 29 kW to 50 kW and is well-suited to retrofitting. The inverter’s 400 AC output fits with older installations, making it a good candidate for revamping PV plants.
Category juror Cormac Gilligan, director clean energy technology at S&P Global, said there is a growing market for revamping and retrofitting solar systems in Europe with the addition of battery systems to increase self-consumption. He saw the flexibility of the Deye inverter as a noteworthy feature. For example, it can be cascaded into a 500 kW application and work entirely off-grid. The option to connect a diesel genset and charge the batteries that way means this inverter could meet demand in regions where weak grids are prevalent.

Origami Solar is rolling out production of its patent-pending steel frame design with contract manufacturers in the United States. Frames are expected to be available from the end of 2023.
Frames are manufactured using recycled steel in a continuous process that Origami Solar says is 10 times faster than aluminum frame making, producing one frame every 15 seconds. It also claims frames have demonstrated increased stiffness in testing, making modules better equipped for heavy loading from snow or wind. Further testing is underway with partners including the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
On price, the company expects to be able to sell frames at least 5% lower than aluminum competitors. There is a sustainability case to be made, too. Origami Solar has worked with consultants Boundless Impact to demonstrate a significantly lower carbon footprint per module.

Multinational steel producer ArcelorMittal claims its XCarb steel is both long lasting and sustainable. XCarb is a certified low-carbon material and the company reports that it is made from predominantly scrap steel, with production carried out via an electrical arc furnace that uses 100% renewable energy.
The steel producer’s Magnelis steel also boasts sustainability credentials. It is long-lived, making it suitable for solar installations in challenging environments. Magnelis steel is a double-sided hot-dip galvanized carbon steel, coated on both sides with a zinc-aluminium magnesium alloy.  “Anything you can do to make a solar asset last longer is a positive climate impact,” said juror Jenny Chase, solar analyst at BloombergNEF.
ArcelorMittal has a target of achieving a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity per ton of crude steel by 2030.

The US storage specialist Fluence has developed a storage-as-transmission asset (SATA) that can help network owners and operators to manage renewables curtailment, increase the use of power lines, and limit congestion. UltrastackTM, provides network owners and operators with fast-acting response of less than 150 milliseconds and with higher than 99% system uptime to meet the availability requirements of critical infrastructure. Its advanced control applications, some with pending patents, include synthetic inertia, power oscillation damping control, grid-forming inertia, dynamic voltage control, emergency power contribution, and black start.
Unlike “regular” big batteries, SATA projects are operated to mimic transmission line flows by injecting and absorbing power. In such applications, they can be used to bolster or even replace existing power lines, offering infrastructure planners a new, versatile solution for transmission transition.

US-based Atonometrics is targeting utility-scale solar projects with its monitoring innovation, the RDE300i. The system performs in-situ measurement of current/voltage (IV) curves within a string of modules. This allows technicians to get a direct view of the performance of individual modules within an array, and eliminates costs associated with installing and maintaining reference modules at a site.
The manufacturer is keen to point out that in-situ IV curve measurement could be useful on many fronts in plant monitoring, and that it is working with laboratories and industrial partners to develop new applications for the technology.
For now, the use case for RDE300i is focused on monitoring soiling. Here the system promises more accurate results than the common approaches of reference modules or optical sensors – and it can also integrate with these systems so monitoring teams have all bases covered.

It’s high time that we recognize leading module manufacturers in this category and this is no easy task. There is a wealth of module makers with strong track records and impressive product portfolios.
In 2023, the nod goes to JinkoSolar, which has shipped more PV modules than any other manufacturer. In November 2023 JinkoSolar hit the historic mark of 200 GW modules shipped since it delivered its first panels in 2010. The manufacturer has quickly transitioned to n-type TOPCon and the higher efficiencies it offers. In October 2023 the company announced a new n-type TOPCon cell efficiency record of 26.89% for a 182 mm cell.
But JinkoSolar is much more than just a module producer. It has expanded its product portfolio to include battery energy storage systems (BESS) to offer its customers around the world a complete solution involving both state-of-the-art modules and the latest BESS technology.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/22/free-home-solar-and-battery-rollout-begins-with-diamond-partnership-heres-how-nrns-value-model-works/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Free home solar and battery rollout begins with Diamond partnership – here’s how NRN’s value model works,"Australian startup the National Renewable Network (NRN) says it has found a model to fit Australian households with no-cost rooftop solar and home battery systems. The systems in its program are not owned by the households, with full control handed over to the energy retailers.
The approach hinges on the value aggregated household fleets can provide to these retailers, which NRN says is substantial enough for retailers to then pass on discounted energy rates to the households, incentivising installation.
On average, NRN says its model saves households over $750 annually. For investors, NRN founder and Chief Executive Officer Alan Hunter tells pv magazine Australia there is a “double digit internal rate of return.” 
NRN has today announced its formal partnership with Diamond Energy, which has been in the works for some time now.
“By working with NRN we’ve been able to help deliver a no upfront cost solar and battery solution. Our unique solution helps make the solar and battery even more affordable to our customers with the benefits delivered through our electricity bill,” Diamond Energy’s Mark Bertoncello said.
As a company, NRN is positioning itself in the background, allowing retailers to design and name their own particular deals, as is the case with the Diamond partnership.
“We’re just the infrastructure behind it,” Hunter said. “The product is led from the energy retailer to the customer, they build their own plan… so either they will sell energy from the grid or behind the meter at the same cost, they may split the cost separately, they may do a subscription plan.”
The value NRN brings to energy retailers rests largely on hedging, the contracts they put in place to protect against the risks of price fluctuation in the day-to-day spot market. Having full control over an aggregated distributed energy resources (DER) fleet is valuable to retailers because it helps them balance their position.
“We are removing the customer’s incentive for this (DER) system,” Hunter said. “So the retailer is able to use these assets to balance their hedging position and actually get energy contracts that could be significantly cheaper because they are flatlining the load profile of their portfolio.”
“We simulated that we can reduce a load-following hedge by $36 / MWh through flatlining and managing the VPP (Virtual Power Plant) accordingly,” he adds. “That value is so big for a retailer.”

“It’s just that curve. We are seeing more and more customers being incentivised to go out and buy a solar system which is just destroying the curves for the retailer,” Hunter said.
In terms of how NRN itself makes money, Hunter said it basically comes down to taking a clip from the four stakeholders who use its platform, including retailers, investors, installers and customers.
In NRN’s system, households won’t be promised energy independence, which is traditionally a strong selling point for home batteries, and one of the reasons VPP uptake remains so low. 
This issue of control, however, matters significantly less since customers actually haven’t paid for the system. “There’s this whole balance of conflict between retailer and customer if the customer owns that system and tries to pass [to the retailer] the tools to operate it,” Hunter said.
“We’ve basically given all the whole tools to the retailer. There’s no customer interest here, the interest is that you’re going to decrease your cost, optimise the asset for that, and then you’re going to pass on cheaper rates to your customer.”

Solar veteran and Head of Business Development at Solar Analytics, Nigel Morris, is intrigued by NRN’s model, especially its emphasis on energy retailers, but notes solar balancing acts can be “complicated territory.”
“I think it’s really cool when people find new ways to extract value out of the larger energy market and it’s a real interesting sign of maturity in the solar sector that we can do that,” Morris told pv magazine Australia.
There have been a number of different iterations of what Morris describes as a ‘full wrap’ strategy, from residential Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), VPPs, to centralised and wrapped product suites like that being forwarded by 1Komma5, and more recently subscription-based models like the newly launched proposition from Lavo. 
“It all seems great, but there’s a lot of real world stuff that gets in the way of it all working,” Morris said.
Some of these real world issues come down to technical complexity butting up against limited returns, as in the case of VPPs, as well as more nebulous problems, like consumer skepticism and installer tendencies. 
There are few customers who trust companies and energy retailers to have their best interests at heart, Morris said, noting “Australians are inherently skeptical,” especially about offers which seem ‘too good to be good true.’
Such things have been on Hunter’s mind too, who acknowledges that “debunking that whole ‘sounds too good to be true’” will be a hurdle for the company. He is adamant, however, that NRN has the “numbers and transactions that show every stakeholder is winning.”
“Building out the platform has been hard. But we have the right legal structure now, we have the right stakeholders involved,” he said.
To Morris’ eyes, NRN’s key point of difference is the company’s focus on value to the retailer. “I like the innovation… I do not understand the risk though and I do not understand how hard they are leveraged,” he said of the company’s more intimate inner-workings. “The fundamental issue is you still have a finance cost, you’ve got investors, you’ve got fees, admin, you’ve got a lot of things to juggle.”
NRN is planning to inject $100 million into fitting renewable systems on 15,000 homes over the next three years. In the more near term, Hunter said the company already has about 500 homes committed to systems in deals with four different energy retailers to deploy over the coming six to nine months. 
To date, it has deployed more than 1 MW of solar and batteries systems into the Queensland, New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian markets, mostly through its partnership with Diamond Energy.

In terms of funding this expansion, the company has just completed a $13.5 million seed raise, which includes both equity and debt.
Morris thinks another key challenge NRN will face is getting enough installers on board. Installers, he said, have traditionally been hesitant about new models that stray too far from the traditional sell/install approach.
Each NRN-programmed rooftop and battery household will carry a 10-year maintenance contract for solar installers worth $5,000. Something which Morris says is “an attractive story for an installer who is willing to think outside the box.”
After much excitement, VPP programs in Australia are still struggling to find their feet. Subdued uptake among consumers is often credited to this issue of control and energy independence flagged above. The other component is that VPP’s financial returns are often fairly “marginal,” Morris said.
“We know a VPP is really worth a couple of hundred bucks to an end user. That’s about the most value you can get out of a VPP and there’s volatility around that,” he said. “It’s part of the reason VPPs haven’t taken off.”
“There’s an awful lot of variables and to build the software architecture for that is very, very complex and you’re dealing with lots of different manufacturers of different equipment who have their own issues around comms and reliability and connectivity. So getting architecture right is a very significant challenge.”
Given the distributed home solar and battery systems within the NRN platform are centrally owned, rather than purchased at the whim of individual consumers, the company is hoping it can smooth some of these kinks.
NRN is also selling a promise of giving more Australian households access to renewable technologies. Renters and low-income earners have traditionally been locked out of the solar market, which in turn means they suffer more from growing costs as networks and retailers try to claw back some of the pie rooftop solar has undercut.
Hunter said NRN’s contractual structure enables renters to access its program, but notes it is still a sticky issue.
“We are over the years going to make that a lot smoother,” he said. “We want to see how we can work with local governments or councils to incentivise the landlords,” he says. If NRN’s platform could offer landlords a cash incentive, say $1,000, to install a system, then Hunter thinks they would be far more likely to bother with the process. 
He believes NRN’s system is simple enough for landlords to navigate, the issue is “just that commercial driver.”
“These holistic wraps, whether it’s through a model like this [NRN] or whether its 1Komma5 or whoever… whoever can successfully wrap intelligent software, better service and more value together for customers and convince them and the network and installers to actually deploy it, that is the next realm for us,” Morris said.
“We’re now able to help energy retailers with these aggregated fleets, so it’s a really, really interesting thing. If it’s going to be a success or not, time will tell.”
“These companies seem to be finding new ways to extract value out of the energy market. If they can find more ways to extract more value from DNSPs, retailers, or whoever it is, then everyone benefits because then there’s more money in the pot. Of course, the real world is a bitch.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/22/neoen-gives-go-ahead-for-second-largest-solar-farm-in-global-portfolio/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,FRANCE,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Neoen gives go-ahead for second largest solar farm in global portfolio,"Neoen has given the final go-ahead to build the 350 MW Culcairn Solar Farm in the New South Wales (NSW) Riverina region. The project also has development approval in place for a 100 MW / 200 MWh battery energy storage system.
The announcement comes just days after the project was named as one of five energy infrastructure projects to secure an underwriting contract in the New South Wales (NSW) government’s latest tender round to support the transition from coal to renewables. The projects have been awarded long-term energy service agreements (LTESA) that effectively lock in long-term minimum revenues.
The five projects supported in the third tender round of the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap represent 750 MW of renewable energy generation and 524 MW / 4,192 MWh of long-duration storage. They are expected to come into operation starting in 2028.
Neoen said engineering and civil construction company Bouygues Construction Australia and Bouygues Energies and Services Australia has been awarded the engineering, procurement and construction contract to deliver the Culcairn Solar Farm which is expected to be operational in 2026.
The project is being developed on an approximately 1,000-hectare site near Culcairn, about 45 kilometres north of Albury.  Once operational, the solar plant is expected to produce about 800,000 MWh of renewable energy a year – enough to power up to 160,000 homes.
Neoen intends to contract the majority of the electricity generated by the Culcairn Solar Farm via power purchase agreements.
The project will be the second biggest solar farm in Neoen’s global portfolio, eclipsed only by the 400 MW Western Downs Solar Farm that is now operating in southwest Queensland.
They are part of Neoen’s fast-growing Australian solar, wind and storage portfolio which has now reached 3.75 GW in operation or under construction.
Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy, who described the Culcairn venture as an “essential project” for Neoen, said the company is aiming to have 10 GW of large-scale solar and wind and battery energy storage capacity in Australia by the end of the decade as part of a multi-billion-dollar forward investment plan.
“We have a massive pipeline of several gigawatts of projects which we are all very excited about,” he said. “Our ambition is to continue to have very highly competitive solar, wind farms and batteries, combining the three technologies in every state and to leverage this multi-technology approach to be able to offer the solutions for both our energy customers and for the grid as well.”
The Culcairn project is expected to generate 400 jobs during construction, as well as seven operational jobs in its projected minimum 25-year operational phase. In addition, 60% of the project’s development cost is expected to be spent within the Riverina region.

The Western Australian government-owned utility said the investment is part of a long-term strategy to strengthen network resilience across the SWIS and improve energy security and reliability for the community.
Western Power Executive Manager of Asset Management Gair Landsborough said the work will manage the capacity of some of the network’s key overutilised feeders, including the underground cables and overhead wires, and will create additional capacity and facilitate the greater connection of renewables such as rooftop solar.
“While we cannot guarantee 100% reliability, we’re doing everything we can to improve network resilience to minimise the duration and number of unplanned outages,” he said.
“This package of work will manage the capacity of the feeders to meet forecasted demand and help to mitigate the occurrence of unplanned outages.”
The work involves managing the capacity of 10 distribution feeders, through the installation of 42 kilometres of underground cable in Mandurah, Meadow Springs, Beechboro, Byford and Southern River.
The start of the works comes after the state government last month committed $708 million to upgrade the SWIS and ensure it can feed the demand and the supply of renewable energy needed to deliver on the state’s 2030 and 2050 emissions targets.

ElectraNet said the South Australian (SA) component of the 900-kilometre project, which spans 206 km from Robertstown in SA to the border with New South Wales (NSW), is the largest transmission project is has yet delivered, and includes the installation of the state’s first 330 kV substation at Bundey.
The transmission network operator said the Bundey substation will be critical in enabling power flow between SA and NSW, and provides a connection point for future renewable generation, realising the full potential of EnergyConnect which will link Roberstown to Wagga Wagga in NSW via Buronga in that state’s far west, with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria.
ElectraNet said the project now moves towards its next phase, with inter-network testing of first stage of the new interconnector scheduled to begin following the completion of stage one works on the NSW side by Transgrid by April 2024.
This will enable an initial power transfer capability of up to 150 MW by July 2024. The full transfer capacity of up to 800 MW is expected to be available by mid-2026, post the completion of stage two construction in NSW.
ElectraNet Chief Executive Officer Simon Emms said the project will be transformative for both the SA grid and the broader National Electricity Market (NEM).
Emms said he expects the project will bolster the state’s status as a leader in the transition to a low-carbon economy and enhance its capability to export an abundance of renewable energy resources.
“Project EnergyConnect is already contributing to South Australia’s clean energy future through new renewable energy developments in excess of 2 GW including wind, solar and batteries that are now proposing to connect to the grid,” he said.
Emms also highlighted the economic benefits of the EnergyConnect project, noting anticipated “bill savings of $127 for a typical SA residential power customer and between $6,000 and $18,000 for business customers” once the interconnector is fully operational.
While ElectraNet has delivered the SA component of the EnergyConnect project on time and within budget, Transgrid said construction of the NSW component “is progressing well.”
In its latest update, the NSW network operator said the two synchronous condensers that sit at the heart of the Buronga substation –  the main connection between NSW, SA and Victoria – have now been assembled inside a 1200m2 machine hall.
The 120 MVAR synchronous condensers will now undergo 12 months of ancillary construction, commissioning and testing and are expected to play a key role in keeping the grid stable as EnergyConnect unlocks greater renewable energy sharing between the three states.
It is anticipated construction of EnergyConnect will be completed by mid-2024 with the release of full transfer capability planned by mid-2026.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/22/solar-manufacturers-unite-to-develop-700-w-module-standards/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",ANNE FISCHER,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Solar manufacturers unite to develop 700 W + module standards,"From pv magazine USA
Trina Solar announced the formation of the 700 W+ Photovoltaic Open Innovation Ecological Alliance. Joined by Astronergy, Canadian Solar, Risen Energy, TCL Zhonghuan and Tongwei, the group of six solar manufacturers intends to standardise the design of solar modules of 700 W or greater.
The alliance calls for module manufacturers adhere to existing agreed industry dimensions of 2,384 mm by 1,303 mm; module long-side vertical hole distance: 400 mm / 1,400 mm). A hole distance of 790 mm has been added to the standard. This adheres to and builds on the T/CPIA 0003-2022 Technical Specification issued by the China Photovoltaic Industry Association.
In recent years, the power output of solar modules has jumped from 500 W to 700 W, and the size of modules have increased along with the wattage. In 2021, for example, Risen Energy released the 132-cell NewT@N panel based on 210 mm n-type monocrystalline multi busbars cells with a half-cut design. The high-wattage module size conforms to the recommended standard of 2,384 mm x 1,303 mm x 35 mm.
Having large modules presents some challenges in terms of weight on a roof, ease of mounting on trackers or racking, and more. But lack of standardisation presents several challenges, not only in production but in fitting to infrastructure.
The 700W+ alliance sees standardisation as a way of reducing balance of system costs as well as cutting the levelized cost of electricity. Ultimately, standardisation will enhance supply chain efficiencies, boost production, and lower costs, the Alliance contends, accelerating the industrialization of high-powered modules.

Researchers from the Nanyang Technological University Singapore (NTU Singapore) and startup EtaVolt have developed a high-intensity illumination device that can reportedly “rejuvenate” solar panels and reduce their degradation.
Called Advanced Regeneration Technology, the new technique consists of applying intense light and controlled temperature on the solar cells to excite the polysilicon molecules and make them move quickly. This reportedly changed their arrangement and “patches up” the holes caused by light, heat and humidity.
“The process is akin to patching holes in a bucket; it repairs solar panels to prevent energy leakage, ensuring optimal light energy collection,” the scientists said, noting that the process is implemented via a high intensity illumination device that can roll itself over the photovoltaic modules. “The process takes less than five minutes and can help treated solar panels recover up to 5% of their lost field performance.”
The research group claims that this process may reduce module degradation by up to five years, depending on the cell technology.
The device may also be used on-site in either rooftop PV systems or ground-mounted PV plants and may be applied to around 90% of the solar modules available in the market.
According to EtaVolt’s website, the new regeneration technology is based on a proprietary combination of illumination, temperature, and regeneration time. It can also reportedly provide light-induced degradation (LID) mitigation and recovery.
“Our solar rejuvenation method has not only been rigorously tested and validated but has shown field-proven results in various commercial applications. The technology has been successfully implemented in projects with major partners in the solar industry, such as renewable energy solutions firm Vector Green, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for widespread adoption,” said NTU Singapore researcher Stanley Wang.
The research team did not reveal more technical details about the device. “These technologies developed at NTU have been patented through NTUitive, the University’s innovation and enterprise company and are licensed to EtaVolt,” it stated.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/22/victorian-solar-farm-switched-off-over-fire-risk/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 22, 2023",Cohuna solar plant resumes operations after Energy Safe shutdown,"Energy Safe Victoria (ESV) had directed Enel Green Power to cease generating power at the Cohuna Solar Farm after initial investigations into the fire raised concerns about specific equipment used at the solar farm.
ESV, the independent safety regulator responsible for the safe generation, supply and use of electricity, gas and pipelines in Victoria, said the operator of the solar farm was on 8 December 2023 directed to disconnect equipment following a three-to-four-hectare grassfire at the 82ha site in November.
Enel told pv magazine ESV had directed it to disconnect some equipment at the site but the plant has since resumed operations.
“Following works in accordance with directions provided by ESV, the Cohuna Solar Farm recommenced generating on 17 December,” Enel said. “The plant is now operating at approximately 75% capacity and is currently ramping up generation to full capacity.”
Enel said it is working closely with ESV to comply with all relevant directions.
ESV Chief Executive Officer Leanne Hughson said early investigations into the fire had sparked concerns about specific equipment used at the solar farm located near Horfield, about 250 kilometres northwest of the state capital Melbourne. The plant comprises about 87,000 bifacial modules mounted on single-axis trackers.
“The operation of modern solar farms is generally safe but on the rare occasion we see a fault with specific equipment we will investigate,” she said.
The ESV said the operator was required to carried out inspections and implement interim safety measures prior to the solar plant, which has been in operations since 2021, being powered up again. The agency said the operator is working to find a permanent solution to help ensure the issue does not happen again, while also working closely with the ESV to comply with the current direction.
The news comes just days after Enel Green Power, owned by Italian utilities giant Enel Group and Japanese oil and gas major Inpex, signed a long-term offtake agreement with the Japanese owned retailer SmartestEnergy for its 93 MW Girgarre solar project in Victoria.
Enel Green Power also has a stake in the Bungala 1 and Bungala 2 solar farms, which deliver a combined 220 MW of generation capacity into the grid in South Australia and is building the 75.6 MW Flat Rocks Wind Farm in Western Australia.
Updated on 22 December 2023 to show that the Cohuna Solar Farm has resumed operations.
Updated on 8 January 2024 to show that ESV is an independent safety regulator; and that direction to disconnect equipment was issued on 8 December 2023, not 2024.
