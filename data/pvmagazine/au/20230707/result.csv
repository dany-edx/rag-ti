The federal government publishes emission forecasts to 2035 – 15 years short of 2050, the net-zero target date. Our newly published study forecasts road transport emissions through to 2050. The estimated reduction by 2050, 35–45% of pre-COVID levels in 2019, falls well short of what’s needed.
Our findings highlight three obstacles to achieving net zero. These are: Australia’s delay in switching to electric vehicles; growing sales of large, heavy vehicles such as SUVs and utes; and uncertainties about hydrogen as a fuel, especially for freight transport. These findings point to policy actions that could get road transport much closer to net zero.
Asleep at the wheel! Some of us just don't get it or, if we do get it, we don't give a damn. We thought Australian cars were using less fuel. New research shows we were wrong https://t.co/TEVd6Bw4qx via @ConversationEDU

Emissions and energy use vary from vehicle to vehicle, so reliable forecasting requires a detailed breakdown of the on-road fleet. Our study used the Australian Fleet Model and the net zero vehicle emission model (n0vem).
Working with European Union colleagues, our emissions simulation drew on an updated EU scenario (EU-27) showing the changes in the EU vehicle fleet needed to meet the latest (proposed) CO₂ targets. Our study assumed Australia will be ten years behind the EU across all vehicle classes.
We further modified the scenario to properly reflect Australian conditions. For instance, the EU has a much higher proportion of plug-in hybrid vehicles than Australia, where buyers are now bypassing them for wholly electric vehicles.
Australia’s adoption of electric vehicles has been maddeningly slow, but we’re well placed to catch up fast https://t.co/SlQ34EGWTh via @ConversationEDU

Using this modified scenario, the simulation produces a forecast fall in total wheel-to-wheel emissions from Australian transport from 104 billion tonnes (Mt) in 2018 to 55-65Mt in 2050. Within the range of this 35–45% reduction, the outcome depends largely on the balance of renewable and fossil-fuel energy used to produce hydrogen.
The modelling nonetheless predicts a large shift in energy use in road transport in 2050, as 2019 was basically 100% fossil fuels.
The on-road energy efficiency of battery electric vehicles is roughly twice that of fuel cell electric (hydrogen) vehicles and roughly three times that of fossil-fuelled vehicles of similar type.
The modelling results make this clear. In 2050, battery electric vehicles account for about 70% of total travel, but 25% of on-road energy use and only about 10% of total emissions.
In contrast, fossil-fuelled vehicles account for about 25% of total travel in 2050, 60% of energy use and 75-85% of emissions. That’s even allowing for expected efficiency improvements.
This means the shift to a mostly electric fleet by 2050 plus the use of hydrogen is predicted to fall short of what’s needed to get to net zero. It will require aggressive new policies to increase the uptake of electric vehicles across all classes.
But that is not the whole story. One neglected issue is the growing proportion of big, heavy passenger vehicles (SUVs, utes). This trend is very noticeable in Australia. The laws of physics mean heavier vehicles need much more energy and fuel per kilometre of driving, and so produce more emissions.
We may be underestimating just how bad carbon-belching SUVs are for the #climate – and for our #health https://t.co/VVNLgaTyMd via @ConversationEDU #ICE

Currently, a large diesel SUV typically emits a kilogram of CO₂ for every 3 kilometres of driving, compared to 15km for a light electric vehicle and 200 kilometres for an e-bike. An average electric vehicle currently emits 1kg of CO₂ every 7km.
This distance is expected to be around 60km in 2050, when renewables power the electricity grid. A lightweight electric car will more than double the distance to 125km per kilogram of CO₂. Reducing vehicle weights and optimising energy efficiency in transport will be essential to meet emission targets.
The study modelled the impacts of lightweighting passenger vehicles while keeping buses and commercial vehicles the same. If Australians had driven only small cars in 2019 for personal use, total road transport emissions would have been about 15% lower.
The reduction in emissions from simply shifting to smaller cars is similar to emissions from domestic aviation and domestic shipping combined. Importantly, lightweighting cuts emissions for all kinds of vehicles.
How climate-friendly is an electric car? It all comes down to where you live. If Australia was serious about reducing emissions – fast – it’s essential electrification starts everywhere, now. https://t.co/vf1EJJyCxh via @ConversationEDU

Fuel cell electric vehicles using hydrogen account for only a few percent of all travel, but most will likely be large trucks. As a result, in our scenarios, they use a little over 10% of total on-road energy and produce 5-20% of total emissions, depending on the energy source used for hydrogen production and distribution.
The modified EU scenario includes a significant uptake of hydrogen vehicles by 2050. That’s by no means guaranteed.
The uptake in Australia has been negligible to date. That’s due to costs (vehicle and fuel), the need for new hydrogen fuel infrastructure, less mature technology (compared to battery electric vehicles) and limited vehicle availability. Unresolved aspects of hydrogen in transport include lower energy efficiency, the need for clean water, uncertainty about leakage, fuel-cell durability and value for consumers.
We must rapidly decarbonise road transport – but hydrogen's not the answer https://t.co/B53z8aF4mc

Our study suggests Australia is on track to miss the net-zero target for 2050 mainly because of the large proportions of fossil-fuelled vehicles and large and heavy passenger vehicles.
These two aspects could become targets for new policies such as public information campaigns, tax incentives for small, light vehicles, bans on selling fossil fuel vehicles and programs to scrap them. Other options to cut emissions include measures to reduce travel demand, optimise freight logistics and shift travel to public transport, to name a few.
The study confirms the scale of the challenge of decarbonising road transport. Australia will need “all hands on deck” – government, industry and consumers – to achieve net zero in 2050.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/07/consultation-opens-to-help-unlock-australias-renewable-hydrogen-future/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JULY 7, 2023",Consultation opens to help unlock Australia’s renewable hydrogen future,"The Australian government has released a consultation paper to help shape the design of its $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program announced in the May budget and has also opened consultation to revamp the National Hydrogen Strategy as it looks to support the domestic hydrogen industry.
The government said the review of the National Hydrogen Strategy will build upon the original 2019 strategy to ensure Australia can leverage hydrogen’s immense economic potential and deliver jobs and energy in the transformation underway.
Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the review is vital to support a fit-for-purpose strategy in an increasingly competitive investment environment for hydrogen.
“Australia is well on track to build an innovative hydrogen industry that will bring immense economic opportunities across the country, especially in the regions that have always powered Australia,” he said.
“We have up to $300 billion of potential renewable hydrogen investments in the pipeline, the largest in the world – but we face huge competition from other countries to create the environment to get these announcements to final investment decisions.
“Our government is committed to working with industry, communities, states and territories to bring our strategy up to date and capitalise on this opportunity.”
Among the government’s commitments is the recently announced Hydrogen Headstart program that will provide revenue support for two to three large-scale renewable hydrogen projects through competitive production contracts.
The Hydrogen Headstart consultation paper is seeking feedback from stakeholders to help frame the design of the program and outlines the criteria for the Australian-based renewable hydrogen projects that will get funding as part of the $2 billion initiative.
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) said successful projects will be able to receive a production credit over a 10-year period to cover the commercial gap between the cost of hydrogen production from renewables and its sale price.
This is expected to help bridge the gap with private investment to make large-scale Australian green hydrogen projects commercially viable.
“Hydrogen Headstart is a key step towards unlocking an estimated $300 billion in private investment in Australian renewable hydrogen,” Bowen said. “Working with industry experts and stakeholders to design the program means we can maximise the success of Australia’s renewable hydrogen future.”
Bowen said the Headstart program would put Australia on course for up to a 1,000 MW of electrolyser capacity by 2030 with the criteria revealing that the minimum size of electrolyser for a hydrogen project to be eligible under the scheme would be 50 MW, with no upper limit.
This will be a major step up for Australia’s industry with the largest electrolyser projects that have reached final investment decision so far 1 to 10 MW in scale.
The funds will only be available for a new renewable hydrogen project and will not be granted towards the upfront capital costs of a project.
It is expected the program will open for initial applications for funding in the December quarter of 2023 or the March quarter of 2024.

It was anticipated construction of the project, which has been identified as a State Significant Development, would begin in late 2024 with operations expected to commence in 2027 but Atco has now indicated that schedule will be pushed out until there is a “clear commercial pathway” for the project.
In a statement, the company said it remains committed to the delivery of the CWPH and will continue to progress the project but has opted to defer the submission of the EIS “from its originally anticipated schedule.”
“The project’s EIS is in the process of being finalised, however, we have decided to defer our EIS submission until some of the NSW government’s policy frameworks mature, and there is a clear commercial pathway for large civil projects like pumped hydro,” Atco said.
“This will result in some deferment from our originally anticipated schedule, but we are working hard to ensure critical projects like CWPH are delivered affordably and promptly.”
Atco did not clarify what it is seeking from the state government, saying only that “overall, the frameworks are close to being able to support financial investment decisions for large-scale infrastructure like pumped hydro, but require some further development on risk allocations to ensure the delivery pathways are clear and feasible.”
Atco said it is likely it will defer lodging the EIS, a key element of the regulatory approvals process, for up to 12 months but that timeframe would depend on “the government and its relevant authorities, and the time they require to refresh the support mechanisms for long-duration storage projects like pumped hydro.”
“We would hope this period may take between six to 12 months; however, our preference is for this to happen faster to deliver the capacity required in NSW sooner and in line with the state’s 2030 storage targets,” Atco said.
The CWPH project is planned for a site near Yetholme, between Bathurst and Lithgow in the proposed 3 GW Central-West Orana renewable energy zone (REZ).
The NSW government has identified the project as a State Significant Development, indicating it will deliver large-scale energy storage and firming capacity to allow for an increased uptake of renewable energy and to help plug the gap left by exiting coal-fired generation.
Atco was awarded $9.4 million in Recoverable Grant funding to progress CWPH through the feasibility stage.

The project is the largest operational PV facility in the Americas.
Prior to the commissioning of the plant, the largest operational PV project in North and South America was the Villanueva project, which consists of the 427 MW Villanueva I and 327 MW Villanueva III installations in the Mexican state of Coahuila.
Elera Renováveis said it invested $1.26 billion (BRL 4 billion) in the Janaúba project, which consists of 20 solar parks spread across approximately 3,000 hectares. The Brazilian renewables developer began construction in January 2021.
In 2021, Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), approved $450 million of financing for 14 plants in the complex, equivalent to 72% of the total planned investment of $630 million.
The complex features tracking systems from US-based Nextracker.
Janaúba has one of the highest concentration of utility-scale solar projects among Brazilian municipalities.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/07/07/study-finds-growing-inequality-in-metal-footprints-of-renewable-power-value-chains/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",VALERIE THOMPSON,"JULY 7, 2023",Study finds growing inequality in metal footprints of renewable power value chains,"A US-Chinese research team has used quantitative models to analyse data about the flow of iron, copper, aluminium, and other precious metals from source to end-use destination in the renewable energy infrastructure value chain to reveal trends and potential risks.
The study found a growing inequality in metal footprints, which are defined in the paper as the total metal ores embodied in the renewable power value chains. The authors said this kind of uneven activity may “hinder the just net-zero transition and climate change mitigation actions” and that there is an urgency “to establish a metal-efficient and green supply chain for upstream suppliers [source countries of metals] as well as downstream renewable power installers for just transition in the power sector across the globe.”
Noting that the amount of metal used in renewable energy infrastructure has increased by 97% in the 10-year period from 2005 to 2015, the paper’s authors examined the flow of metals in seven value chains, including solar, solar thermal, ocean, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal.
They developed a multi-regional input-output model and a value chain decomposition model that are said to enable the analysis of the activity for worldwide regions and individual countries. They sourced data from Exiobase, a dataset used that estimates emissions and resource extractions by industry, developed by a consortium of research institutes in projects financed by the European research framework programs.
The scientists found imbalances within the global value chains studied and attributed them to the continuous outsourcing of metal demand for the renewable power sector to developing economies.
“Developed economies occupy the high-end segments of the renewable power value chain, while allocating metal-intensive (but low value-added) production activities to developing economies,” they also stated, noting that some economies are contributing a considerable amount of metal from their reserves to fulfil foreign demand but have only minimal economic benefit.
The academics presented their findings in the paper “Tracing metal footprints via global renewable power value chains,” published in nature communications. The research group comprises scientists from China’s Shandong University, Fudan University, Guangxi University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as well as from the University of Maryland in the United States.
“Our results indicate that the trade structure can be modified to mitigate metal supply risk and consumption inequality along global renewable power value chains (RPVCs) among economies,” they concluded. “Import-dependent developed economies can adjust the distribution of traded goods towards metal-efficient sources.”
