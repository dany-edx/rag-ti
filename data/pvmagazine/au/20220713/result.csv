Speaking at the Sydney Energy Forum on Tuesday, US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm focused on the importance of secure supply chains to the clean energy transition, especially in light of the current global energy crisis spurred by Europe’s over-reliance on Russia and the invasion of Ukraine.
“We’ve seen what happens when we rely too much on one entity for our source of fuel, and we don’t want that to happen – so to diversify those energy sources and to link up with partners is part of our energy security,” Granholm said.
With few hard details in the agreements, it seems as though the moves at this stage are more of a formal recognition of a joint goal, especially in response to recent geopolitical events. The US and Australia did, however, point to of a number of technological focal points.
Granholm described the transition to renewables as “the greatest peace plan of all” since countries cannot be “held hostage” over access to the sun or wind. “They have not ever been weaponised, nor will they be,” she said.

Australia currently imports around 80% of its solar panels from China – which also controls the vast amount of materials processing for other renewable technologies. While this has led to incredible depressions in the price of these technologies globally, the International Energy Agency’s executive director Fatih Birol noted the country’s near monopoly was “something that we all need to think about.”
Signed by Granholm and Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, the Australia – United States Net-Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership seeks to accelerate the development and deployment of zero emissions technology, as well as growing cooperation between the two countries in terms of critical minerals supply chains.
“With today’s partnership, our two countries will work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials – providing an essential opportunity to export the innovations that will accelerate the global clean energy transition,” Granholm said.
Officials from the US and Australia agreed to meet within three months to make further progress relating to the agreement, presumably to set out more concrete goals. 
This global partnership is specifically aimed at ensuring the security of critical minerals supply chains. Australia has now joined the partnership which includes the US, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the European Commission.

At the forum, Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific, Research, and Industry Organisation (CSIRO) and the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
“Under the agreement, CSIRO and NREL will initially focus on four areas of strategic importance to Australia: hydrogen, global power system transformation, plastics, and an accelerator/incubator program for small and medium sized enterprises that has the potential to transform our global energy future,” NREL’s Chief Research Officer, Dr Peter Green, said at the signing yesterday.
The agreement was also signed by CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Larry Marshall. “Importantly, through CSIRO’s shared national labs, it paves the way for new opportunities for Australian science institutions to partner with US national labs and industry to lead on cutting-edge research that will lower the cost of net zero energy technologies at a global scale,” Dr Marshall said.

The Nolan’s Project, located in the Northern Territory about 135 kilometres north of Alice Springs, proposes to build a mine and processing plant to supply a significant proportion of the world’s NdPr demand, used for rare earth permanent magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines.
The Nolan project could support a value chain supplying nearly 5% of the global demand for the rare earth over projected project life of 38 years, GE said in its media release.

At this stage, the agreement takes the form of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), with GE saying a definitive and binding contract would be subject to Arafura securing funding for the Nolan project and of course its successful commissioning.
Since the agreement was signed at the major forum, Australian ministers and the US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm attended the signing. Federal Minister for Trade and Tourism, Don Farrell, described the agreement as showing the real potential for Australia to foster strong commercial critical minerals partnerships with our major trading partners.

Comms Declare, the group of climate advocate advertising professionals behind the Fossil Ad Ban campaign, estimate around $238 million is spent each year on marketing and sponsorships from companies like Ampol, AGL, Origin, Santos and Energy Australia.
It argues all levels of government should ban fossil fuel advertising in Australia, just as has been done with industries like tobacco, gambling, and alcohol which have negative impacts on consumers. It labelled the continued allowance of fossil advertising “hypocrisy.”
The campaign has been supported by the Australian Healthcare and Hospital Association, Australasian Epidemiological Association, Australian Federation of Medical Women, Medical Scientists Association of Victoria, Doctors for the Environment Australia and more.
As part of the campaign, an open letter signed by 195 health professionals was sent to prime minister Anthony Albanese and every mayor in Australia on Monday calling on the leaders to follow Melbourne’s Yarra City Council, which in March became the first council restrict the promotion of fossil fuels on council-run property.
“Advertising fossil fuels serves no purpose other than to increase demand for the products that are driving climate change and harming our community,” the open letter reads.
The campaign follows similar moves which have taken off internationally, with over a quarter of a million people signing the European Citizen’s Initiative to ban fossil fuel ads and sponsorships.
Comms Declare founder Belinda Noble said banning fossil fuel advertising is an obvious next step for leaders to acknowledge the significant health impacts of climate change, which is expected to cause around 83 million human deaths by 2100 if urgent action isn’t taken.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/13/spanish-giant-plans-26-billion-investment-in-australian-renewables-following-government-change/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,SPAIN",BELLA PEACOCK,"JULY 13, 2022",Spanish giant plans $26 billion investment in Australian renewables following government change,"Acciona is currently constructing Australia’s largest wind farm, the 1 GW MacIntyre complex on Queensland’s southern tip, with a price tag just shy of $2 billion. 
The company’s chairman, José Manuel Entrecanales, has now told The Age the company plans to increase its Australian renewable capacity six fold, targeting 6 GW with an investment forecast sitting at $26 billion.
The plan, Entrecanales said, has been enabled by the new Albanese’s government’s pledge to invest $20 billion in Australia’s electricity transmission grid through its ‘Rewiring the Nation’ policy, intended to unlock renewable development by allowing more projects to connect without the current curtailment woes.
Alongside Australia’s vast renewable resources, its AAA credit status and reliable legal system, the new government’s policy is something of the finishing touch, facilitating an ideal investment environment for the Spanish giant.
“Australia can be possibly the most effective destination for our investment,” Entrecanales said in an interview with the Fairfax newspaper.
Almost one fifth, 18%, of Acciona’s business in generated in Australia, where the company not only develops wind and solar projects but also public transport and other construction jobs. Acciona’s revenue was $11.9 billion (€8.1 billion) in 2021.
The Age reports of the company’s $26 billion future project pipeline in Australia, 10 projects worth $7 billion are “pending resolution” while the rest of the planned investment, $19 billion, is in tenders under development.
Alongside its flagship MacIntyre Wind Farm, the company owns a number of assets in the country, holding total installed capacity of 435 MW here in 2021. Its 158 MW Mortlake wind farm is currently under construction in Victoria, where it already operates the 132 MW Mt. Gellibrand and 192 MW Waubra wind farms.
The company also owns the 64 MW Cathedral Rocks wind farm in South Australia and 47 MW Gunning wind farm in New South Wales. 
Late last year, Acciona signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Queensland government-owned generator Stanwell Energy which could see energy generated at the proposed 600 MWp Aldoga Solar Farm power a 3 GW green hydrogen project being developed near Gladstone on the central Queensland coast.
Acciona is also currently testing Sydney company Gelion’s zinc-bromide Endure batteries at its Montes del Cierzo testing field in Navarra, in the north of Spain.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/07/13/vietnamese-government-fears-legal-action-from-solar-investors/,"LEGAL,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,VIETNAM",MAX HALL,"JULY 13, 2022",Vietnamese government fears legal action from solar investors,"From pv magazine Global
Vietnam’s latest draft energy plan prepares for 8.7 GW of new solar between 2021 and 2030, but the Ministry of Industry and Trade is reportedly fearful of action by investors in another 2.4 GW of projects that have been built or approved.
VN Express International reported this week that 2,428 MW of solar capacity above what is set out in the nation’s draft power plan has been built or has secured planning consent. The news site reported that the draft version of Vietnam’s eighth power development plan, drawn up in March 2021, includes a target for 8.7 GW of new solar additions between 2021 and 2030.
According to the news outlet, some 11,164 MW of solar capacity is already in place or has been approved. And the Ministry of Industry and Trade is pushing for it all to be included in the masterplan, in order to avoid investors suing the government.
VN Express reported that the government has yet to approve the power plan, as it needs to be updated, including to reflect the net-zero-by-mid-century pledge made by Hanoi at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow last December. The news site said that thermal power, hydro, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are set to dominate the Vietnamese power mix under the draft plan.
International Finance Corp. (IFC), the private-sector arm of the World Bank, recently noted that the 36 GW of clean energy generation envisaged by the October draft of the power plan would still be smaller than a planned 38 GW of coal power plants, up from 20 GW in 2020. The IFC said that Vietnam could use LNG as a bridge energy source for its power transition.
Separately, Vietnam Plus reported last week that state-owned utility Vietnam Electricity is pushing Hanoi to introduce regulations for rooftop solar. The company reportedly wants to add 1.5 GW of solar by 2025, with a focus on the poorer northern part of the country.
A feed-in tariff for grid-connected solar drove expansion in the industry, with the 8 MW the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated the country had at the end of 2017 rising to 105 MW a year later. The cumulative total hit 4.99 GW in 2019 and 16.7 GW in 2020.
The IFC has criticised the lack of an auction system to follow up the FIT program. Its assessment appears to be borne out by IRENA’s estimate that no new grid solar capacity was installed in 2021.

Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., a unit of Korea Electric Power Corp. (Kepco), has started working on a 200 MW solar park at a former salt farm in Sinan country, South Jeolla province.
The plant will feature bifacial modules provided by an unnamed manufacturer. The array is scheduled to begin commercial operations by June 2023. The project site is situated in the Honam region, on the southwestern tip of the Korean peninsula.
Kepco said the solar plant will be owned by a group of local residents, a unit of LG, Hoban Industrial, Haedong Construction, and Kepco itself. The project is expected to generate around 270 GWh of electricity per year. It will likely compete in South Korea’s tenders for small-scale and large-scale PV.
South Korea’s largest PV plant is currently a 150 MW solar park that was built by South-East Power in Sinan county. South Jeolla province hosts the largest number of renewable energy projects under development in South Korea.
South Korea reached an installed solar power capacity of around 22 GW at the end of December 2021. New PV capacity additions hit 4.4 GW in 2021. The country plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030.
