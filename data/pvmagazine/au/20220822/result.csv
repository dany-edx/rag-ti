The emergence of solar as the lead source of power in August was first noted on Friday, when it beat out coal for 35 minutes as the primary fuel source in the NEM, which includes all states and territories except Western Australia and the Northern Territory. That effort was eclipsed on Sunday when solar shone brightest for three hours and 20 minutes.
At noon on Sunday, the solar market share in the NEM reached 45.9%, with rooftop PV and utility scale solar producing  a combined 11,213 MW of power while the combined supply of black and brown coal was 39.9% (9,752 MW). Rooftop solar accounted for most of the solar market share, delivering 30.7% while large-scale assets provided 15.2%. In total, renewables provided 58.6% of the market’s power.
Solar also dominated in Western Australia’s main grid on Sunday, responsible for 65.2% of midday generation requirements while coal’s market share dropped to 14% in the Southwest Interconnected System (SWIS). Rooftop solar dominated the solar market share, delivering a staggering 61% of energy in the market. Renewables, including wind, hydro and storage totalled 66.4% generation.

While it is not the first time solar has dominated the market, Joshua Stabler, managing director of Brisbane-based energy consulting firm Energy Edge, said it is the first time it has happened under relatively normal conditions, noting it was not caused by a shortage of coal-fired power, and it happened outside of summer.
“This is the first time in business-as-usual that we’ve ever seen coal be dethroned as [the] number-one fuel source in the market,” he told the ABC. “Coal has been at times up to 80 or 90% of the amount of energy coming into the market. Which means that this is a big event.”
Stabler said he expects solar to play an increasingly prominent role in electricity production in the coming months.
“This is just the first of many events like this,” he said. “Each sort of spring-ish period, what we have is a lot of sun in the sky and not a lot of demand.
“What we will see is more and more events where solar becomes the number-one generator in the market. The coming Sundays over August and September will be testing the 50% market share boundary where demand remains subdued but solar capacity grows.
“While peak solar dispatch will still occur during summer, the hotter weather will bring higher demand so this is the optimal period in terms of maximum market share for solar.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/22/new-energy-solar-to-wind-up-after-sale-of-us-assets/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 22, 2022",New Energy Solar to wind up after sale of US assets,"ASX-listed New Energy Solar confirmed on Monday it had reached a binding agreement to sell its United States solar farm portfolio totalling 606 MW to international investment banking heavyweight Goldman Sachs subsidiary MN8 Energy for $352 million (US$244.5 million).
The deal comes after New Energy Solar sold its Australian solar farms to Thailand’s Banpu last year in an effort to close a large discount between the group’s share price and its net tangible asset backing.
New Energy Solar sold the 87 MW Beryl and 47 MW Manildra solar farms in New South Wales’ central west for $288 million in a bid to create value for investors but the strategy has not delivered the intended results.
The board said since the sale of its Australian assets it has implemented a series of strategic initiatives including a share buyback and a return of capital but “despite these measures, the trading discount persisted”.
New Energy Solar said the deal struck with MN8 is consistent with the net asset value of the US portfolio. The company will deliver an initial return of capital of $0.82 per share, and will deliver a further return or returns of capital estimated to total between $0.13 and $0.163 per share on winding up, which expected to take place prior to the end of 2023.
The sale remains subject to shareholder approval, with a meeting to take place on September 26.

The grant has been awarded under the Regional Community Energy Program, a $20 million fund designed to support capital expenditure for innovative renewable community energy projects.
Construction has already commenced on the Latitude project with Uralla-based construction firm Meralli Solar to install an estimated 20,000 panels.
Those panels are being mounted on the PEG racking solution developed by German manufacturer Jurchen Technology. The system features a low-profile frame which sits on slender galvanized steel bars. The solar panels are seated on the frame and secured in place. The lightweight construction means no major foundations are required, eliminating the need for concrete.

When complete, the solar farm will generate about 13,500 MWh per year of renewable energy, or enough electricity to power approximately 2,300 homes. The asset will connect to the grid via state-owned electricity infrastructure company Essential Energy’s network.
Essential Energy said the Latitude Solar Farm is one of the first renewable energy projects in its network which will operate within an agreed voltage range, improving grid stability.
The network operator also said the battery energy storage system is one of the first to be deployed on its network and the lessons learned during the delivery of this project will help inform other projects.

While final testing and commissioning activities are continuing, Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said in a statement the project, being developed on a 1,500-hectare site near Chinchilla, has already begun generating into the national electricity market.
“A major milestone has been reached on Australia’s largest solar farm under construction with the project now able to export more than 100 MW of clean energy into the nation’s electricity grid,” the statement reads.
When complete, the Western Downs Green Power Hub, which will also include a 200 MW/400 MWh big battery, is expected to produce more than 1,080 GWh of clean energy per year, enough electricity to power more than 230,000 Queensland homes.
“This solar farm, the largest of its kind in Australia, will be able to generate power for a region the size of Logan and Redlands combined,” de Brenni said. “And is a major step towards achieving the government’s 50% renewable energy by 2030 target.”

Neoen Australia managing director Louis de Sambucy said the team is now working to finish the project as quickly as possible, and to ramp up the capacity in coordination with Powerlink and AEMO.
When fully operational, the Western Downs Green Power Hub will add 400 MW of renewable energy into the grid with Queensland government-owned energy generator and retailer CleanCo signed up to take 320 MW.
CleanCo board Chair Jacqui Walters said the power purchase agreement will be used to support commercial and industrial customers to push ahead with their net zero goals and build their global competitiveness with competitively priced energy.
“CleanCo has committed to bringing 1,400 MW of new renewable energy into the market by 2025 and projects like the Western Downs Green Power Hub are underpinning that, so it’s very exciting to see the project coming to completion,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/22/unions-call-for-energy-authority-to-manage-transition/,"EMPLOYMENT,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 22, 2022",Unions call for energy authority to manage transition,"The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has urged the federal government to quickly establish a national energy transition authority tasked with ensuring that workers and their communities affected by the exit of coal-fired generation from Australia’s energy mix are fully supported.
In a paper released on Monday ahead of the jobs and skills summit to be held in Canberra on September 1 and 2, the ACTU said the authority would ensure the affected workers and communities are properly supported through training, reskilling, redeployment and secure job opportunities.
ACTU president Michele O’Neil said 12 coal-fired power stations had closed in the past decade, in most cases leaving workers and communities devastated.
O’Neil said with proper support, those workers can be the first in line to benefit from Australia becoming a renewable energy superpower with the switch to renewables set to create thousands of jobs during both construction and operational phases.
The union peak body said an estimated 395,000 jobs could be created, and $89 billion in revenue generated by 2040 in export industries alone if the transition is managed properly.
“A national energy transition authority will ensure that we don’t have to choose between climate action and good, secure jobs,” O’Neil said.
“Through support for skills and training, redeployment, and secure jobs in new industries we can ensure no worker or region is left behind.”

Alongside the new authority, the ACTU has recommended the development of a national renewables strategy; a national disaster response capability to deal with climate change impacts; climate mitigation and adaptation policies; access to reliable and affordable energy for households and industries; and a net-zero emissions public service by 2030.
The ACTU’s call for a national authority to support workers affected by the rapid decline of coal follows the release of a report by Construction Skills Queensland (CSQ) which shows that state’s renewable energy boom will require up to an additional 26,700 construction workers over the next 20 years.
With the state government targeting 50% renewable energy penetration by 2030, on the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050, the CSQ estimates Queensland will need to install somewhere between 105 GW and 192 GW of additional renewables over the next 30 years. The state’s current installed renewables capacity is 3.8 GW.

“Queensland will need to expand its base of renewable power generating assets by as much as 50-fold by 2050,” CSQ says in the report. “A substantial amount of capital will be allocated to the construction of renewable energy assets over the coming decades in Queensland.”
CSQ chief executive Brett Schimming said capital expenditure of up to $13.9 billion a year would be required to meet the net-zero target.
“Queensland is on the cusp of a renewable energy boom” he said.  “The biggest challenge in delivering the boom could be the scale of the construction workforce required. Now is the time to start thinking about the long-term impact this future could have on labour and skilled trade provision. Then we can plan with eyes wide open to meet the challenge.”
CSQ estimates the number of construction jobs that will be directly created by Queensland’s renewables build-out will range from 14,500 to 26,700.
“The impact of the renewables transition on the construction workforce will be roughly equivalent to the mining boom,” the peak body said. “But unlike the mining boom, the renewables transition will not be a temporary shock to the labour force. It represents a permanent lift in the demand for construction labour in Queensland.”

The “Reveal” research project began in July, with a number of big goals. They are focusing on the further development of advanced technologies that can produce aluminium from alumina without carbon dioxide emissions. And they are working on technologies to use the metal as a medium for long-term storage of electricity as heat, which can be extracted and used to heat homes in buildings during winter months.
The EU Horizon Europe funding program and the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) are supporting the project with €3.6 million (AU$5.25 million). The project will run until 2026.
Reveal’s main focus is the development of technology that can store energy from PV, wind and hydropower for months or even years at low cost. Nine partners from seven different European countries are participating in the project. It builds on ideas and preliminary projects from the SPF Institute for Solar Technology at the OST. The concept is fundamentally different from traditional methods of energy storage such as batteries, hydrogen or synthetic fuels, and uses aluminium metal as a medium for energy storage.
Researchers in Iceland have already shown that electrical energy from renewable sources can be chemically stored in aluminium without emitting greenhouse gases. The OST team was able to back this up by showing that aluminium can be used to generate heat and electrical energy with great efficiency.
Initial model calculations also showed that storing energy in this way can be significantly cheaper than, for example, with power-to-gas or synthetic fuels. The discharge of the energy stored in the aluminium leads to reaction products. These can be converted to aluminium with new energy. But ultimately, the costs and environmental impact will be decisive for the success and sustainability of the concept, according to the Eastern Swiss University of Applied Sciences.

Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corp. (SPNEC), the listed unit of Manila-based PV module manufacturer and project developer Solar Philippines, has announced that it is working on what could be the world’s largest solar project.
SPNEC has unveiled plans to add a 3.5 GW solar farm to its 500 MW flagship project on the island of Luzon, “for which the first 50 MW and the transmission for the full 500 MW are under construction.” Now, the company is looking to acquire another 2,500 hectares in the provinces of Nueva Ecija and Bulacan to extended its original project eightfold.
“At 4 GW, SPNEC’s combined developments in this area would surpass the capacity of India’s Bhadla Solar Farm, currently the world’s largest farm at over 2.2 GW; as well as surpass the capacity of the total grid-connected solar operating in the Philippines as of the end of 2021 at over 1.3 GW,” stated SPNEC.
SPNEC is using the proceeds from various capital raises to acquire the land for the 3.5 GW project extension, including a previously announced stock rights offering to raise at least PHP 10 billion ($179 million), as well as planned asset-for-share swap with parent company Solar Philippines, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022.
SPNEC said it has been able to plan such a massive project as it has been working to secure land and permits since 2016 when it applied with the Department of Energy for its first solar energy service contract in the area. In addition, the company said this clustering of projects will benefit from the transmission infrastructure works already underway in the area, which will extend over 60 kilometres to connect to NGCP’s (National Grid Corp. of the Philippines) substations that supply the Greater Manila Area.
“Over the years, others did not believe these ranchlands far from the grid could be the site for a solar farm,” said Solar Philippines founder Leandro Leviste. “By the end of this year, our planned share issuances should result in the consolidation of ingredients that would enable SPNEC to expand its flagship project to be the world’s largest solar farm.”
