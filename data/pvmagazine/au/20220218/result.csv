“The reality is the economics of coal-fired power stations are being put under increasing, unsustainable pressure by cleaner and lower cost generation, including solar, wind and batteries,” Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria said in a statement.
The company plans to install a big battery of up to 700MW with a dispatch duration of four hours at the Eraring power station site.
Origin said the battery plans are “well advanced” but the timing is not yet certain although it aims to have it mostly built before the 2,880MW plant shuts.
“We’ve been clear on our strategy and ambition to lead the energy transition,” Calabria said.
Origin’s announcement comes on the back of that from fellow energy retailer AGL last week that it would bring forward the planned closure of its two biggest coal-fired power plants – including the 2,640MW Bayswater coal-fired power plant in the Hunter to “no later than” 2033 and for its 2.210MW Loy Yang A power station in Victoria to 2045. AGL’s coal-fired Liddell power plant, also in the Hunter, remains on track to close in April 2023.
Clean Energy Council (CEC) chief executive Kane Thornton said the latest announcement highlights the need for policy and regulatory reform to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and storage.
“What we’re seeing unfold is precisely what the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) anticipated in its draft 2022 Integrated System Plan: a rapid acceleration in coal-fired power station retirements,” he said.
“While the renewable energy industry is ready to deliver replacement supply, these accelerated coal retirements need to be coordinated to ensure our electricity system remains stable through this rapid transition.”

Eraring is the biggest of Australia’s 16 remaining coal-fired power plants. Seven of those are already scheduled to close by 2035 while the last is planned to shut by 2051.
Thornton said Australia’s ageing coal assets represent a key vulnerability in the nation’s power system, and it is critical to bring forward the necessary investment in renewable generation and storage to replace them.
“Investors are willing to develop the projects that put Australia on the pathway to a future powered with clean energy, but what’s missing is a strong federal policy to underpin that new investment,” he said.
Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor described Origin’s decision as “bitterly disappointing”, warning the “early and sudden closure” of the Eraring power plant, which provides about 20% of NSW generation output, would leave a considerable gap in reliable generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
AEMO chief executive Daniel Westerman however said there is enough supply coming into the electricity market to compensate for the exit of Eraring.
“Planned additional transmission capacity – including the announced battery – will give the state access to enough electricity generation to meet the Energy Security Target at the time Eraring closes,” he said.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean is also confident sufficient capacity will be available to adequately replace the Eraring plant, saying the state government would move to accelerate transmission upgrades and the construction of new electricity generation.
Kean said the government will work with industry partners to install the 700MW/1,400MWh “Waratah Super Battery” on the state’s Central Coast by 2025.
“We are also establishing a Transmission Acceleration Facility to accelerate the delivery of priority transmission projects and Renewable Energy Zones, which are modern day power stations,” he said.
“In addition, we are providing a $47.5 million to accelerate the development of pumped hydro in the state.”

Origin acknowledged that bringing forward the closure date for the Eraring power plant presented a challenge for the sector but said it had carefully weighed Eraring’s future for some time.
“This is a market in rapid transition,” Calabria said.
“The cost of renewable energy and battery storage is increasingly competitive, and the penetration of renewables is growing
“Origin’s proposed exit from coal-fired generation reflects the continuing, rapid transition of the NEM as we move to cleaner sources of energy,” Calabria said.
As part of its replacement plan for Eraring, Origin will continue to progress its plans for a battery of up to 700MW to be located on the site and will also seek to bring online additional renewable and storage capacity, including a potential expansion of the Shoalhaven pumped hydro scheme.
Origin on Thursday reported an 18% rise in underlying profit to $268 million for the half-year to December, boosted by record-high revenue from its stake in the Australia Pacific LNG plant, while earnings from its energy markets business fell due to lower power tariffs to customers.

Octopus said DSO will be majority Indigenous-owned and led and shapes as a $50 billion investment opportunity over the next 10 years.
“Through Desert Springs Octopus, we will open up renewable energy and other infrastructure opportunities for First Nations Australians specifically targeting Northern Australia,” the company said in a statement.
Octopus said its “multifaceted” investment will promote renewable energy development, hydrogen production, new water infrastructure, agricultural production, energy for mining, transmission and grid build out.
“The launch of Desert Springs Octopus is incredibly exciting, and it provides a great opportunity for our First Nations communities to contribute to our journey as a nation towards net zero,” Octopus Australia energy markets head Dr Lumi Adisa said.
“Given the current dependence on fossil fuels for power generation especially in northern Australia, Desert Springs Octopus provides an avenue for Indigenous communities to not only reduce their reliance on high-polluting fuels, but also contribute significantly towards renewable energy targets in their respective states.”
DSO co-chair Bevan Mailman told the Nine Entertainment media group the venture’s plans include the development of solar and battery storage, data centres and infrastructure to link the supply to mines as well as the development of wind farms and green hydrogen projects.
The company said plans could also involve the export of clean energy from northern Australia to land-constrained nations including Singapore and Japan.
Mailman said he hopes the venture can start building its first solar project as early as next year.

Octopus Australia, which has invested about $1 billion in renewables in the Australia – including in the 333 MW Darlington Point solar and storage project – since arriving in 2018, said DSO would seek funding from both Octopus and other investors, and involve Indigenous groups holding equity stakes.
Octopus Australia managing director Sam Reynolds said the venture, which adds to its Australian portfolio, shapes as a significant opportunity for investors to develop renewable energy infrastructure while providing meaningful long-term economic benefits to Indigenous Australians.
“Octopus was drawn to this venture initially due to the significant renewable energy investment potential, but for my team and I this goes a lot deeper,” he said.
“Through creating a partnership between the global investment community and our Indigenous communities, we hope the Desert Springs Octopus projects will provide lasting economic and cultural benefits today and for generations to come.
“We also see this as a valuable opportunity to learn from our Indigenous communities and we hope to utilise a vehicle such as Desert Springs Octopus to make this happen.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/18/cefc-gives-green-light-for-specialist-fund-manager/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 18, 2022",CEFC gives green light for specialist fund manager,"Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) on Friday launched specialist venture fund manager Virescent Ventures which is targeting a $200 million capital raise as it looks to lift investment in clean energy technologies and businesses.
Already Australia’s largest specialist cleantech investor, through its $200 million Clean Energy Innovation Fund, the CEFC will own 30% of the newly created Virescent Ventures. It is co-owned by its founders, formerly senior executives with the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, including executive director Ben Gust and investment leads Kristin Vaughan and Blair Pritchard.
The CEFC said the creation of Virescent follows the early success of the government-owned green bank’s Clean Energy Innovation Fund which has invested almost $150 million with direct investments in 21 companies and indirect investments in 100 another companies via three cleantech accelerator and incubator programs.
The latest of those investments is $6 million for Melbourne-based EV charging company Jet Charge.
The CEFC announced earlier this week it had increased its investment in Jet Charge, investing $6 million in the company’s $25 million Series B funding round. The CEFC said it has invested $9.5 million in JET Charge to help accelerate its growth.
To date, each dollar of investment from the CEFC’s innovation fund has attracted an additional $3.07 in private sector investment.

CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth, who now sits on the Virescent board, said there has been “enormous market interest” in the commercialisation of innovative technologies and business models which can accelerate the transition to net zero emissions.
“The success of these companies can benefit our economy and our environment, while enabling Australian innovators to play a leading role in the sustainable economy of the future,” he said.
“In creating Virescent Ventures, we are continuing to lead the market in seeding a new Australian venture manager with an outstanding track record to facilitate additional private sector investment and growth in the cleantech sector.”
The CEFC also confirmed it will outsource the management of its innovation fund to Virescent Ventures, but will remain the owner of those equity positions and would continue to make its own investments.
“The CEFC will continue to invest in cleantech companies where our capital can make a difference,” Learmonth said. “With reserving for follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies, we expect to deploy more than the notional $200 million originally allocated to the Innovation Fund.  The scale and strength of the CEFC balance sheet means we will be able to continue to invest in the cleantech sector drawing on capital from our core fund.”

Gust said the success of the Clean Energy Innovation Fund has generated very strong investor interest in the cleantech sector.
“Sustainability-focused investors are committed to the success of these innovators, recognising that there is no longer a need to choose between emissions impact and commercial impact,” he said.
“Virescent Ventures gives us a powerful opportunity to tap into this interest, by bringing a specialist fund manager to market.”
Virescent said it will back companies in four key areas within the realm of emissions reductions – energy transition, food and agriculture, the circular economy, and mobility and smart cities.
Vaughan said Virescent will be seeking to invest in Australian-focused cleantech start-ups and early-stage companies, including those seeking to expand into global markets.
“We see great potential and diversity among Australia’s cleantech entrepreneurs and are committed to supporting their commercial success, drawing on the positive gains of the Clean Energy Innovation Fund,” she said.

German football club SC Freiburg has announced that a 2.4MW rooftop solar array is currently under construction on the roof of its Europa-Park stadium.
Swiss solar manufacturer Meyer Burger Technology has provided its heterojunction panels for the project, which is claimed to be the world’s largest PV system built on a stadium roof to date.
The project was selected in a tender for commercial PV projects recently held by the German federal network agency and will be developed by Badenova Wärmeplus, SC Freiburg’s energy and environmental partner.
Around 6,000 high-performance solar modules from Meyer Burger will be installed on a 15,000m2 roof area. Badenova Wärmeplus is investing around €2.3 million in the system, which it will operate over a 20-year period.
“In order to meet the high sustainability standards of the city of Freiburg and the sports club, as well as our own standards, we consciously rely on high-performance modules that are manufactured in Germany,” said Badenova board member Heinz-Werner Hölscher.
“This clearly puts us in the photovoltaic Champions League,” says Moritz Borgmann, chief commercial officer at Meyer Burger. “Solar energy offers a lot of potential to reduce emissions using already built-up areas, to become climate-neutral and to give climate protection more drive with a forward-looking technology – not only for soccer clubs.”

The Vistra Energy Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility Phase II set off fire alarms just after 8 p.m. (PST) on Feb. 13. Upon arrival, the local fire department found roughly 10 battery racks that were completely melted. The fire department representatives said that the fire was extinguished.
“We could confirm that it does have a fire suppression system, that the fire suppression system activated, and actually extinguished or cooled the batteries to the point where there wasn’t any flame or fire,” North County Fire District Chief, Joel Mendoza told local media outlets.
Vistra Energy later released an official statement on its website. The company says the onsite fire suppression systems performed as required, at least in the sense that the fire incident was isolated.
The California ISO energy website does show a drop in battery output at 7 p.m., local time. There is no indication this is related to the Moss Landing facility.
Vistra has suggested that the event might be a similar event to a September incident that took down the first phase of the facility. According to a statement from Vistra, that incident involved a cascading series of events which may have started with the failure of a ball bearing in a fan.
The suspected bearing failure is presumed to have set off the very early smoke detection apparatus (VESDA), which in turn armed the heat suppression system. Vistra stated that due to “failures of a small number of couplings on flexible hoses and pipes,” water sprayed directly onto additional battery racks, causing short circuiting and arcing, which damaged the batteries and made more smoke. The additional smoke set off more alarms and caused even more water to spray from the failed couplings.
While the cascading events following the smoke detection can be seen in the data, investigators have not explicitly determined what set off the smoke alarm in the first place.
Vistra says that they had been bringing the first facility back online incrementally, but have now decided to pause those activities. Pv magazine was not able to confirm whether any of the larger facility’s capacity has come back online.
