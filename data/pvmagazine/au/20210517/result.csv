Powercor proposed the plan, to be delivered in two stages, in response to the Victorian Government’s Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) discussion paper. 
It is designed to unlock more large-scale renewable connection opportunities across the four REZs (of six planned for Victoria) within Powercor’s remit — Murray River (V2), Western Victoria (V3), South-West (V4) and the Central North (V6); will support greater distributed residential and commercial rooftop penetration; and is expected to increase the reliability of the network to regional customers by an average of 22%.

“Connecting renewable energy at the distribution network level is fast, simple and generates greater benefits more broadly spread out at the local level,” said Mark Clarke, Powercor’s General Manager of Electricity Networks.
Powercor’s Directions Paper submission on Victorian REZs, published in March, summarised that the applications for connection by large-scale renewable generation it had worked on over the past 20 years were delivered within six months, while application for connection at transmission level could take up to two years.
Distribution network projects were also generally completed in half the time (12 months) of those at transmission level (which took at least two years).
Powercor reasoned in its announcement of the plan today that it could help the Victorian government more quickly transition to renewables, and achieve its recently strengthened emissions reduction target of 45-50% decrease in emissions by 2030, on the way to net-zero in 2050.
Interestingly, it is one of two announcements made at the start of this week that seek novel responses to the lengthy requirements imposed on investment in transmission infrastructure — the other being Energy Estate’s proposal to transport energy in the form of hydrogen from regional renewable energy hubs to manufacturing load centres. Both are evidence perhaps of “don’t build it, and the alternatives will come”.
Powercor’s statement today described its plan’s light footprint compared to transmission build out. It said that its proposal “requires no new easements and uses existing land and assets held by Powercor to ensure no additional impacts on the visual amenity of communities or local agricultural or natural environments.”
At the Smart Energy Summit last week, Anh Mai, the Executive Director for REZ’s in Victoria, and Chloe Hicks, Director of Energy Infrastructure and Zones in New South Wales, both emphasised the importance of understanding local communities’ perspectives on the transition to renewable energy embodied in REZ development — specifically the impacts it will have on their experience of life in regional Australia. 
It’s vital, the two directors said, that people in REZ areas experience the benefits of Renewable Energy Zones, in a way that more than compensates for the disturbance and change that they will bring.
“The real opportunities come from creating jobs and network capacity that will benefit a large number of diverse communities,” says Clarke of Powercor’s network-supporting infrastructure.
The first stage of the Powercor plan is to unlock 1.3 GW of renewable generation capacity by 2025, with some of that capacity delivered within 12 months at an estimated cost of $93 million per GW of capacity unlocked.
Stage 1 centres around the strategic positioning of eight synchronous condensers to ensure system strength on the sub-transmission network, providing greater redundancy to support connection of many of the 2.3 GW of active connection enquiries or applications for solar and wind projects currently under consideration by Powercor. 
It will also include augmentation of Powercor’s 66 kV network to enable a greater number of solar and wind projects to connect, especially in the Geelong, Shepparton, Terang, Ballarat and Bendigo regions.
These improvements to the network are also expected to have a positive impact on transmission network developments as the benefits conferred by synchronous condensers can be shared by generators on either transmission or distribution lines. Powercor also said its program of work will complement construction of new transmission-level investments.
Stage 2 of the Powercor rollout will see installation of another eight synchons, but centres on the installation of some 20 large batteries with a total of up to 1.12 GW capacity, positioned within or beside existing zone power stations on the network.
“These assets,” said Powercor’s Directions Paper, will “provide further benefits to regional communities, particularly in locations where traditional augmentation cannot be justified via the Australian Energy Regulator’s investment frameworks”.
It identifies optimum positions for the batteries to benefit from being close to customers in Njill, Charam, Cobram, Robinvale, Boundary Bend and Ouyen. “This storage will also be of higher value in the market, given its closer proximity to end customer load,” said the paper.
The Powercor network supplies 11,200 medium commercial and industrial businesses and 106,000 small to medium businesses concentrated in sectors such as health care, social assistance, agriculture, forestry and fishing, which are calculated when combined to generate 25% of Victoria’s gross domestic product — an economically as well as socially important customer base.

Clarke said today that distribution networks should be considered as part of a whole-of-network solution to unlocking the state’s targeted 10 GW of new renewable energy capacity as fast as possible, and that having comparatively smaller installations connected to the distribution network would allow more projects to be built simultaneously, spreading the job opportunities across regional Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/17/2-billion-blueprint-to-run-a-green-hydrogen-river-through-the-hunter-valley/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,PUMPED HYDRO,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 17, 2021",$2 billion blueprint to run a green hydrogen river through the Hunter Valley,"At its heart, Energy Estate’s proposal released this morning, to create Australia’s first hydrogen valley in the New South Wales Hunter region, is a simple, elegant plan to put power transmission underground in the form of hydrogen pipelines, linking some of New South Wales’ biggest renewable energy producing zones to the electricity-ravenous industrial ring of the coastal city of Newcastle, and to the world.
But the plan, which has been a couple of years in the making, says Energy Estate Principal, Vincent Dwyer, has also picked its moment — that of a knife-edge state by-election that threatens to squeeze Liberal Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s slim majority, of the polarising gas peaker plant forced by the Federal Government at Kurri Kurri, of significant energy hubs in development throughout the state — to present “an alternative narrative”.
“We looked at the pinch points in the transition,” Dwyer told pv magazine Australia this morning. “Given that we need to decarbonise heavy industry, transport and the chemical sector, we need massive investment in the transmission system, which has been a real headache for people.”
Not only is transmission build-out constrained by long-lead-time processes such as the Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission (RIT-T), it most often represents an investment risk in that it could in the meantime be superseded by other technologies — such as more flexible virtual transmission based on battery storage, or, indeed, ever more viable hydrogen supplies swishing through pipelines.
Transmission also raises the ire and objective of communities and landowners bound to live in its shadow. 
The Hunter Valley, a region questing for an alternative employment and renewed industrial base to replace coal mining and departing fossil-fuel power stations is, says Dwyer, “an area of particularly complex social licence, between vineyards and horses and mines”.
But where transmission infrastructure means towers and a 60-metre easement, pipes are underground, and require only a 20-metre easement — “it’s a small, buried pipeline, so it hasn’t got quite the same level of social license issues as 500 kV transmission lines,” suggests Dwyer.
Energy Estate, an energy consultancy as well as a renewable energy developer, already had many of the connections to envisage emerging hydrogen as an alternative solution to transporting electrons from new areas of green generation to traditional areas of high usage.
It is an adviser to Idemitsu Australia Resources, which is re-envisaging the future of its Muswellbrook Coal acquisition as a potential pumped-hydro energy storage site and an adjacent clean-energy-powered industrial precinct.
Energy Estate’s massive Walcha Energy Project on which it is partnered with MirusWind, is gradually jumping through the regulatory hoops of co-locating pumped hydro that repurposes Dungowan Dam with up to 700 MW of solar on the Salisbury Plains; up to 700 MW of wind power at Winterbourne Wind Farm (acquired by Vestas in 2019); and a 100 MW battery energy storage system (BESS).
Its Hydrogen Growth platform has joint ventures and advisory roles around the country, among them the partnership with Hills International College to develop a hydrogen plant at its Jimboomba campus in Queensland. 
It has been in discussion with Atlassian’s Mike Cannon-Brookes-backed Beyond Zero Emissions think tank on BZE’s latest campaign to gather participants and momentum for re-envisioning the Hunter and Gladstone as Renewable Energy Industrial Precincts.
“Then we thought, if we’re going to deliver this, let’s pull together someone who knows pipelines” — enter APA Group; “someone who knows gas generation” — AGL is the participating energy utility; someone who knows the route to market for global export of ammonia — Trafigura and Idemitsu are keen; “and large renewable energy developers” — WalchaEnergy, of course, and another partner of Energy Estate, RES Australia.
The resulting Hunter Hydrogen Network (H2N) project is envisaged in two stages, with the second a little looser than the first, to take advantage of emerging cost advantages and market developments in a constantly changing energy landscape.
As Dwyer says, “There is such a variety of uses for hydrogen — in transport, in chemical plants to create caustic, to create ammonia and chlorine through electrolysis, you can use it to create all sorts of green plastics, it can be used drive gas-peaker plants — we want to remain open to all these derivative markets as they evolve.”
The first stage of the project aims to produce green hydrogen in Muswellbrook, and transport it via short pipeline to the site of Liddell Power Station, which AGL is scheduled to close in April 2023, and could be repurposed for a variety of green hydrogen-utilising activities, such as chemical facilities and/or a second gas peaker plant.
The Walcha Energy Project also plans to bring the majority of its 4.5 MW of renewable energy via a privately developed transmission line, Walcha Link, to the Liddell vicinity where it can be used for hydrogen production, or be distributed using existing network infrastructure, throughout the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Independently of its H2N project, Energy Estate is “out in the market with Walcha Link right now,” says Dwyer, “discussing the opportunities associated with that.” 
Dwyer envisages supplying the future H2N hydrogen product of the Muswellbrook/Liddell ecosystem as green feedstock for mining, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and other industrial uses.

Stage 2 will see a pipeline connecting the Muswellbrook/Liddell production hub to Newcastle, “with laterals to Kurri Kurri for the gas peaker, if that’s how Snowy Hydro chooses to fuel it, out to Williamtown to fuel army operations or to the Tomago industrial precinct,” says Dwyer.
He says that the consortium assembled under H2N could deliver competitively priced green hydrogen today, but that the pipeline and potential port infrastructure to ship the product to international markets is where the project will require government support.
Unable to conscience policies promoting renewable electrons, the Federal Government is much more likely to be able to wrap its National Hydrogen Roadmap around a plan to boost the Hunter region, especially given this Saturday’s knife-edge state by-election in which a YouGov poll found no candidate had more than 25% of the vote (Layzell is on 25%, Labor’s Jeff Drayton polled 23%) — in the traditionally safe Nationals seat.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/17/going-fission-how-scientific-enquiry-by-unsw-may-push-solar-cell-efficiency-to-38-2/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 17, 2021",Going fission! How scientific enquiry by UNSW may push solar cell efficiency to 38.2%,"“This is a scientific paper rather than a new-product release,” cautions Nichols Ekins-Daukes, emphasising the theoretical win documented in a new paper he co-authored on the discovered effects of adding a layer of singlet-fission material such as tetracene to silicon solar cells. 
The benefits are two-fold, in that the tetracene layer doubles the number of electrons produced by each photon in photovoltaics, from one to two. That is, “a photo-excited singlet exciton undergoes fission into two triplet excitons, producing twice the electronic charge carriers for each absorbed photon,” explains the paper.
This increases the efficiency or output of energy converted from sunlight by the solar cell — although it doesn’t necessarily double it.
“In terms of our study, we’ve got our solar cell operating at 32%,” Ekins-Daukes tells pv magazine Australia, “which is substantially higher than baseline solar at 26%.”
He points out that some of the study’s co-authors have previously made calculations on the absolute efficiency achievable with singlet fission — ”and that takes you to 45.9%, so in principle the concept can lead to really high gains”.
The second benefit, which the authors say is often overlooked in the race to increase everyday efficiency of solar conversion, is the module-life extension bestowed by this process, because it lowers the operating temperature of the silicon cells.
Professor Martin Green of the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering at UNSW, a co-author of this paper, has often been heard to say that solar modules would prefer to be operating in a fridge, and yet their working environment can see them reach temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius.
The single-fission process using tetracene in particular, compared to other possible singlet fission materials, is endothermic; in this investigation it was found to reduce the operating temperature of the solar cell by 2.4 degrees Celsius. 
Given that every 10-degree reduction in operating temperature over time can double the lifespan of solar cells, the authors calculated that the reduction brought about by singlet fission would add 4.5 years to today’s typical high-performance panels, bringing the theoretical warrantable period up from current 25 years to 29.5 years and delivering substantially more electricity over their lifetime.
A bonus delivered by tetracene is that although it degrades over time, its degradation makes it transparent to sunlight. Explains Ekins-Daukes: “Initially the solar cell would be more efficient, then if that singlet fission material degrades, it gets out of the way, so the solar cell efficiency will drop, but only to the performance level you’d expect of a baseline silicon cell.”
The paper, titled Singlet fission and tandem solar cells reduce thermal degradation and enhance lifespan, actually compared the performance gains of two types of tandem solar cell — those layered with perovskite material and those topped with tetracene. Table 1 shows the differences in performance, with singlet fission using tetracene to  be a clear winner.

Tandem approaches are at various stages of development, and “All have a question mark next to them,” says Ekins-Daukes.
He adds that some technologies have so far received more investment and attention than others, but “The opportunity here is that the molecular single-fission layer in principle is just an add-on to the manufacturing of photovoltaic devices.”
Via this study, tetracene has become a useful prototype, even though it may not be the material eventually used should the technology go into production.
The origins of the study stem from an interdisciplinary approach enabled by the ARC Centre for Excellence in Exciton Science, of which UNSW SPREE and the School of Chemistry at UNSW are participants.
“The ARC Centre is funded to study the fundamental processes, such as are going on in this material,” says Ekins-Daukes. 
SPREE typically works closely with industry to improve efficiency of near-term manufacturable devices. Professor Green’s recent wide-ranging desktop study on a variety of module-cooling mechanisms including vortex generators is an example of the group’s extremely successful, industry-integrated approach.
“But this was an opportunity where we could partner with our colleagues in the Science School and take a piece of science that is in its early stage, demonstrating the single-fission mechanism and some of the candidate materials,” says Ekins-Daukes.
Another co-author on the project, Murad Tayebjee, also with SPREE, is working to find alternatives to tetracene that may be receptive to more of the solar spectrum, or that are more stable than tetracene over time.
In the meantime, the tetracene study has shown the necessary effects, says Ekins-Daukes, “and provides us with the opportunity to push the concept forward, while finding suitable alternative materials.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/17/how-will-you-know-its-green-hydrogen/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 17, 2021",How will you know it’s green hydrogen?,"Last week at the Smart Energy Summit, green hydrogen’s cred was boosted by the announcement of new founding partners to the Smart Energy Council-initiated Zero Carbon Certification Scheme, which will verify the origins of renewable hydrogen, green ammonia, and eventually of metals processed using  green energy.
The Victorian Government has now joined the Scheme’s initial list of eight founding partners announced at its launch in December 2020.
Lily D’Ambrosio Victoria’s Minister for Energy, Climate and the Environment, beamed into the mostly face-to-face Summit via Zoom, to say, “I’m really excited about the potential for renewable hydrogen.”
She named the decarbonisation of gas supplies and the powering of green manufacturing as among the opportunities it provides and added, “To support the industry we also need ways to trace and certify where and how hydrogen is made … Schemes like this are instrumental to encouraging best practice in production and boosting investor confidence.”
The team at Australian innovator Power Ledger are experts in using the blockchain to digitally trace, track and trade units of energy, and environmental commodities, and last week also brought their expertise and support to the Zero Carbon Certification Scheme partners’ circle.
Dr Jemma Green, Co-founder and Chairman of Power Ledger, said she was delighted to partner with the SEC and others “to help the green economy grow internationally and domestically in Australia.” 

The Zero Carbon Certification Scheme will deal only with green hydrogen, emphasises Scott Hamilton, advisor to the scheme, who is also on the Strategic Advisory Panel to the Australian-German Energy Transition Hub.
“We don’t want potential greenwashing or blurring of what is green and what is not,” he said, adding that customers for high-density green fuel who see the Scheme’s brand “will have confidence that they’re getting zero-emissions hydrogen.”
At the opening session of the conference, former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had set the tone of discussion, saying, “Green hydrogen, that’s the only kind of hydrogen we should be planning for.” He described blue hydrogen — made from fossil fuels but capturing and sequestering the carbon produced in some form — as “BS.”
He said, “I’m old enough to remember when we thought carbon capture and storage [CCS] would work and we were sincere… but it does not work, other than in some very specialised situations.”
Green hydrogen is the only hue, he said: “There is no other colour of hydrogen that you can responsibly support.”
The Zero-Carbon Certification Scheme is designed to build faith in the green hydrogen ecosystem.
Hamilton says it was initially planned to focus on the needs of local founding members such as CWP Global, “making sure that they can attract investment to get the Asian Renewable Energy Hub up and running”.
To be located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, the AREH will build 26 GW of wind and solar capacity, some 3 GW of which will be allocated to large energy users in the region, while the bulk of generation will be dedicated to large-scale production of clean hydrogen for domestic and export markets. The project is expected to reach a financial investment decision in 2025.

In the months since it launched, the Scheme has emerged as a globally significant certification initiative, with overseas founding partners such as the US-based Ammonia Energy Association, which sees certification “as a critical part of establishing green ammonia as a viable energy source for decarbonising the energy system,” says Hamilton.
He cited shipping as one of the biggest sectors likely to rely on green ammonia for decarbonisation of its activities.
The Scheme’s pilot certification is of the ACT’s ActewAGL hydrogen refuelling station, the first public facility of its kind in Australia, which will be assessed by Point Advisory, a sustainability services company that is on the Clean Energy Regulator’s register of certified auditors. 
Hamilton expects this first certification will be completed by July 2021.
He says the next step for the Scheme is likely to be a study assessing “the potential transport emissions associated with exporting renewable ammonia to places like Japan and Germany.”
All emissions in the green hydrogen supply chain will be considered during certification, with producers required to offset any residual emissions using Australian-accredited or internationally recognised offset programs.
COP26 High Level Champions for Climate Action, another of the SEC’s founding partners in the Scheme, brings members such as the US politician, philanthropist and author, Michael Bloomberg, and the UK’s High Level Climate Action Champion Nigel Topping to the Scheme’s promotion and guidance.

“It’s really important,” says Hamilton, “to have people who are going to be around the conference in Glasgow later this year, supporting the Scheme and advocating for us.”
Chief Executive of the Smart Energy Council, John Grimes, says that trusted certification of green hydrogen is a critical step in building the jobs and industries of the future.
D’Ambrosio credited Grimes for his tireless advocacy and commitment to the Scheme, saying, “This is exactly what is needed to accelerate renewable hydrogen in Australia.”
