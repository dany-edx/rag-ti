https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/19/energyaustralia-explores-microgrid-technology-in-melbourne-housing-estate/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 19, 2021",EnergyAustralia explores microgrid technology in Melbourne housing estate,"EnergyAustralia has revealed plans to develop a 210 kW rooftop solar PV project coupled with a centralised 100 kW/270 kWh battery energy storage system as part of the Rathdowne residential housing estate being developed by Villawood Properties in the Melbourne suburb of Wollert.
The Solstice precinct will form part of the 1,100-home Rathdowne estate. It will comprise 36 townhouses and a large residents’ club which will store and share power generated by solar PV systems installed on their rooftops.
Four of the townhouses in the Solstice precinct will be fitted with 3 kW rooftop solar PV systems, 32 will have 4 kW solar arrays installed while a 70 kW solar system will be installed on the roof of the residents’ club.
The solar PV infrastructure will be supported by a 100 kW/ 270 kWh battery energy storage system (BESS) located at the residents’ club.
EnergyAustralia said the solar+storage system will be managed by an intelligent microgrid platform that controls the energy flow across the precinct. Any excess renewable energy generated within the microgrid that is not consumed by the townhouses will be fed back into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Villawood Properties executive director Rory Costelloe said the microgrid, which has been endorsed by the Victorian government’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, has the potential to cut annual power bills in half.
Figures provided by Villawood suggest the annual power bill for those living in a townhouse in the Solstice precinct will total $892 while those in a standard townhouse will pay $1943 each year.
The savings estimates are based on a Solstice townhouse fitted with a 4 kW solar PV system generating 5.3 MWh of renewable energy each year coupled with battery storage, compared to a typical three-bedroom townhouse without solar consuming 6 MWh per annum.

“The microgrid, combining individual solar PV systems and a centralised battery together with smart home capabilities, is a game-changer that will help residents use energy much more efficiently and lower their bills by up to 50%,” Costelloe said.
EnergyAustralia chief customer officer Mark Brownfield said the project could provide a blueprint for low-cost, sustainable, residential energy.
“Our purpose at EnergyAustralia is to lead and accelerate the clean energy transformation for all, from small community projects to providing clean energy for the state,” he said.
“That’s what’s so exciting about the Solstice precinct microgrid at Wollert — it demonstrates what can be done at a local level.
“The technology helps residents become self-sufficient, gives them control over their energy use, reduces their bills as well as their carbon emissions.
“We believe what we’re doing in Wollert is the start of more community energy solutions being rolled out across Australia.”
EnergyAustralia, which has approximately 2.5 million customers in the NEM, owns and operates a multi-billion-dollar energy generation portfolio across Australia.

The gen-tailer has considerably broadened its generation sources in recent years, with investments in wind and solar totalling more than $3 billion and 1000 MW of capacity. Its portfolio includes power purchase agreements with Coleambally, Ross River, Manildra and Gannawarra solar farms.
In addition, the retailer has plans to replace the Yallourn coal-fired power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley with a four-hour 350 MW capacity big battery. The battery is expected to be delivered by 2026. EnergyAustralia already operates two utility-scale battery storage systems – the stand-alone Ballarat terminal station and co-located Gannawarra solar farm battery assets that represent combined storage of 80 MWh.
Construction of the Solstice precinct is expected to commence late in 2021 with the first residents to move in next year.
“The microgrid will really come into its own once all the townhouses and the clubhouse are finished,” Costelloe said.
“Early next year we are hoping to have proven the power and financial benefits.”
The Solstice microgrid project has secured the support of the state government’s Microgrid Demonstration Initiative which is designed to support the development and implementation of microgrid demonstration projects in Victoria.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/19/anu-researchers-claim-29-efficiency-world-record-for-bifacial-solar-cell/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 19, 2021",ANU researchers claim 29% efficiency world record for bifacial solar cell,"Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra have produced a dual-sided silicon solar cell with a front conversion efficiency of 24.3% and a rear conversion efficiency of 23.4%, representing a bifacial factor of 96.3%. The performance represents an effective power output of approximately 29%.
Chief investigator Dr Marco Ernst said the figure outstrips the performance of the best single-sided silicon solar cell.
“This is a world record for selectively laser-doped solar cells and among the highest efficiency bifacial solar cells,” Ernst said.
The result, which the research team said has been independently verified by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), was achieved by using specific laser-doping technology to fabricate the cells.
“Laser-doping uses lasers to locally increase electrical conductivity,” Ernst said.
“It is a low-cost, industry-compatible process for boosting solar cell efficiency.”
Principal investigator Dr Kean Chern Fong said the bifacial solar cells easily beat the performance of single-sided silicon solar cells and provide efficiency benefits for solar PV projects.
Bifacial solar cells, which are commanding an increasing share of the market, absorb light from both the front and rear surfaces of the device, capturing albedo light reflected off the ground and roof surfaces that would otherwise be lost.
“We have developed what I would call a true bifacial solar cell, as it has nearly symmetrical power generation capacity on both surfaces of the device,” Fong said.
“When deployed on a conventional solar farm, a bifacial cell absorbs direct incoming light, while also taking advantage of ground reflection, which can contribute up to additional 30% power generation.
“Bifacial solar cells are becoming increasingly important in the roll out of solar farms and are expected to have a market share of over 50% in the next five years.
“Our work demonstrates the incredible capabilities of this technology.”

The result is the latest milestone for scientists at ANU, which received $3.6 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in January as part of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics Infrastructure project.
Earlier this month, scientists working on the PV potential of ultra-thin 2D materials discovered the ability of the materials to generate solar energy can be controlled by “twisting” the angle between two layers of the material.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/19/cefc-to-pursue-priority-areas-after-year-of-investment-firsts/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 19, 2021",CEFC to pursue ‘priority areas’ after year of investment firsts,"After a year of landmark investments that saw its focus move beyond wind and solar projects, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has revealed it is pursuing a strong pipeline of potential investments in what it dubbed “priority areas”, including clean hydrogen, energy storage and grid projects.
The CEFC released its latest Investment Report on Wednesday, revealing in the 12 months to June 30, 2021 it had made investment commitments totalling $1.37 billion across 22 clean energy projects with a combined value of $5 billion.
Total commitments reached $9.54 billion, with $7.4 billion deployed, with the CEFC saying it had spurred almost $33 billion in investment commitments to clean energy initiatives across the economy.
Since its inception, the bulk of CEFC funding has gone to large-scale wind and solar projects but chief executive Ian Learmonth said investments into new areas accounted for about a third of new commitments in the past year.
“The commitments of the 2020-21 year reflect the importance of our purpose, in leading investment to accelerate Australia’s transition to a low-emissions economy,” he said.
“We are increasingly using our capital to drive investment in hard-to-abate activities.
“We’re excited to be backing the evolution of clean hydrogen as a low-emissions energy source for transport, manufacturing and industry.
“We’re also pleased to be investing in complex large-scale transmission infrastructure, which is so essential for Australia to leverage our natural advantage as a renewable energy powerhouse.”

Learmonth said the CEFC investment commitments are assisting with the delivery of low-emissions priorities outlined in the Australian Government Technology Investment Roadmap, including investing in technologies such energy storage and large-scale transmission infrastructure.
The $10 billion CEFC also confirmed it has a strong focus on hydrogen-related investments and is actively pursuing large-scale investment opportunities through its recently unveiled $300 million Advancing Hydrogen Fund.
“These large-scale investments can take time to develop, (but) we are looking forward to reaching financial close on our first large-scale transaction,” Learmonth said.
The CEFC has already finalised its first green hydrogen-related investment with $750,000 provided to Wollongong University start-up Hysata to commercialise electrolyser production technology.
It is one of a string of investment firsts notched by the CEFC in the 12 months to June 30, 2021.
The CEFC also completed in its first major transmission transaction with $125 million allocated to TransGrid to help deliver grid infrastructure critical to the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project.
TransGrid will draw on the CEFC finance to design, construct, operate and maintain a new 330 kV switching station and associated transmission lines which will connect Snowy 2.0 to the National Electricity Market (NEM).

In 2020-21, the CEFC also delivered its single largest investment to date, a $295 million subordinated note to help accelerate delivery of Project EnergyConnect, the high-voltage electricity transmission interconnector between South Australia and New South Wales.
The 900-kilometre interconnector, which will include a short spur into northwest Victoria, is forecast to unlock some 1.8 GW of renewable energy generation in its path.
The green energy bank also finalised its largest energy storage investment to date with $160 million committed to build the 300 MW Victorian Big Battery, providing a critical boost to the state’s grid security while supporting more renewable energy.
The year also delivered the CEFC’s first solar PV technology investment with $10 million awarded to Shanghai-based Sunman to develop its lightweight, flexible eArc solar panels.
The panels, made from a lightweight polymer composite material are 70% lighter than traditional glass panels, and the CEFC said they have the “potential to revolutionise Australia’s use of rooftop solar”.
Only two large-scale solar projects attracted CEFC financing in the 12 months to June 30, 2021 with $74.38 million awarded to Canadian Solar to help financing the construction of its 150 MW Suntop and 110 MW Gunnedah solar farms in western New South Wales.
“While the nature of CEFC investments continues to evolve, an enduring characteristic of the CEFC is the commercial rigour of our investment approach,” Learmonth said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/19/energy-storage-projects-attract-attention-of-global-epc-giant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 19, 2021",Energy storage projects attract attention of global EPC giant,"Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services provider Sterling and Wilson has announced it plans to broaden its EPC offerings in the renewable space to include solutions for energy storage projects and hybrid energy power plants.
The EPC contracting giant, which has an Australian order book that includes five major solar PV projects with a combined total of more than 1.1 GW, also intends to deliver solutions for waste-to-energy projects.
Sterling and Wilson Australia CEO Philip Sheridan said the company aims to use its project management skills and strong stakeholder relationships to become a global leader in the energy market of the future.
“Australia is witnessing a significant change from traditional sources to cleaner energy forms for power generation,” he said.
“Several coal-fired power plants are reaching the end of their service life and consumer pressure is mounting to deliver future energy solutions that are more reliable, cost effective and sustainable.
“By diversifying into these key renewable areas, we aim to deliver new and innovative solutions to Australia’s future energy market and believe that our latest global offerings could open greater possibilities in the country’s renewable energy space.
“As a long-term operator in Australian market, we are excited to be part of this transition and provide investors with greater options to confidently invest in the region.”
Sterling and Wilson’s new focus will see it look beyond utility-scale, rooftop and floating solar power projects and operations and maintenance (O&M) services to seek opportunities to build hybrid energy power plants comprising two or more sources of energy, generally renewables, with or without energy storage.
In an emailed statement, the company said a large part of the global energy market is moving towards microgrids based on 100% renewable energy and that there is a huge demand for decentralized power plants because they are environment-friendly and economically viable.
The company said the waste-to-energy segment is another growing market.
“We believe the opportunities in these segments are huge,” Sterling and Wilson global CEO Amit Jain said.
“With the increased focus globally on low-carbon energy consumption and the resultant growing demand for green energy solutions, this is a logical extension of our business into the rapidly growing ESG space, thereby becoming a diversified renewables company.”
The announcement comes just weeks after Sheridan told pv magazine the integration of battery energy storage systems into solar PV farms in Australia will not only open up new business models and potential revenue streams but will be crucial for effective management of the nation’s energy supply as solar and wind grid penetration continues to increase.
Sheridan said with the demand for variable and dispatchable sources set to increase as Australia’s ageing fleet of thermal generators retire, grid operators and energy regulators are beginning to consider more closely how batteries can fit into the wider energy landscape.
“Building in battery storage unlocks the untapped potential to harness solar energy,” he said.
“Being able to generate during the day and being able to store and then dispatch in periods of peak demand has certainly got real opportunity.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/19/solar-modules-are-being-detained-by-customs-agents-reports-suggest/,"LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 19, 2021","Solar modules are being detained by customs agents, reports suggest","From pv magazine USA
Solar module shipments to the U.S. appear to have been detained by Customs and Border Protection agents as part of an enforcement action aimed at banning the import of solar equipment containing components provided by a Chinese company suspected of using forced labor.
Roth Capital Partners said that JinkoSolar had around 100 MW of product detained by border agents. The analyst said that Jinko may not ship hundreds of megawatts of capacity to the U.S. as long as the customs inquiry is in process.
Canadian Solar also was said to have had four testing samples detained, and Trina Solar may have had six testing samples detained in July.
Action taken on June 24 by the Biden administration included a “Withhold Release Order” by the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) against Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Withhold Release Order instructs personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
(Read “Border action ordered for solar components made by Chinese manufacturer.”)
The CBP acted in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labor being in the solar supply chain in the Xinjiang region of China. The report that modules actually were being detained was among the first indication that enforcement action may be under way.
A spokesperson for JinkoSolar said the company would not comment on the report. Requests by pv magazine USA for comment from Canadian Solar and Trina Solar were not immediately returned.
Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said that “almost any module coming to the U.S. cannot yet prove it does not have Hoshine silicon metal.” He said that traceability protocols do not yet go far enough up the supply chain. In addition, it may take 6-12 months to develop the traceability capability up through silicon metal or quartz. Shen said that solar cells may be manufactured in Southeast Asia, Europe or the U.S., “but the challenge is that 95-99% of the world’s wafers come from China.”
In a related move, a group called the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed petitions requesting that the Department of Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The group said in a trio of petitions totaling more than 600 pages that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
Timothy Brightbill, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Wiley Rein, declined to identify the companies that joined in filing the petitions. In an email, he said that “Given the Chinese control of the entire solar supply chain, retaliation is likely if their identities are revealed.” He said that in such situations, the companies who make up the coalition “are allowed under U.S. law to remain confidential.”
The organization said that while Chinese companies “now almost exclusively” export to the United States from Southeast Asia, “the vast majority” of manufacturing, research and development, and capital investment remain in China. The group called for duties on Chinese solar products to be extended to what it said were “circumventing entities.”
The group asked the Commerce Department to investigate the following companies:
Malaysia: Jinko Solar Technology Sdn. Bhd.; LONGi (Kuching) Sdn. Bhd. and its affiliate Vina Cell Technology Company Limited and Vina Solar Technology Company Limited; JA Solar (Malaysia) Co., Ltd. or JA Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.
Thailand: Canadian Solar Manufacturing (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Trina Solar Science & Technology (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Talesun Solar Technologies Thailand or Talesun Technologies (Thailand) Co., Ltd.; Astroenergy Solar Thailand Co., Ltd

In the U.S., where virtual PPAs make up three-quarters of the market, tech giants like Google and Amazon are leading the charge. In Europe, where physical PPAs are prominent, renewable energy law reforms (particularly in Spain and Italy) have prompted growing numbers of transactions. And according to a new report from Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac), corporate renewable PPAs are “playing a bigger role in decarbonising Asia Pacific”. 
Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and despite only 10% of the Asia Pacific’s RE100 companies having signed corporate PPAs, WoodMac estimates that corporate renewable PPA volume more than doubled to 3.8 GW in 2020 compared to 2019. To put that figure in perspective, Hannah Hunt, impact director at RE-Source, told pv magazine that corporate PPA announcements in Europe for 200 reached a record of 4 GW, only 400 MW more. 
WoodMac senior analyst Rishab Shrestha said “Corporate renewable procurement is on the rise and Asia Pacific is starting to play a bigger role with 10.9 GW of cumulative capacity procured until H1 2021.” 
Australia, India and Taiwan are the regions leaders when it comes to corporate renewable PPAs, with a cumulative procurement capacity of 3.2 GW, 5.2 GW and 1.3 GW respectively. Taiwan, like Europe, booming thanks to energy reform laws. In the near future a similar boom may be seen in Vietnam as well, with the nation currently running a direct PPA pilot programme until 2022. 
Shrestha also expects Singapore and Japan to join those ranks in coming years. “Singapore is the most developed procurement market in Southeast Asia but has limited land availability for renewable projects. Japan’s procurement is largely limited to onsite projects, but we expect policy updates by year’s end.”
According to Shrestha this growth is in good part thanks to decarbonisation targets (though not at the federal level in Australia of course), but more importantly, from “falling renewables premium and rising power tariffs in Asia Pacific making corporate renewable PPAs more attractive.” 
WoodMac says the renewables premium has fallen across all markets in the Asia Pacific region and is expected to be 45% below power tariffs on average by 2025, which, after transmission charges, wheeling and the like, means an expected discount above 30% by 2025. 
Of all corporate buyers, industrial offtakers accounted for 57% of the PPAs contracted in 2020, particularly companies in the electronics manufacturing and mining industries. Retail and service followed up with a 25.4% share, and the technology sector made up 16.9% as tech firms seek novel ways to power data centres and meet their decarbonisation goals. 
“Interestingly,” continued Shrestha, “although RE100 memberships in the Asia Pacific have increased year-on-year, only 10% of the 99 member companies signed corporate PPAs in the region. Most Asia Pacific headquartered RE100 companies rely on onsite installation and net-metering solar projects to power their operations using renewables.” 
Shrestha argues that businesses in the Asia Pacific regions are putting increasing pressure on regulatory bodies to ease corporate procurement regulations “towards offsite generation offering larger capacities.” 
“While challenges remain,” concluded Shrestha, “policy, corporate ambition and economics are starting to tilt the balance towards a more conducive corporate PPA landscape for growth.”

The contractor which has landed the deal to install a 4.8 MWp solar plant on the planned new headquarters of the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) has claimed the project will feature “the most energy efficient solar cells currently available worldwide.”
James Stewart, general manager of the state-owned ALEC Energy unit of Dubai-based construction company ALEC – quoted in a press release on the DEWA website – said: “Accredited laboratories will conduct numerous sophisticated performance tests, quality controls and rigorous durability tests prior to the manufacturing of the … PV panels.” DEWA did not announce any further technical details about the panels and cells to be installed on the roof and facade of its Al-Shera’a office, which is being planned in the Al Jaddaf area of the emirate.
Announcing the contract win by ALEC; Abu Dhabi-based main contractor Ghantoot Transport & General Contracting; and Canadian-owned consultant Atkins last week, DEWA said the project would feature almost 21,150m2 of rooftop PV and more than 1,000m2 of building-integrated PV on the facade, plus “shaded structure PV” and solar trees.
The utility said ALEC will design “customised, walkable solar panels with a high transparency feature.”
The two million square foot, 15-floor building, which will house 5,000 employees, is intended to consume no more energy than it will generate annually and has been designed to receive a platinum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating and a gold rank from the WELL Building Standard.
ALEC’s Stewart added: “This project and the integrated solar design truly pushes the boundaries of solar power further.”
DEWA did not offer up a timetable for construction of the skyscraper, whose name means sail in Arabic.
