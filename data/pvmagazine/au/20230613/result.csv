Overall, the government has allocated $19 billion over the next four years to help realise its Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan. This funding tranche sits within an $89 billion four-year infrastructure program – though it is worth noting this also includes water, 2032 Olympic games, as well as state housing and school infrastructure.
The Queensland government has been pushing its model of state-owned energy infrastructure for some time now – something which sits in contrast to many other states, including its neighbour New South Wales, which has a highly privatised energy system. In March, NSW elected a new Labor government that campaigned on keeping more energy assets in state hands, meanwhile Victoria recently opted to put transmission back into the state government’s remit.
Which is to say, Labor state governments are turning to public ownership to drive the energy transition and assuage community concerns and issues around social license. In the Queensland government’s budget announcements, Treasurer Cameron Dick noted his government will also take action “to enshrine into law public ownership of Queensland’s electricity assets.”
Building from this philosophy, the state government will rely heavily on its six publicly-owned energy entities to transition the state’s coal-reliant energy system. Queensland’s public entities include Energy Queensland, Powerlink Queensland, Stanwell Corporation, CleanCo, CS Energy, and the newly formed Queensland Hydro – which is charged with delivering the state’s publicly-owned pumped hydro projects.
The Queensland government has budgeted an additional $6 billion for the Borumba Pumped Hydro Energy Storage project. Estimated to cost $14.2 billion overall, the 2 GW project is to be located west of Gympie and is targeting completion by 2030.
The budget allocated the remaining $1 billion to the Pioneer-Burdekin project, west of Mackay. At 5 GW/120 GWh, the Pioneer-Burdekin will be the largest pumped hydro storage system in the world, the Queensland government says. Little detail was included on what precisely the $1 billion will fund, but given this is the larger project, it seems likely it will go towards studies and planning. 
The government’s budget website says it has put $1.06 billion towards transmission project CopperString 2032, a 1000‑kilometre transmission line from Townsville to Mount Isa set to  connect the North West Minerals Province to the National Electricity Market.
Somewhat confusingly, the government’s media release cites a $594 million investment from Powerlink into CopperString and it is not clear whether this sits within the billion dollar umbrella or additional to it.
Another state-owned entity, CleanCo, has attracted $500 million for its 2.3 GW portfolio of wind and solar projects in Central Queensland. On top of that, CleanCo has been providing funding to install a 250 MW big battery at Swanbank Power Precinct near Ipswich.
Meanwhile, $673 million will go to Stanwell to develop the Wambo and Tarong West Wind Farms and large-scale batteries, and $312.1 million for CS Energy to also invest in wind and battery projects.
Public transmission company Powerlink will invest $193.8 million to support the connection of major renewable projects to the grid, including the proposed 2 GW Borumba pumped hydro energy storage and Australia’s largest onshore wind project, the 1 GW MacIntyre Wind Precinct south-west of Warwick.
Energy Queensland will continue the roll-out of network batteries with $150 million allocation to that end.
The Queensland government has lent into the provision of household electricity rebates in this budget, providing all Queensland households with $550, while concession holders will receive an additional $150 energy payment.
Treasurer Dick has described Queensland’s energy rebates as the most generous in Australia, and while they will undoubtedly be welcomed by households, some in the industry warn against such measures.
EY Port Jackson Partner Blair Comley, for instance, says blanket subsides can lead to increased consumption – which is ultimately counterproductive to reaching climate targets.
The Queensland government last year introduced an additional three tiers to its coal royalty structure, and this alone injected $10.5 billion into the state’s budget.
These extra royalties have been cited as a key reason Queensland was able to deliver a $12 billion surplus.
Coal lobbies ran a multimillion-dollar champaign against the move, but given the massive reward it isn’t difficult to understand why the Queensland government “stood its ground” and defended the changes.
“Those coal companies will earn four times as much in revenue as Queenslanders make in royalties,” the Treasurer said.

That project, however, appears to now be temporarily sidelined with the Australian Financial Review reporting that Recharge has redeployed most of its 160 worldwide staff to execute its plan for a 30 GWh battery cell manufacturing facility in Cambois, Northern England.

In February, just weeks after the Avalon Geelong factory announcement, Recharge acquired collapsed company Britishvolt’s assets and business. Recharge’s takeover seeks to resuscitate the insolvent company’s multibillion-dollar plan for a manufacturing plant in Cambois.
That resuscitation is now Recharge’s main focus, with the startup’s founder, David Collard, telling the AFR: “In effect we had the site in Geelong ready, everything was going forward, and then Britishvolt happened.”
The Britishvolt manufacturing site is more advanced than its Geelong plan, and the site is considered “shovel-ready” with planning permission, designs and existing infrastructure in place.

According to the AFR, Recharge has also signed an investment deal with real estate fund Tritax Management, majority owned by investment giant Abrdn, which will account for £1 billion ($1.85 billion/USD 1.25 billion) of the project’s more than £3 billion ($5.56 billion) estimated cost. Tritax Management appears to have previously had an investment deal with Britishvolt.
While Recharge will focus on its British gigafactory, Recharge Industries Australian CEO Rob Fitzpatrick says the Geelong project will see “significant benefits from being part of a larger manufacturing ecosystem.”
This is because Recharge is hoping both its British and Geelong plants will be able to share “parallel and replicating” designs. “Being part of a larger battery cell production ecosystem de-risks our construction process – enabling us to adopt a “design once, build many” approach. It helps to de-risk supply chain by aggregating greater volumes that allow us to be a more serious supply chain partner, moving us closer to the front of the cue. And it de-risks our financing by proving that we’re a more investable entity,” Fitzpatrick said.*
Recharge Industries is aiming to be manufacturing batteries at its Cambois factory as early as 2024, with the initial construction providing for 6 GWh of annual capacity, before scaling up another 6 GWh in the second phase, and finally adding an additional 18 GWh of capacity to reach its final 30 GWh scale. 
Crucial to Recharge’s pitch is that it will use battery technology from US company C4V, removing the expense of developing its own process.

While founder David Collard insists the refocus is simply a pause on the Geelong plans, rather than a stop, the news comes on the same day another Australian battery manufacturing company has touted its international plans. 
Magnis Energy Technologies, an Australian graphite miner turn integrated lithium battery company, has today announced its Nachu project in Tanzania has delivered sample feedstock that meets the requirements for batteries in both the electric vehicle and stationary storage industries.
Magnis had formerly planned to build an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery factory in Townsville, northern Queensland. It quietly abandoned those plans in February though. 
Although Magnis is an Australian, ASX-listed company, most of its ventures are now abroad – including a proposed AAM plant, which is to be constructed in New York, as well as the Tanzanian Nachu Project, which includes both a graphite mine and planned Active Anode Material (AAM) facility.

The company also announced it had raised $25 million through a share issuing facility.
With Australia’s hydrogen superpower vision slowly deflating under the far bigger, more ambitious schemes now being offered in the US, Europe, and elsewhere, the country’s ambition is rapidly refocusing on battery critical minerals. 
Australia is home to some of the world’s largest critical mineral deposits, including lithium, and boasts highly advanced mining industries. A bounty of research has touted the potential economic (though not environmental) advantages of refining and manufacturing these critical minerals onshore, rather than simply exporting raw materials as we do today.
While actual battery cell manufacturing, which does not exist at all in Australia today, is still widely seen as a stretch, politicians are hyping the nation’s potential to do more to capture the value chain from the booming battery industry.
The fact that the handful of companies seeking to manufacture batteries within Australia have either abandoned or paused these plans, however, hardly bodes well.

The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), OPIS’ benchmark assessment for modules from China, declined for a second week running to USD 0.198 ($0.29) per W as dramatic downslides in the country’s upstream segments pushed module prices to their lowest level in almost three years, according to OPIS data.
This 7.48% plummet – the largest percentage drop so far this year – takes CMM below the psychologically significant level of USD 0.2/W ($0.3/W).
Multiple market players pinned the slump on growing polysilicon capacity in China and how China-made polysilicon is essentially back at what one source calls a “reasonable price.” The latter, which OPIS assesses as China Mono Grade, continued its inexorable march downwards to CNY 107.5 ($22.33)/kg.

China module prices are dropping rapidly, with opening bids for some recent domestic projects all lower than CNY1.5/W, noted multiple sources. Downstream demand is huge, with 48.31 GW installed in the first four months of this year. Yet module shipments are still lower than expected as prospective buyers, expecting further price drops, delay their purchases, sources also concurred. Buyers will wait as long as their project allows them to do so, explained one veteran market observer, adding that he did not expect falling module prices to level off.
OPIS expects significant price volatility ahead as buyers and sellers alike adopt a wait-and-see approach to the China module market’s direction. Pent-up demand from what one source calls “all-time high” procurement, with China’s National Energy Administration approving a third batch of Gigawatt-base power projects, means falling prices could find a floor.
According to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, the country is set to install up to 120 GW of solar power in 2023. But manufacturers should have big module inventories accumulating, noted another source, which if unleashed on the market may suggest more downslides on the horizon.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/06/13/research-shows-polycrystalline-panels-from-11-different-producers-degrade-more-than-warranty-rate/,"QUALITY,RESEARCH,GHANA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 13, 2023",Research shows polycrystalline panels from 11 different producers degrade more than warranty rate,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR) have assessed the performance of different polycrystalline solar modules coming from 11 undisclosed manufacturers and installed under the same warm and humid climatic conditions in Kumasi, Ghana.
Their work analysed, in particular, 48 solar panels coming from 12 different PV systems. “In each PV system, the stratified random sampling technique was used to select 4 PV modules for testing,” they explained. “All the systems were off-grid connected and installed on rooftops for 5-9 years.”
The scientists decided to keep the manufacturers anonymous and marked the 12 sites with the letters from A to L and said the panel power output ranged from 100 W to 460 W. They conducted a visual inspection based on a checklist developed by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and used a Seaward PV 210-meter automatic I-V Tracer to measure the performance of the panels.
They said none of the PV systems was exposed to shading and that they were all built with the same installation and maintenance practices.
Through the testing, the scientists ascertained that the minimum degradation rate of the analysed modules was 0.79%/year, while the maximum degradation rate was found to be 1.67%/year. They also found that the modules degraded at different rates with degradation rates between 0.78-1.95%/year with mean and median degradation rates of 1.36%/year and 1.38%/year.
“Overall, PV modules from only one manufacturer degraded less than the warranty rate of 0.8%/year while the modules from the remaining manufacturers degraded more than 1.0%/year,” they stated, noting that 42 modules exceeded the 1.0%/year threshold, which they said means these panels may “fail” before 20 years in operation under outdoor conditions in Kumasi. “Out of the 48 PV modules studied, 6 PV modules representing 12.5% are likely to operate reliably for 20-25 years, with only 4 PV modules representing 8.3% expected to meet the warranty period of 25 years.”
The research group stressed that the solar panels from the manufacturer with the highest mean degradation rate do not necessarily mean that all products from this manufacturer are of lower quality. It also said the degradation rate does not correlate with the age of the modules and that maximum power degradation was mainly attributable to lower short-circuit current.
The academics presented their findings in the paper “Degradation analysis of polycrystalline silicon modules from different manufacturers under the same climatic conditions,” published in Energy Conversion and Management: X. “The results of this study were comparable to the results obtained in the degradation analysis of polycrystalline silicon modules from different manufacturers carried out in other countries,” they concluded.
