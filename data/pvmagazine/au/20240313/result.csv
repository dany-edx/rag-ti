The software is one of a fast growing number of software providers to the rooftop PV market segment by Aussie developers.
The Version5 (V5) software from SolarPlus incorporates a Smart Energy Simulator, which is able to identify specific devices including battery energy storage systems, heat pumps, a hot water energy diverter for hot water units, air conditioners, heaters, Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers, and electric cooking appliances.
SolarPlus says users can potentially save 75% more on their monthly or quarterly electricity bills through accurately modelled solar installations based on V5s analysis, which then presents the data to enable full potential of a solar system.
SolarPlus Managing Director Laurie Kane said, as the cost of living and doing business continues to rise, people don’t like the idea of relying solely on the big power companies for their energy.
“So, it’s vital that consumers and business owners make full use of renewable power within their homes and businesses – particularly because the economic benefits of selling power back to the grid have eroded and are likely to soon disappear altogether.”
“Solar remains the cheapest source of renewable energy to reduce electricity bills and carbon emissions. Using as much of your solar energy produced every day should be the goal,” he said.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/13/hybrid-power-systems-fuel-renewable-energy-pathway-for-gold-producer/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,2024-03-13,Hybrid power systems fuel renewable energy pathway for gold producer,"Installed in four locations across the Midwest of Western Australia, the systems comprise 28 MW of solar, 11.5 MW of battery energy storage (BESS) and 42.5 MW of high-efficiency gas generation. They were delivered under a seven-year build-own-operate agreement.
The hybrid systems also have emergency hydrocarbons-off functionality, which enables uninterrupted mining operations using solar and BESS during system outages and other critical situations.
Four sites have been constructed at Westgold’s Tuckabianna, Bluebird, Fortnum, and Big Bell facilities, and are expected to collectively displace 38 million litres of diesel every year and cut carbon emissions by up to 57,000 tonnes annually.
Perth-headquartered Pacific Energy centred the design of the hybrid systems around its virtual generator (VG) BESS technology, which integrates renewable energy sources and dynamically stabilises the power systems, marking a shift away from thermal generation as the primary source of system stability.
An evolution of grid forming BESS technology, VG BESS can mimic the rotating mass present in thermal generators, providing for the first time the ability to stabilise large-scale power systems without burning fuel or using legacy technologies like synchronous condensers.
Pacific Energy’s Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Cullen said they approached the systems design with a future-focused mindset to support the increasing sophistication of future renewable energy technologies and ensure delivering client decarbonisation outcomes.
Westgold’s Managing Director and CEO, Wayne Bramwell, said powering Westgold’s operations with renewables was at the heart of its Clean Energy Transition Project, which is set to improve the company’s environmental efficiencies and reduce operating costs.
“Moving towards renewables works for Westgold as a business because it drives costs out. It also works for the environment because it significantly reduces carbon emissions and it sends a signal about our long-term view of building a sustainable business,” Bramwell said.
The Tuckabianna system, fully commissioned in August 2023, achieved an average of 31% solar penetration between November 2023 and January 2024, peaking at 36.9% in December.
Pacific Energy has more than 750 MW of contracted capacity under management with operations in Kalgoorlie, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern Territory and is owned by global investment manager Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC).

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/13/cec-finds-utility-scale-financial-commitments-fall-short-of-target-in-2023/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,2024-03-13,CEC finds utility scale financial commitments fall short of target in 2023,"The Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) annual Clean Energy Australia report says new capacity from fourteen large-scale solar projects commissioned in 2023 was up 55% from 841 MW in 2022 to 1.9 GW, bringing total utility-scale solar generation to 14.8 GWh. The report was released today.
The number of utility-scale solar projects that commenced construction, however, dropped from 10 in 2022 to seven in 2023 and saw a 39% decline in capacity, from 1.5 GW in 2022 to 912 MW in 2023. If hybrid projects with solar generation are included, the total increases 11 projects worth some 1.3 GW of capacity.
Of most concern in the report was the 39% fall in financial commitments to large-scale solar projects from $1.5 billion in 2022 to $912 million – prompting Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton to say the significant downturn in investment, particularly in large-scale generation projects, remains an issue for the sector.
The steady increase of big PV to Australia’s electricity network has continued. Large-scale solar contributed 15.9% of Australia’s 39.4% overall renewable generation in 2023, up from 14% in 2022, and accounts for 6.3% of all electricity generation, up from 5% in 2022.

Long-duration storage projects in 2023 attracted $4.9 billion of investment across 27 utility-scale batteries under construction, up from $1.9 billion investment in 19 utility-scale batteries at the end of 2022.
Batteries under construction in 2023 account for a total of 5 GW / 11 GWh combined capacity, up from 1.4 GW / 2 GWh of capacity in 2022.
“We are more determined than ever to continue to build and maintain the strong investment in our clean energy future that we need, overcome the barriers holding back a substantial pipeline of new opportunities and navigate the most consequential transformation of Australia’s economy in a generation,” Thornton said.
He said there is hope the Government’s expansion of the Capacity Investment Scheme will help bring on the kind of investment Australia needs in order to meet its targets.
“The Australian Government’s supporting an additional 23 GW of new renewable electricity generation capacity between 2024 and 2027 and a further 9 GW of dispatchable capacity, is a boost to investment.
“However, there will need to be urgent and careful policy design undertaken in the first half of 2024 to ensure the program realises its critical objective to turbocharge private investment in the coming years,” he said.
The report applauds the rooftop solar sector, which added 3.1 GW of new capacity from 337,498 households and small businesses, up from 2.7 GW in 2022 from 315,499 installations, taking the total rooftop solar systems installed in Australia to 3.7 million.
Rooftop solar capacity surpassed the utility scale segment, which came in at 2.8 GW including wind.
“Rooftop solar accounted for 28.5% of all renewable generation nationally over the past year. This is a testament to its success in driving additional value and lowering energy bills for over one in three Australian households and small businesses,” Thornton said.

The 35 MWh Rotohiko battery energy storage system (BESS), at Huntley in the Waikato region on the upper North Island, is the first of its scale to commence operations in New Zealand.
Wel said the grid-connected facility, which includes 16 battery modules, eight inverters and four transformers, will deliver strengthened reliability of electricity supply for Waikato customers and will benefit the national grid through its ability to help correct supply and demand imbalances.
The battery is connected to WEL’s 33 kV local lines network but is capable of providing fast reserve support for the North Island grid at times of high demand, enhancing grid stability and resilience and allowing for more renewable energy generation to be connected to the grid.
WEL said the Rotohiko battery, which will store enough energy to meet the daily demands of more than 2,000 homes, will participate in the electricity market providing instantaneous reserves and undertaking energy trading.
“The 35MWh BESS is the first battery of its scale in New Zealand and something we’re very proud of,” WEL said. “It will deliver huge benefits by improving the resilience of the electricity system, while also increasing the value of intermittent renewable generation in the region.”
Transpower New Zealand, the state-owned operator of the national grid, said the battery will play a pivotal role in the reduction of emissions in the Waikato and will move the nation closer to its goal of becoming 100% renewable by 2030.
“We see the Rotohiko battery as a milestone achievement by WEL, and we look forward to working with industry over the years to come to connect more batteries and other flexible resources to the power system to realise New Zealand’s renewable future,” Transpower said.
While the Rotohiko battery is the largest of its kind currently operating in New Zealand, it will soon be overshadowed by the 100 MW / 200 MWh Ruakākā BESS being constructed by Meridian Energy about 150 kilometres north of Auckland.
Renewables developer Meridian has already commenced construction of the battery with project completion expected in the second half of 2024. The BESS project is stage one of a two-stage project that anticipates the future construction of a 130 MW solar farm.

ACEN has approximately 4.8 GW of attributable renewable capacity across the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India and a target of 20 GW of renewable capacity by 2030.
Martin Hermann, Chief Executive Officer at BrightNight, which is developing a global portfolio of 23 GW across the U.S. and Asia Pacific, including Australia, said ACEN’s leadership in the Philippines’ renewables sector is unparalleled.
“They have demonstrated success in scaling and operating large fleets of renewable assets through strategic partnerships across the region, and our existing India partnership is already delivering tremendous value,” he said.
In 2023, ACEN, through its subsidiary, ACEN Renewables International, formed a 50-50 partnership with BrighNight to develop, construct, and operate approximately 1.2 GW of large-scale solar and wind projects in India.
“The success of our joint projects in India, which are already winning customers and building capacity, serves as a solid foundation for our venture in the Philippines,” ACEN Group Chief Investment Officer Patrice Clausse said.
“This move is a strategic fit for ACEN and aligns with our dedication to meeting our customer’s energy requirements while upholding our environmental and social responsibilities.”
In Australia, ACEN has more than 1 GW capacity in construction and more than 8 GW capacity in the development pipeline spanning solar, wind, battery, and pumped hydro energy storage projects.
The largest solar project in Australia to be financed on a fully merchant basis, the 400 MW first stage of New England Solar Farm in New South Wales (NSW), is ACEN’s first Australian operational project.
The 400 MW Stubbo Solar Farm being constructed in NSW in the NSW Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone is its second project while it has four other solar projects in development (190 MW Axedale, 600 MW Birriwa, 320 MW Deeargee and 320 MW Narragamba).
BrightNight made its entry into the Australian market in 2022 and its local portfolio includes only the Mortlake Energy Hub proposed for regional Victoria. The planned project is to comprise a 350 MW solar farm and a 300 MW battery energy storage system.

5,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/13/safework-nsw-launches-blitz-on-rooftop-solar-installations/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",EV FOLEY,2024-03-13,SafeWork NSW launches blitz on rooftop solar installations,"SafeWork NSW said fines of up to $3,600 will be issued to retailers and installers of rooftop solar systems who are found to be non-compliant with legislative requirements.
Trent Curtain, head of SafeWork NSW, said results from previous compliance programs were concerning and inspectors will ensuring that installers are adhering to safety requirements when putting PV systems on rooftops.
“Inspectors often find those in the solar industry taking short-cuts and endangering the
lives of workers by not having adequate safety measures in place,” he said. “We will be taking a zero-tolerance approach and those caught will be fined and potentially prosecuted.”
Curtain said falls from heights remain the number one cause of fatalities on building sites in NSW and the regulator is committed to reducing that number.
“Last year, preventing falls from heights was a regulatory priority for SafeWork NSW and
this year we will continue to prioritise the safety of workers, especially those involved in the installation of solar panels,” he said.
SafeWork NSW inspectors will be monitoring other risks such as electrical, asbestos, and musculoskeletal issues.
The compliance blitz follows a similar initiative in 2022 when SafeWork inspectors visited 86 rooftop solar installation sites, resulting in 403 notices being issued, along with fines totalling $216,864.  Most notices issued were for falls from heights, followed by falling objects and electrical risks.
Inspectors found 42% of the worksites visited did not have adequate controls to prevent a fall from the roof. Of the sites that had fall protection in place, 54% of them were not adequate to keep workers safe while 64% of workers were wearing harnesses not connected to a harness system and 61% did not have a plan that showed the system layout.
“It is clear from inspector observations that workers in the rooftop solar panel installation industry are at high-risk of serious or fatal incidents due to the recurrence of having no or inadequate fall protection in place,” the regulator said.
“Additionally, the reliance of harnesses for fall protection continues to place workers lives at risk due to the high proportion of systems that are either set up incorrectly or not being used safely.”
SafeWork NSW said the rooftop solar industry must continue to lift its standards in relation to using higher level fall protection, such as temporary edge protection and scaffolds, opposed to harnesses which should only be used as the last resort.

Vinci Energies Spain, the Spanish unit of Vinci, has developed a new tool that calculates the most efficient earthworks for the deployment of large-scale PV plants.
According to Inove, Vinci’s engineering unit, the new tool can save up to 50% in costs associated with earthworks.
“This new software works with the real cost of clearing and filling to minimize the total cost of a project,” said the company.
The new tool accounts for optimization parameters, design restrictions, mounting structure slopes, and terrain adaptation.
“With these factors, the tool is capable of carrying out the necessary iterations to reach the optimal solution in terms of earthworks cost,”  Inove said.
The new software can evolve and adapt to the specific requirements of clients. It reportedly covers the needs of all project phases, from basic engineering to detailed engineering and construction support. Vinci Energies Spain said it has already been deployed.

7,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/13/hydro-solar-hybrid-starts-commercial-operations-in-thailand/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,THAILAND",PATRICK JOWETT,2024-03-13,Hydro-solar hybrid starts commercial operations in Thailand,"From pv magazine Global
The Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) has confirmed that a 24 MW floating hydro-solar hybrid project, located at Ubol Ratana Dam in Khon Kaen province in northeastern Thailand, has started commercial operation.
The hydro-solar hybrid project integrates solar energy, hydropower and a battery energy storage system (BESS). It harnesses solar energy in the day and hydropower at night, while the BESS allows continued electricity generation during the transition between the two. EGAT said an energy management system and weather forecast system have been incorporated to enhance stability of the electricity generation system.
The authority has collaborated with Thailand-based Fisheries Research Center to promote the conservation of aquatic animal species in the area. Fishery is integral to the quality of life of people living in the vicinity of the dam, with many millions of fish released into the reservoir annually.
EGAT said the solar panels, which cover less than 1% of the reservoir’s total surface area, are installed in a way that allows sunlight to penetrate the water surface without impacting the underwater ecosystem. It noted that it plans to develop a solar-powered shrimp farm in the area, acting as a learning centre so communities can generate income and achieve self-reliance.
The Ubol Ratana Dam project is EGAT’s second floating solar hybrid project developed in accordance with Thailand’s Power Development Plan. The authority is planning to develop 16 floating solar projects across nine of its dams with a total installed capacity of 2,725 MW.
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Thailand deployed 3,065 MW of solar by the end of 2022. The country expects renewable energy to constitute more than 50% of its power generation mix by 2037.
Researchers from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory have assessed 10 Southeast Asian countries including Thailand to have the combined potential to deploy over 1 TW of floating PV. The Southeast Asian solar market is thought to have grown by 13% last year, according to mid-year analysis by the Asian Photovoltaic Industry Association, with Thailand as one of the region’s largest markets.
