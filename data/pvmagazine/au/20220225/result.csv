After signing agreements with Powerlink and the state government-owned Economic Development Queensland (EDQ), FFI’s planned multi-gigawatt-scale electrolyser factory in Aldoga, near Gladstone, and proposed green hydrogen production facility at Gibson Island near Brisbane will be connected to the Queensland transmission network and supplied with renewable electricity.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said on Friday the parties had agreed to work together to build new transmission connections that will power FFI’s Queensland developments.
“FFI are seeking to build a facility at Gibson Island to produce around 50,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year. Connection to the transmission network is vital to allow green energy to power this facility,” he said.
“Queensland’s constantly growing fleet of renewable power stations will provide the energy to produce green hydrogen ready for export to overseas markets like Japan and South Korea.
“By working with Powerlink, FFI will receive a streamlined service across their Queensland connection developments, which could be up and running as soon as 2023.”
FFI has already gained planning approval to build what would be the world’s largest electrolyser, renewable industry and equipment factory at Aldoga.

Stage one of the estimated $1 billion project would establish an electrolyser factory with an initial capacity of 2GW per annum – more than doubling current global production.
The company has also announced plans to partner with fertiliser and chemical manufacturer Incitec Pivot to convert its ammonia-production facility at Gibson Island to run on green hydrogen. Currently, the facility uses natural gas as a feedstock.
FFI also plans to construct an on-site electrolysis plant, which will produce up to 50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year for conversion into green ammonia.
FFI founder and chair Andrew Forrest said the transmission agreement will allow the proposed green hydrogen projects to advance.
“We look forward to working with Powerlink to use the grid to deliver green power to our projects, enabling us to move quickly and supporting the entry of more renewables and decarbonisation of the electricity network,” he said.
“FFI’s goal is to turn Queensland into the global green energy heartland and to help create jobs now and into the future.”

To support the Gibson Island facility, Powerlink will construct a new 275kV switchyard at its existing Murarrie Substation and two 275kV feeders to Gibson Island.
Works at Aldoga will include establishing a connection to Powerlink’s existing Larcom Creek substation, a 275kV overhead transmission line, and a new substation at the Aldoga facility.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the new transmission infrastructure will allow the proposed green hydrogen projects to tap into the state’s planned Renewable Energy Zones (REZ).
“By establishing Renewable Energy Zones across the state, the Queensland government will enable a new market for thousands of megawatts of new renewable energy,” he said.
“Powerlink’s transmission network will then deliver this clean energy to places like Gibson Island and Gladstone where it will be converted in to green hydrogen and green ammonia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/25/new-rules-allow-distributors-to-roll-out-standalone-power-systems-in-nem/,"COMMUNITY,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",New rules allow distributors to roll out standalone power systems in NEM,"The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) on Thursday announced a package of new rules that enable distribution network businesses to supply their customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) using standalone power systems (SAPS) where it is cheaper than maintaining a connection to the grid.
The new rules allow electricity distributors in NEM jurisdictions that opt into the new regulatory framework to install SAPS for both individuals and communities where stand-alone energy generation may be cheaper, safer and more reliable than grid supply.
AEMC chair Anna Collyer said the rules were presented on Thursday by South Australian Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan and their publication was the final step in giving effect to the commission’s recommendations following a lengthy review and legislative process.
“Standalone power systems aren’t a new concept, but they have become more viable as technology improves and costs decrease,” Collyer said.
“Until now, SAPS weren’t included in the NEM and weren’t covered by consistent reliability standards or customer protections.
“We now have agreement on a staged implementation, beginning August this year.”
SAPS typically comprise a renewable energy supply such as solar PV panels coupled with a battery energy storage system and, where necessary, a back-up generator. The self-sufficient power units include both microgrids and individual power systems.

The technology has been widely deployed in remote and regional areas of Western Australia (WA) but are less prominent in the NEM jurisdictions of Queensland, New South Wales (NSW), the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.
Collyer said that is likely to change, saying electricity distributors operating in the NEM had predicted new SAPS solutions might cater for several thousand customers in the next decade and could expand faster as grid connections reached the end of their service lives.
“Maintaining and replacing traditional older power lines and related infrastructure is a major cost in a country the size of Australia,” she said.
“This is a timely rule change as we continue to transition to a renewable energy future. It increases the reliability and resilience of energy supply in remote areas, as well as reducing network costs for all customers.”
Collyer said the new rules will help unlock the benefits of new technologies that are increasingly allowing electricity services to be delivered through alternatives to a traditional grid connection at a lower cost and with improved reliability and safety.

“Particularly in remote, bushfire-prone areas, SAPS do away with the need to replace damaged grid connections at significant expense,” she said.
“In fact, the power infrastructure that connects communities to the grid can also cause bushfires, which is another reason SAPS are attractive alternatives to traditional network connections in those areas.”
The publication of the new rules come after an extensive AEMC review, completed in 2020. The AEMC said the findings of the review were supported by the NEM jurisdictions and led to changes in 2021 to the national electricity and retail energy laws.
“The changes operate on an opt-in basis, as some states may need to make amendments to their own legislation to accommodate SAPS,” Collyer said.
The rule changes apply to new distributor-led SAPS. Existing microgrids and other independent power systems will continue to be managed under state and territory legislation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/25/nsw-council-considers-making-rooftop-solar-pv-compulsory/,"INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",NSW council considers making rooftop solar PV compulsory,"Shellharbour City Council on the South Coast of New South Wales (NSW) is poised to become the first local government area (LGA) in Australia to mandate the installation of solar PV panels on the rooftops of all new buildings constructed in the region.
A motion calling for council officers to prepare a report on making rooftop solar a requirement on all new buildings and dwellings built within the Shellharbour City Council LGA was tabled at the council meeting earlier this week.
“This report should include, but not be limited to the potential cost impacts on new builds versus the long-term energy cost savings and the projected city-wide carbon emissions reduction figures,” the motion read.
The motion was unanimously passed.
Councillor Robert Petreski, who was among those who spoke in favour of the motion, said the mandated rollout of rooftop solar not only made economic sense but would further reduce the council’s carbon footprint and aid its net zero targets.
“This motion comes from obviously an evolving landscape,” he said.
“In terms of solar cost, the costs of solar panels have come down exponentially and the efficiency has gone up.
“The business case is there, commercial entities and for-profit organisations would not be putting massive solar banks on their roofs if it wasn’t economically viable.”
Shellharbour Council’s proposal comes as Australia’s appetite for solar continues to surge. The Australian PV Institute (APVI) earlier this month announced that Australia has reached 25GW of installed solar – more solar per capita than anywhere else in the world.
Australia, with a population just above 25 million, installed a record 360,000 rooftop systems in 2021, a massive 40% increase on 2020.
The APVI said at the end of 2021 there were more than 3.04 million PV installations in Australia, with a combined capacity of more than 25.3GW.
Shellharbour homeowners have been playing a part with more than 3,135 small-scale systems installed in the 2529 postcode area at 31 December 2021. With approximately 9,367 dwellings in the area, the rollout matches the Australian average of 33 solar panel systems per 100 households.

“If you want a business case for rooftop solar you just have a look down the road at Shellharbour Square, at the large clubs – even half the houses in our area are voluntarily putting on solar,” Petreski said, adding it wasn’t the intent to introduce any retroactive policy that would force the installation of rooftop solar on existing homes.
However, he hoped to “encourage” the fitting of solar panels to existing dwellings.
“It’s not going to be applied retrospectively,” he said. “It would apply to new dwellings and seeing where we can encourage retrofitting to existing dwellings.”
Petreski said the report would allow council to make an informed decision and nothing would be implemented as a requirement before the report is completed.
While Shellharbour is thought to be the first local council in Australia to investigate the possibility of requiring all new builds to have solar panels on the roof, the concept is already gaining traction in other nations.
The Berlin House of Representatives last year passed the Berlin Solar Act which requires the installation of solar PV systems on all new buildings in the German capital from 2023.
The law’s new provisions apply to all new buildings as well as to major renovations of roofs in existing buildings with usable areas of more than 50 square meters.
Those who don’t abide by the new PV requirements will have to pay a fine of almost $80,000 (€50,000) if it’s a non-residential building.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/25/why-the-australian-government-should-welcome-mike-cannon-brookes-plan-to-takeover-agl/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",Why the Australian government should welcome Mike Cannon-Brookes’ plan to takeover AGL,"From The Conversation
As Morrison stated this week: “We need to ensure that our coal-fired generation of electricity runs to its life, because if it doesn’t, electricity prices go up, they don’t go down.”
Likewise, AGL has dismissed the plan as “unrealistic”. But are they right? Would closing AGL’s three coal power stations by 2030 push up prices and bring chaos to the National Electricity Market (NEM)?
No. In fact, there’s already chaos in the NEM due to increasingly early and disorderly coal retirements. The government should welcome the plan to takeover AGL, because it addresses failures in the market and entails a more orderly tranformation process.
The bid, made alongside Brookfield Partners, came just days after Origin Energy brought forward the closure date of Eraring, Australia’s largest coal station, by seven years. It was the latest in a string of early coal closure announcements, and yet there remains no national plan to manage early retirements like this.
Instead, it’s up to each commercial entity to decide when to close. This means coal generators have no obligation to guarantee reliability beyond providing notice of retirement plans over the short term – five years in Victoria, or three and a half years elsewhere in the NEM.
As the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has pointed out, owners can technically comply with the notice period while withdrawing generation capacity from the market. Even more chaotically, generators can run down maintenance spending when they’re getting ready to close down, which further reduces reliability.
Image: Origin
The NEM was designed to be an “energy only market” – the market signal that retirements are due is supposed to encourage investors to build new generators. Unfortunately, this market design has failed.
Part of the failure stems from the NEM’s design, and partly from the federal government’s failure to implement either a strong climate policy or a coal retirement plan. This adds up to an environment of bad investment.
For example, in its latest update of the NEM database, AEMO lists 130 gigawatts of prospective solar, wind and solar projects, but only 6.6 gigawatts of these are committed for development in the next 10 years.
The Brookfield/Cannon-Brookes plan addresses some of these market failures.
 
First, it provides a notice period of closure of about eight years, longer than is required by law. That gives a signal to the market and improves energy planning by governments and AEMO.
Second, the new AGL would carry all the risk because it must continue to supply electricity to millions of customers. The new owners of AGL would have to provide enough electricity to cover this load, in real time, or they’ll have to buy that supply from their competitors.
This incentive will mean the owners will build new generation. More renewable energy, which has zero marginal cost, will help reduce the wholesale electricity price, not just for those customers but for all consumers.
Image: RHG
The short answer is yes. Coal generators provide around three quarters of the electricity in NSW alone, so replacing it entails a transformation of the grid. There are plans to do exactly that, at the intergovernmental and NSW levels.
So it’s strange the prime minister seems not to have confidence in these plans, given his government has agreed to and funded them both.
First, there’s a nationally agreed Integrated System Plan, which is designed by AEMO with extensive consultation across government and industry. The latest draft plan predicts Australia is on track to see 14 gigawatts of coal retire by 2030 and all coal gone by 2040.
AEMO doesn’t predict any shortfall of supply over that time, as long as new transmission is built to carry the electricity from the new fleets of solar, wind, hydro and batteries.
Second, NSW has its own plan: the Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap. This will accelerate construction of Australia’s first Renewable Energy Zone, and is co-funded by the federal government.
One of the key challenges is to replace the “security” gap as coal retires. Coal power stations maintain the frequency and voltage of the grid. These security services can be thought of as the “quality” of the electricity purchased. You need sufficient quantity and quality of supply to run our devices, from laptops to smelters. Still, Australia Institute research last year confirmed that batteries and renewable energy can provide such security services, and do it cost effectively.
Solar, wind and battery projects can be built much faster than conventional generators. Elon Musk famously built the biggest battery in the world in South Australia, within 100 days in 2017.

We don’t yet know what new resources the new AGL would invest under a Brookfield/Cannon-Brookes ownership. I believe the most exciting and innovative part of the bid might well be that much of the new investment is in consumer assets.
Australian households could lead the world in decarbonisation by doing it themselves, according to research supported by Cannon-Brookes, published last year by Dr Saul Griffith and Rewiring Australia.
Houses can generate a quarter of what they need with rooftop solar. In Australia, rooftop solar in Australia is the cheapest in the world, at a couple of cents per kilowatt-hour. Batteries allow them to soak up excess solar during the day and use it at night.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/25/mcg-claims-australian-first-with-switch-to-100-renewables/,"SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 25, 2022",MCG claims Australian first with switch to 100% renewables,"The Melbourne Cricket Ground, widely known as the MCG or simply the G, has turned green with electricity provider EnergyAustralia this week confirming that since the start of the year all energy used at the stadium has been supplied by renewable sources including wind and solar PV.
EnergyAustralia said that in less than two months the MCG, which is managed by the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) and is one of the most iconic landmarks in the Victorian capital, has cut its greenhouse emissions by close to 1,000 tonnes.
EnergyAustralia chief customer officer Mark Brownfield said the switch to GreenPower-accredited renewable sources is a first for major stadiums in Australia.
“Since 2017 we’ve been helping the MCG become more sustainable. And now we’ve kicked the winning goal – getting the MCG running off 100% renewables in an Australian first,” he said.
The transition to 100% renewables is the latest sustainability initiative to come out of a partnership that commenced in 2016 with EnergyAustralia supplying electricity to the MCG and supporting a range of environmental sustainability initiatives across the precinct.
In 2018, EnergyAustralia helped the MCG achieve another Australian first with the stadium going carbon neutral for the month of September, the ground’s busiest period of the year.
The following year solar-powered lights and security cameras were installed in the neighbouring Yarra Park and in 2020 EnergyAustralia installed 220 solar PV panels along the roofline of the Northern Stand to power the stadium’s water recycling facility which turns sewerage into Class A water.

MCC chief executive officer Stuart Fox said this latest initiative is a huge moment in the sustainability journey of the MCG which was built in 1853 and remains the largest stadium in the Southern Hemisphere.
“This is a really exciting initiative for the MCC and EnergyAustralia, to work together and provide a first for major stadiums in the country,” he said.
“At the MCG, we’re about inspiring excellence and leading by example, so we hope to see this initiative continued into other stadiums and venues across the country.”
A recent study conducted by the University of New South Wales’ (UNSW) School of Photovoltaic & Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) highlighted the merits of Australian sports stadiums switching to solar.
The report, released in 2021, shows that solar installed across the rooftops of Australia’s major sports stadiums and sporting association head offices could generate around 20,000MWh of clean energy annually.
ACF campaigns director Paul Sinclair said at the time that if cricket, AFL and soccer pursued the initiative, the combined effect would be to mitigate 310,000 tonnes of carbon emissions over two decades, while the sports themselves could save a combined total of $3.7 million each year.

Australian Test cricket captain Pat Cummins has taken up the solar challenge, recently launching a campaign to have local cricket clubs around the nation install solar PV systems, declaring it is time for the sport to do its bit to tackle climate change.
Cummins earlier this month announced the creation of Cricket for Climate and its solar PV project Solar Clubs, an initiative designed to unlock the solar potential of up to 4,000 community cricket clubs across Australia.
“Few countries in the world can match Australia’s extraordinary potential to generate renewable energy like solar and wind power,” he said. “We’ve got real ambitions; this is just the start.”
EnergyAustralia said it is also about more than just aiding big stadiums make the switch to renewables.
“We’ve got our eye on the big picture too,” Browning said. “We recently updated our Climate Change Statement with a clear commitment to have net zero emissions (scope one, two and three) by 2050, to be out of coal by 2040, and to reduce our direct emissions by 60 percent by 2028/29 relative to 2019-20.
“As part of this, we have announced the early retirement of the Yallourn coal-fired power station in mid-2028 and are building Australia’s first net zero emissions gas and hydrogen capable power plant, pumped hydro energy storage, and large-scale battery storage projects.
“We’re doing, not just dreaming, when it comes to making the clean energy transition a reality.”

Scottish start-up Gravitricity has secured a £912,000 (AU$1.7 million) grant from the UK Department of Business Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to build a 4 MWh gravity-based storage facility on an unspecified brownfield site in the United Kingdom.
“The feasibility project will complete in late 2022 and will provide the information required to commence the build of the full-scale commercial prototype multi-weight gravity energy store immediately thereafter, subject to securing planning permission and the necessary funds,” the company said in a statement. “This project will demonstrate multi-weight use and control using a single set of hoisting equipment and will pave the way to custom projects which can be built wherever they are required.”
The company completed last summer a 250 kW demonstration project, which was supported by a £640,000 grant from UK government funder Innovate UK. In this facility, a tower is powered by renewable energy to raise a mass in a 150-1,500 m shaft and discharges the electricity thus “stored” by releasing the mass to rotate the two power generators. The mass used in larger projects can range from 500 to 5,000 tons.
The technology is claimed to have a faster response time than lithium-ion storage technology and to be able to help stabilise electricity networks at 50 Hz by responding to full power demand in less than a second.
In October, Gravitricity also announced it was considering the deployment of its gravity energy storage system in Czechia, where it would be built at the decommissioned Staříč coal mine in the country’s Moravian Silesian region. The mine consists of six deep sites that could potentially host the storage solution.

Adani Group and Canada-based PEM fuel cell producer Ballard Power Systems have signed a memorandum of understanding to evaluate a joint investment in the commercialisation of hydrogen fuel cells for mobility and industrial applications in India.
Under the MoU, both parties will examine various options to cooperate, including potential collaboration for fuel cell manufacturing in India. 
Green hydrogen is a logical next step for the Adani Group, given its capabilities in large-scale renewables and transmission and distribution infrastructure. The Group sees itself well-positioned to become one of the largest producers of green hydrogen globally.
Adani efforts under this MoU will be led through its newly formed subsidiary Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL), which is focused on the generation of green hydrogen, including downstream products, green electricity generation, manufacture of electrolysers, and wind turbines, among others. 
“Green hydrogen is the fuel of the future and fuel cells will be a game-changer in India’s energy transition,” stated Vneet S Jaain, director, Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL). “Our ability to build a world-class green hydrogen value chain will be critical in facilitating the energy transition and we are excited to partner with Ballard, a global leader in fuel cell technology, to create a shared fuel cell ecosystem in India. We will be deploying innovative use cases across our businesses with fuel cell trucks, mining equipment, marine vessels, off-road vehicles, and critical industrial power. We will shape the industry through this strategic collaboration.
The Adani group, founded in 1988, has a current market capitalisation of US$151 billion, comprising seven publicly listed companies with businesses spanning power generation and distribution, renewable energy, gas and infrastructure, logistics (seaport, airports, shipping, and rail), mining and resources, and other sectors. 
“We are excited to partner with Adani given Gautam Adani’s inspiring leadership and the highly complementary assets across the group portfolio,” said Randy MacEwen, Ballard’s President and CEO. “India represents a new growth opportunity for Ballard, and we look forward to working with the Adani group to support and accelerate their energy transition and decarbonisation goals.”
