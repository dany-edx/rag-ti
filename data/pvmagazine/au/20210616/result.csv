The only Australian selected for the prestigious role was Andrew Horvath, a man who could only be described as an ‘out of the box’ thinker.
His company, Star Scientific, which is headquartered in the central coast of New South Wales, was recently propelled into the global limelight after it launched its patented Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser (HERO) technology. Discovered accidentally, the technology is driven by a catalyst reaction which, upon contact with hydrogen and oxygen, goes from zero to over 700 degrees Celsius in three minutes. The promise of the technology, which is applied in the form of a coating substance, is that it’s hydrogen demand activator. It makes the ‘future fuel’ easy and efficient to use as a heat source in existing spinning mass turbine systems.
In March, the technology won the Sustainable Energy Council’s World Hydrogen Award for Industrial Application. This award, Horvath believes, started up the conversations which ultimately led to his position on the newly formed board.
“They [Sustainable Energy Council] looked into what we were saying as part of the award. So the award not only focussed on the technology, it also focussed on the business plan and what the CEO was saying. They listened to that and then they gave me a call afterwards,” Horvath said, to ask him if he’d be interested in being part of the board.
While the HERO technology and award might have started the conversation, Horvath’s vision isn’t just limited to optimising hydrogen’s energy release at the molecular level – his ideas stretch right into global energy systems. He isn’t really thinking about how to fit clean energy into fossil fuel’s structures (though reusing infrastructure is a big part of HERO’s promise), Horvath is convinced future energy systems will look different, “cleverer” than those we use today.
“Of course it’s exciting,” Horvath said about his appointment to the board, pointing to the esteemed leaders he’s serving alongside, which include the Secretary General at Hydrogen Europe, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis; President and CEO of Port of Rotterdam Authority, Allard Castelein; and Vice President of Hydrogen at Royal Dutch Shell, Paul Bogers; Chile’s Ministry of Energy department head, Max Correa Achurra; Chair at the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells (IPHE) and Hydrogen Advisor at the International Energy Agency (IEA), Noé van Hulst; CEO and Executive Chairman at Smartenergy, Horst H. Mahmoudi; and Linde’s Vice-President of Clean Energy, David Burns.
The advisory board’s role will be to give focus to the World Hydrogen Event Series, ensuring key industry challenges and opportunities are addressed and “enabling participants to take relevant, informed decisions which will drive further collaboration and accelerate the hydrogen industry roll-out world-wide,” the Sustainable Energy Council said in its statement.
“What we need now, is the appropriate regulatory framework to scale-up clean hydrogen rapidly and de-risk the huge private investment required. We also need smart policies that aim at creating integrated markets and facilitate the entire value chain across borders, including infrastructure and storage,” founding member, Noé van Hulst, said in his statement.
Horvath told pv magazine Australia the first World Hydrogen Advisory board meeting is planned for September and will be virtual. “Then the next one I think is in Rotterdam, held by the port there, next year sometime,” he added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/16/solar-panels-installed-across-59-bus-and-train-stations-in-perth/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,POLICY,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JUNE 16, 2021",Solar panels installed across 59 bus and train stations in Perth,"Western Australia’s state government is fitting 50 of Perth’s train stations with solar, while eight of its major bus stations have already been fitted out with panels and a ninth is on its way.
The electricity generated by the solar panels on the bus stations power lighting, ticket machines, signage and driver facilities, while at the train stations it will also be used to power lifts and escalators.
“Over 1,000kW of solar panels are being installed on train and bus stations – once completed these are expected to produce enough energy to power the equivalent of 360 households per year,” Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said.
Solar panels, all 450W, have already been installed at East Perth train station, which now has 80; Rockingham, which has 74; and Currambine, which has 88. Work is to soon to begin at Murdoch and Bull Creek stations, with Edgewater, Butler, Thornlie, Clarkson and Leederville to follow.
As for the remaining 40 train stations, the government says a feasibility study is underway and the full rollout anticipated to be completed by mid-2022.

Eight bus stations have also had solar panels installed, those are: Booragoon, Kwinana, Morley, Victoria Park, James Street, Mirrabooka, Henley Brook, Optus Stadium in Perth’s city centre, and work is currently underway at Leederville bus station. The size of these installations, however, is not known.
The state government noted solar was last year installed on High Wycombe Station as part of Metronet’s Forrestfield Airport Link.
More than $1.8 million has been allocated to the solar program through the WA Recovery Plan, which aims to support the economy and local jobs following the pandemic.
Transport Minister Rita Saffioti added that combined with the state’s electric bus trial in Joondalup beginning in 2022, the government is investing in new technologies to make public transport systems even more sustainable.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/16/has-china-extended-solar-grid-connection-deadlines-by-a-year/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"JUNE 16, 2021",Has China extended solar grid-connection deadlines by a year?,"From pv magazine Global
China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) has thus far refused to confirm whether the deadline for connecting solar projects in time to secure incentive payments has been extended into next year, as has been suggested by industry body the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA).
The CPIA, a semi-official body and trade organisation, has claimed the deadlines for connecting up subsidised and ‘grid-parity’ solar projects which are registered, and/or have begun construction, have been extended by a year.
The industry group’s assertion is based on one line from the Notice on Development and Construction of Wind and Photovoltaic Power Generation in 2021 policy promulgated by the NEA on May 20.
The sentence in question reads (in translation): “All existing projects which are not finished [with a grid] connection within the year will be counted by provincial government and approved [for] the postponement to connection, [with a] scope of next year.”
The CPIA has interpreted “existing projects” as all facilities which have been registered since 2019 and/or upon which construction has started. As it stands, projects which have been approved for central government incentives must obtain a grid connection this month to receive their payments and unsubsidised ‘grid-parity’ solar arrays must connect to the grid this year to benefit from the favourable policy treatment they qualify for under such status.
The Chinese solar trade entity has said the industry has not paid enough attention to this apparently significant concession to the sector by Beijing at a time when rising component prices are threatening to render approved projects unviable.
Many solar project investors and engineering, procurement and construction companies have suspended work amid rising solar costs which have included a quadrupling in the price of panel raw material polysilicon this year. Without an extension to grid connection deadlines, it is feared many projects could be abandoned entirely.
A glance at the business case for solar in a western province of China illustrates the dilemma facing investors. It has been estimated a 100 MW project connecting to the grid by December 31 in that region would offer investors an internal rate of return (IRR) of 6.6%, based on a purchase price of RMB0.2595/kWh ($0.0405) for the electricity generated at the site versus a solar module cost of RMB1.80/W ($0.28) of generation capacity, and a total solar system cost of RMB3.70/W ($0.58).
If, as the CPIA has stated, developers wait until the end of next year to connect the same system, the electricity sale price might only fall RMB0.0095/kWh ($0.0015), to RMB0.25, but module costs by that point may have stabilised back to RMB1.40/W, for a system cost of RMB3.10/W. That would mean an 8.21% IRR in the second half of 2022.
All eyes are on the NEA at this point.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/16/gravity-based-storage-for-distributed-solar/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,NIGERIA,UNITED KINGDOM",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JUNE 16, 2021",Gravity-based storage for distributed solar,"From pv magazine Global
A British-Nigerian research team has developed a model to design PV systems coupled to gravity-based energy storage systems.
The scientists explained that the proposed concept, described as a multi-state energy conversion system, builds upon the experience gained in previous research with pumped-hydro gravity storage systems, compressed air gravity storage, suspended weight in abandoned mine shafts, dynamic modelling of gravity energy storage coupled with a PV energy plant, and deep ocean gravity energy storage. “Essentially, this research is geared towards designing a storage system using non-conventional methods and radical ideas with little similitude to previous research but totally different in functionality,” they affirmed.
The research team built their experimental system with a solar power generator; a bulk booster charge controller; an inverter; a solenoid device – which is a coil of wire used as an electromagnet; a deep cycle battery; a pulley block; a geared motor; a microcontroller; and wire ropes.
The battery is not used primarily for storage purposes but only for smoothing out the system’s power output. It is connected to an inverter which, in turn, is connected to AC loads. “The life span of the battery in this proposed storage system will be longer, since the battery utilised here will have a constant output hour duration,” it warned.
The solar panels are connected via a diode to a charge controller that regulates the charges supplied to the deep cycle batteries and the electric geared motor. The latter is mounted on a foundation on the roof, which in turn opens into a hollow shaft connected to an intermediate pulley made up of two grooves. “One act[s] as the string wrap that carries the dead weight which falls under gravity when the solenoid retracts the geared motor shaft from the pulley shaft, while the other connects to the dynamo pulley via a flat belt,” the academics explained. “Then, the dynamo is connected to the battery via cables of considerable length, to avoid losses that may arise due to length and [the] resistivity of the cables used.”
Through a series of simulations the researchers found that, due to its high electrical requirements, the system needs to rely on high-power solar modules with an output of over 500 W, and suggested that a combination of multiple panels may be necessary for regions with low solar radiation levels. “This essentially proves the importance of effective utilisation of this energy potential in continent[s] like Asia or Africa, with long sunlight stretches, as they will require [a] limited amount of panels, consequently reducing the cost incurred on [the] purchase of PV cells during set-up,” the researchers further explained, noting that raising of the weight and charging the battery requires a considerable amount of energy.
Africa is considered an ideal location, not only for its sunlight potential but also for the large amount of metal scrap materials it hosts, which can be converted to suspended weights at reasonable cost. “The unique characteristic of this system that makes it versatile, is the fact that it is not restricted to a particular land topographical reference or expensive component design materials,” they concluded. “Subsequent optimisation of the design and sizing of this storage method might enable the gravity storage approach to compete favourably with current storage solutions already in the market.”
A complete description of the system can be found in the paper Gravitricity based on solar and gravity energy storage for residential applications, recently published in the International Journal of Energy and Environmental Engineering. The research group comprises scientists from the De Montfort University in the United Kingdom, and the Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria.
