Shukla Poddar, lead author of the study and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the UNSW School of Photovoltaics and Renewable Energy Engineering said while large scale commercial PV modules have a typical lifespan of about 20 to 25 years, and naturally degrade or lose their efficiency overtime, local weather and climate influence the degradation of PV modules.
“For the first time, this research aims to statistically model the weighted average degradation rate Australia-wide for the different degradation modes.”
Researchers used regional climate model projections to study forecast temperatures and the relative humidity around Australia – and track its impact on the degradation of PV modules.
The study looked at three degradation mechanisms, which are typical mechanisms observed in silicon modules, including hydrolysis degradation, thermal degradation, and photo-degradation.
The weighted average degradation rate was calculated using the probability of occurrence of each of these mechanisms under specific climate types including hot and humid, moderate, and desert conditions. To assess the impact of climate change on module degradation, they estimated then forecasted changes in the weighted average module degradation rate under a low and high emission scenario.
Under both scenarios, researchers found module degradation rates were higher in regions with hot and humid climates, such as northern parts of Australia compared to central Australia where the degradation rate increase was smaller due to the drier weather conditions and lower humidity of the region.

Regions with high degradation rates are also expected to experience the greatest power loss – with the projected weighted average degradation rate almost doubling by the end of the century.
“PV module degradation is climate-dependant and very specific according to where they’re installed in Australia,” Poddar said. “If you have a module, say in the middle of the desert, and you have the same module installed somewhere along the coast, while they may be identical, the degradation rate would vary because they are exposed to different climates.”
Fiacre Rougieux, co-author of the study and lecturer in the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, said Australia needs to have climate change front of mind when it comes to PV design.
“We can see that climate stressors are becoming more extremes and as a result PV modules are likely to being replaced more frequently in some regions,” he says. “PV panel technology has gone through a complete revolution in the last 10 years, and this is a call for manufacturers to now focus their attention on how to make them more climate resilient”.
As the world experiences more extreme weather, the researchers believe that this could play a part in the lifetime of PV modules.
“It’s important to understand how we can help manufacturers understand which modules or which types of technology will perform better, based on the degradation performance under specific types of climates,” says Associate Professor Merlinde Kay, co-author of the study and lecturer in the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering.
While the researchers identified that thermal degradation is Australia’s main degradation precursor, further research should focus on reducing the extent of thermal cycling in modules.
“It is essential to focus on improving the module design to limit temperature rise of the modules. This would ensure higher power output and better lifetime of the modules. This will benefit future industrial large-scale PV plants to choose the most cost-effective and climate resilient modules,” Kay said.

Under the new entity name of Power Australia Limited, the Industry Growth Centres will see five hubs established around the country to ensure nationwide opportunities are sourced. Power Australia CEO Shannon O’Rourke said the the primary task will be to connect clean-tech ecosystems, commercialise Australian innovations and build capability across the country.
Husic said batteries, renewables and other low-emissions technologies offer huge opportunities for Australian industry to create jobs and the sovereign capabilities critical to Australia’s economic success, and the $14 million investment is targeted support to grow Aussie know-how in these emerging areas.
“It aligns with what we’re doing with our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, which has renewable and low-emissions technologies as one of its priority investment areas, once again demonstrating how Government linking up policies can better support Australian industry,” Husic said.
The Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre (PAIGC)’s intended outcomes include increasing industry development and adoption, plus domestic demand of renewable energy technology, and increase competitiveness in international renewable technologies markets. Other priorities will be upskilling workers to service the renewable technologies industry, increase capabilities of business to overcome battery regulatory barriers, and develop domestic battery and other renewable energy supply chains.
The PAIGC network will fund activities and provide services to help commercialise locally manufactured renewable energy technologies and ideas, encourage connections between critical minerals producers and renewable technology manufacturers, and include a First Nations Advisor to build First Nations business management capabilities in renewable technologies. It is a part of the government’s Australia Made Battery Plan, to provide advanced technology and skills development to businesses looking to locally manufacture renewable technologies.
Over the coming weeks Power Australia will contact businesses across the country to discuss its involvement in the PAIGC program, which will run from 2023-24 to 2026-27.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/20/environmentally-friendly-nickel-value-proposition-presents-lifeline/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,2024-02-20,‘Environmentally friendly’ nickel value proposition presents lifeline,"As highlighted in an article from the ABC last week, a number of nickel mines in Australia have shut down and more will likely follow. The reason is the price of nickel has dropped 40% in the last 12 months as a result of increased and low-cost supply from Indonesia.
This supply from Indonesia is using laterite nickel which is more difficult to smelt than the nickel sulphides ores pre-dominantly used in Australia. How is this possible? The media has mentioned use of Chinese technology. What is this new technology?
As far as I can tell this technology is based on a High Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) process used to extract nickel and cobalt from laterite ore bodies. The HPAL process utilises elevated temperatures and sulfuric acid to separate nickel and cobalt from the laterite ore.
The HPAL process is not new and was first used in the 1960s in Cuba. According to market intelligence firm Wood Mckenzie it is estimated that for every tonne of nickel produced via HPAL around 1.4-1.6 tonnes of acidic waste is also produced. This waste is currently being stored on land in tailings dams.
Many of the Indonesian mines and smelters and are located in the “coral triangle”, which is named after a staggering number of corals. Imagine if someone proposed an HPAL smelter on the iconic Ningaloo reef in WA?
The majority of lithium-ion batteries utilise a nickel cathode. There is, in fact, more nickel than lithium in a lithium-ion battery. Unfortunately, EV manufacturers are not currently prepared to pay a premium for more environmentally friendly nickel produced in Australia.
Placing nickel on the critical minerals list, allowing nickel miners to apply to access a $4 billion fund, is a good step in the short term. For the time being we need environmentally friendly sources of nickel to support our transition to net zero emissions.
In the long term, it is likely that Lithium-iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries will prevail over lithium-ion batteries. LFP batteries are lower cost, safer and have a longer life. LFP batteries have a cathode of iron phosphate and an anode of graphite.
There is no nickel or cobalt in an LFP battery. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has championed the LFP battery technology saying, “the vast majority of the heavy lifting for electrification will be iron-based cells.”

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/20/sustainable-module-prices-unlikely-to-fall-further/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,WORLD",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-20,‘Sustainable’ module prices unlikely to fall further,"With a global PV oversupply cycle in full swing and price declines of more than 40% having rocked the market in 2023, it appears likely that significant reductions should not be expected to continue this year. Solar manufacturing advisory Exawatt reported that while inventory levels remain high, further cost reductions would likely represent manufacturers selling below cost.
Exawatt presented some of its price and cost analysis in a webinar last week. During the event, the head of PV for Exawatt, Alex Barrows, said that there remains little scope for significant cost reductions from solar module manufacturers in the near term.
“Our fundamental cost modelling allows us to look at where ‘sustainable pricing’ can go. In the near term it looks like spot prices have largely stabilised. Potential oversupply could push prices down even further, but ‘sustainable’ cost reductions in the medium term look fairly difficult,” said Barrows.
The Exawatt analyst noted that with materials and consumables comprising approximately 80% of PV module production cost, there is little room for further cost reduction in the short term. As such, prices will have to stabilise if manufacturers are to avoid selling at a loss.

Barrows observed that prices for polysilicon, the primary raw material in crystalline silicon module production, are relatively close to the cost of production at present. He said with prices at USD7.5kg for the polysilicon used for p-type ingot and wafer production and USD9 for poly used for n-type – and production costs averaging USD6.5/kg, there is little headroom for further declines.
“There’s a little bit of room for further cost reductions but not much,” said Barrows.
Rami Fedda, the co-founder of wholesaler of Solar Juice, noted that polysilicon prices have turned a corner – after a period of massive declines. Fedda said that poly prices had increased “for the first time in many months. This is usually the first sign of where panel prices are heading.”
Fedda made the call in Solar Juice’s first video news update for the year, posted today, in which he predicted module prices would stabilize in Q2 2024. He added that the annual production shutdown in China over the Lunar New Year of two weeks, may be exteneded of three-to-four weeks given the oversupply market dynamic.
While module buyers very well may welcome cheaper modules being available, Exawatt’s Barrows warned that distressed manufacturers may sacrifice quality in an attempt to cut costs.
“If you’re a module buyer, one of the key things to look out for is that module suppliers will be at risk of exiting the market this year. And they will be under a lot of pressure to cut costs by reducing the quality of materials they are using – backsheets, encapsulants, junction boxes.
“Low cost [could mean] potentially lower quality options,” Barrows warned.
The Exawatt team hosted the webinar last week to promote its subscriber Solar Technology and Cost Service, that it delivers along with quality assurance providers PVEL. Exawatt was acquired by commodity business intelligence provider CRU in April 2023.

The JHWE2301 EV charger enables the integrated control of PV power generation, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging in order to ensure high levels of self-consumption. The Japanese electronics manufacturer said that solar energy is fed into the electric vehicle as direct current.
The wall-mounted device is suitable for indoor and outdoor environments. It measures 505 mm x 194 mm x 347 mm and weighs 23 kg. Sharp claims that the system is the smallest and lightest currently on the market and said it is an ideal solution for parking lots where space is limited.
The charger has a charging/discharging rated power of 6 kW and an input DC voltage of 340 V.
The system can be used with Sharp’s Cocoro Energy mobile app, which enables the operation of multiple Sharp home appliances. The app is reportedly able to warn vehicle owners to charge their cars when there is the risk of power outages due to difficult weather conditions.
“In these cases, users can charge the EV in an area that is not affected by the power outage, and when they return home, they can discharge the EV back to the home battery,” it said in a statement. “With Cocoro, a notification will be sent to your smartphone if no EV connection operation is performed within a given time, which prevents users from forgetting to charge their EV.”
Sharp is currently offering the EV chargers in Japan for JPY 1.65 million ($11,000).
