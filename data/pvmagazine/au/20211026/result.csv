https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/26/woodsides-vague-hydrogen-announcement-coincides-with-major-gas-expansion/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",Woodside’s ‘vague’ hydrogen announcement coincides with major gas expansion,"Oil and gas company Woodside Petroleum Limited yesterday surprised the market with its ‘H2Perth’ announcement which will see the company construct a $1 billion hydrogen and ammonia plant in Kwinana on Western Australia’s south coast. Woodside claims the facility will produce both green and blue hydrogen – though specifics around how the hydrogen could be classed as such remains murky. 
The news, which is yet to be announced on the company’s ASX, comes not long after Woodside gained a crucial approval from the Western Australia government for its proposed Scarborough liquified natural gas (LNG) project, a $16 billion deep sea gas drilling project off the state’s coast.
A spokesperson from the Western Australian government, which has supported the plan, told pv magazine Australia one third of the Kwinana project’s hydrogen would initially be produced through electrolysis, while two thirds would be produced using gas. The electrolysers used in the project, however, are to be powered from the Western Australian grid – which in the last year sourced under a third of its electricity from renewable sources, with the vast majority coming from fossil fuels. Woodside’s announcement did not include plans for additional solar or wind installations, making it somewhat difficult to claim the hydrogen produced via electrolysis is indeed renewable. 
The majority of the hydrogen produced in the project’s first phase will come from gas via steam methane reforming, with the company expecting to use 40 terajoules — equivalent to 1 trillion joules or 0.278 GWh — of gas per day. Woodside says the H2Perth project will be net zero, which it plans to achieve using a combination of abatements, offsets and renewable energy certificates.
Maggie Wood, director at Conservation Council of WA, told pv magazine Australia it had examined Woodside’s H2Perth plan and found the details “very vague,” noting exactly how the facility plans to achieve carbon neutrality is “really unclear”.
“This is a big announcement for Woodside. When a company doesn’t provide a lot of info to the market, there’s normally a reason,” Wood said.

This lack of clarity led Wood to question whether the project’s blue hydrogen claims are even verifiable, saying the output might be better classed as grey hydrogen.
In August, WA’s environment minister granted approval for a key component of Woodside’s proposed Scarborough gas field project, in which the company plans to construct a gas field approximately 375km north-west of the Burrup Peninsula with production start between 2023 and 2025.
The company is expected to reach its final investment decision on the project by the end of the year – which has unsurprisingly drawn widespread criticism. “If Woodside is serious about reducing emissions, then the best way to do that would be to stop the planned development of the Scarborough gas project,” Fiona Ivits, acting head of communications at Greenpeace Australia Pacific told pv magazine Australia.

Conservation Council of WA have also been highly critical of the plan, which it noted would be a major ($16 billion) draw on Woodside’s budget – making yesterdays news of a $1 billion hydrogen facility all the more surprising.
A spokesperson for Woodside told pv magazine Australia the gas from the Scarborough project would not be used at the H2Perth facility because the company has an offtake agreement in place with Perdaman Chemicals and Fertilisers, and plans to export the remainder.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/26/nats-not-listening-new-data-rejects-assumed-attitudes-of-coal-communities/,"EMPLOYMENT,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",Nats not listening: new data ‘rejects’ assumed attitudes of coal communities,"The findings of two surveys have been released this week revealing the extent to which Australians support renewable energy investments and desire stronger leadership from the federal Coalition government.
Surprisingly, a survey from Liberal party-aligned Blueprint Institute found 72% voters in traditional coal regions supported the redirection of government fossil fuel subsidies into renewable energy – with that sentiment holding true even among respondents who do not believe climate change is the result of humans. Put simply, even communities built on the back of coal with trepidations about climate science can see the future will be green.
“It seems the data rejects what some would have us think about the attitudes of people in regions, including regions which contain coal employment,” Blueprint regional researcher Kate Green said.
“The fact 68% of Coalition voters support this same prioritisation of renewable investment over fossil fuel subsidies was also striking. It’s clear regional people now believe the jobs created by renewables projects and clean hydrogen are real,” Green added.
The Blueprint Institute-commissioned survey polled 3,763 voters in the Queensland seats of Flynn, Maranoa, Capricornia; the Hunter, Shortland, Calare in New South Wales, as well as Gippsland (Victoria), Grey (South Australia), and O’Connor (Western Australia). It found 73% of respondents overall believe renewables projects would create jobs in their regions, while 74% would support a target to halve emissions by 2030.
Even among households employed by coal industries, 63% of respondents supported the redirection of subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable projects and 78% supported clean hydrogen projects.

World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Australia on Monday also published a report from its survey of 53 experts from private organisations, thinktanks, academic groups, and NGOs across finance, insurance, policy, advocacy, law, energy transition and investment.

It found 93% of experts felt Australia currently holds the natural resources to become a world leading renewable and clean manufacturing exporter. Be that as it may, 66% felt Australia lacks sufficient federal support to foster innovation and scale renewable and clean manufacturing opportunities, with 81% believe Australia does not yet have clear federal policy.
70% agreed WWF-Australia’s ambition to reach 700% renewables by 2050 is an achievable target, but felt Australia needed to grow its skills and capabilities to harness the potential.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/26/national-climate-blockers-at-odds-with-their-electorates/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",National climate blockers at odds with their electorates,"As someone under thirty, it’s hard to watch a handful of our leaders refuse to listen to the most up-to-date climate science and take appropriate action to safeguard my future. But it’s even more infuriating that the key National Party members that are derailing Australia’s climate ambition represent regional electorates that can benefit from the world’s transition to clean energy and transport systems.
Let’s start with Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce and his New South Wales electorate of New England. The NSW government has announced that they will develop a New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) because the area has good quality wind and solar resources. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, the New England REZ can support up to 10,900MW of new renewable energy generation, so if it was developed to its full potential it would create almost 29,000 construction and 1,800 ongoing jobs.
With the right planning and consultation, large-scale renewable energy projects can be built in a way that makes agricultural land more productive while providing a valuable second revenue stream to farmers. We see this in Dubbo where the local solar farm provides shade for grazing sheep and stimulates extra grass growth because condensation drips off the panels.
In Queensland, local federal MPs Ken O’Dowd, George Christensen and Keith Pitt have all been vocal about their opposition to implementing stronger emission reduction targets. But similarly, regional Queensland is perfectly placed to benefit from the world’s shift to a cleaner economy.
Ken O’Dowd’s electorate of Flynn will soon be home to the world’s biggest hydrogen-equipment manufacturing facility. The plant proposed just west of Gladstone will produce things like hydrogen electrolysers so that the Sunshine State can tap into its incredible renewable potential to produce renewable hydrogen for export.
If Australia takes the steps to manufacture products like renewable hydrogen, ‘green’ steel and aluminium to meet a growing global demand for these products, it would stimulate future-proof employment in industrial regions like Gladstone. In fact, research commissioned by Beyond Zero Emissions shows that building a local Renewable Energy Industry Precinct in Gladstone will power 11,000 Queensland jobs and raise local wages by $20,000 per year on average.
In George Christensen’s electorate of Dawson, in or immediately surrounding the electorate there are seven existing large-scale solar farms that are providing clean electricity to the region, with a further nine proposed in the area. Dawson also encompasses key tourism destinations, like the Whitsundays, that depend on the ongoing health of the Great Barrier Reef. Showing leadership on climate change is in the best interest of these communities.
Further south in Hinkler, which is represented by Keith Pitt, Bundaberg leads the country by being the postcode with the largest number of installed rooftop solar systems. Close-by Hervey Bay has the third highest uptake of any Australian postcode. Regional Queenslanders are leaders in the uptake of solar because utilising the impressive local sunshine to create cheap energy is a no-brainer.
The global transition to a cleaner economy means that we’ll have to adapt our export industries to stay competitive. If members of the federal Nationals really want to stand up for their electorates then they should be backing the leadership that’s already taking place locally and implementing 2030 climate targets that are in line with science.

Researchers at South Korea’s Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) claim to have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.8% for a single junction perovskite solar cell without the need for passivating the surface of the perovskite layer to reduce interfacial defects.
The scientists said the result is a world record for this kind of solar cell and that the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) certified the achievement of a 25.5% efficiency for the device.
The cell was built with an interlayer between a tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) electron-transporting layer and a layer made of a halide perovskite layer by coupling chlorine-bonded SnO2 with a perovskite precursor containing chlorine. “This interlayer has atomically coherent features which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer; and fewer interfacial defects,” the academics explained.
The defect-free connection layer is said to eliminate the risks related to passivation, which may not always provide the desired interface defect reduction, as the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film.
The cell was also able to retain around 90% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours under standard illumination. “Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers,” said UNIST researcher Seok Sang-il.
The technique to develop the solar cell is presented in the study Perovskite solar cells with atomically coherent interlayers on SnO2 electrodes, which was recently published in nature.
In April, a group of researchers from UNIST and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) achieved a conversion efficiency of 25.6% in a single-junction perovskite solar cell. The result edges out the previous record of 25.2%, achieved in February by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and UNIST’s earlier result of 25.17%, achieved in November 2020.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/26/will-chinas-double-carbon-and-dual-control-policies-drive-demand-for-solar/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,CHINA",PV MAGAZINE,"OCTOBER 26, 2021",Will China’s ‘double carbon’ and ‘dual control’ policies drive demand for solar?,"From pv magazine Global
There have been a range of measures taken by the Chinese authorities to achieve emission reductions, and I set out such policies in detail in an article on Wednesday. One immediate impact of such policies is that distributed solar PV has gained significant importance, simply because it enables factories to consume, on-site, their locally generated power, which often is significantly more affordable than grid-supplied power – in particular during hours of peak demand. Currently, the average payback period of a commercial and industrial (C&I) rooftop system in China is approximately 5-6 years. Furthermore, deployment of rooftop solar will help reduce manufacturers’ carbon footprints and their reliance on coal power.
In this context, in late August China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) approved a new pilot program specifically designed to promote the deployment of distributed solar PV. Accordingly, by the end of 2023, existing buildings will be required to install a rooftop PV system. Under the mandate, a minimum percentage of buildings will be required to install solar PV, with the requirements as follows: government buildings (no fewer than 50%); public structures (40%); commercial properties (30%); and rural buildings (20%), across 676 counties, will be required to have a solar rooftop system. Assuming 200-250 MW per county, total demand deriving from this program alone could be in the order of between 130 and 170 GW by the end of 2023.
Furthermore, if a solar PV system is combined with an electrical energy storage (EES) unit, it enables a factory to shift and extend its production hours. To date, approximately two-thirds of provinces have mandated that every new C&I solar rooftop, and ground-mounted system, must be combined with an EES unit.
At the end of September, the National Development and Reform Committee issued urban development guidelines which explicitly encouraged the deployment of distributed solar PV, and business models based on energy performance management contracts. The immediate impact of those guidelines has yet to be quantified.
In the near to mid-term, significant demand for PV will come from “GW-hybrid bases,” a concept which features the combination of renewables, hydro and coal, depending on location. China’s premier, Li Keqiang, while recently chairing a session addressing the current power supply constraints, explicitly called for the construction of massive GW-bases (in particular those including PV and wind) in the Gobi Desert, in order to serve as a power supply back-up system. Last week, it was China’s president, Xi Jinping, who announced that the construction of the first phase of such a GW-base – with a capacity of up to 100 GW – had already been initiated. Details relating to that project have yet to be published.
In addition to supporting solar PV installations, recently, an increasing number of provincial governments – notably Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu, among others – have been planning to introduce a more differentiated electricity tariff structure scheme, in an attempt to stimulate more rational use of power. For example, the ‘peak vs. valley’ price difference amounts to RMB1.173/kWh ($0.18/kWh) and RMB0.85/kWh ($0.13/kWh) in Guangdong and Henan, respectively.
Guangdong’s average tariff is RMB0.65/kWh ($0.10) and its lowest is RMB0.28/kWh ($0.04) between midnight and 7 a.m. Such time-of-use based electricity tariff schemes, anticipated to become effective during this month and next, will drive the emergence and development of new business models, in particular when combined with distributed solar PV.
Regardless of the impact of the double carbon and dual control policies, over the past eight weeks polysilicon prices have been increasing – to reach RMB270/kg ($41.95). Over the past few months, transitioning from a tight to a now-short-of-supply situation, the polysilicon supply crunch has led to existing and new companies announcing their intention to construct new polysilicon production capacities or add to existing facilities. According to the latest estimates, provided all 18 poly projects currently planned are executed, a total of 3 million tons of annual polysilicon production could be added by 2025-2026.
However, in the near-term, polysilicon prices are expected to stay high, given the limited additional supply coming online in the next couple of months, and due to a massive shift of demand from 2021 into next year. Over the past few weeks, countless provinces have approved double-digit-gigawatt scale solar project pipelines, the overwhelming majority scheduled to be connected to the grid by December next year.
This week, during an official press conference, representatives of China’s NEA announced that, between January and September, 22 GW of new solar PV generation capacity was installed, representing an increase of 16%, year on year. Taking into account the most recent developments, the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory estimates that in 2021 the market could grow between 4% and 13%, year on year – 50-55 GW – thereby crossing the 300 GW mark.
