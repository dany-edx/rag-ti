Blyth is Neoen’s fifth big battery in the National Electricity Market (NEM), located and will be integrated with the 203 MW second tranche of Neoen’s 412 MW Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm, and linked to ElectraNet’s 275 kV transmission network via the existing Blyth West substation.
CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth said the investment builds on a long-standing support for enabling technologies that will transform the grid and deliver clean energy to households and businesses around Australia.
“By developing additional renewable energy generation alongside the firming and storage capacity of large-scale batteries, we can continue to decarbonise the grid while ensuring stability,” Learmonth said.
“This innovative solution to provide firmed green energy at Olympic Dam enables a significant energy user to progress its net zero goals while producing a critical mineral like copper more sustainably.”
Monique Miller CIO for Renewables and Sustainable Finance CEFC said the strong working relationship between the CEFC and Neoen has now helped finance four large scale batteries.
“The Blyth Battery is one of eight grid scale battery projects which were successful under ARENA’s Large Scale Battery Storage Funding Round, which will also support Neoen to retrofit the Victorian Big Battery that CEFC supported in [2020] to provide grid forming inverter technology.
“The Blyth Battery is the fourth Neoen large scale battery that the CEFC has financed, following investments in the 300 MW Victorian Big Battery, the 100 MW Capital Battery in the ACT, and the expansion of the 150 MW Hornsdale Power Reserve, also in SA. It is the fifth large scale battery financed by the CEFC and takes lifetime commitments in this critical enabling technology to more than $390 million, complementing our extensive renewable energy portfolio.”
Other banks in the lender group financing Blyth Battery and Goyder South Stage 1 wind farm include German-headquartered KfW IPEX-Bank, ING Wholesale Banking, the Japanese Mizuho Bank, and Westpac.
Velibor Marjanovic, Management Board Member KfW IPEX-Bank said the decision to finance the Blyth Battery and second tranche of Goyder South Stage 1 was made out of conviction.
“Our aim is to support the transformation of the economy and society to improve economic, ecological and social living conditions worldwide – which is why we also focus on energy transition projects. With our participation, we are enabling another energy transition project in Australia.”
Xavier Barbaro, Chairman and CEO Neoen congratulated Neoen Australia on completing the joint financing of two assets.
“In Australia, and around the world, Neoen is a long-term investor and owner of the renewable energy assets that it develops. This strong alignment of Neoen’s interest with that of our lenders is a genuine enabler and catalyst for growth,” Barbaro said.
The CEFC has access to $30.5 billion in investment capital from the Australian Government to deliver it’s $19 billion (USD$12 billion) Rewiring the Nation Fund, $1 billion (USD$652 million) Household Energy Upgrades Fund, $500 million (USD$326 million) Powering Australia Technology Fund, the $300 million (USD$195 million) Advancing Hydrogen Fund and the $200 million (USD$130 million) Clean Energy Innovation Fund.
The Blyth Battery project will use Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) batteries supplied and installed by Green Light Contractors and NHOA Australia.
The huge wind and battery project will supply BHP’s Olympic Dam copper mine. The federal minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowan, noted that the project will be large enough to supply the mine with approximately half of its electricity needs.
“It’s great to see clean energy powering mining – bringing together key national industrial strengths in renewables and resources, while creating jobs,” said Bowen in a statement. “The Albanese Government is excited to support a project that involves three vital things for Australia’s future – wind power, batteries, and strategic materials.”
Bowan reported that the project will more than 400 jobs during the construction of the wind farm and 40 at the Blyth Battery.
In its 2023 financial report, BHP said that improved reliability and productivity helped Olympic Dam in South Australia achieve record annual copper production.
The mining giant has a goal to reduce its operational greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.

Energy is the cornerstone of progress. Our quality of life is inextricably linked with access to, and utilization of, external energy sources. Electricity is the most versatile and practical form of energy available to us. We can endure prolonged periods without coal, gas, or oil but electricity is indispensable as it underpins the functionality of modern life. Imagine a major city suddenly deprived of electricity. There would be chaos. Fortunately, across much of the world, we have established robust electricity systems that provide us with reliable and cost-effective power 24/7.
We are swiftly transitioning to cleaner sources of electricity, leaving behind the era of dirty coal and other fossil fuels. Solar and wind generated more than 14% of global electricity in 2023 (see chart right), marking a nearly fourfold increase over a decade. In the same period, an astonishing 413 GW of solar generation capacity was deployed globally. Global wind installations also reached record levels in 2023, approaching 105 GW.
The path forward involves a significant electrification of our societies, as outlined by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its roadmap to net-zero emissions by 2050 (see chart below). The focus is on replacing fossil fuels with clean electricity and implementing energy-efficiency measures. The synergy between the two is promising. For example, electric cars and heat pumps offer much greater efficiency than internal combustion engines or gas stoves. This increased efficiency translates to reduced energy losses, lower fuel costs, and decreased CO2 emissions. When we factor in efficiency measures across industry, buildings, appliances, and transport, it becomes evident that the IEA’s net-zero scenario is attainable. What the IEA does not fully anticipate is the impending renewable-era revolution, spearheaded by solar energy.

Globally, the Earth’s surface receives approximately 170 W of sunlight energy per square meter, on average, with high-pressure zones around the tropics receiving more than 250 W per square meter. Given modern solar technology, and assuming 20% conversion efficiency, we could meet global energy needs with an area the size of the Sahara Desert if we effectively harnessed this energy.
Solar power seems to be the perfect solution for the world, from a theoretical standpoint. It offers free, boundless, clean energy. Solar energy fuels bioenergy, it serves as the primary source for wind energy, hydro energy, and was even the ultimate source of energy for the fossil fuels that developed over millions of years.
We have the ability to convert solar energy into its most usable form – electricity – at a low cost. Photovoltaics have the advantage of applicability in both small- and large-scale installations. PV can be integrated into roofs and facades or deployed in large-scale plants with ease. Installation is straightforward and requires minimal or no maintenance.
These factors explain why, in 2023, there were more solar installations worldwide than all other forms of power generation combined. To put that into perspective, the scale of solar installation in 2023 exceeded the cumulative global nuclear fleet, which has been built up over five decades. Solar is setting unprecedented records and even experts continually underestimate its installation rates. A year ago, analysts at BloombergNEF projected 320 GW of solar installations for 2023, a number that will likely have been exceeded (see chart below).

In 2024, the global solar market is poised to reach 500 GW of annual installations. Over the past five years, we will have installed as much solar capacity as the world’s coal power generation fleet. This signifies a revolution, albeit one marked by intermittent energy production, as some critics contend.
The solution to this intermittency challenge is the “neural grid,” a term coined by analyst Guidehouse Insights some years ago. In the neural grid, data and intelligence are predominantly housed in the cloud. The grid makes use of widespread connectivity, artificial intelligence, and the growing number of devices connected to the internet. It manages the interface of generation assets and distribution networks with energy consumers, buildings, transportation infrastructure, city systems, and assets such as solar, wind, and energy storage systems.
Essentially, the “neural grid” empowers the world’s largest machine, the power grid, with intelligence. This presents a substantial growth opportunity that will unlock significant consumer value, drive decarbonization, and reshape societies.
Energy storage is also pivotal. Over the past century, we have built extensive energy storage capability. For instance, the United States has strategic reserves of crude oil sufficient to meet national needs for more than a month. There is also substantial storage capacity for coal and natural gas. The same cannot be said for electricity. Unlike other energy forms, electricity must be utilized immediately or converted into another form before re-use. Common methods include the use of spinning turbine masses (inertia), pumped hydro, and batteries. The world lacks enough backup energy storage capacity to sustain even a single day without electricity. Consequently, our power systems rely on fossil fuel storage as backup. The battery revolution is the next critical component of the renewables-era transition.
Batteries are a vital, albeit often overlooked, part of our lives. Our digital existence depends on batteries, which provide the portable power required for our electronic devices. The sheer number of batteries in our surroundings is staggering (see chart below). I identified more than 300 batteries in my home, ranging from button-sized devices in my watch to a 120 kg battery used for home storage.

The demand for high-performance batteries, such as lithium-ion devices, has surged at an unprecedented rate. In 2013, the high-performance battery market amounted to 45 GWh of energy storage capacity, primarily serving mobile devices and laptops. Last year, this market expanded to nearly 1.1 TWh, a 24-fold increase. Meanwhile, battery pack prices have plummeted by 80% and, all the while, battery performance continues to improve. Most of those batteries are being deployed to electrify cars and other vehicles. Batteries are already a foundational element of the renewables-era revolution, and their significance will only amplify, going forward.
Batteries play a pivotal role in the electrification of transportation, where we have already reached a tipping point in terms of ownership costs. Future innovations and economies of scale will further drive down expense to achieve price parity between internal combustion engines and electric vehicles, based on sticker prices. Those electric vehicles will serve as grid resources, charging when renewable energy is abundant and discharging when it is scarce.
Continued enhancements in performance, and cost reductions, will open up new markets, starting with off-grid solutions and expanding to residential homes and buildings. A prime example can be found in Germany, where almost 70% of residential solar owners installed storage systems to complement their panels last year. That choice is driven by the economic advantage of utilizing excess self-generated power for internal consumption, instead of exporting it to the grid.
We will also witness a proliferation of large-scale stationary storage sites, to ensure 24/7 power reliability for grid operators. These storage facilities will mitigate price volatility in wholesale energy markets and enable the expansion of cost-effective intermittent renewables.
Expect significant innovations, particularly in longer-duration storage solutions, where lithium-ion may not be the ultimate choice. Technology such as sodium-ion batteries could gain prominence. Ultimately, low-cost storage for the electricity grid will become ubiquitous.
The final crucial technology in the renewables era is the heat pump. These devices boast high efficiency, delivering three to five units of heat for each unit of electricity consumed, thanks to their ability to harvest “free energy” from the difference between inside and outside temperatures. Heat pumps are already the primary method of heating homes in Nordic countries such as Norway. Many heat pumps can also be configured for cooling purposes. While heat pumps themselves are not new, innovations surrounding refrigerants – the fluids that circulate and transfer heat – are advancing. Innovations are also taking place in thermal storage and the control and management of heat pumps, opening new markets and stimulating growth opportunities. Mass-production capacities are scaling up worldwide, further driving down costs. Heat pumps are poised to become a versatile solution for heating and cooling buildings efficiently and affordably.
Energy revolutions occur periodically. The last major incidence was the oil boom at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1900, daily oil extraction stood at 150,000 barrels, today it exceeds 100 million barrels. The resultant wealth has been instrumental in the prosperity of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and many other nations.
Presently, we find ourselves in the midst of another energy revolution: the renewables-era revolution. It represents both a significant opportunity and a challenge for companies and countries worldwide. Four pivotal technologies – solar, batteries, digital connectivity, and heat pumps – will facilitate global decarbonization. They will usher in wealth for those who embrace them.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/07/australian-ev-fast-charging-sites-set-to-double-in-2024/,"EV,AUSTRALIA",ALEISHA HEY,2024-02-07,Australian EV fast charging sites set to double in 2024,"The “Q4 – 2023 Australian Electric Vehicle Public Fast Charger Network Report,” by Next System has revealed the number of Australian EV fast charging sites grew by 90% in 2023. According to Next System’s analysis, the network’s total installed capacity grew a staggering 33% in just the last three months.
Next System founder and report co-author Daniel Bleakley said, “Our analysis shows that an additional 50,000 kW of capacity was installed in Q4 2023 alone.”
The report addresses the idea that EV charging stations can be installed in many more sites than traditional petrol service stations, allowing the charging station network the potential to be far more widespread than the current petrol and diesel fuel distribution system.

The development and rollout of the EV fast-charging network presents an opportunity to view transport very differently from our current refuelling system. Sectors such as shopping centers and workplaces need to be aware of the opportunities on offer.
“Lack of public fast charging infrastructure is often quoted to be a major barrier to electric vehicle uptake in Australia; however, our report shows the EV charging network is actually now growing faster than the Australian EV fleet”, says Bleakley.
In 2023 there were 397 new charging sites installed, taking the total number of sites in Australia up to 840 sites, with a total installed capacity of 201,695 kW, which was up by 93%. While average charger speed has increased by 52% since 2016, contrary to expectations, there has been an overall decrease in the number of chargers per site.
The report also noted the average pricing varies greatly across the network with a $0.25 per kWh difference between the cheapest and most expensive network operators.
With the rollout of more powerful chargers, newly installed capacity in Q4 2023 grew even faster, going up 271% compared to Q4 2022. Leading the charger capacity was Tesla, making up 62% of all newly installed chargers with 31.5 MW of new charger capacity.
The network has experienced rapid growth over the past two years. In early 2022 just 10 new EV charging sites were being added to the network each month. By the end of 2023, that figure has increased to 50 per month.
The recent growth in new commissioned sites has been driven largely by Chargefox and Evie, with over 50% of target market share.

Scientists at Belgium’s Hasselt University have discovered that climate-based solar module degradation rates could have a significant impact on power electronics in PV systems.
In the study “Assessing the impact of PV panel climate-based degradation rates on inverter reliability in grid-connected solar energy systems,” which was recently published in Heliyon, the academics warned that using similar climate-based degradation rates for PV systems in all climate zones worldwide represents an “unrealistic approximation” that can lead to misleading results. “This can result in the over- or underestimation of PV lifetime and subsequently impact the power electronics reliability estimations,” they added.
The research group evaluated the panel degradation rates based on climatic stresses in three distinct geographical locations: Genk in Belgium, Accra in Ghana, and Kabd in Kuwait. These locations represent moderate, hot and humid, and hot and dry climates, respectively.
It used a physics-based approach that considered meteorological data such as ambient temperature, irradiance, wind speed, and direction, as well as material properties like optical, thermal, and electrical constants, and thicknesses of each layer in the module. It also took into account panel parameters such as temperature coefficients, external quantum efficiency, and interconnect layout.
The researchers explained that insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), which are the switching devices in the PV inverter, are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and, without proper management, can lead to failures or reduced lifespan.
“Every time that an IGBT is turned on, there will be power losses generated inside the material layers, and these power losses can generate heat inside the IGBT,” they explained. “Consequently, each activation induces a thermal cycle attributed to these power losses.”
The team analyzed the potential degradation rates in a standard 4 kW PV system including a DC-DC boost converter and a single-phase inverter using four IGBTs with a voltage rating of 700 V and a current rating of 40 A. It considered a scenario without solar module intrinsic degradation rate and a scenario taking into account intrinsic PV degradation rate.
Through a series of simulations, the researchers found that the inverter in the PV system located in Kabd has a much shorter lifespan than inverters located in Genk and Accra.
“The PV inverter in Kabd experiences substantial thermal stresses without the effects of PV degradation, and the IGBT may fail in just 5 years, leading to PV inverter failure in just 3.8 years,” they stressed. “With the introduction of linear PV degradation, the PV inverter’s lifespan in Kabd will increase to 5.8 years, but still falls short of the other two locations. The physics-based PV degradation model will raise Kabd’s lifespan to around 6.5 years.”
The group concluded that deploying PV systems in hot and arid climates could require different parameters for inverter design. “These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating various factors and parameters when assessing the reliability of a PV inverter and its switching device,” it stated.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/07/more-than-2500-low-income-homeowners-in-nsw-take-up-rebate-swap-for-solar-offer/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,NEW SOUTH WALES",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-07,"More than 2,500 low-income homeowners in NSW take up rebate swap for solar offer","NSW Minister for Energy Penny Sharpe announced on LinkedIn that free solar panels available through the state government’s Rebate Swap for Solar program have been delivered to 2,700 low-income households. The program funds the installation of 3 kWp rooftop PV systems to homeowners that qualify for the annual electricity subsidy, the Low Income Household Rebate (LIHR).
The Rebate Swap for Solar scheme offers to help homeowners on low incomes reduce their electricity bills by installing small residential solar systems promising to save $600 a year off energy bills, which is twice as much as the LIHR at $285 a year.
Two installers are approved to deliver the solar scheme, including Sydney-based company UPowr, which administers a network of installers for all of NSW except the remote far west where it is managed by Lighting and Energy Conservation Australia (LECA).
“The NSW Government is partnering with private enterprise to reduce energy costs for customers through the Rebate Swap for Solar offer, which is an essential part of our plan to reduce the state’s carbon footprint as NSW transitions to a renewable energy-based Net Zero economy,” Sharpe said.
Eligibility for the scheme includes agreeing to “swap” or forgo the LIHR annual discount on any electricity bill for 10 years – the equivalent of up to $2850 – plus take ownership of the system, be responsible for maintenance, and install a smart meter at their own cost. There is an option to increase the size to a maximum of 6 kW, also at the homeowner’s own cost.
Recipients must also have a concession card, own their own home, and not already own a solar system. Further conditions can additionally limit eligibility including a home’s suitability for a solar installation.
Solar energy that is not consumed in the home is fed back to the electricity grid, potentially attracting a solar feed-in tariff, which Energy NSW has said for 2022/2023 was $0.046 to $0.055/kWh. Although the major savings come from using, as much as possible, the electricity produced by the rooftop system in the home.

In a short case study, published on the NSW energy ministry website, NSW South Coast resident Catherine reported that she has shifted electricity-consuming chores to sunny times of the day.
“I vacuum, use the washing machine and cook my main meal in the day. And I make an effort not to use as much electricity in the evening,” said Catherine. “The application was very easy and straight forward. After my application was assessed, the installer at SolarHub talked me through the installation process. Then my new solar system was set up in less than a day.”
At 3 kW, the systems provided under the Rebate Swap for Solar are small. Indeed, with module prices at record lows, increasing system sizes to 6 kW could be achieved without doubling the total system cost.
A similar program, Switch for Solar operates in South Australia, which asks eligible low-income residents to exchange government concession payments for a 4.4 kW solar system installation.
There is evidence to suggest that incentivising rooftop PV in low-income neighbourhoods is effective in promoting solar uptake. Researchers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States published research in 2023 that found that as solar becomes more common in low-income neighbourhoods, that it encourages others to install PV – a policy that is particularly effective if economic barriers to entry are also reduced.
The NSW rebate swap scheme was launched in June 2022, by the former Perrottet government. At the time, the NSW government said that approximately 1 million NSW homes received rebates to assist with power bills.
