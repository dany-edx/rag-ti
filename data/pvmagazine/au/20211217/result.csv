https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/17/csiro-report-reveals-renewables-remain-cheapest-new-build-power/,"SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 17, 2021",CSIRO report reveals renewables remain cheapest new-build power,"The CSIRO’s fourth annual GenCost report, released on Friday for public consultation, has again found renewables including solar PV and wind are by a “significant margin” the cheapest new-build electricity generation option in Australia.
A collaboration between the national science agency and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the GenCost report compares and estimates the levelised cost of large-scale electricity generation in Australia.
The CSIRO said the latest modelling, which incorporates current capital cost estimates and projections of future changes in costs, confirmed past years’ findings that solar and wind are the cheapest sources of energy in Australia.
This is true even when considering their additional integration costs such as energy storage and more transmission lines that are required due to the variable nature of renewable output and their wider distribution compared to fossil fuel generation.
“Variable renewables (wind and solar PV) without transmission or storage costs are the lowest cost generation technology by a significant margin,” the report says.
“From 2030, the estimates on additional integration costs associated with increasing variable renewable generation confirms that they are also competitive when transmission, synchronous condenser and storage costs are included.”
The modelling estimates that the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) using solar PV ranges from $44 to $65 per MWh, depending on the scale and location of the installation. Wind power costs range from $45 to $57 per MWh.
The CSIRO says the integration costs to support renewables are estimated at $10 to $15 per MWh, depending on the variable renewable energy (VRE) share.
This compares to the estimated LCOE of a new black coal generator of between $87 and $118 per MWh and gas generation costs between $65 and $111 per MWh.
The modelling forecasts that the costs of fossil fuel technologies will remain largely unchanged in real terms over the next three decades while the costs of wind, solar and integrating technologies like energy storage will continue to fall as the respective technologies advance.
CSIRO chief energy economist Paul Graham said the new report would aid industry stakeholders as they grapple with the rapid transition of the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“The energy sector is rapidly changing so we need updates like this report to ensure that our planning is based on the most up-to-date cost estimates,” he said.
“It’s also crucial that stakeholders have an opportunity to scrutinise the changes to ensure they are consistent with direct industry experience.”
While the report indicates solar PV and wind continue to provide the cheapest sources of new electricity generation capacity, the CSIRO did warn that forward projections for 2022-23 assume that cost reductions for all technologies will stall for 12 months with international supply chains dealing with fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Global supply chains are currently experiencing tight conditions following ongoing restrictions and mixed recovery from the global Covid-19 pandemic,” the report says. “This increases the potential for price pressures. Higher prices have not been observed in this year’s update of current costs. However, they are a risk for projects that will be procured or completed in the coming year.”
The updated GenCost report also shows the costs of hydrogen electrolysers, which the CSIRO believes could be an important pathway for producing low-emission hydrogen, have declined considerably, in line with 2020-21 projections.
Cost reductions for technologies not currently being widely deployed, such as solar thermal, carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear small modular reactors, and ocean energy are lagging and would require stronger global and domestic investment to realise their full potential.
AEMO forecasting group manager Nicola Falcon said the updated GenCost report would help frame the market operator’s future grid planning.
“The CSIRO’s process to regularly monitor, consult on and update generation technology cost trajectories is incredibly valuable as we plan for an accelerated transformation of the NEM,” she said.
“Offshore wind, for example, has great potential due to resource quality, but economics are not yet proven in Australia. If technology costs continue to track down, as foreshadowed in this year’s GenCost, then this technology could play a greater role in future Integrated System Plans.
“GenCost assists us, and industry stakeholders, to achieve the vision for a reliable, low-cost, net-zero emissions electricity system.”
The final version of the GenCost report will be delivered mid-2022.

The privately-owned developer is also seeking to build a new transmission line that would connect the big battery to TransGrid’s existing 330 kV Wallerawang substation.
Greenspot, which acquired the former power station site from EnergyAustralia in September 2020, said construction of the energy storage system is expected to begin in early 2022. It is anticipated the big battery, dubbed the Wallerawang 9 Battery, will be fully operational by summer 2023/24, making it one of the earliest examples of how new and sustainable economies can be born from the retirement of coal-fired power stations.
“We’re focused on delivering a shovel-ready site and we are aiming to work with leading energy market players to deliver a successful example of what’s possible as Australia transitions to renewable energy,” Greenspot chief executive officer Brett Hawkins said.
Greenspot, which was established with the objective of repurposing stranded fossil fuel assets, said the big battery is aligned with the state government’s electricity strategy and will provide enabling infrastructure for expanding the renewable energy industry in NSW, particularly in and around the Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).
“We’re excited about the project’s potential to deliver storage, firming and other energy services to facilitate the introduction of more renewables into the NSW market,” Hawkins said.
Greenspot said the battery will also be a significant enabler for the transformation of the site into a multi-use hub for industry, providing a stable, reliable and cost-effective energy source for the future redevelopment.

It is anticipated the battery project will require only 40 hectares of the approximately 450ha site, which has sat idle since the coal-fired power station was decommissioned in 2014, with Greenspot aiming to attract industrial, agribusiness and manufacturing businesses, serving to generate sustainable economic activity.
“The lodgement of the development application for the Wallerawang 9 Battery is an important early marker in repurposing the site for the next chapter of success,” Hawkins said.
“There is much at stake as we look to reinstate the power station as the heartbeat of the community here. We’re looking forward to working together with all stakeholders to generate renewed business activity and sustainable employment opportunities for the region.”
The project is the second major battery slated for the region with French renewables developer Neoen earlier this year filing planning documents for a 500 MW/1,000 MWh big battery to be also built at Wallerawang.
Construction of the Great Western Battery is expected to begin in 2022 with Neoen indicating the battery could be operational by 2023.
The lodging of the DA for the Wallerawang 9 Battery follows the recent demolition of two 175 metre chimney stacks and a boiler house at the power station site.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/17/end-of-coal-is-coming-three-times-faster-than-expected-governments-must-accept-it-and-urgently-support-a-just-transition/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"DECEMBER 17, 2021",End of coal is coming three times faster than expected. Governments must accept it and urgently support a ‘just transition’,"The report, called the 2022 Integrated System Plan, confirmed what many of us in energy policy have long known: the end of coal is coming, and the pace may take some industries and governments by surprise.
The Integrated System Plan (ISP) is effectively the planning “blueprint” the market operator publishes to help industry and policy makers assess how Australia’s electricity system might evolve. It’s an incredibly important document for guiding where and when investment is needed to unlock new renewable resources to meet demand.
Given ISP’s prediction for the rapid closure of coal-fired power stations, it’s critical governments don’t stick their heads in the sand. Continuing to deny the impending end of coal-fired generation is simply not in the interest of coal workers and their communities, who urgently need support.
The most important aspect of the ISP is that what used to be called the “step change” has now become the “central scenario”. For the first time, this central scenario is consistent with Australia’s commitment under the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to under 2℃.
The ISP is forecasting that huge volumes of coal will be retired in the next 10 years, including all brown coal and two-thirds of black coal, and significant investments in new renewables and “firming technologies” (such as batteries, gas, and pumped hydro) will take their place.

About 14 GW of coal is now assumed to be exiting the National Electricity Market (NEM) this decade – more than three times the amount of coal retirements the industry has announced.
Effectively, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is saying (yet again) that the incumbent industry is likely to be caught by surprise by the speed of the transition.
It’s not just an explosion of renewables investment that AEMO predicts. Around 9GW of gas-fired generation and an extra 620GW hours of storage (provided by batteries or pumped hydro) will be required to provide backup generation capacity when solar and wind are unavailable.
Electricity demand is expected to surge out to 2050 and will double to at least 350 terrawatt hours. This includes from electric vehicles uptake, converting natural gas heating and hot water to electric in homes, and electrifying many industrial processes such as low-emissions steel and aluminium.
All these developments will require a major overhaul of the grid. The ISP states around A$12.5 billion in transmission spending needs to occur to unlock $29 billion in investment benefits.
There are two main drivers for this significant substitution of coal for new technologies.
First, the cost of these technologies continues to fall rapidly and consumers are voting with their feet. Some of Australia’s largest and most iconic businesses are increasingly buying 100% of their energy from renewable resources, including Woolworths, BHP and Coles.
Second, state governments have filled the void left by the lack of a nationally consistent energy and climate policy, and are now implementing ambitious policies to drive the uptake of renewable energy and firming.
 
The most ambitious of these policies is the NSW government’s 12GW energy roadmap, which effectively prepares for the retirement of ageing coal-fired power stations by facilitating investment in new capacity.

It is critical governments focus on a “just transition” to these new technologies, and provide support to communities and workers most impacted, such as those in the Hunter and Latrobe Valleys.
Structural adjustment policies such as job placements, relocation assistance, or financial support to transition local economies are vital to secure opportunities for these regions. Retraining ahead of closures will help workers transition to new or related industries.
Everyone who uses energy must be afforded access to the clean energy transition. At present, the biggest barrier to participating in the solar and battery revolution is owning your own home.
Governments have been absent from this important policy debate. Australian low-income and rental households should be prioritised in any future policies that support adoption of solar and battery storage.

Governments must also ensure the private sector (rather than consumers) wear the risk of poor investments. Governments are increasingly taking on very significant risk (on behalf of consumers) through underwriting renewable energy and firming investments of large multi-national energy businesses.
Some economists (including us) have been providing alternative models for governments to achieve the same objectives, but with greater focus on reducing risks to consumers.
Given the surge in households and businesses voluntarily buying renewable energy, it’s important consumers know what they’re getting. The Clean Energy Regulator is doing some interesting work in this space by developing an emissions and renewable energy transparency register as part of the national greenhouse and energy reporting framework.
 
If governments really wanted to help, they could introduce a carbon price. Such a policy is considered political poison, but a carbon price would result in us reaching this future in a much less costly and more orderly way.
The ISP is forecasting a better and cleaner future. Australia has great opportunities from moving beyond the coal age and into the age of efficient renewable energy, as we’re blessed with some of the best renewable resources on the planet
With global leaders increasingly focused on rapidly reducing emissions, we have a lot to gain through new industries, such as green hydrogen and mineral processing. Both major political parties at the national level have targets that don’t really push beyond what AEMO now thinks is the status quo.
The stone age didn’t end because of a lack of stones. And the coal age is ending despite an abundance of it – whether governments believe it or not.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/17/pepsico-australia-makes-switch-to-100-renewables-with-new-ppas/,"MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 17, 2021",PepsiCo Australia makes switch to 100% renewables with new PPAs,"PepsiCo Australia announced on Thursday it has teamed with French renewables giant Engie and the Northam Solar Farm to secure power purchase agreements (PPAs) to source clean energy generated at a string of wind and solar PV farms, enabling its transition to 100% renewable electricity across its entire Australian operation.
The new agreements will integrate with PepsiCo’s current and planned on-site solar PV installations and the purchasing of large-scale generation certificates (LGCs).
The deal represents the first PPA for the Northam Solar Farm, which is jointly owned by Indigenous Business Australia (IBA) and Bookitja, a part of the Noongar Property Holdings group.
IBA acting executive director Stella de Cos said the returns provided by the organisation’s investment in renewable energy will be reinvested to benefit and create opportunities for Indigenous Australians.
“The Northam Solar Farm consists of 33,600 solar panels and is constructed over 25 hectares to provide renewable, sustainable, zero-emission electricity powered by Western Australia’s Wheatbelt sunshine,” she said.
“The agreement with PepsiCo Australia is the first PPA on this project and the first large-scale solar farm for IBA. We look forward to doing more in the renewable space with a view to Indigenous communities maximising their land resources.”
The PPA will be facilitated through an Electricity Supply Agreement with Western Australia-based electricity retailer Change Energy which will manage the Renewable Energy Certificate compliance, network connections and provide additional wholesale energy requirements to Pepsico’s Forrestfield manufacturing site in WA.
The new agreements will ensure Pepsico’s entire Australian operation, including its headquarters at Chatswood in New South Wales and manufacturing sites in South Australia, Queensland and WA, is powered entirely by renewable energy.

Pepsico, which has committed to 100% renewable electricity across its entire operations globally by 2040, said the shift to renewable energy in Australia will reduce the company’s carbon emissions by around 26,000 tonnes per year – equivalent to the annual electricity usage of 6,950 Australian homes.
PepsiCo Australia and New Zealand chief executive Danny Celoni said the company is committed to reducing emissions with climate change one of the most pressing concerns facing the global food system.
“The move to renewable electricity is positive for our business,” he said. “Australian consumers care about how companies are responding to climate change. The agreements are a great step forward in achieving our goal of net zero emissions by 2040.”
PepsiCo is a member of RE100, a global renewable energy initiative led by international non-profit The Climate Group and CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, bringing together large business with a shared commitment to renewable electricity.
Between them, the Australian members of RE100 use more than 5.5 TWh of electricity per year, enough to power 800,000 Australian homes.
RE100 Australia co-ordinator Jon Dee said PepsiCo’s switch to 100% renewable energy is a positive example for other companies to follow.
“Research shows that Australians want real action on climate change,” he said. “On that front, PepsiCo are delivering what the public want.”

Trade body SolarPower Europe this afternoon welcomed a European Commission proposal to mandate all new buildings in the bloc be zero-emission structures from 2030, and said the measure, if approved, would “mainstream the installation of on-site solar and [energy] storage in building renovations.”
The commission today proposed new buildings achieve zero-emission status by having low energy consumption, being powered by renewables where possible, generating no on-site fossil fuel emissions, and spelling out their anticipated whole life-cycle emissions in a new, clearer energy performance certificate.
The proposal, which will now pass to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers consisting of EU member state representatives for consideration, also suggested new public sector buildings meet the same requirements from 2027. The draft policy was presented as part of a recast, second version of the EU’s Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD).
Miguel Herrero, senior policy advisor at SolarPower Europe, this afternoon told pv magazine: “SolarPower Europe has long called for the revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive to accelerate the decarbonisation of existing buildings with on-site solar and storage. We’re thrilled to see this recast EPBD extend its scope to include the reduction of emissions from buildings, beyond simply improving their energy performance.”
He added: “Today’s proposal for EPDB II is set to mainstream the installation of on-site solar and storage in building renovations.”
Asked whether the commission’s suggestions were likely to survive possible pushback from member states, Herrero said: “As with all commission proposals, we will have to see how negotiations evolve in the European Parliament and council, but we know that in 2020 the parliament already indicated its strong support for the renovation wave and maximising the energy efficiency of all existing buildings.
“And if you look at what is already happening in France, Germany, and Portugal, with announcements of new legislation for solar on buildings, we can see a growing wave of realisation that solar technology can and must empower Europe to rapidly decarbonise the continent’s buildings.”
