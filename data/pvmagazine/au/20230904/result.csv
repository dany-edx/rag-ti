The Perth-based company said its licensed manufacturer in China had conducted a commercial production run on a standard manufacturing line with continuous production of 80 integrated glazing units (IGUs). Adding ClearVue’s components to produce a fully assembled and sealed IGU increased the production cycle time by only five minutes.
ClearVue Chief Executive Offer Martin Deil said the production run was a “very important milestone,” proving that the company’s second-generation IGUs can be mass produced by glazing manufacturers globally without the need for production line change.
“We now have proven ability to scale our innovative smart building solutions,” he said. “Our ability to mass produce the second-generation IGUs confirms the commercial viability of our product for both large commercial and small-scale bespoke products.”
Deil said eliminating the need for production line changes will allow manufacturers to lower their costs and increase their production outputs and manufacturing plant capability, “leading to lower cost products for end-customers.”
ClearVue has developed specialised glass technologies that preserve glass transparency while generating electricity. The IGUs feature PV cells around the edges of each unit. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and UV light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells.
The company said its second-generation IGUs deliver enhanced efficiency – averaging about 100 w peak per square metre over an entire facade – and a lower average cost per watt. The new design also provides reductions in the thickness and weight of the units while new electrical connection elements simplify the assembly and fabrication process.
ClearVue said production of the second-generation IGUs was initially tested at a smaller factory in Singapore with the company saying the time required to fabricate and assemble them was about 90% less than its original IGUs.
Deil said he expects the latest commercial-scale production run will assist ClearVue as it looks to expand its manufacturing capabilities, adding the company is currently in discussions with “multiple manufacturing license partners around the world.”

The Marinus Link interconnector was to comprise two 750 MW high voltage direct current (HVDC) undersea cables stretching from Burnie in northwest Tasmania to the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, giving the mainland greater access to Tasmania’s Battery of the Nation renewable energy projects.
The project was originally priced at between $3.1 billion (USD 2 billion) and $3.8 billion but recent estimates have put revised costs at more than $4 billion while the Tasmania government has suggested the final price tag could rise to as much as $5.5 billion.
The surge in costs had prompted a warning from the Tasmanian government that it wouldn’t fund the project at “any price”, casting doubt over the future of the interconnector.

Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said at the weekend that his government had reached a new funding deal with Tasmania under which the Commonwealth would increase its share in the joint venture entity to 49%.
Bowen said the agreement would ensure that the “game-changing” project will proceed.
“The Marinus Link is an important project for Australia’s renewable transformation and a vital project for Tasmania as well as the mainland,” he said. “And today, the Albanese government is stepping up and making sure this project becomes a reality.”
The new funding arrangements will see the Commonwealth’s equity share climb from 33.3%, while Tasmania’s share has dropped by almost half to 17.7% and Victoria’s has remained at 33.3%. Tasmania will have the option to sell its stake to the Commonwealth once the project is commissioned.
The new agreement has also seen the scope of the project scaled back with Bowen noting that Marinus Link will now “focus on one cable in the first instance, with cable two negotiations to continue and be considered as part of final investment decision making.”
Marinus Link is working towards a final investment decision by the end of 2024 with the cable expected to be built by 2028 or “earlier is possible.”

Updated economic analysis indicates that delivering the single cable will still cost in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion with Bowen pointing to rising equipment costs and supply chain challenges as key factors in the price increase.
“But we’re not going to let that get in the way of getting the job done, because it’s so important for renewable energy,” he said. “It’ll create energy security for Tasmania, and it’ll mean a big step forward in our plans to bring the entire energy grid to 82% renewables.”
Marinus Link Chief Executive Officer Caroline Wykamp said the project “will deliver more renewable generation development in Tasmania and the mainland, more energy security to both Tasmania and the mainland and more movement and access to lower-cost renewable energy sources, helping deliver lower energy costs in the long term.”
Wykamp said modelling showed the majority of the economic benefits associated with the Marinus Link project would be realised from the first cable.
“The first stage of the cable, which we are prioritising while negotiations continue for the second stage, will deliver 75% of the gross market benefits and more than 60% of the economic benefits,” she said. “That’s more than $2 billion in economic stimulus and more than 2,400 jobs, particularly in regional areas such as the northwest of Tasmania and Gippsland in Victoria.”
Marinus Link is currently undertaking a global tender process for HVDC cables and converter stations as it works towards a final investment decision.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/04/make-it-burn-and-other-lithium-ion-first-responder-guidance/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 4, 2023",‘Make it burn’ and other lithium-ion first responder guidance,"from pv magazine USA
Following a spate of thermal runaway incidents this summer, American Clean Power (ACP) has released its “First Responders Guide to Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) Battery Energy Storage System Incidents.”
The release coincides with New York state’s convening of an expert panel to reevaluate energy storage installation guidelines. The decision was prompted after several lithium-based battery projects faced thermal issues in New York State this summer, including the Three Mile Bay incident in the header image. And while it was not explicitly stated, the convening is presumably also influenced by the Moss Landing energy storage facility incidents.
The ACP’s guide specifically targets energy storage systems (ESS) that use Li-ion batteries, highlighting hazards like fires, explosions, arc flashes, electric shocks, and exposure to toxic chemicals. The guidance is based on the 2023 NFPA 855 revision, whose requirements apply to an ESS housed in multiple outdoor enclosures with an aggregate energy capacity surpassing 600 kWh. For systems of this scale, ACP highlighted requirements include a hazard mitigation analysis, fire and explosion testing in accordance with UL 9540A, emergency planning, and annual training sessions.
Insights from the McMicken facility’s thermal runaway and explosion in Arizona are reflected in the current code.
Pre-incident planning
Facilities with a capacity over 600 kWh must submit a comprehensive set of pre-incident documentation to both local authorities and firefighting departments. Key documents include fire and explosion test results, a hazard mitigation assessment and a detailed emergency response plan.
While the fire and explosion test results primarily focus on smaller components like battery cells, packs, and racks, the hazard mitigation report focuses on larger scale scenarios that could lead to a full-blown enclosure fire. The guide cites examples such as insulation loss leading to arcing or mechanical damages from vehicle impacts or flying debris.
Following the incident at McMicken, first responders now have mandated access to the battery management system data. During that Arizona mishap, adequate sensors and data would have alerted the first responders to the accumulating gasses in the battery enclosure. Knowing the temperatures of adjacent energy storage units can guide fire departments on any added protective measures.
Incident response
Emergencies involving fires, explosions, arc flashes, and toxic chemicals require quick assessments and appropriate protective gear upon arrival.
If there’s an active fire, allowing it to burn out thoroughly ensures the consumption of all fuel sources, reducing reignition risks. Monitoring neighbouring enclosures to curb fire spread is paramount.
When there is no evident fire, the data from battery management systems proves invaluable insight into the enclosure’s internal situation and whether a thermal runaway event has occurred. During these types of events, accumulated gasses and mounting pressure within the battery unit create a volatile mix, risking explosions if unchecked.

The McMicken event was triggered by gas accumulation. Responders, uninformed due to a lack of data, breached the enclosure, introducing large amounts of oxygen and driving an explosion that injured eight of them. One was thrown 73 feet from the container upon trying to access it.
Through any incident, the dangers of arc shock and toxic chemical exposure must be considered. Energy units, irrespective of the damage extent or visual status, should always be treated as fully charged. Combusted materials can release toxic gasses like hydrogen fluoride and carbon monoxide, demanding caution.
Concluding the guide, ACP sheds light on emerging industry views on incident management. Lithium-ion discussions oscillate between robust systems that curtail thermal events – risking explosions – and the “make it burn” approach:
Some ESS designs employ a ‘make it burn’ strategy, in which a sparker ignites flammable gas when the lower flammable limit is exceeded but before the lower explosive limit is reached. Such designs do not include fire suppression, on the basis that the loss of an enclosure through controlled burning is preferable to increasing the risk of an explosion.
In potential explosive scenarios, the wisdom of active venting enclosures is reiterated. If a first responder is unsure about an enclosure’s venting status, merely opening it can be useful – but perilous. Simple venting actions might not suffice in all cases, with active gas extraction deemed a more effective risk-mitigation strategy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/04/new-control-technique-for-microgrid-connected-pv-systems/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,WORLD",LIOR KAHANA,"SEPTEMBER 4, 2023",New control technique for microgrid-connected PV systems,"from pv magazine Global
An international research team has developed a new control strategy for microgrid-connected PV systems that uses integral backstepping control (IBC) – an evolution of the backstepping control (BC) technique.
The latter is a recursive technique that is commonly utilised to extract the maximum power from the PV system. It works by breaking down the nonlinear control problem into a series of simpler subsystems. “IBC is a form of non-linear control system, which is modified using integral action to handle different real-life variations in PV arrays better,” the scientists explained.
The novel technique is also said to perform control of the voltage of the PV system’s DC link voltage loop, as well as that of the grid’s active/reactive power loops of the microgrid. It can also control the compensation of the harmonic currents of the network, the injection of the power of the battery into the grid, and the loop of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT).
Via the Matlab software, the scientists applied the novel approach to a microgrid-connected PV system equipped with battery energy storage and a three-phase multi-functional two-level voltage source inverter (MVSI). The MVSI is controlled by a non-linear direct power control (DPC) strategy, which is generally utilised for grid-connected voltage source converters, and space vector modulation (SVM), which is a common technique in field-oriented control for induction motors and permanent magnet synchronous motors.
They conducted a series of simulations over seven scenarios of micro-grid operation and compared the results achieved by the IBC technique with those achieved by classic BC control and the proportional-integral (PI) approach, which consists of a controller formed by combining proportional and integral control action.
They found that the IBC method was the most accurate in tracking the performance of the DC bus voltage. It also had better results regarding reactive power testing, dynamic response, and charge current ripples. Finally, it also performed better in reducing total harmonic distortion (THD) and fundamental amplitude values under specific scenarios.
“The numerical results reveal the better characteristic of the proposed system in terms of current quality for different conditions,” the researchers said. “At all levels, the IBC controller remains comparatively better than the BC and PI controllers.”
They introduced the new technique in the paper “Robust integral backstepping control microgrid connected photovoltaic System with battery energy storage through multifunctional voltage source inverter using direct power control SVM strategies,” published in Energy Reports. The research group comprises academics from the Brothers Mentouri University and the University of Bejaia in Algeria, as well as from the Nisantasi University in Turkey, and the University of the Antilles.
