https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/25/renewables-to-drive-down-prices-as-fossil-fuel-generators-exit-nem/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 25, 2021",Renewables to drive down prices as fossil-fuel generators exit NEM,"A new report by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) says the impact sparked by the planned closures of several of the nation’s fossil-fuel generators, including the 1.68 GW Liddell Power Station which is set to shutter in 2023, will be largely offset by decreasing wholesale electricity and environmental costs as more renewable energy comes online across Australia.
The AEMC’s 2021 annual residential electricity price trends report, which examines the direction household electricity prices will take over the next three years, forecasts an average national drop in annual bills of 6%, or $77, by 2024 as cheaper renewable energy flows to consumers.
AEMC chair Anna Collyer said the report shows that, based on current trends, prices per kilowatt hour are likely to be under 26c p/kWh by June 2024, the first time since 2016/17.
“This illustrates how integrating renewables in a smart way makes it possible to have both lower emissions and lower costs for consumers,” she said.  “What we are seeing is the impact of new generation already commissioned as well as new capacity committed across the NEM.”
The predicted declines come in spite of the impending exit of several fossil-fuel generators from the National Electricity Market (NEM), including the staged exit of AGL’s Liddell Power Station in 2022 and 2023, one of the biggest coal-fired generators in the NEM.
AGL will close the plant in the New South Wales Hunter Valley in April 2023, having already lodged plans to establish a giant 500 MW battery at the site.
Collyer said prices are expected to fall slightly this financial year, increase by about $20 a year in FY2022/23 when Liddell exits the system, and then fall again as that lost capacity is replaced by a combination of solar, wind, gas and battery energy storage.

“While we have just under 2,500 MW of generation expected to exit the grid over the next three years, there are almost 5,500 MW of committed new large-scale generation and storage projects coming online over the same time period,” she said.
“This is in addition to 4,130 MW of new rooftop solar PV capacity, which will also influence prices by lowering demand and through exports.
“This diversity of generation and storage puts us in a strong position to manage the forecast retirement of ageing thermal generators and highlights the importance of being smart in how we connect resources to the grid and ensure the back-up needed for a secure supply, so the benefits of low cost and low emission generation aren’t eroded.”
While the report indicates wholesale costs and environmental costs are trending lower in most jurisdictions, it warns that regulated network charges are increasing.
“We can now see far enough into the future to be confident that power prices paid by consumers will continue to trend downwards over the next three years,” Collyer said.
“But while wholesale costs and environmental costs are trending lower, we are starting to see increases in the cost of network investments, and this is likely to accelerate over the next decade as more network investment is required to connect dispersed new generation to the grid.”
Queensland is predicted to see the biggest price drop over the next three years, with prices expected to fall by 10%, or $126, to their lowest level in more than a decade.
The report predicts the price falls will be driven by more than 1.3 GW of new solar and wind generation and 100 MW of new battery storage coming online in the state’s southeast in the reporting period.
“Significant new generation has been committed in southeast Queensland,” Collyer said, highlighting the 200 MW Bluegrass Solar Farm being constructed by Spanish solar EPC X-Elio near Chinchilla on Queensland’s Western Downs, the 162 MW Columboola Solar Farm being developed at nearby Miles, and 120 MW Gangarri Solar Farm developed by Shell in the state’s south west.
Collyer also identified the Kennedy Energy, Maryborough, Warwick stage 1 and 2, Western Downs and Woolonga solar projects and the 100 MW/150 MWh Wandoan South BESS project being developed by Singapore-based Vena Energy.
Electricity prices are forecast to fall by 4% ($50) by 2024 in New South Wales, 8% ($99) or in Victoria, 6% (125) in Tasmania, while a modest drop of 2% ($35) in South Australia is predicted.
The report said wholesale prices would fall in South Australia despite the withdrawal of 420 MW of generation capacity with the closure of the Torrens Island and Osborne units over the next few years.
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) is the only jurisdiction where power bills are predicted to rise. A net increase of 4%, or $77, is forecast by 2024.
Collyer said the modelling showed prices in the ACT increasing by $99 this financial year, and by $123 the following, before falling by $145 in 2023/24.
“A comparatively large number of ACT consumers, 28.7%, are still on standing offers rather than cheaper market offers so there are savings available to households if they shop around for a better deal,” she said.
The report said the price rise would be driven by rising wholesale and network costs, driven by increases in transmission and distribution costs.
It said environmental costs in the ACT would also increase due to the costs of large-scale Feed-in Tariff Schemes.
The report does not include the Northern Territory or Western Australia, which are not part of the NEM.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/25/states-stake-claim-for-green-hydrogen-as-australia-partners-with-germany-on-project/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 25, 2021",States stake claim for green hydrogen as Australia partners with Germany on project,"The future of Australia’s hydrogen export industry is set to get a boost with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announcing it will play a key role in the development and delivery of the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator known as HyGATE.
ARENA will team up with Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to administer HyGATE which it said will support “real-world pilot, trial, demonstration and research projects along the hydrogen supply chain”.
Australia and Germany have committed up to $50 million and €50 million, respectively, to invest in new renewable hydrogen projects. The funding initiative is expected to open in the first quarter of 2022.
ARENA chief executive Darren Miller said he welcomed the agency’s involvement and the opportunity to work with Germany, which he described as “one of the world’s leaders when it comes to renewable hydrogen technology”.
“Having already committed over $160 million into renewable hydrogen research, studies and electrolyser deployments, ARENA now has an opportunity to highlight Australia’s innovation and commitment to growing and being at the forefront of a renewable hydrogen economy,” he said.
The HyGATE project follows the signing of the Australia-Germany Hydrogen Accord in June which will see the two nations invest in a series of new initiatives to accelerate the development of a hydrogen industry, creating new economic opportunities and jobs while reducing emissions.
The Western Australian Government has announced it will invest up to $117.5 million to attract federal funding for two new renewable hydrogen hubs as it looks to establish the state as a global clean energy powerhouse.
Hydrogen Industry Minister Alannah MacTiernan said the state government this week lodged applications through the Federal Government’s Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs program for matching commonwealth funding to develop hubs in the Pilbara and Mid-West.
“Both the Pilbara and Mid-West are attracting global attention for their renewable hydrogen potential, with energy companies from across the world setting their sights on WA,” she said.
“Our government has made this major commitment to unleash that potential and deliver the infrastructure we need to fast-track local renewable hydrogen production and exports.”

The Pilbara Hydrogen Hub plan involves development of a hydrogen or ammonia pipeline connecting the Maitland and Burrup strategic industrial areas, creation of a Clean Energy Training and Research Institute based out of both Karratha and Port Hedland, and port upgrades to facilitate export opportunities.
The Mid West Clean Hydrogen Hub proposal includes construction of renewable energy and road infrastructure at the Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area, as well as connecting the area to power and water, and developing hydrogen refuelling infrastructure.
WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state has “globally competitive natural advantages” in the renewable hydrogen industry – including abundant solar and wind resources, available land, existing export infrastructure and strong trading partnerships in the region.
“Western Australia has every advantage to be a world leader in renewable hydrogen, and we are committed to providing the support to make these job-creating projects a reality,” he said.
“The Pilbara and Mid-West are second to none among regions around the country in offering the competitive advantages needed to drive successful local hydrogen industries.
The Queensland Government’s ambition to establish Townsville in the state’s north as a green hydrogen powerhouse has been strengthened with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to investigate the process and feasibility of exporting the zero-emission fuel through the city’s port.
Australian renewables developer Edify Energy has signed a MoU with the Port of Townsville to advance Edify’s renewable hydrogen export project which would comprise up to 1 GW of electrolyser capacity, capable of producing up to 150,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year.
The signing of the MoU comes after Edify recently received development approval to build and operate a green hydrogen production plant, as well as a behind-the-meter solar and battery storage facility within the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct, south of Townsville.
Edify Energy
Edify plans to initially produce green hydrogen at the site with a 10 MW pilot scale facility before increasing capacity in stages. The company is also in the development stages of building its 200 MW Majors Creek Solar Power Station, which will supply electricity to the Lansdown facility.
Edify chief executive officer John Cole said Townsville’s existing infrastructure and industry is well suited to host a renewable hydrogen production and export industry.
“Using a renewable energy source to produce large-scale green hydrogen means Townsville will be perfectly poised to be North Queensland’s hydrogen hub and export capital on the east coast,” he said.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the state has a track record of creating energy export industries and the state government is getting the investment settings right to capitalise on renewable hydrogen.
“We are positioning Queensland as a global powerhouse for clean energy exports,” he said. “Renewable hydrogen will boost construction, utilities, heavy manufacturing, and a range of local service industries.”
Edify Energy joins a growing list of proponents seeking to export renewable hydrogen through the Port of Townsville, including Origin Energy and Ark Energy Corporation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/25/spark-5-2bn-takeover-secures-foreign-investment-approval/,"FINANCE,LEGAL,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 25, 2021",Spark $5.2bn takeover secures foreign investment approval,"Spark Infrastructure has announced that the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) has approved the $5.2 billion takeover of the power grid operator by a consortium led by United States-based global investment company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP).
The consortium, jointly owned by entities linked to KKR, OTPP and Canada’s PSP Investments, will take control of the network operator on December 22 if the New South Wales Supreme Court approves the scheme in the mandatory second hearing required for the takeover deal.
The hearing is scheduled for tomorrow (26 November) and already the process to delist Spark Infrastructure from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has begun with the S&P Dow Jones Indices announcing on Wednesday that subject to final court approval of the buyout, it will remove the company from the S&P/ASX 200 effective prior to the open of trading on 30 November.
“With receipt of Foreign Investment Review Board approval, all regulatory approvals required for the acquisition have been obtained,” Spark Infrastructure said in a statement.
“It is expected that Spark Infrastructure securities will be suspended from trading on the ASX from close of trading on 29 November 2021 and the cchemes will then be implemented on 22 December 2021.”
Spark shareholders earlier this week approved the $5.2 billion takeover, with 99.51% of security holders voting in favour of the creditor scheme resolution.
Spark owns a 49% stake in the Victorian distribution operators Powercor and CitiPower, which distribute electricity to more than 1 million customers in Victoria, 49% of South Australia’s distribution network operator SA Power Networks, which is the sole operator of South Australia’s electricity distribution network, and a 15% stake in transmission network operator Transgrid in New South Wales.
Until recently, Spark was exclusively an investor in regulated network infrastructure but it has begun developing a portfolio of wind, solar and storage assets, targeting more than $1 billion of investment in renewable energy generation by 2025.
In July, it announced plans to develop a 2.5 GW hybrid wind, solar PV and battery storage project in New South Wales while the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm came online last year.
The consortium will own Spark via a peak company PIKA Bidco.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/25/california-plans-400-mw-3200-mwh-compressed-air-energy-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"NOVEMBER 25, 2021",California plans 400 MW / 3200 MWh compressed air energy storage project,"From pv magazine USA
An affiliate of Hydrostor filed an application for a 400 MW / 3200 MWh long duration energy storage (LDES) project with the California Energy Commission (CEC). Hydrostor deploys compressed air energy storage, a technology that is able to store and dispatch energy for long durations.
As the region’s 2,200 MW Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is set to retire in 2024/2025, the LDES project has a target for commercial operation date as early as 2026. The project is expected to have a capital investment of around $800 million.
LDES technologies are viewed as important components in an evolving grid that features a growing share of renewable energy. They provide reliability services, and are hailed for their synergies with the weather-driven generation cycles of renewables.
Hydrostor’s technology features a four-step process for storing and dispatching energy. It first compresses off-peak or surplus energy from the grid, producing heated compressed air. Then, the heat is extracted from the air stream, and stored inside a thermal store, preserving the energy for later use. The compressed air is stored in a tank that uses a process called hydrostatic compensation to maintain constant pressure during operation.  When the energy needs to be dispatched, pressure forces air to the surface, where it is then recombined with heat, and sent through a turbine, producing dispatchable electricity.
The company said its technology has a 50 + year system life, uses no toxic materials, is emissions-free, and can provide rotational inertia in support of grid stability.
The plant, named the Pecho Energy Storage Center, will be able to deliver 400 megawatts of electricity for 8 hours, and will be comparable in physical size to some of California’s largest fossil fuel power plants. It is planned to interconnect at an existing 230 kV PG&E Morro Bay Switching Station, strategically located to serve California’s central coast.
The Pecho Energy Storage Center is expected to create 30 to 40 permanent, full-time jobs, and 200 to 450 labor jobs during construction. 
In June, the CEC said it would procure 1,000 MW of LDES, with duration of eight hours or longer, to be activated between 2026-2028. LDES technologies are continuing to take stage in the climate discussion, with an international LDES council formed at the recent COP26 summit. The council projects a need for 85 to 140 TWh of global LDES by 2040 to meet decarbonisation goals, which could entail an investment of $1.5 to $3 trillion.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/25/consistency-shines-bright-in-battery-storage-testing/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA",,"NOVEMBER 25, 2021",Consistency shines bright in battery storage testing,"In September 2021, independent battery performance tester ITP Renewables (ITP) released the latest bi-annual public report on its “Lithium-ion Battery Testing”. Supported by a $1.29 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), ITP tests the reliability and performance of a range of battery technologies at the Canberra Battery Test Centre.
A standout performer from the ongoing testing is Italian inverter specialist Fimer’s React 2 solar inverter and storage solution, an 8 kWh (nominal) Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (Li-ion NMC) phase 3 battery. ITP has experienced no operational issues with the battery.

ITP Renewables methodology uses accelerated cycling in the lab to attain faster results. As Susan Dedman, a project engineer at ITP Renewables, related in pv magazine Insight Australia 2021, “The batteries are cycled three times through their full useable capacity per day.” Each cycle consisting of full charging and fully discharging a battery by the maximum normal usage. “The nominal trial period is three years,” continued Dedman, “so at the end of that period we will have almost the equivalent of 10 years cycling data.”
ITP also aims to recreate real-world conditions for the batteries to cycle in, meaning the lab’s temperature is altered depending on the time of day and year.
“Capacity tests” are performed monthly whereby ITP measures how much energy is discharged. The Fimer React 2 is the only phase 3 battery that has completed more than 1,000 cycles, having completed over 1,320 cycles, and having managed to retain over 88% of its initial capacity, marking only a 3% loss in over 450 cycles since March. And thanks to its modular design, its capacity can be increased from 4 kWh through 8 kWh to 12 kWh depending on the application.

Dedman noted that while some of the batteries in testing are retaining their capacities well, the number of issues across the board means “the industry as a whole still has improvements to make in operational reliability, with issues often coming out of battery management, integration and control.”
This further emphasises the battery and inverter integrated React 2’s solid performance in testing, especially as one of the broadest findings ITP’s testing project has provided so far is that residential batteries can be quite unreliable.

As you can see from the above overview, in which red represents issues experienced by batteries under testing, to use Dedman’s words “there is really quite a lot of red on this graph, and going into the trial we hadn’t expected the operational data to be so valuable. And it has really highlighted how important technical support is after the sales process.”
Compared to other phase 3 batteries in ITP’s ongoing testing, the Fimer React 2 is both high-performing and consistent, particularly when it comes to lifetime round-trip efficiency, and though the Tesla Powerwall 2 is shown with its AC losses, the React 2 would likely remain the top performer.


At this juncture, in which the cost of batteries has fallen, and solar panel installations continue to accelerate, many people are asking themselves the tricky question of which system to install. Because the React 2 is a hybrid system with a strong ongoing test record, it should rank pretty high in your calculations if you’re considering installation of a whole new solar + storage system.
But if you already have a solar system installed, the React 2 is also a strong option thanks to its retrofitting capability. What is more, retrofitting with a hybrid storage plus inverter system saves on some conversion losses.
Fimer’s remote monitoring Energy Viewer mobile app is another big plus, and a factor some competing systems trip over. Being able to see how your system is operating provides an extra layer of system efficiency, for it allows users to examine their habits and behaviours and make small changes to live more sustainably, while saving more money on their electricity bills. This is especially important as payments for exports the grid continue to drop with wider solar uptake. The more efficient your solar + storage system is, the less you’ll need to call on the grid at all, and the more savings can accrue to make up some of the difference.
Fimer’s React 2 is available on the South Australian home battery scheme, the Victorian battery scheme and the NSW Empowering Homes program (provided it is installed by an approved installer).
