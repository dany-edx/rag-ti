Windlab Operations General Manager Mark Pickering told pv magazine Australia that KEP, near Hughenden in central north Queensland, is now fully operational and the initial hold-point tests, 10 MW and 25 MW, have been completed with the facility currently authorised to operate at 25 MW, exporting 80% of the energy that the facility is expected to produce at full 50 MW capacity.
“KEP has one further hold point to complete, being HP3 at 50 MW, which is the rated connection capacity,” he said. “We are awaiting the go-ahead from AEMO and Energy Queensland to perform this test. We hope to receive permission before the end of this year,” he said.
The energy park was hailed as Australia’s first project on a major grid to combine wind, solar and battery technologies when it was completed in late 2018, but its commercial operation has been delayed due to complications in the connection process. The plant was eventually energised in August 2019 but didn’t secure its registration from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) until June 2021.
Pickering said the ongoing hold-ups relate to the finalisation of the electrical model rather than the design of the plant.
“AEMO and Energy Queensland require a complex set of scenarios to be modelled which has taken longer than expected,” he said.

A 50-50 joint venture between Windlab and Japan-based energy company Eurus Energy, KEP is now expected to commence full commercial operations in early 2023.
The project is underpinned by a 10-year power purchase agreement with Queensland state-owned generator CS Energy which includes 100% of the output of KEP.
The update on KEP comes just days after Windlab announced it would team with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) to develop the North Queensland Super Hub in the Hughenden region. The goal is to unlock more than 10 GW of wind and solar energy within the next 10 years to support the industrial-scale production of green hydrogen.
Windlab Chief Executive John Martin said the projects are big steps towards the company realising its ambition to deliver 20% of Australia’s new green energy generation over the next 10 years.
“The enormous renewable energy potential of Hughenden and the Flinders Shire means this region is a strategically critical part of our development strategy,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/21/cleanpeak-to-switch-on-massive-5-mw-rooftop-system/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 21, 2022",CleanPeak to switch on massive 5 MW rooftop system,"Australian commercial rooftop solar specialist CleanPeak Energy has announced the expansion of the 5 MW Tonsley solar project will be commissioned this week, more than doubling the green energy output at the former car manufacturing site turned “innovation precinct” in Adelaide’s southern suburbs.
CleanPeak, which owns and operates the Tonsley District Energy Scheme, said the expansion included the installation of almost 6,000 solar panels atop Renewal SA’s Line Zero building and TAFA SA’s campus.
The second stage significantly adds to the capacity of the original 2.34 MW solar system installed on the rooftop of Tonsley’s Main Assembly Building in 2020, which at the time was one of Australia’s largest rooftop systems.
Combined, the two stages comprise more than 13,000 panels, and CleanPeak Chief Executive Philip Graham said the massive system will generate more than 7,000 MWh of clean energy each year, bringing the 56-hectare Tonsley Innovation Precinct one step closer to being fully solar powered.
“The 5 MW solar project is one of the largest systems in the country,” Graham said. “Now that it is operational, it will provide around 80% of the precinct’s overall energy needs annually.”

Graham said the Tonsley project underpins Sydney-based CleanPeak’s growing investment in South Australia, which includes a planned battery energy storage portfolio that will service multiple commercial sites across the state.
The first of these batteries is to be built at Tonsley and is expected to be online for summer 2022/2023.
“Our strategy is to couple the Tonsley system with a 3.3 MW battery, currently being developed for the site, which will allow storage of excess energy generation,” Graham said. “This will ensure the site is on track to reduce its carbon footprint and moves us closer to realising our ambition to power the site from 100% renewable sources.”
CleanPeak said the behind-the-meter battery will be delivered over three stages and at full capacity will reach 10 MW.
The Tonsley Innovation District, the former site of car maker Mitsubishi’s manufacturing plant, was purchased by the South Australian government more than 10 years ago with the vision of turning it into a climate-smart precinct housing research and education institutions, industry and manufacturing residents. Managed by Renewal SA on behalf of the state government, the district is now home to more than 140 businesses, including ZEN Energy, Tesla, AZZO and Siemens.

State Planning Minister Nick Champion said the commissioning of stage 2 of the rooftop solar system is another example of Tonsley’s commitment to sustainability.
“Renewables are the future, and it’s great to see Tonsley Innovation District and CleanPeak Energy pushing to not only create cleaner sources of energy but also providing storage capabilities for the future,” he said.
Champion said the project would aid the state in achieving its emissions reduction goals, including reducing carbon emissions by more than 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

At a ceremony marking the milestone, Green, a Scientia Professor at the University of New South Wales and director of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said via video that 26.81% is the world’s highest silicon cell efficiency record to date.
“This outstanding achievement will be incorporated into the next version of efficiency tables charting important progress in the photovoltaic industry,” he said.
Longi achieved an efficiency of 25.26% for the same solar cell 18 months ago but said it had made rapid advancements in the past month, increasing HJT cell conversion efficiency from 26.74% to a peak of 26.81%.
The company said the performance enhancement was due to a focus on R&D investment but did not provide any further details.
“Improving efficiency and reducing LCOE (levelised cost of electricity) is the eternal theme in the development of the PV industry,” Longi founder and President Li Zhenguo said. “Cell efficiency is the shining light of PV technology innovation, with every 0.01% improvement the result of enormous effort. Crystalline cells account for nearly 95% of the current market, so their ultimate efficiency illustrates the development potential and direction of the industry.”
The Chinese manufacturer also achieved an efficiency of 26.12% for a gallium-doped, p-type HJT cell based on an M6 wafer in September and a 26.5% rating for a n-type heterojunction cell in June. It also achieved a 25.19% rating for its p-type TOPCon solar cell in July 2021 while a month earlier it recorded a 25.21% efficiency rating for an n-type TOPCon device.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/21/roadmap-to-achieve-cigs-solar-modules-with-efficiencies-above-20/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 21, 2022",Roadmap to achieve CIGS solar modules with efficiencies above 20%,"Scientists from Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology have investigated the prospects for lightweight, flexible PV devices based on copper, indium, gallium and selenium (CIGS) thin-film technology.
The described their findings in “Lightweight and flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar minimodules: toward 20% photovoltaic efficiency and beyond,” which was recently published in Flexible Electronics. They said that their work was largely limited to panels that can be used on rooftops where severe weight restrictions are applied. However, they also used rooftops with curved surfaces and surfaces on which conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) panels cannot be used.
“Among thin-film photovoltaic technologies, CIGS-based solar cells are an attractive option owing to their advantages of relatively high energy conversion efficiency, long-term stability, relatively short energy payback time, and small carbon footprint of products,” the scientists said.
It will be crucial to improve the control of alkali metal doping on the CIGS film, in order to help the CIGS solar module technology reach an efficiency of over 20% at the module level. They said this depends on the alkali metal species and the doping methods and processes.
“In addition to alkali-metal doping, silver (Ag)- and sulfur (S)-alloying for the modification and control of the energy band structure in CIGS devices, improvement in the bulk crystal quality, and surface and back interface modification are the current topics of interest in the CIGS community,” the scientists explained, noting that these techniques could help to increase the average efficiency of CIGS flexible panels from around 18.5% at present to more than 20%.
The scientists said the suppression of carrier recombination at the interface and in the bulk of a CIGS cell is one of the factors that must be improved to obtain higher efficiency. They identified scribed edges of CIGS photoabsorbers as one of the possible causes leading to recombination issues.
“Nevertheless, to date, there have been only a few discussions on the effect of mechanically scribed edges on photovoltaic performance,” they said. “Therefore, in this section, the effect of mechanical scribing (MS), which has been used as a standard technique, on photovoltaic performance is comparatively studied with photolithographically formed edges.”
The review also investigates the variations in CIGS performance with light intensity and suggests the usefulness of CIGS photovoltaic devices under low illumination conditions.
“For further development, the improvement of CIGS single-cell performance is essential,” they concluded. “Approaches based on material science and device physics, including modification of surface and interface, and bulk crystal quality by alloying with Ag or S, or other elements as well as doping control of alkali metals, are expected to bring further progress in CIGS photovoltaics.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/11/21/iea-outlines-standardised-guidelines-for-solar-om/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"NOVEMBER 21, 2022",IEA outlines standardised guidelines for solar O&M,"The International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power System Programme (IEA-PVPS) has published new guidelines to help PV asset owners with operation and maintenance (O&M) for utility-scale PV plants in different climate zones.
In the “Guidelines for Operation and Maintenance of Photovoltaic Power Plants in Different Climates” report, the agency provides a series of climate-specific O&M programs for four climate zones – moderate, hot and dry, hot and humid, and deserts at high elevation areas. It also looked at extreme conditions such as floods, cyclones, and snow.
The paper defines O&M performance indicators and standard O&M operator services to create a clear framework.
“O&M contracts should take into account regional differences, such as national or local legislation that affects the availability of staff on-site, as well as variations in the capabilities of key stakeholders that affect project cost,” IEA-PVPS said.
The report also presents guidelines for monitoring and forecasting, as well as technical tools to analyse PV plant performance and safety.
“The scale and complexity of plants determine the level of monitoring: the larger and more complex the plant, the more intensive the monitoring,” IEA-PVPS said. “O&M operators need to be ready to comply with applicable grid codes and regulations, allowing for the re-evaluation of the scope of operations for contracts if grid codes change, especially in contexts where more RE plants replace thermal sources of power.”
The report also includes a description of different types of maintenance services and advanced inspections. IEA-PVPS offers a series of recommendations for climate–specific O&M.
“Preventive maintenance (PM) action plans that exclude redundant activities can bring costs down,” they emphasised. “The preventive maintenance plan should seek to optimise the overall PV plant and O&M budgeting, depending on the plant’s size, design, complexity, and environment.”
The report concludes by warning that maintenance is required, even though PV plants require much less maintenance than other types of power generation assets.
“A combination of well–designed O&M specifications, proactive monitoring systems and a flexible and tailored O&M regime that considers both possible weather impacts on systems as well as possible changes to grid requirements are good practices to ensure that PV systems perform according to or even beyond expected lifespans,” the researchers said. “Reducing risks by ensuring that personnel are trained and equipped for O&M operations, as well as employing PV forecasting to reduce possible downtimes, also contribute to maintaining PV plant performance according to specifications.”
