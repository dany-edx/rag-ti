The draft rule change — Access, pricing and incentive arrangements for distributed energy resources — aims to facilitate more distributed rooftop solar to be connected to and participate in the National Electricity Market (NEM) by incentivising network distribution service providers (DNSPs) to improve network capacity and control mechanisms needed to manage a high distributed-energy environment. It recognises the need for a dual distribution highway that efficiently transports electrons between customers and the network, and acknowledges that this has become a service provided to rooftop solar owners by the distribution networks.
More than 40 industry submissions to the proposal were received by the AEMC on or near its closing date of 27th May, along with more than 100 submissions from individuals. 
They were published last week, and dipping randomly into their arguments provides many insights into how the proposed rule changes could be improved and the potential for unintended consequences of the changes as they stand.
One of the components of the rule changes is that it would give network service providers the option to develop two-way pricing that rewards owners of distributed energy resources for exporting power to the grid when extra energy is needed, and charging them a fee for exporting at times when the system is already well served.
This change in particular has been widely labeled a “solar tax”. The possibility of such a levy is raised by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) as part of its submission.
The CEC argues, not necessarily against such charges, but against the uncertainty that it would generate if, according to regulated process, the details of the charges were not decided on and released until the next round of Tariff Structure Statements (TSSs).
TSSs are the proposals and justifications submitted to the Australian Energy Regulator by each DNSP in the NEM, to set their tariffs for providing network services in the coming years. The next round is due to take place at different times in each state, between 2024 and 2026.
The CEC says in this respect the AEMC’s Draft Determination leaves solar customers and suppliers in three to five years of limbo.
Without knowing when and to whom, and under what conditions the charges will apply, “solar designers and retailers would be unable to provide customers with a reliable estimate of the likely return on investment (ROI) of DER investments, and how the ROI might be affected by sizing of the solar array and energy storage system”. 
This could put the brakes on confidence in rooftop PV as an investment.
Other industry players, such as Professor Bruce Mountain, Director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, and a vocal critic of the rule change, argued to pv magazine in print last month that, “Connecting solar to the grid costs two-thirds of nothing … There is no cost rationale” for imposing a tariff.
Taking another tack, in a submission made jointly with Ellen Roberts of Solar Citizens, Dan Cass of The Australia Institute, John Grimes of the Smart Energy Council, and others, Mountain argues that DNSPs must provide transparent reporting on “voltage issues, hosting capacity, network congestion and the impact of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) and other DER integration trials”, before limits are set on solar exports, or export tariffs are applied.
Also in favour of getting the tariff ducks in a row, is one of the arguments made by Solar Analytics (which develops and supplies intelligent rooftop solar and energy management solutions for households and businesses). That is: “the draft rule should include a requirement for tangible incentive arrangements” for DNSPs to provide improved services to solar owners, “prior to the imposition of any positive export charges”.
An individual submission from Simone Fox simply says, “I do not support the proposal to charge households with rooftop solar to export to the grid. It is not as if we have a choice as to who we are connected to. The suppliers are monopolies …”
Another individual, Peter Barnes, writes that Australians “have been encouraged to spend a lot of our money on rooftop solar to export to a grid operator at a rate of 30% of what the operator charges their customers .. financial responsibility for the grid rests with the industry and government — not the consumer… I am one of many thousands of people in Australia that are very angry about this proposal and I call on the industry to establish community grid scale batteries to absorb the excess supply”.
Passion, sometimes pragmatism and a great deal of expertise have gone into the formulting the draft changes and into submissions which the AEMC will consider in preparation for a final determination on the rule change in July.

pv magazine Australia: How did SA Power Networks become involved in this AEMC rule change?
Bryn Williams: The context was that back in 2019 the Australian Renewable Energy Agency sponsored a review process that brought together a whole bunch of stakeholders from across different parts of the electricity sector, to think about concerns that were emerging around distribution networks — poles and wires companies like us — and our ability to support the continued uptake of rooftop solar. The issue being that we’re governed by regulation, and the rules are very prescriptive about what we can and cannot do, particularly what we can and cannot spend money on. For example, the rules today don’t recognise that enabling energy to be exported into the network is part of the service that the regulated poles and wires companies now provide — they predate rooftop PV uptake.
That means that all the requirements that the rules placed upon us to make sure that the network has enough capacity to do the things customers want to do, don’t apply to solar customers feeding in. We have no obligations, there are no service levels that we have to meet, etc. And in fact, the rules almost mandate the reverse: there are clear obligations to keep prices down as much as possible and spend as little as we can on the network because that’s good for customers. Put those two things together and you find that there are technical limits to how much solar you can connect in an area of the network before you start running into problems. Until now we’ve kind of been filling up the existing capacity and everything’s been fine. We’re now in a situation in some places, like South Australia, where we’re starting to reach those limits.
So we’ve got choices to make: we have to spend money to upgrade the network, to add more capacity or we have to stop anymore solar energy feeding in. And as they stand, the rules are pretty clear on that. They don’t give us a mandate to spend money to upgrade the network for that purpose, but they do require us to keep the network working properly while spending as little as possible. So you’re starting to see, in areas where there’s already lots of rooftop solar, new customers who want to connect being told by their network provider: “I’m sorry your area is full. You can only connect your solar if you don’t feed any energy into the grid; you have to set your system to zero export.” That’s the broad issue that this review was grappling with, what do we do about that, because clearly that’s not what customers want. 
And the other issue was around the fairness of spreading costs incurred by upgrading for more solar connection across all customers, including non-solar owners, is that right?
Yes, the review also grappled with that issue, raised by vulnerable-customer advocates, such as ACOSS and St Vincent de Paul. That is, If we decide that we do want to start spending money to upgrade so that more solar customers can connect and feed in their energy, who pays for that? Does it get passed on to all the other customers who don’t have solar, which is how networks recover their costs today, and is that fair? 
As a result of that review process, three of the parties involved in that review — ourselves as a distribution network, St Vincent Paul and ACOSS/TEC that’s a joint proposal from advocacy group ACOSS (the Australian Council of Social Services) and Total Environment Centre advocacy groups. Each of us wrote up a rule change proposal and submitted it to the AEMC reflecting our views arising from this review process as to what needed to be done and we were very closely aligned, varying only slightly according to our different perspectives.
The common view was that we do need to change the rules to now recognise that networks do provide a service to solar customers, to let them feed energy into the network — that is something that should be recognised as part of the role of a network. And simply by making that definitional change in the rules, that brings to bear all the other requirements and obligations on us as a regulated entity,  to make sure the network is fit for that purpose and has enough capacity. 
So that basically gives us the mandate as distribution network businesses to go to the regulator with proposals to spend money to upgrade the network to enable more solar which is something that we couldn’t do before. 
The other side of the coin arising from the issues or concerns raised by ACOSS and others about who pays for that is the rule change goes to that issue as well. So it says, to the extent that networks are spending money to upgrade the network, purely for the purpose of enabling solar customers to feed in more energy, those particular costs then should be recovered from the customers that are using that service, the solar customers. They shouldn’t be passed on to other customers who can’t get any benefit from them because they don’t have solar. And that’s the pricing part. So the rule change is about access and pricing: access to feed energy into the network and how the cost of the investments required to enable that are recovered through pricing. 
There’s a very specific thing in the rules today that says network tariffs cannot be applied to energy fed into the grid; they can only be applied to energy consumed from the grid. The rule change proposes to delete that prohibition, so that in the future, we can consider pricing arrangements that pass on the component of our costs associated with enabling more energy to be fed in, to the people who are using that, separate to charging for simply maintaining the network etc which will continue to be recovered through the normal charges on energy consumed from the grid.
That seems logical. But are DNSPs considering imposing a flat fee? 
The rules are very specific about the process we  have to go through to create new tariffs. We can only do it every five years, as part of our five-year regulatory determination. We go through what’s called the Tariff Structure Statement process where we have to engage with customers and governments and the regulator if we want to propose changes. We can only create new tariff structures if everyone agrees. The rule change doesn’t, as has been suggested, whack $100 on people’s new tariffs. It simply changes a few of the parameters and regulations, so that the next time distribution networks go through that five-year cycle which for us is 2025, we will then go through it in the context of these changes to the rules. So we will be able to propose to spend money to enable more solar, which we couldn’t do before. And we will be able to propose tariffs to recover that expenditure from solar customers, which we couldn’t do before. 
Neither of these proposals, if they are deemed appropriate by the networks, will come to pass, if the regulator doesn’t like what we propose, or our customers don’t support it, because that’s the way we’re governed as a regulated entity.
What’s the alternative to paying a fee for access?
The alternative is, you may not get to feed energy into the network because there isn’t enough network capacity for you to connect, which is already happening in some places.
People also perceive that you will invest in poles and wires to support greater solar export from rooftops, but that’s not necessarily what you’re proposing is it? Poles and wires are not the only technology.
 Speaking just as SA Power Networks, but it’s similar to the views of other network businesses, we’ve got a public goal to double the amount of solar that we can accommodate on the network by 2025. Based on current forecasts, that’s what customers want and we’ll bring to bear a whole bunch of different approaches to try to achieve that in the most efficient way we can. Flexible Exports is a key part of that, which involves moving from fixed export limits to dynamic ones. And we put a lot of effort into building the case to invest in that capability in South Australia. It was in our last regulatory proposal, and was widely supported as the right technical solution; it’s now accepted across the industry as the way we should be going. 
Having flexible export limits means you can get a lot more out of the poles and wires you’ve already got because customers don’t just have to be set to the worst possible case of system overload all the time. When we say the network is running out of capacity in different areas, it’s generally only at certain times in the middle of the day in spring that we have problems if you export above one kilowatt or something. That shouldn’t mean that the rest of the time you can’t export more than one kilowatt. But if all we’ve got is a fixed limit that’s hard coded in your device then the best we can do is say it’s got to be one kilowatt. Shifting to a dynamic limit, means that all the rest of the time, the limit can be higher and customers can export much more energy. In fact we’re saying that under the Flexible Exports scheme we can raise the limit from five kilowatts to up to 10 kilowatts for customer exports. So only at specific times, in those specific locations where we’ve got constraints, will we have to reduce the level, and that will happen automatically. 
That’s a key part of the solution. It doesn’t add any new capacity to the network, it just means you can get a lot more out of what you’ve got, which will get us so far, and then over time we can deploy other strategies to add more capacity if this rule change is successful, and we’re allowed to invest in adding more capacity,
What kinds of changes would you make in terms of adding more capacity?
SA Power Networks has already done something in this regulatory period, because we were able to take advantage of an upgrade program that we had to do to our substations anyway.  We’ve just completed a $10 million program, upgrading the voltage regulation capability of 140 of our major substations, which has significantly improved the way those substations can control voltage on the network. And that’s because voltage rise in the middle of the day is the first thing that goes wrong if you’ve got too much solar in a local area. The upgrade has been really helpful and we’re already seeing the effects of that in a significant reduction in the number of customer inquiries we’re getting for high voltage issues in solar-rich areas. 
As we go into our next regulatory proposal for the 2025-plus period we’ll be proposing additional measures like that. They could just be replacing a transformer with a bigger one, because the existing transformer is just too small to collect the amount of solar energy that’s now flowing through it. So it could be those sorts of traditional network upgrades. It could be engaging virtual power plants or solar owners, or customers themselves to provide services to us. We’re working with the virtual power plants in South Australia to explore those sorts of services at the moment.
A lot of people say the possible solar-export charge is just a money grab on the part of networks …
Something fundamentally important to know is that we are a regulated, private business. We have a very specific role, which is to look after the poles and wires from the substation down to the customer. We’re fully regulated which means that we operate under a revenue cap that is set by the Australian Energy Regulator every five years. So our revenues are basically locked in for five years at a time. Our tariffs are a component of the electricity bill and are calculated so that, added up, they recover that fixed amount of revenue that the AER has approved for us. What this means is we cannot possibly lose money as a business, if for example customers consume less from the grid because they have installed rooftop solar. Our revenues are fixed. If customers consume less than we thought they would, because they’re putting a lot more solar into their neighbourhood than anticipated, that is translated as an adjustment to our tariffs in the next year to push them up so that we still recover the same amount of revenue. That’s the way our regulation works. 
Similarly, if everyone goes out and buys an EV and everyone starts consuming a lot more energy from the grid, retailers and generators are going to make more money out of that because they make money from selling energy. But distribution networks don’t. Our revenues are fixed by the regulator, and our prices actually go down if the unit volume goes up.
There’s this very common narrative that we are threatened as a business by solar, because we are energy companies, so surely it’s bad for us if customers are making their own energy. That might be true if you’re running a coal-fired generator; it’s absolutely not true if you’re a distribution network which is the sector this rule change is targeting. 
In fact there’s no question that the transition to distributed energy and rooftop solar is unequivocally a very good thing for us as businesses, because it means that much more of the energy system is now concentrated in our network. 
Where are you up to with the Flexible Exports trial?
We’re working away with our partners, putting in place the technical components of that system, which is on track. So we are looking to open up that trial in July or August of this year. The field trial will involve around about 300 customers, and we’ll target a couple of specific areas in our network where we’ve got lots and lots of solar PV, where if we didn’t do this, we would be facing the prospect of having to put new customers onto lower export limits or zero elements. We’ll be opening up this dynamic export option for customers in those areas, so that  they have a choice. They don’t have to go onto a fixed limit; they can go onto this flexible export limit. That field trial is starting in the middle of this year, and that will run for 12 months, and our intention is, that at the end of that process we should be in a position to move this to being the standard service offer for new solar connections for South Australia.

Morrison also met with Japan’s Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga off the official agenda on Sunday and announced “a partnership on decarbonisation through technology”, which focuses on development and commercialisation of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, lower-emissions liquefied natural gas production, clean-fuel ammonia and again, green hydrogen.
Suga and Morrison’s joint statement described a technology-led response to climate change as critical to creating jobs and boosting economic growth, but while the statement reaffirmed Japan’s “commitment to transition to net zero emissions by 2050”, Australia reaffirmed its “commitment to achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible, preferably by 2050”.
In May, Germany brought its pursuit of a net-zero-emissions economy forward, strengthening interim annual targets and declaring a revised deadline of 2045. A statement announcing the German-Australian JDOI said that the demand for emission-free energy would be even greater than Germany’s leaders had previously envisaged.
Entities related to the German Fraunhofer Institute, including the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, this month published a joint study which predicted that German demand for green hydrogen will boom to 80 TWh around 2030, to between 100 and 300 TWh in 2040, and reach some 800 TWh in 2050.
The study identified that the greatest growth sector of demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthesis products (such as fuel-gas mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) will be industry — with up to 500 TWh of energy required for this German economic powerhouse sector by 2050.
“We are in the midst of an unparalleled revolution to decarbonise our industries,” confirmed Christoph von Spesshardt, Executive Director of the German-Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, yesterday. He added, “This joint declaration is building on an already established partnership between our two like-minded countries and will enable the decarbonisation of German and European industries.”
The JDOI provides some added certainty of opportunity for investors in the development of clean hydrogen technology in Australia, where major new hydrogen ventures and commitments are announced at least weekly.
In May, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) committed more than $100 million to supporting construction of three large-scale renewable hydrogen plants; east-coast-focused clean energy company Pure Hydrogen is putting all the requirements in place to build the first of four large-scale green hydrogen plants, Project Jupiter, at the port of Gladstone; Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO has committed $68 million to a “Hydrogen Industry Mission” dedicated to driving the cost of local green hydrogen below $2 per kilogram and establish the country as a leader in the global hydrogen economy by 2030; and Queensland electricity generator Stanwell this month partnered with Japan’s Iwatani Corporation and secured 236 hectares of land west of Gladstone to build a 3 GW hydrogen electrolysis plant. 
“We know countries like Japan are looking to the Sunshine State to meet their emissions targets, and in the next decade, Queensland must be ready to capitalise,” Queensland’s Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Minister, Mick de Brenni, said last week.
Having signed, the JDOI yesterday morning, Morrison told those assembled, that Australia’s “ambition is to produce the cheapest clean hydrogen in the world, which will transform transport, mining, resources and manufacturing at home and overseas”.
But already other global emissions-reduction initiatives are threatening the competitiveness of Australia’s products on the world market.
On Friday, in advance of the G7 Plus meeting, the Australia Institute Climate & Energy Program published new analysis which shows that the introduction of carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), which is also on the agenda for the gathering of leaders in Cornwall, “will put Australian industry and manufacturing processes — mainly steel, aluminium and alumina — at risk if Australia continues its recalcitrant role on the global stage”.
Scott Morrison had indicated he would warn world leaders against the use of carbon tariffs, on the basis that he considers carbon border adjustment mechanisms to be “protectionist”.
CBAMs are levies imposed on emissions-intensive imports by countries that themselves implement carbon pricing. The Australia Institute posits that an EU-proposed CBAM, which was to debut at the G7, is “not a tariff, and unlikely to be considered protectionist, as it is designed to comply with World Trade Organisation rules”.
This leaves Australia exposed to widespread implementation of CBAMs by countries that are concertedly steering their economies toward zero emissions by 2050 — it’s natural that as they invest in transitioning their industries to low-carbon processes, they will have no desire to support uncommitted freeloaders.
Australia remains one of only a few high-income countries that haven’t implemented or plan to implement a carbon price, but whose economies rely on the trading of energy-intensive products that will soon be taxed by more forward-thinking and future-invested countries.
Primary metals manufacturing industries are most exposed, says the Australia Institute, which points out that the emissions-intensive alumina and aluminium industries alone produce $12 billion per annum in export revenues for Australia.
Economist Nicky Hutley, a spokesperson for the Australian Climate Council, added to the chorus urging more decisive Australian climate action on Friday, “By refusing to set net-zero targets, raise our Paris targets, or stop wasting taxpayer money on fossil fuels, the Australian government is leaving industries like manufacturing, energy and agriculture exposed to costly tariffs … and missing an opportunity to create 250,000 new jobs in the clean economy.”
On the positive side, “Carbon border adjustments in destination markets will assist Australia to develop new zero-emission export industries,” says international climate-policy expert Frank Muller, lead author of the Australia Institute report.          
It’s in Australia’s interests to “engage constructively in the design of CBAMs and invest in clean production methods” for products such as steel and bauxite-to-aluminium processes which are currently heavily reliant on coal or gas for production, says the report.
The conclusions of the Australia Institute report authors — “Australia’s natural endowments and human resources position it better than most countries to prosper in a low-carbon world,” says Muller — echo the sentiments of the German-Australian Chamber, which supported negotiations toward the signing of yesterday’s JDOI:
“Australia, with its vast assets of renewable energy, is in a prime position to satisfy significant parts” of German industry’s burgeoning demand for green hydrogen.
It follows that it has the wherewithal to lead the development of green-metals and other products produced using renewable energy sources.
Riche Merzian, Climate & Energy Program Director at the Australia Institute put a warning twist on the Prime Minister’s prevailing narrative when he said in a statement accompanying the Institute’s report, “The Australian Government claims that its approach to climate is dictated by technology, not taxes. Make no mistake, if Australia continues to stonewall its trading partners and allies on climate, the taxes will come anyway” — the revenue will just be collected outside Australia.
A hydrogen agreement here, a $600 million gas plant there — such disparate approaches show Australia to be directionless and profligate in its attitude to climate change.

World leaders including Prime Minister Scott Morrison are gathered in the UK this weekend for the G7 summit. In a speech on Wednesday ahead of the meeting, Morrison said Australia recognises the need to reach net-zero emissions in order to tackle climate change, and expects to achieve the goal by 2050.
So has Australia started the journey towards deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions?
In the electricity supply system, the answer is yes, as renewables form an ever-greater share of the electricity mix. But elsewhere in the energy sector – in transport, industry and buildings – there has been little or no progress.
This situation needs to change. These other parts of the energy system contribute nearly 40% of all national greenhouse gas emissions – and the share is growing. In a new working paper out today, we propose a way to track the low-carbon transition across the energy sector and check progress over the last decade.
The energy sector can be separated into three major types of energy use in Australia:
In 2018-19, energy sector emissions accounted for 72% of Australia’s national total. Transition from fossil fuels to zero-emissions sources is at the heart of any strategy to cut emissions deeply.
The transition is already happening in electricity generation, as wind and solar supplies increase and coal-fired power stations close or operate less.
But in stark contrast, elsewhere in the sector there is no evidence of a meaningful low-emissions transition or acceleration in energy efficiency improvement.
This matters greatly because in 2019, these other segments contributed 53% of total energy combustion emissions and 38% of national greenhouse gas emissions. Total energy sector emissions increased between 2005 (the reference year for Australia’s Paris target) and 2019.
As the below graphic shows, while the renewables transition often gets the credit for Australia’s emissions reductions, falls since 2005 are largely down to changes in land use and forestry.

Let’s take a closer look at the areas where Australia could do far better in future.
Transport includes road and rail transport, domestic aviation and coastal shipping. Mobile equipment includes machinery such as excavators and dump trucks used in mining, as well as tractors, bulldozers and other equipment used in farming and construction. Petroleum supplies almost 99% of the energy consumed by these machines.
Road transport is responsible for more than two-thirds of all the energy consumed by transport and mobile equipment.
What’s more, prior to COVID, energy use by transport and mobile equipment was steadily growing – as were emissions. The absence of fuel efficiency standards in Australia, and a trend towards larger cars, has contributed to the problem.
Electric vehicles offer great hope for cutting emissions from the transport sector. As Australia’s electricity grid continues to decarbonise, emissions associated with electric vehicles charged from the grid will keep falling.
Emissions from all other parts of the energy system arise mainly from burning:
Emissions from these sources, as a share of national emissions, rose from 13% in 2005 to 19% in 2019.
These types of emissions can be reduced through electrification – that is, using low- or zero-carbon electricity in industry and buildings. This might include using induction cooktops, and electric heat pumps to heat buildings and water.
However the data offer no evidence of such a shift. Fossil fuel use in this segment has declined, but mainly due to less manufacturing activity rather than cleaner energy supply.
And in 2018 and 2019, the expanding LNG industry drove further emissions growth, offsetting the decline in use of gas and coal in manufacturing.

Over the past decade or so, Australia’s emissions reduction policies – such as they are – have focused on an increasingly narrow range of emission sources and reduction opportunities, in particular electricity generation.
Only now are electric vehicles beginning to be taken seriously, while energy efficiency – a huge opportunity to cut emissions and costs – is typically ignored.
Our paper proposes a large set of new indicators, designed to show what’s happening (and not happening) across the energy sector.
The indicators fall into four groups:
Our datasets excludes the effects of 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns. They’re based on data contained in established government publications: The Australian Energy Statistics, the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory and the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ national accounts and population estimates.
By systematically tracking and analysing these indicators, and combining them with others, Australia’s energy transition can be monitored on an ongoing basis. This would complement the great level of detail already available for electricity generation. It would also create better public understanding and focus policy attention on areas that need it.
In some countries, government agencies monitor the energy transition in great detail. In some cases, such as Germany, independent experts also conduct systematic and substantial analysis as part of an annual process.
Australia has begun the journey to a zero-emissions energy sector. But we must get a move-on in transport, industry and buildings.
The technical opportunities are there. What’s now needed is government regulation and policy to encourage investment in zero-emissions technologies for both supplying and using all forms of energy.
And once available, the technology should be deployed now and in coming years, not in the distant future.

Flow batteries present an attractive alternative to lithium-ion in stationary storage, offering longer lifetimes and lower degradation. Since the batteries aren’t suitable for electric vehicles or consumer electronics, the market size is much smaller than lithium-ion. Flow batteries, however, are gaining market share in stationary storage projects designed to support regional grids and boost consumption of renewables generated power.
To date, most of these projects have relied on vanadium or zinc-bromine flow batteries. There is, however, a wealth of other materials with the potential to be used in flow batteries, and scientists are hard at work narrowing down those that offer the best potential for the highest performance, the lowest cost and the least environmental damage.
Manganese is a relatively cheap and abundant element, already to set to play an increasing role in lithium-ion batteries amid growing concerns over the supply chain and toxicity of cobalt and nickel. A group of scientists led by Germany’s University of Freiburg decided to investigate manganese for flow batteries, achieving some impressive results.
The group fabricated all-manganese flow batteries in a variety of configurations with different electrode materials, solvents and membranes. The best of these demonstrated an energy density of 74 watt-hours per liter and a cell voltage of 2.59 V. “Although further optimisations are necessary,” the group states, “this system represents a new and promising setup toward sustainable energy storage.”
The batteries are described in the paper Investigations toward a Non-aqueous Hybrid Redox-Flow Battery with a Manganese-based Anolyte and Catholyte, published in Advanced Energy Materials. The group notes that its ‘first try’ with manganese already exceeds the energy density of commercial vanadium redox-flow batteries, which have several decades of research behind them.
The promising performance comes with several caveats. In observing the batteries the group noted issues including high over-potential for manganese deposition, leaching toward the negative electrode, capacity fade and low energy efficiency, as well as what they describe as “cauliflower like” deposition, leading to the formation of an unstable manganese film. They also note that the battery’s area specific resistance would have to be dramatically reduced to develop a commercially viable battery.
With further investigation into different materials combinations, additives, and pre-treatments the group expects most of these challenges to be overcome, and states that performance should improve alongside this, with the tweaking of various parameters in the battery design.
“Compared to the benchmark vanadium redox flow battery system, the all-manganese flow battery has a higher energy density and is based on the cheap and abundant element manganese,” the researchers conclude. “Additionally, there is still a lot of room for improvements, making the all-MFB presented in this work an interesting field for further research.”

French environmental services provider Veolia is leading a research project which is aimed at developing a highly efficient and special process for the recycling of solar modules.
Through the ReProSolar initiative, which the EU is funding with €4.8 million (AU$7.5 million) through the EIT Raw Materials pot, the company and its partners from the public and private sectors who operate along the value chain of recycling solar modules are seeking, for the first time, to recover all components of a solar panel at the end of its life cycle.
The consortium hopes to develop a process that allows recovery of pure silicon, silver and glass and makes them be made usable, again, for industrial sectors of different kinds.
Funding for the project began in February and runs until January 2025. The feasibility of the process on an industrial scale will be tested by the partner companies Flaxres, operating in Dresden, Germany; and Rosi Solar – headquartered in Grenoble, France – by the end of the year.
According to Veolia, around 5,000 tons of solar modules will be processed in a demonstration plant, annually, by 2023. “Our process is based on a new delamination technology that is able to efficiently separate the solar cells from the glass plate,” explained project manager Antoine Driancourt, of Veolia Umweltservice GmbH. “Innovative physical-chemical processes will then enable all materials to be recovered without the photovoltaic modules having to be shredded.”
According to the French company, no industrial process in the world is able, to date, to recover silver and silicon with very high purity from solar cells. “This would be a major breakthrough for the entire solar industry in terms of current recycling standards,” said Driancourt. With the project partners, Veolia will map the entire value chain, from processing and raw material cleaning to the waste stream supply chain and reintegration into various industries.
