Inertia, historically provided by traditional synchronous generators such as coal-fired power plants, is necessary to maintain a consistent frequency and help the power system ride out any disturbances.
But with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) forecasting that 60% of coal-fired generating capacity will exit the National Electricity Market (NEM) by 2030, and more intermittent renewable generation connecting, alternative ways to provide and measure inertia are needed to maintain a secure and reliable grid.
The market operator currently estimates levels of inertia using a variety of techniques, including power system simulations and by measuring empirical data after system disturbances.
Reactive Chief Executive Officer Marc Borrett said moving from estimates to real-time measurements will boost visibility of inertia across the system and enable operators to predict and plan for guaranteed sources of inertia to keep the grid stable as they add renewables and distributed energy resources.
“We are eager to show how powerful our technology is when it comes to facilitating a swift and smooth transition to net-zero carbon grids without sacrificing reliability or resilience,” he said.
“Australia is one of many countries around the world that is taking admirable steps toward accelerating their energy transition and have rightly identified measurement of inertia as a crucial component of that transition.”

The $3.07 million (USD 2.07 million) trial, supported with $1.43 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), will be based in Victoria and will test and target a range of operating conditions including high solar generation, and high and low demand.
Reactive will deploy its Grid-Sonar technology, which will measure system inertia by injecting power pulses using Neoen’s 300 MW/450 MWh Victorian Big Battery to create small frequency deviations.
These deviations will be measured using units specifically designed to collect frequency and voltage data and installed at 15 strategically located sites on the grid. Reactive’s GridMetrix software suite will then collect the data and calculate the grid’s system inertia. AEMO will then be able to view the inertia values in real time via Reactive’s cloud-based platform.
The trial, which is scheduled to continue through to Q1 2024, is the first real-time, accurate measurement of inertia in the NEM and ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said he expects the technology will help AEMO to manage the power system, reduce the occurrence of inertia shortfalls, and improve overall system security.
“Continuous measurement of inertia will become highly valuable as it will allow less conservative grid operation and ultimately the ability to accommodate more non-synchronous generation such as solar and wind,” he said.
“Reactive Technologies’ measurement tools could change the way the NEM is managed. With real-time data available to AEMO, they could also then optimise customer-side generation which has been proven to contribute as much as 30% of total inertia to the National Grid in the United Kingdom.”
The trial project has received funding from Victoria’s Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) which is also providing the sites for the measurement equipment. The University of Melbourne’s Melbourne Energy Institute will also provide support.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/21/record-solar-helps-send-wholesale-power-prices-down/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 21, 2023",Record solar helps send wholesale power prices down,"A new report from the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) highlights that both large-scale solar and rooftop PV generation reached record highs in the January to March quarter, helping push down the cost of power across the National Electricity Market (NEM).
“Across the NEM, large-scale solar output achieved an all-time quarterly record and was up 22% on a year earlier, accounting for 9% of the total generation mix in the quarter,” the AER says in its latest Wholesale Markets Quarterly Report. “Rooftop solar output also hit a new record.”
The AER said the increase in both large-scale and rooftop solar output contributed to downward pressure on prices across the market with average quarterly prices ranging from $64 per MWh (USD 43/MWh) in Victoria to $114/MWh in Queensland.
Comparisons to prices at the same time last year vary by region with prices lower in Queensland but higher in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. They were about the same in Victoria.

The AER said lower average prices across most regions occurred despite an increase in demand while heatwave conditions experienced across several regions during the quarter produced several acute high-price events that resulted in average prices being higher than they otherwise would have been.
“These high-price events were concentrated in evening periods where solar output was relatively low,” the regulator said.
“This is consistent with a longer-term trend of deepening separation in market dynamics between periods of solar availability and unavailability which are directly associated with specific times of day.”

AER Chair Clare Savage said the report, which showed forward prices for electricity stabilised during the early part of 2023, is unlikely to impact the Default Market Offer (DMO) for the coming year.
“Despite an increase in March, (forward base futures prices) remain well below levels observed in 2022,” she said. “It also appears that the coal price cap interventions continue to place downward pressure on electricity prices, together with strong renewable output.”
“At this stage, the late quarter increase in base futures prices does not appear to be having an impact on likely DMO outcomes, but we will continue to monitor contract prices head of releasing our final DMO determination in May.”
The regulator’s DMO for 2023-24 will be released by May 26.

Transgrid and its construction partner SecureEnergy, which are building the 700km NSW section of the EnergyConnect project from Wagga Wagga to the SA border, with a connection to Red Cliffs in Victoria, said 850 cubic metres of concrete had been poured during an 11-hour operation earlier this week to form the foundations for two 120 MVA synchronous condensers which will sit at the heart of the new Buronga substation.
Transgrid said an additional 850 cubic metres of concrete is scheduled to be poured later this month to complete the foundations for the synchronous condensers which will provide system stability and circuit strength to the grid, playing a key role in moving Australia to cleaner renewable energy.
The substation, spread over a 16-hectare site at Buronga near Mildura in NSW’s southwest, will also house five phase-shifting transformers, three power transformers and four shunt reactors.
“The Buronga substation will be one of the largest and most sophisticated in the Southern Hemisphere and act as the main hub for the connection between the three states, Transgrid Project Director Stephen Troughton said.
The EnergyConnect project, a joint venture between Transgrid and South Australian network operator ElectraNet, will link Wagga Wagga to Robertstown in SA via Buronga, with an additional ‘spur’ link between Buronga and Red Cliffs in northwest Victoria.
Troughton said the high-voltage interconnector, which will provide 800 MW of nominal transfer capacity in both directions, will integrate renewables into the grid and “allow energy sharing between NSW, Victoria and South Australia for the first time.”

While Transgrid is powering ahead with the construction of the NSW section of the interconnector, ElectraNet said the largest transformers in SA’s high-voltage network are now being installed at the new Bundey substation, about 160km north of Adelaide.
ElectraNet said the 275 kV/330 kV transformers, supplied by South Korean manufacturer Hyosung Corportation, will play a critical role in stepping up the voltage to flow across this new energy highway within the National Energy Market.
The SA component of the EnergyConnect project will also include upgrades to existing substations at Robertstown and Tungkillo.

It is successfully coping alone with rapidly increasing levels of solar and wind and is finding it to be remarkably straightforward and cheap.
Currently, Australia procures 38% of the electricity in its National Electricity Market from renewables, mostly from solar and wind. The government target is 82% renewable electricity by 2030 (see figure below). Australia is finding the task of managing high levels of solar and wind to be easier and less expensive than many people anticipated.

The state of South Australia (population 1.7 million) is tracking toward 100% solar and wind in 2027 on an annual basis (see figure below). South Australia is relatively weakly connected to other states. Additional gigawatt-scale transmission is under construction, which will allow South Australia to export substantial amounts of solar and wind electricity to the eastern states.
Image: OpenNEM
The solar and wind fraction for the month of December 2022 was 85% (see figure below), with an average price on the spot market of $55 (USD 37)/MWh. The South Australian grid is highly stable and generally delivers lower electricity prices than other states. South Australia provides compelling evidence that solar photovoltaics and wind is cheaper than fossil gas generation.
Image: OpenNEM
Australia does not have any nuclear or geothermal generation and low capacity for hydroelectricity (about 6% of annual generation). Virtually all new generation capacity in Australia is solar and wind.
Energy storage is a solved problem. Australia has three existing pumped hydro energy storage systems. Two new systems are under construction (Snowy 2.0 and Kidston) that have more energy storage than all the utility batteries in the world put together.
Australia (population 26 million) has about 15 GW of pumped hydro that has been announced by the governments of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, with about 700 GWh of combined storage. None involve new dams on rivers. Multi-gigawatt-scale investment in batteries and thousands of additional kilometres of gigawatt-scale transmission is in progress.
Australia is demonstrating straightforward solutions to variability of solar and wind and offers an economically compelling model for rapid removal of fossil fuels from electricity generation.
Solar and wind comprise three-quarters of new global generation capacity (see figure below). This is compelling market-based evidence that they are the cheapest method of electricity generation. Coupled with the “electrification of everything,” they can do the heavy lifting to reach zero emissions before mid-century. Balancing techniques are off the shelf, comprising storage, transmission and demand management.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/21/feds-roll-out-funding-programs-aimed-at-accelerating-ev-uptake/,"EV,FINANCE,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"APRIL 21, 2023",Feds roll out funding programs aimed at accelerating EV uptake,"The Australian government has announced a suite of funding packages totalling more than $120 million as part of plans to improve the accessibility and affordability of electric vehicles (EVs) and build out charging infrastructure in a bid to facilitate and encourage the take up of EVs among Australian drivers.
Among the packages is a new $70 million round of grant funding aimed at fostering innovation in EV charging solutions and to help improve charging technology across Australia.
To be delivered through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the program comes one day after the government announced its National Electric Vehicle Strategy which outlines plans to get more zero-emission cars into the country.
ARENA said the funding, which aims to improve charging infrastructure and provide more Australians with access to charging facilities, will be available to businesses, local governments and councils, as well as state and territory owned corporations.
The $70 million funding pool is part of the $146.1 million Driving the Nation funding package that is to be delivered by ARENA over the next five years to co-fund projects to decarbonise road transport.
The federal government has also announced a new $40 million investment to support discounted loans for EVs.
Finance through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) will support a discount on green car loans offered by Australian non-bank lender Firstmac.
It is estimated the discounted loans, which will apply to EVs priced under $90,000, will save borrowers an average of $1,400 to $2,500, depending on the loan’s size and length. Firstmac will split the cost of the loan discount with the CEFC.

Origin Energy will also split the cost with the federal government for a $12.8 million program that will see the energy giant deliver 1,000 EVs and charging infrastructure to business customers nationally.
ARENA will provide almost $6.2 million in funding to Origin for the Accelerate EV Fleet Program which will see 1,000 EVs and charging infrastructure made available to the energy major’s business customers across Australia.
The program is designed to reduce the start-up costs for businesses as they look to transition their transport fleets.
ARENA Acting Chief Executive Officer Chris Faris said the program also offers an opportunity to scale up Australia’s emerging EV fleet leasing market.
“Origin’s program is ARENA’s largest to date targeting light vehicle fleets and we’re excited to see what lessons we’ll learn,” he said.
“Not only will we be putting 1,000 new electric vehicles on the road, but this program will create a blueprint for how EV fleet leasing models can operate. And those 1,000 fleet EVs will feed the second-hand market for EVs in the years ahead.”
The unveiling of the funding packages comes as Hobart-headquartered social enterprise the Good Car Company, which operates an EV marketplace as well as importing second-hand EV into Australia, called for a relaxation of import policies to improve access.
Good Car Company co-founder Anton Vikstrom said while the National Electric Vehicle Strategy is a move in the right direction, it is unlikely to create a massive increase in the number of EVs in Australia.
“Part of the answer to establishing a healthy electric vehicle industry in Australia and ensuring these sorts of vehicles are accessible to all is actually ensuring independent importation can occur with ease,” he said.
“Currently, access to a range of additional EV’s are restricted by a suite of protectionist legislative measures. The Good Car Company is advocating an easing of these restrictions for electric cars to improve access and affordability while providing consumer protectionism.”

Over the last eight months, since the passage of the IRA, more than USD 150 billion ($223b)of domestic utility-scale clean power investments have been announced, according to the American Clean Power Association.
This unprecedented level of investment exceeds the total investment in utility-scale clean power projects brought online in the last five years combined, from 2017 to 2021. More than 96 GW of utility-scale projects have been announced over the eight-month stretch, said the American Clean Power Association.
Solar is set to play a central role in decarbonising and onshoring US energy. By 2030, it is estimated that the IRA will drive the installation of 950 million solar panels, 120,000 wind turbines, and 2,300 grid-scale battery facilities. While the investments are a clear sign of the promising progress towards a decarbonised economy, the American Clean Power Association warns that more action needs to be taken to ensure that future.
“To realise this clean energy future and ensure the full potential of these projects, [the American Clean Power Association] urges the Administration and Congress to continue improving trade policies, supporting next-generation technologies, finalising effective tax implementation and working to enact commonsense permitting reform,” it said in a new report.
The American Clean Power Association said that in the eight-month period, 46 utility-scale clean energy manufacturing facilities were announced, bringing an expected 18,000 or more US jobs.
It said 26 of the 46 announced facilities are solar manufacturing sites, 10 are utility-scale battery storage factories, and 10 are wind power factories – two of which are for offshore wind technology development. The report contains a full roundup of each of the manufacturing sites, the expected jobs created, the expected online date, investment data, and other relevant information.
The largest single-site announcement has been a Hanwha Qcells facility, which will involve an investment of USD 2.5 billion ($3.7b) to expand the company’s manufacturing capacity in the United States. It is expected to create as many as 2,500 jobs in Georgia. The factory will cover several aspects of the solar supply chain, including polysilicon ingots, wafers, cells, and modules.
One battery facility of note is American Battery Factory’s site to manufacture lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells for residential and commercial energy storage. The site, which is expected to go online in the fourth quarter of 2024, would bring USD 3.1 billion ($4.6) of economic activity in its local county in Arizona.
