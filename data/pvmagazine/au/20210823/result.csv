No, not just any of the five ISP scenarios — a panoply of possibility that the market has been trying to reckon with since the ISP began in 2018 — but the Step Change Scenario of the current 2020 ISP iteration, which the CEIG says aligns most closely with international commitments to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius.
“Investors are deploying funds into markets where they see an alignment with those broader global goals, and shifting away from markets that aren’t aligned because they are considered too risky,” Simon Corbell, CEO and Chair of the CEIG told pv magazine Australia.
The overarching risk he adds is that while capital gravitates toward the certainty of countries with clear policies toward net zero, “Australia is not seeing enough committed projects moving forward; although there will continue to be investment in Australia’s renewable projects, it will be slower, and more expensive than it should be”.
Investors, says Corbell, “want to highlight to decision makers that there is a significant cost premium on Australian projects in the market at the moment — it’s between 100 and 200 basis points above other OECD markets”.
The CEIG commissioned Rennie Partners to assess the risks and define the principles that could guide Australian governments to meet their net-zero commitments, attracting the necessary capital at the lowest cost.
The group identified $70 billion worth of commitment required by the end of the 2030s. “We could reduce that by $7 billion if we had a cheaper cost of equity, and we’re only going to get that if we have a more investor-friendly approach to market design,” says Corbell.
CEIG members in consultation with Rennie Partners formulated 5 Clean Energy Investor Principles designed to support the undeniable attraction of Australia’s renewable resource and the country’s need to replace ageing fossil fuel plants with clean electricity generation:
Adopting the ISP’s Step Change Scenario — which is characterised by accelerated global ambitions to limit atmospheric warming, consumer-led change with a focus on energy efficiency assisted by technology, switching to clean fuels in transportation, private vehicles and domestic cooking and heating, and growth in carbon sequestration, particularly in the land-use sector — is the easy part.
One would assume that recent revisions of regulations by entities such as the Energy Security Board and the Australian Energy Market Commission have constantly been striving to create an environment conducive to expansion of and investment in clean energy generation.
But reforms recently presented to parliament by the Energy Security Board include a proposal to pay ageing coal and gas power plants to maintain their “capacity” to generate electricity if required.
The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) in a joint report prepared with Green Energy Markets and released on Friday, found that reliability of the electricity system “is not at threat by the level of likely coal power plant exits over the next ten years,” said Johanna Bowyer, the report co-author and IEEFA electricity analyst.
In fact, yesterday, Sunday 22 August, saw solar take over from coal for the first time, as the majority generator of electricity across the entire NEM, delivering 57% per cent of demand just after noon.
Nonetheless, Australia’s Federal Energy Minister, Angus Taylor, is backing the plan for an unnecessary $2.9 to $6.9 billion in payments to keep the fossil-fuel plants alive.
On behalf of renewable energy investors, Corbell describes the proposal as “unhelpful and unnecessary” saying it further clouds the investment environment.

“The key issue for investors,” he explains, “is being able to predict with a reasonable level of certainty their revenues over the life of a project. At the moment that’s very difficult to do and some of the proposals we’ve seen from the ESB further complicate that picture.”
Constantly changing marginal loss factors are deemed by the Rennie Partners’ analysis as one of the greatest risks for investors in renewable projects; their volatility makes it virtually impossible to calculate returns on investment. And the introduction of local marginal pricing of energy generation, that reflects energy losses in transmission, and congestion at different points in the grid is also too complicated a methodology to give investors confidence.
Corbell says, Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) development represents an alternative “locational investment signal that is very strongly welcomed by investors, because it’s about providing firm access to the grid in areas of resource rich development”.
Which raises the spectre of connection difficulties in the NEM, which are likely to be alleviated under the planning of REZs, but are expected to remain a challenge in the broader NEM.
“Additional information requirements earlier during the Connection Application phase, including forecasting information and GPS data, increases project complexity and timeframes leading to cost overruns, which also impacts the viability of future investments,” says the CEIG report.
The assertion is supported by last week’s PwC analysis, which found that the time taken for projects to achieve connection in the NEM has increased from the shortest recorded average period of 1.4 years in 2018, to 2.3 years in 2020.
AEMO’s launch of a new online simulator on Friday, to assist developers with modelling their grid connections, and thereby speed the process, is promising. Some 97 GW of large-scale generation projects — 33 GW of which are solar farms — are currently in the application pipeline, and may live to demonstrate the time-to-connection improvement.
So while electricity-market reforms are underway, only some are helpful from an investor perspective, and the Federal Government remains unwilling to commit to overall unifying policies.
Corbell says the Australian states and territories hold the key to coordinated NEM control: “The states have taken strong leadership in the development of the future NEM,” in terms of proactively setting up REZ development and transmission augmentation frameworks, but there is still what Corbell describes as “a degree of inertia in terms of whole-of-NEM governance”.
The CEIG proposes an antidote that could but need not include the Federal Government, in the form of a new intergovernmental agreement between the states, “with clear goals based on the ISP Step Change scenario for development of the NEM”, says Corbell 
These goals and the other four Clean Energy Investor Principles could set the framework for action that would “direct market bodies to implement the necessary rule changes to achieve a decarbonised NEM by the end of 2040” — at an almost $7 billion reduction in cost to taxpayers. That’s some incentive.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/23/solar-accelerated-carbon-dioxide-splitting-to-recycle-a-deadly-greenhouse-gas/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"AUGUST 23, 2021",Solar-accelerated carbon-dioxide splitting to recycle a deadly greenhouse gas,"Solar panels are now an accepted means of producing clean electricity, and Australia is revving along the roadmap to mass production of clean hydrogen using a two-step solar conversion process — photovoltaics followed by electrolysis. But this month, Swinburne University of Technology’s Associate Professor Tianyi Ma received an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship of more than $937,000 to pursue his work using solar energy directly in photocatalysis, to repurpose abundant carbon dioxide emitted during industrial processes into “solar” fuels such as green methane, methanol and carbon monoxide. 
The efficiencies of Ma’s technology are currently lower than photovoltaics which have been developed to achieve between 20% and 30% conversion of light into electricity. His work with new-generation carbon dioxide photoreduction catalysts — perovskite-based ferroelectrics — have so far achieved a solar-to-fuels efficiency of 2-5%, but that’s increasing. 
Importantly, the materials used are much cheaper than those used in solar panels, offering substantial savings on upfront capital investment and the technology shows potential for co-location with industry, to siphon off CO2 at the source and produce fuels that can replace high-emitting fossil fuels.
Yes, even these solar fuels when burned will release carbon into the atmosphere, but they go some way to achieving a low-cost circular economy for carbon — capturing what’s emitted, and producing replacements for new fossil fuel production.
“My goal is carbon neutrality,” the lead of the Carbon Neutrality Group at Swinburne University of Technology tells pv magazine Australia. Boom-boom!

For some years Ma was known for his work using grid-supplied electricity in a process known as electrocatalysis, for reducing CO2 into potentially reusable fuels. “The thing is,” he says, “that the majority of electricity in the grid still isn’t green, so I recently changed focus to photocatalysis, because I want to use pure renewable energy.”
Ma says his work is still “inspired” by electrocatalysis, in that he’s using an external power source to accelerate a catalytic reaction. But there’s no voltage in raw sunlight, so “if we can create a little bit of an electric field in the semiconductor catalyst…”
Ma identified a novel ferroelectric, crystalline material that doesn’t have a symmetric structure, “So it has a little bit of polarisation in the structure”, which translates into “an intrinsic and spontaneous electric field” that delivers high-performance photocatalysis.
His Future Fellowship comes under the ARC Discovery Scheme, which aims to promote Australia’s strong capability in fundamental, or ‘blue sky’ research, and to generate new ideas, new jobs, economic growth and enhanced quality of life in Australia, according to the literature.
Ma’s group will use the funding over four years, initially, he says “to generate some high quality papers, scientific breakthroughs and even patent some of the technologies”.
Because Swinburne focuses heavily on translation of research to industry, Ma’s project team is also already collaborating with GrapheneX, a pioneer in the field of synthesising high-value carbon nanomaterials, from low-cost carbon sources; and with the Clayton Hydrogen Technology Cluster (Clayton H2), one of 15 nationwide renewable energy platforms supported by National Energy Resources Australia.
“We’re working with GrapheneX to treat carbon-dioxide emissions from the biomass lignite [aka brown coal]-mining industry,” says Ma, “and I can foresee that towards the middle of the four-year fellowship, we could partly commercialise some of those technologies.”

In his six-months-new role at Swinburne, which appointed him Associate Professor at the university’s Centre for Translational Atomaterials, Ma has also already published a paper describing a photocatalytic process to produce hydrogen from seawater, using a novel single-atom platinum catalyst, that yielded solar-to-hydrogen quantum  efficiency of 22.2% under LED-550 illumination.
This is “among the best catalysts ever reported” for the solar-to-hydrogen process, said Baohua Jia, Founding Director of the Centre for Translational Atomaterials in February when the paper was released.
Compared to carbon-dioxide splitting, photocatalytic water splitting is a piece of cake, asserts Ma, but he was compelled to pursue CO2 splitting to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time produce chemicals that are useful.
The splitting of carbon dioxide, he says, can take more than six potential pathways. It can, for example, be catalysed to form carbon monoxide, formic acid, ethanol or methanol, of which the latter three are important chemical feedstocks.

“We’ve also been doing this photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide in an aqueous, or water, solution,” explains Ma, which generates a competing reaction. That is, the water will also take part in the reaction and split out into hydrogen and oxygen.
“So you can never get pure carbon monoxide this way, you always have a monoxide with a little bit of hydrogen, which is what we call syngas — one of the most widely used fuels for residential cooking — there’s a huge market for it.”
Ultimately, his project, as described for Future Fellowship consideration, is expected to “deliver highly efficient photocatalysts and reaction prototypes for carbon dioxide reduction, to relieve the greenhouse effect and accelerate the development of large-scale carbon dioxide utilisation for clean fuels production by making use of abundant and clean solar energy”; the catalysts and techniques “are highly promising for commercialisation and industry-level application”.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/23/novel-pv-module-recycling-tech-from-south-korea/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SOUTH KOREA",EMILIANO BELLINI,"AUGUST 23, 2021",Novel PV module recycling tech from South Korea,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) have developed a “non-destructive” solar module recycling technology that is claimed to be able to recover 100% of a module’s glass.
The novel technique can be applied to either damaged or undamaged panels and works in four steps: The automated dismantling of the frame and the junction box; glass separation; metal recovery; and solar cell recycling. “The core process is glass separation, with the glass recovery rate approaching 100%,” the scientists emphasised, noting that this was obtained by separating the interface between the glass and the module encapsulant.
The Korean group claims that the new technique, which was, so far, tested on an undefined series of 72-cell panels, reduces power consumption by a third compared to other recycling technology, thanks to process optimisation. The system is also said to allow the recovery of high-quality glass with an iron content of less than 200 parts per million, and of more than 65% of the components that make up a panel.
The scientists were also able to refine the silicon recovered from waste panels to make six-inch single crystal ingots and wafers. The wafers were used to manufacture a 20.05%, high-efficiency solar cell. “Recycling a ton of discarded photovoltaic modules means a reduction of 1.2 tons of greenhouse emissions,” said KIER researcher Jinseok Lee. “So this technique is crucial to achieving a net-zero economy.”
More technical details on the four processes were not disclosed.
The research project was supported by South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology. Korea-based provider of commercial heat treatment for metal and coating processing services, HST Co Ltd, has now been tasked to bring the technology to the market.

“Australia’s renewable energy supply is set to expand exponentially, and the ripples of change in today’s energy market will soon turn into waves,” says PwC Australia’s Danny Touma, one of the authors of the report, Renewable energy market gives developers and investors pause for thought, released on Friday.
The report’s title may make both sectors brace for the worst, but its salient points indicate an unstoppable king tide of change — and suggest how experienced developers can surf it.
It shows that while investment in renewables by oil and gas companies was just 2% of new projects over the calendar years 2017-18 calendar years; 2019-20 saw their engagement rise to 15%.
In addition, PwC research finds that large energy users, such as corporates and utilities are being driven by the need to ramp up their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials, to accelerate their move to renewable energy via power purchase agreements.
These two factors alone signal to investors that there’s a healthy appetite for green energy, as technological developments also drive down the cost of renewable energy generation, and energy storage is proving its value for time-shifting variable renewable generation.

The report cites the Clean Energy Council’s (CEC) recent tally that more than 100 large-scale solar and wind projects are either planned for construction or already have infrastructure sprouting from the fields. If all are carried through to fruition, they will add 10GW of renewable capacity to the National Electricity Market.
“The sector is ripe for partnerships between local developers who often find it challenging to access capital and negotiate regulatory hurdles to get projects off the ground, and corporates who are seeking to build their net-zero carbon credentials,” says Touma,PwC’s Integrated Infrastructure partner, who specialises in environmental transactions.
Among the emerging partnership trends, PwC identifies a move to earlier engagement on projects by developers seeking to secure access to capital.
“The good news,” says Touma, “is that investors are out there.” They’re also, unsurprisingly given recent well-publicised difficulties in bringing projects to successful commissioning and then uncurtailed operation, seeking greater influence over project development.
“Utilities, oil and gas companies, or infrastructure funds,” are determined to “avoid ‘cost of capital’ auctions at the ready-to-build stage, avoid expensive individual sale processes,” and are instead focused on “their need to decarbonise and manage a larger portfolio of renewables,” summarises a statement accompanying the report.
With strategic investors and independent power producers stepping into the fray, PwC finds that the number of projects by smaller boutique developers has decreased from 30% in 2017 to 22% last year. The big end of town, it seems, has the leverage and resources needed to manage changing risk factors.
For example, given greater state government involvement in energy policy and markets, PwC says there’s a growing need for investors to bring expertise in government relationships and lobbying to ensure positive outcomes.
The spectrum of stakeholders, from local communities and landholders to off-takers and networks, is also exerting greater influence and demanding to know more about project owners.
And grid congestion remains a preoccupying challenge: PwC quotes the CEC’s 2021 Clean Energy Outlook Confidence Index survey conclusions which include: “Investors have consistently rated the grid connection process as the top business challenge since July 2019.”
PwC also notes that, “One of the consequences of grid congestion has been the change to technical modelling requirements for generators to achieve an offer to connect. These changes have led to an increase in costs, and delay for developers to achieve financial close on their projects.”
Time to financial close has increased, says the ‘pause for thought’ report, from the shortest recorded average period of 1.4 years in 2018, to 2.3 years in 2020.

As a result, still keen investors frequently seek to engineer one of two partnership structures, in which they either purchase parts or all of a development company; or they purchase a specific pipeline of projects.
Despite the greater degree of control such structures offer investors, it’s still incumbent on the capital provider to respect the developer’s expertise, skills and methodology (otherwise why would you be investing in that company?); “be up front about how and when they expect to be involved in decision making”; be sure to validate the developer’s proposals; and understand the risk profile of the transaction. That is, any such deal “will likely include a range of projects, only some of which will reach financial close”, says PwC in its report.
For the developer’s part, the rules of engagement recommended by PwC include being prepared to articulate their core strengths and capabilities; identify where the input and expertise of a large investor can positively impact outcomes; and present realistic timescales and expectations for each project’s connection to the grid.
The upshot is that shareholders and a climate-concerned market are increasing the pressure on big players to demonstrate their commitment to the energy transition, and they’re bringing their clout, capital and expertise to bear on project development. 
In the ever evolving renewable-electricity landscape, this is unlikely to represent a final state — but perhaps a welcome learning bridge over troubled waters.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/08/23/us-customs-enforcement-is-jeopardising-2-1-gw-of-solar-projects/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,UNITED STATES,WORLD",DAVID WAGMAN,"AUGUST 23, 2021",US customs enforcement is jeopardising 2.1 GW of solar projects,"From pv magazine USA
Around 2.1 GW of solar projects representing a total investment of about US$2.2 billion (AU$3 billion) on a payroll of 3,000 construction workers is at risk as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforces action to stop the flow of goods that may have been produced using forced labour in China’s Xinjiang region.
Philip Shen, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners, offered those numbers and said that JinkoSolar has had 100 MW of modules detained by customs agents and that the company is “not able to ship from Malaysia to the U.S.”
In addition, Trina Solar had six next-generation test modules detained and Canadian Solar had four modules detained. The Canadian Solar modules may have been headed for the Solar Power International trade show in September in New Orleans.
pv magazine has learned independently that all three companies have had products detained by border agents. Both Trina Solar and Canadian Solar said the detentions directly involved their products.
In remarks given during a webinar hosted by Roth Capital, Elise Shibles, an attorney with Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said there was a “low likelihood” that any of the detained modules would be released. Affected importers have three months to prove that no forced labour was involved at any stage of the product’s production. But Customs and Border Patrol have set a “high bar” in terms of what documentation must be produced to secure the products’ release. She said that the documentation “is almost never enough” to satisfy release requirements.
The amount of detail that will need to be provided by companies that have product detained by border agents will require “unprecedented cooperation” from upstream suppliers, said Richard Mojica, a lawyer with the firm Miller & Chevalier.
The detentions all stem from a June 24 “Withhold Release Order” issued by the Customs and Border Protection against Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Withhold Release Order instructs personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to “immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products” made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries.
The CBP acted in response to what officials said were credible reports of forced labour being in the solar supply chain in the Xinjiang region of China. Reports have surfaced in recent days that shipments are being detained in what many believe to be the first stage of long-term enforcement action.
As CBP gathers more information, it could target other manufacturers and detain more imports. The action is creating “tension” within the Biden administration, Mojica said.
On the one hand, the president has issued statements opposing forced labour in supply chains. On the other hand, it also is pushing for a rapid expansion of green energy resources, including solar. A White House brief said that solar deployment would need to accelerate at a pace up to four times faster than today in order to meet clean energy targets by 2035.
Trade pressure grew in mid-August after a group of companies asked the U.S. Commerce Department to impose antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on a handful of producers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are imported from Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention filed three petitions through the law firm Wiley Rein requesting that Commerce investigate what it said are “unfairly traded imports” from the three countries.
The group said that circumvention of antidumping and duties on Chinese solar products has “hobbled the U.S. industry, eviscerated our supply chains, and put our clean energy future at risk.”
Shibles, who spent 11 years as a CBP lawyer, said during the webinar that the detention does not prevent the product from being exported away from the U.S. And she said that product can be identified regardless of how it enters the U.S., whether by ship, rail, or air freight. She said that CBP likely will use a wide range of sources to identify potential companies and products, including non-governmental organisations, press reports, the U.S. Department of Labor, as well as international partners.
Nathan Picarsic of Horizon Advisory said that the solar industry is “woefully behind” both the agriculture and apparel industries when it comes to preparing for and responding to WRO enforcement.
Companies in other industries have dedicated teams that monitor for and act to mitigate CBP enforcement risk, he said. By contrast, the solar industry largely has had little recognition of similar risk indicators. “The reality is baked in to the agriculture and apparel” industries, he said.
The solar industry has made some progress since the beginning of the year to improve supply chain traceability, said Andy Klump with Clean Energy Associates. For example, the Solar Energy Industries Association earlier this year published a supply chain traceability protocol.
And, companies can avoid CBP detention by shifting supply chains away from potential conflict regions.
pv magazine reported August 18 that JinkoSolar had signed a five-year, US$1.86 billion (AU$2.6 billion) agreement to buy 70,000 tons of PV module raw material polysilicon from German producer Wacker. The polysilicon manufactured at Wacker sites in Germany and the U.S. will begin to be supplied in September and continue through December 2026.
Mojica said the move by Jinko may be an effective strategy to avoid the CBP dragnet.
“Suppliers who can provide documentation should have no issue” at the border, he said.
