The group said Australia’s current market scenarios for decarbonising the national electricity market “either fall short of government commitments or rely on assumptions that are not credible with mainstream investors.”
The models “falling short” include AEMO’s Integrated System Plans based on CSIRO and ClimateWorks assumptions, the Australian government emissions projections from 2021, and Australian Labor’s modelling done by Reputex.

“Although some existing market projections map a path to 1.5°C, they rely on implausible assumptions like extreme uptake of hydrogen and electrification, a highly truncated coal exit, or unrealistic renewable buildout rates to reach generation targets,” the Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) said.

This inadequacy led the group to commission modelling from consulting firm Baringa, which forecasts Australia will need $421 billion of investment to successfully decarbonise the NEM. This is $116 billion higher than AEMO’s Step Change scenario.

 
“Making this work requires the coordinated closure of coal with a focus on shutting the most-polluting plants first, average renewable buildout of 5.5 GW per year between 2024 and 2034, and credible hydrogen uptake starting in the early-mid 2030s.”
The group identified six priority actions necessary for realising this pathway:

The company is targeting a USD 200,000 – 30,000 million per tonne ($300,00 – $450,000) capital cost for its H2Leo, saying this makes it “significantly cheaper than onshore solutions.”
Hydrogen storage has long been a sore spot for the industry since hydrogen molecules are notoriously difficult to contain, and converting it to bigger ammonia molecules can be resource intensive.

Provaris says its H2Neo has a design capacity range of 300 to 600 tonnes of hydrogen, expandable to up to 2,000 tonnes. The company envisions the H2Leo being used for intermittent or buffer storage for green hydrogen production, long-duration storage for excess renewable energy, and bunkering for the maritime sector.
Provaris, formerly known as Global Energy Ventures, had its compressed hydrogen carrier vessel, the H2Neo, verified and approved by the American Bureau of Shipping in December 2022. Alongside this, the company has been developing the 2.8 GW solar-powered green hydrogen production project on the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory.
“Provaris sees the development of a floating storage solution as a natural extension of its compressed hydrogen IP [intellectual property], providing an alternative to current high-cost bulk-scale storage solutions and improving the economics of its existing projects,” Provaris Managing Director & CEO, Martin Carolan, said. “We believe a floating storage solution will complement our pipeline of hydrogen production and transport projects and decrease timelines to first revenues and IP commercialisation.”
The H2Leo floating will have two cargo tanks with independent isolation, safety valves, and manifolds for compressed hydrogen transfer, the company said. Simultaneous operations capability will allow for continuous production and discharge, it added. 
The development of H2Leo design will run parallel to the remaining engineering and approvals for Provaris’ hydrogen carrier, the H2Neo. It is targeting prototype testing and final class approval for that later this year, with Provaris previously saying it will get H2Neo to construction-ready status in 2023, with a bigger green compressed hydrogen carrier to follow in 2026.
 H2Leo set to become available in 2025.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/19/a-plan-to-make-a-plan-australias-somewhat-wanting-national-electric-vehicle-strategy-unveiled/,"EV,MARKETS,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"APRIL 19, 2023",A plan to make a plan: Australia’s National Electric Vehicle Strategy unveiled,"Australia’s federal government has released its long-awaited National Electric Vehicle Strategy, Australia’s first such policy. In reality, it is more of a silhouette than a “comprehensive roadmap.”
The cornerstone of the strategy is a fuel efficiency standard for Australia – or, more accurately, a plan to eventually introduce a standard. A fuel efficiency standard would put a monetary impetus on vehicle manufacturers to import cars which emit less pollution and have improved fuel technologies. 
Australia and Russia are the world’s only two developed nations without a fuel efficiency standard today, but despite there being no shortage of global frameworks on which to model the standard, the federal government has given no firm date on when it would be introduced. Rather, it simply flagged its proposal will be made public by the end of 2023.
The fuel efficiency standard is the primary mechanism the government will pull to boost Australia’s EV supply – making it a rather striking omission from the strategy, especially given Minister Bowen opens the document by acknowledging Australia does not have an EV appetite problem, but simply isn’t getting enough EV models to our shores.
Australia & Russia are the only advanced economies without fuel efficiency standards.
Cars sold here emit more pollution that the EU, the USA and NZ, which is bad for climate & our budgets.

The government will also “prepare” for a recycling, reuse and stewardship program for EV and larger vehicle batteries. It has funded the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Motor Trades Association of Australia to design this scheme, for which few other details were provided.
Next to ‘supply,’ the strategy has another two focus areas, including ‘systems and infrastructure,’ like EV charging stations and safety, and ‘demand,’ which includes monetary incentives to support EV uptake. On this end, the strategy includes no new initiatives beyond Labor’s Electric Car Discount introduced in 2022 which exempts eligible EVs from fringe benefits tax and removes the 5% import tariff on EVs.
In terms of infrastructure, the federal government is set to work with state governments to develop mapping tools for optimum deployment of charging infrastructure. It will also change building codes to help give access to EV charging capacity to people living in apartments. Finally, the government will fund training and support for emergency services.

Overall, the strategy includes very few specifics on any of these points and mostly just flags them as areas of development. The bulk of the document reads like an information sheet about electric vehicles with some additional information on hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). 
The strategy will be reviewed in 2026 – an aspect of the design the Smart Energy Council lauded, saying it would keep the document “fit for purpose.”
Alongside the overall vagueness, the strategy has caught the attention of a number of groups for its omissions. “It contains no new measures to support electric vehicles operating as ‘batteries on wheels’, and nothing for e-bikes or micromobility despite having consulted on it,” Smart Energy Council CEO John Grimes said.

This ‘batteries on wheels’ comment refers to the potential for EV batteries to offer two way power flows, known as a vehicle-to-grid or V2G capacity. EV batteries generally have significantly more power and capacity than household batteries, which holds huge promise. While Australia is currently conducting a number of V2G trials, this technology is still some way off widespread adoption and requires concerted support.
The Greens party have also criticised the strategy for not including any target date for the phase out of petrol or diesel cars. While such policies seem rather radical in Australia, they are commonplace overseas, as are restrictions on where diesel cars are allowed to drive.
The Greens also noted there was no overall target for EV uptake, deeming it a “a strategy without destination.”

Meanwhile, CEO of EV subscription service Carbar, Des Hang, said even though a fuel efficiency standard is certainly useful, other mechanisms need to be put in place to address Australia’s chronic undersupply of EVs. Hang did not note any specifics, simply saying “there needs to be further financial incentives applied to EV adoption.”
Coming from a different angle, ‘old guard’ alliance Energy Networks Australia noted the strategy should include smart EV charging and pricing reform to stop the incoming electricity load from EVs negatively impacting grid reliability. “This would encourage and reward efficient charging behaviour and provide flexible electricity pricing for customers to make power supply cheaper when it is plentiful – for example during the day to soak up solar generation,” Acting CEO Garth Crawford said.
In 2022, the transport sector made up 19% of Australia’s emissions, with passenger vehicles specifically accounting for 10%. Without intervention, the government projects transport to be Australia’s largest source of emissions by 2030.

Absent from the strategy, and from the overall discussion in Australia, is any effort to reduce Australia’s reliance on passenger cars or encourage more pooling of transport resources. Instead, the primary vision hinges on moving Australians from internal combustion engines to EVs – which is far from a truly sustainable solution, given the sector’s intensive manufacturing footprint and the virgin-mined materials required to upscale the industry.
The uptake of EVs in Australia grew 86% from 2021 to 2022 alone, but still only accounts for 3.8% of new car sales here – markedly less than in other developed nations.
Fitting into the broader strategy umbrella are a number of other EV-related policies federal Labor has introduced in its first year in office. Next to the previously mentioned Electric Car Discount, it has also introduced the Driving The Nation Fund, an EV charging network which will roll out chargers on average every 150 kilometres along major highways.
Australia’s lack of fuel efficiency standards as seen it become “a dumping ground for less efficient vehicles,” giving carmakers a market for the models deemed unfit overseas, EV Council CEO Behyad Jefari said during last year’s fuel security summit.
Such a standard would not cost the government nor citizens money to introduce. Moreover, there is already a well established international framework in place that could be enacted immediately – which makes the government’s current delay all the more puzzling. 
By introducing vehicle standards, the strategy notes, it would afford Australian’s a greater choice of fuel-efficient and EV models as importers would be penalised for bringing in more polluting models. It would also save Australians roughly $519 per year at the bowser, according to the government’s modelling.
On average, new cars in Australia use 40% more fuel than the European Union, 20% more than the United States, and 15% more than New Zealand. 
The standard would only apply to new cars, and not retrospectively. 
Consultation on the design of the national fuel efficiency standards begins today, April 19.

Growatt says its new solar generator, Infinity 1300, uses lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to achieve a 3,000-plus cycle lifespan. The generator can be fully charged with solar panels, resulting in 1,382 Wh of capacity and 1,800 W of output. It can perform a fast charge in 1.8 hours by using an AC input.
The Infinity 1300 contains 14 DC and AC outlets and carries bidirectional inverter technology. It can be controlled through the SmartGro app.
Optional 200 W solar panels are available for off-grid use, and four can be connected for 800 W of charge. The foldable panels are made of monocrystalline silicon solar cells and feature an ETFE fluorine-based plastic material that makes them weather resistant. The modules have a waterproof rating of IP67, which means that the International Electrotechnical Commission has determined that the unit can be dropped into a body of water up to 1 meter deep for up to 30 minutes.
The generator is designed for portable use. At 16.5 by 9.1 by 11.3 inches, it weighs less than 19.5 kg. Its optimal operating temperature ranges from 68 F to 86 F. The system includes Growatt’s battery management system (BMS) technology, and it also features an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) function and multi-unit expansion.
Growatt says that it is taking pre-sale orders for its Infinity 1300 solar generator now through April 30 on its official website.
In December, Growatt announced a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery for residential and commercial rooftop PV applications. The APX HV battery has a storage capacity of 5 kWh with one battery module and up to 30 kWh with six modules. The system has a maximum parallel expansion to 60 kWh.
Last year, Growatt unveiled the Infinity 1500 solar generator, which has a battery capacity of 1,554 Wh and an AC output of 2,000 W. The manufacturer says it can power about 95% of outdoor and home appliances, with 12 outlets available for diverse needs. The device can be charged with up to four 24 V solar panels in series, or with 12 V solar panels.
