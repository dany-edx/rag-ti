Translating these identified issues into reform solutions following consultation with industry and governments in 2020, the EBS concurrently published its Post 2025 Market Design Directions Paper today. In it, the Board recommended the early implementation of Renewable Energy Zones (REZ). It also flagged that it will focus on actioning the Integrated System Plan.
“The Health of the NEM clearly shows the repercussions of rapid change in our electricity system and highlights the absolute urgency of addressing them,” EBS Chair, Dr Schott, said in a statement.
Energy Security Board
“While many people in the energy sector have different perspectives on the possible solutions or priorities, everyone agrees on the problems we identified earlier in this process. What we have in place now is no longer fit for purpose for the energy transition and beyond.”
“It’s now time for tough, united, decisions. If we keep kicking this further down the road, it’s going cost us all more for electricity in the future.”
Over the next two decades, between 26 GW and 50 GW of new large scale variable renewable energy (VRE) is forecast to come online. This is in addition to existing, committed and anticipated projects. It will be supported by between 6 GW and 19 GW of new flexible and dispatchable resources. These arrival of these new energy sources will coincide with the retirement of about 16 GW of thermal generation, translating to 61% of the current coal fleet in Australia’s National Energy Market.
Energy Security Board
“We are concerned about security constraints in some parts of the NEM and the increasing pressure on distribution networks from growing rooftop solar penetration.
“This, combined with growing large scale renewable generation and low wholesale prices, means it is vital that post 2025 reforms are put in place that can work alongside government policy schemes.”
Responding to the Directions Paper, the Clean Energy Council this afternoon put out a statement in support of the ESB’s report. They applauded the Board’s embrace of REZ as well as its plan to defer transmission access reforms, more commonly referred to as the coordination of generation and transmission investment – COGATI – initiative. “COGATI will do very little to improve the coordination of generation and transmission while increasing risk, complexity and cost to the market,” the Council’s statement read.
“The Clean Energy Council is also pleased that the ESB is progressing the essential system services work through several rule change processes and the continued assessment of an ageing thermal generation retirement strategy.”
The ESB has five members including Dr Schott AO who is the Independent Chair; David Swift, Independent Deputy Chair; Clare Savage, Chair of the Australian Energy Regulator; Merryn York, Acting Chair of the Australian Energy Market Commission and Drew Clarke, Chair of the Australian Energy Market Operator.
In the coming months, the Board will develop detailed market designs for energy ministers. It will hand down final recommendations to government in mid 2021.
Reforms to be progressed address four focus areas of need:

The project is contingent on 60 conditions, however, with the majority of submissions made to the IPC stating opposition to the plan.
The solar farm will install approximately 120 MW (AC)/150 MW (DC)  and a Battery Energy Storage System with maximum capacity of 30MW/60MWh. The project proposes to cover around 327 hectares of the subject land with single axis tracker PV solar panels and is the result of a partnership between Green Switch Australia and Hanwha Energy Corporation.
The project is to be situated not far from the proposed Glenellen Solar Farm, which has sought to side-step the community frustration about agricultural lands being used to house solar panels by incorporating agrivoltaic principles to allow sheep grazing and cropping to continue on the site. Both projects aim to connect into the same local TransGrid Jindera 330/132kV substation.
Also in the pipeline for the Greater Hume Shire are FRV’s Walla Walla Solar Farm, which was approved in November of last year, and French company Neoen’s 400 MW Culcairn Solar Farm and energy storage facility. In the Riverina region more broadly is the 90 MW West Wyalong Solar Farm, 17 MW Finley Solar Farm, 333 MW Darlington Point Solar Farm , 349 Limondale Solar Farm, 150 MW Coleambally Solar Farm, the 109 MW Sebastopol Solar Farm and 255 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/05/top-gun-is-one-of-4-dozen-us-large-scale-bess-projects-set-for-service-in-2021/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"JANUARY 5, 2021",Top Gun is one of 4 dozen US large-scale BESS projects set for service in 2021,"From pv magazine USA
It may not be the largest battery energy storage system, but the 30 MW Top Gun system at San Diego Gas & Electric’s Miramar substation in California may have the coolest name. The array of lithium-ion batteries is set to enter service during the first quarter of 2021.
Naval Air Station Miramar is home to the TOPGUN aviator training center made famous in the 1986 movie starring Tom Cruise.
SDG&E said that because of delays with fabricating battery containers due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project is a few months behind schedule. Even so, construction milestones include pouring foundations, completing overhead interconnection facilities and building and energizing the switchgear and control shelter.
Top Gun is one of 16 BESS projects in California that are slated to enter service in 2021. That’s according to data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration.
All totaled, the Golden State systems represent more than 825 MW of capacity. The smallest to make the FERC database is the 1.4 MW DESI-2 BESS that Southern California Edison is expected to bring into service this coming June. The largest is the 182.5 MW Elkhorn BESS that Pacific Gas and Electric plans to bring online in July.
Under California Assembly Bill 2514, investor-owned utilities have been tasked with incorporating more energy storage into the energy grid to integrate greater amounts of renewable energy, defer the need for new fossil-fueled power plants, and reduce utility BESSdependence on fossil fuel generation to meet peak loads.
Earlier this month, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. asked California’s state utility regulators to approve six additional battery energy storage projects totaling 387 MW of capacity.
The utility said that the six project agreements complete procurement requirements outlined in a November 2019 decision by the Public Utility Commission. That decision identified potential electric system reliability issues beginning this coming summer. Regulators authorized PG&E to procure at least 716.9 MW of system reliability resources to come online between Aug. 1, 2021 and Aug. 1, 2023. In May, PG&E announced the results of its first round of procurement: 423 MW of battery energy storage capacity, scheduled to be online by August 2021.
Outside of California, some 555 MW of BESS capacity is expected to enter service nationwide during 2021, according to FERC data. Massachusetts will play host to no fewer than 18 of those projects, representing almost 64 MW of storage capacity.
Among the Bay State projects is a 1 MW BESS at Boston Medical Center slated to enter service during the first half of the year, and a roughly 25 MW BESS being developed by Eversource on Cape Cod.
The Eversource project will use a lithium-ion, 24.9 MW/38 MWh battery system. It will supply power in the event of an emergency like an outage, and will also help meet peak summer demand. The Outer Cape Community Battery is expected to enter service during the first quarter and aligns with Massachusetts’ Global Warming Solutions Act that established a greenhouse gas reduction goal of 80% by 2050.
In Texas, work is under way on the 100 MW Chisholm Grid BESS in Fort Worth. The project is being developed by Able Grid Energy Solutions, MAP Energy and Astral Electricity. Mortenson is the balance of plant and battery installation contractor. The project is Mortenson’s ninth energy storage project and is slated to enter service this summer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/05/consultant-plays-down-chinese-solar-fever/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,CHINA",MAX HALL,"JANUARY 5, 2021",Consultant plays down Chinese solar fever,"In-country consultant the Asia Europe Clean Energy (Solar) Advisory (AECEA) has cast doubt on the ability of China’s authorities to drive through a mooted 120 GW of new solar and wind power generation capacity this year.
The consultant reported the annual energy working meeting held by state body the National Energy Administration (NEA) last month stated it would consider gunning for the 120 GW figure this year, in the wake of a pledge by president Xi Jinping in mid December to achieve 1.2 TW of renewables generation facilities this decade.
However, even if the NEA adopts a 120 GW target – perhaps as part of the next, 2021-25 five-year plan – it is unlikely to achieve the ambition, according to the AECEA, which has offered 45-50 GW as its initial guesstimate of how much solar will be added in China this year.
An update issued by the AECEA this morning stated the president’s 2030 announcement had caused the Chinese renewables industry to get “carried away.” The analyst pointed to the warning issued by the State Grid Corporation of China nine months ago that only 48.45 GW of new solar project capacity, and 36.65 GW of wind could be accommodated on its network during 2020. The “up to 15” long-distance, ultra-high-voltage DC power lines which are under construction to alleviate capacity constraints will not enter service until at least 2022-23, according to the AECEA.
The world’s solar capital experienced its usual end-of-year installation rush last month, according to the consultant, with official NEA figures expected this month to confirm up to 40 GW of new solar was added last year, with 14-15 GW coming online last month and November predicted to have seen 3.49 GW of the year’s remarkable 10.1 GW of new residential arrays. That anticipated rooftop rush in November will have been helped by the “buffer month” guarantee to honor subsidies for household systems despite the fact the annual RMB500 million ($77.4 million) budget had been almost exhausted during October.
Notably, the NEA is considering extending the household solar subsidy program this year and city authorities in Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Guangzhou last month issued supportive policies for such arrays out to 2025.
If an annual figure of around 40 GW of new solar is confirmed for 2020, China would have reached 245 GW four days ago, obliterating the current five-year-plan target of 105 GW, according to the AECEA.
Guizhou is expected to have added 5.2 GW of solar capacity last year, to retain its top position, and the 4.57 GW of rooftop solar expected to have been added in Shandong, plus 4.1 GW in greater Hebei, are expected to have accounted for the lion’s share of new household PV.
If those figures are borne out, the 1.2 TW renewables ambition announced by President Xi would require 72 GW of new wind and solar annually this decade, a figure which is already expected to have been beaten by around 18% last year. The AECEA stated the National Energy Administration has a 50 GW renewables pipeline plus plans for a “reserve capacity” of around 40 GW in the form of more than 20 clean-energy mega-projects. The consultant added, state utilities are aiming to install 175-200 GW of renewables by 2025.
