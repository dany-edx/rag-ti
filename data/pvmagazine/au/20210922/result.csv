It was the biggest vote ever recorded for a climate-focused shareholder push in corporate Australia without board support, according to Ashjayeen Sharif, a climate activist who sought but didn’t succeed in being elected to the company’s board during the same meeting.
This is an incredibly momentous event in the history of climate in Australia. Wow. Wow.
👏🏻 @brynnobrien and @AustCCR team on their @AGLAustralia resolution.
You put a dent in the future timeline of the world today. https://t.co/0HH6WeslLp

AGL Energy is Australia’s biggest coal fire generator and greenhouse gas emitter, accounting for roughly 8% of the country’s emissions. In July, it agreed to give its shareholders a vote on climate reporting for after enduring heated criticism over its plan to separate into two entities, the “green” and forward-facing AGL Australia and Accel Energy, which would retain the company’s fossil fuel assets.
Executive Director of the ACCR, Brynn O’Brien, described corporate greenwashing like AGL’s rather transparent ploy to distance itself from its climate notoriety, as “a massive issue” in Australia.
“It’s part of the machinery of delay,” O’Brien told pv magazine Australia.

In a momentous victory which was presumably unexpected for the company, AGL shareholders voted for both of the businesses entities to set targets which align with the Paris-agreement to keep global warming below 1.5°C.
ACCR’s resolution includes that AGL’s board disclose:

Somewhat confusingly, AGL has since released a statement saying resolution 6(b), the setting of Paris-aligned targets, was an “advisory resolution” which could only be considered if resolution 6(a), titled “amendment to the constitution”, was passed – which it wasn’t. It appears this would mean that despite obtaining majority support from shareholders, the company won’t be obliged to take action, though clarification has been sought.
A spokesperson for AGL told pv magazine Australia: “[it] did not believe this resolution is in the best interests of AGL’s shareholders.”
AGL’s share price has plunged to 20-year lows as the company battles with collapsing electricity prices, the widely-criticised demerger scheme, the shock loss of its CEO, and mounting climate pressure.
“The erosion in shareholder value appears to have finally united shareholders behind this push,” the ACCR’s Director of Climate & Environment, Dan Gocher, said in a statement on the win.
“AGL Chair Peter Botten’s claim that AGL cannot set Paris-aligned targets unilaterally is nonsense. Botten claimed the board is trying “to create a glide path rather than a crash landing,” which ignores the crash that AGL shareholders have already experienced.
“AGL’s claim that it is not in position to commit to develop the necessary replacement capacity for its coal-fired power stations doesn’t stack up. 10-15 years is ample time to develop the replacement capacity with renewable energy and storage,” Gocher added.
Presumably, the company will now have to take some type of climate action – and ACCR will no doubt be keenly watching. Just yesterday, the organisation had its first day in federal court with oil and gas giant Santos, which the ACCR alleges does not have a credible pathway to its net zero by 2040 target, effectively amounting to deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/22/bidding-war-for-victorias-transmission-networks/,"FINANCE,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2021",Bidding war for Victoria’s transmission networks,"Just 24 hours after Canadian asset management group Brookfield put in a bid for AusNet valuing the company at $9.6 billion, Australian gas giant APA Group jumped in with an almost $10 billion offer.
It wasn’t enough though, with AusNet announcing yesterday that it deemed APA’s offer “inferior in respect of price, form of consideration, structure and certainty” to the Brookfield offer.
AusNet owns and operates Victoria’s electricity transmission network, which is of course connected to the national electricity market (NEM). It also owns a Victorian electricity distribution network and gas distribution network. The company is currently 32% owned by Singapore’s state investment arm Temasek and 19.9% owned by the China’s State Grid Corporation.
Brookfield now has eight weeks of exclusive due diligence to asses AusNet’s books. APA Group had hoped to undercut this exclusive arrangement with its offer, but it seems to have failed with AusNet saying it will “consider the APA [proposal] and has the ability to engage with APA following completion of the exclusivity period”.
APA Group, which already own or operate a $22 billion portfolio of gas and electricity assets in Australia, sought to rally support for its takeover on the promise of preventing Victoria’s power grid becoming completely foreign-owned.
“Unlike many OECD countries, Australia lacks a locally owned and controlled energy utility with capabilities across critical energy infrastructure and with the size and strength to partner with government and the community to deliver the energy transition,” APA’s managing director Rob Wheals said in a statement.
AusNet’s takeover comes less than a month after the bid for Australian power network group Spark Infrastructure was finalised at $5.2 billion from a North American consortium comprised of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. 
Evidently, Australia’s transmission assets are seen as increasingly attractive investments with electricity usage expected to grow over the coming decades as the country decarbonises, embracing electric vehicles and producing hydrogen.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/22/edify-approved-for-1-gw-green-hydrogen-and-battery-project-in-north-queensland/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2021",Edify approved for 1 GW green hydrogen and battery project in North Queensland,"Edify Energy’s project is the first development application to be formally approved by the Townsville City Council for the planned Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct, which aims to co-locate clean energy generation with industrial and manufacturing facilities across more than 2000 hectares of dedicated land 40 kilometres south of Townsville.
Edify plans to initially produce green hydrogen at the site with a 10 MW pilot scale facility before increasing capacity in stages “to meet the needs of a growing domestic and export green hydrogen market,” it said. 
The company is also in the development stages of building its 200 MW Majors Creek Solar Power Station, which will supply electricity to the Lansdown facility.
Edify has not yet released capacity or chemistry details about the battery storage facility it is also planning to build at the site though.

The formal approval marks the first stage in the precinct’s development and was warmly welcomed by both Edify and Townsville’s Mayor Jenny Hill. “The momentum continues to build behind the development of northern Australia’s first environmentally sustainable, advanced manufacturing, processing and technology estate right here in Townsville,” Cr Hill said in a statement.
According to her, Edify’s application had been independently assessed by council’s planning officers and approved with conditions relating to development staging, roadworks and traffic safety upgrades.
Edify is one of three companies Townsville City Council said had “signed up to establish themselves at the precinct.”
Queensland Pacific Minerals is an other, and it reportedly plans to produce battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulphate from a nickel-cobalt ore. Imperium3 Townsville (iM3TSV), the third company looking to join, is seeking to develop an 18 GWh lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facility, according to the council.

Mayor Hill said the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct had the potential to significantly boost Townsville and North Queensland’s economy for decades.
“Lansdown is really significant to the city with the potential for thousands of jobs to be created which would be a huge boost to our economy and bring new skills to the community, particularly when the local economy is recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic,” Cr Hill said.
“We welcome the state government’s strong support of this jobs-generating precinct and we will continue to lobby the federal government to similarly get behind the initiative and help realise the jobs and economic benefits it will deliver for North Queensland.”
On Tuesday, the federal government announced an additional $150 million in grants funding for regional hydrogen projects, expanding its hub priority list from five to seven to include a location in every Australian state. In Queensland, the federal government’s priority location will be Gladstone, south of Townsville.

Queensland-based community group Solar Citizens said it would be unfortunate for Townsville, which is located in the far north – a region espoused by many to be an ideal location for green hydrogen production due to its proximity to Asian markets – to miss out on Commonwealth project funding.
“When you’ve got Edify, Sun Metals and Origin Energy all planning to invest in renewable hydrogen projects, it would be a real shame if Townsville missed out on this federal funding,”  Solar Citizen’s Energy Strategist, Stephanie Gray, said.
“Townsville has all the key ingredients to be a clean energy industrial powerhouse: some of Australia’s best solar resources, a skilled local workforce and world-class port facilities.”
Solar Citizens published a report earlier this year which found turning Townsville into a renewable industry powerhouse would create a $154 billion economic boost for the region. 
“Townsville has incredible potential but all levels of government need to back the region and build the enabling infrastructure to see these opportunities realised,” Gray added.
Even without Commonwealth government backing, Edify CEO John Cole described the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct’s location as ideal for developing Australia’s green energy industries.
“Existing rail and road infrastructure connecting Lansdown to the Port of Townsville makes the precinct an excellent location to lead the renaissance of exporting value-added Australian-made products to global markets.  We have long held the view that Townsville is a very good place to create a green hydrogen export industry and meet the growing need domestically and across the world for this emission free fuel,” Cole said in a statement.
“The linking of clean electricity generation with the proposed advanced eco-industrial activity at Lansdown, together with the hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and opportunities for future proofed careers is what delights us.”
Mayor Hill described Edify’s plan as “a major vote of confidence in our city”.
“Edify’s desire to establish itself at the precinct supports Council’s ongoing efforts to work with both the state and federal government through the Townsville City Deal to get the precinct investment ‘turn-key’ ready as soon as possible,” she added.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/22/india-added-a-record-521-mw-of-rooftop-solar-in-q2/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2021",India added a record 521 MW of rooftop solar in Q2,"From pv magazine India
India has reached a cumulative installed rooftop solar capacity of 6.1 GW at the end of June 2021 with the addition of 521 MW rooftop PV in the second quarter (Q2) of the year. The Q2 2021 addition is a 53% increase compared to 341 MW installed in Q1 2021, and India’s highest-ever rooftop solar capacity installed in a quarter, according to Mercom India Research’s Rooftop Solar Market Report Q2 2021.
Installations were significantly higher than the previous quarter despite the second wave of the COVID-19 and related state lockdowns. The report cited targeted lockdowns and industry preparedness as the factors reducing the impact on installation activity this time around.
With Q2 addition, rooftop solar installations in the first half of the year have reached 862 MW, surpassing the total rooftop solar capacity installed in all of 2020 (719 MW) when the market was severely affected by COVID-19 lockdowns. 
The report forecasts if the market has no other adverse Covid-related events for the rest of the year, 2021 could turn out to be the second-largest year for rooftop solar after 2018.
“The rooftop solar segment had a strong quarter, and demand is up. Finalising the net metering cap at 500 kW has removed uncertainty for installers and paved the way for future growth. However, haphazard rooftop solar policies across states and a lack of support from distribution companies are holding back the sector from realising its true potential to bring in new investment, create jobs and drive the clean energy economy forward,” said Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group.
The Indian state of Gujarat led the rooftop solar installations in Q2, followed by Maharashtra and Haryana.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/09/22/solar-powered-delivery-van-with-400-km-range/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2021",Solar-powered delivery van with 400 km range,"From pv magazine Global
Swedish start-up Clean Motion is planning to start production of its solar-powered delivery van Re.Volt from the fall of 2022.
The manufacturer said the solar modules deployed on the vehicle’s roofs ensure over 100 km of additional range, with the overall range being estimated at around 400 km. The maximum range from the vehicle’s batteries is estimated at between 70 and 280 km/day and the maximum range from solar energy at 130 km/day, depending on geography.
The 23% efficient n-type monocrystalline solar cell technology used was provided by Finnish producer Valoe, with which Clean Motion signed a cooperation agreement in August. Valoe’s products are interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells developed by Germany’s International Solar Energy Research Center Konstanz e.V. (ISC Konstanz), which specialises in IBC technology. The Finnish business began manufacturing its cells in Vilnius, Lithuania, in December after installing IBC production equipment bought from defunct Italian manufacturer Megacell Srl.
“What is unique is the energy efficiency of our vehicles, which means that the solar-roof can make them self-sufficient in energy,” said Clean Motion CEO Göran Folkesson. “It also means that with only 40 kg of batteries we can offer a range of 280 km, which will suit northern latitudes where the sun is not a reliable energy source.”
The vehicle, which the manufacturer defines as ideal for transport missions with a minimal need for charging, has a size of 300 x 140 x 170 cm and, when unloaded, weighs in at only 250 kg. When loaded, its weight can reach up to 700 kg thanks to a cargo space of 2,500 litres. Further technical details of the vehicle were not revealed.
Founded in 2010, the Lerum-based company also produces Zbee, a light electric three-wheeled vehicle that is available either with a rear seat or with cargo space.
