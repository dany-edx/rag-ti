In separate statements, Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen and Greens leader Adam Bandt confirmed the two parties had come to an agreement on changes to the proposed Safeguard Mechanism Bill that is seen as central to the federal government meeting its 43% emissions reduction target by 2030.
The Greens had previously demanded, as a condition of supporting the bill, the government commit to no new coal and gas projects but the government has repeatedly rejected the request.
Greens leader Adam Bandt said the two parties have however now agreed to a suite of reforms to the proposed legislation, including the introduction of a hard emissions cap, or ceiling, on actual or absolute emissions, which won’t be able to exceed current pollution levels and will decrease over time.
Bandt said the hard cap “puts a limit on coal and gas expansion in Australia”, making it unviable for “about half” of the 116 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline because they would be unable to get their emissions below the limit.

“Coal and gas have taken a huge hit,” he said. “Real pollution must actually come down and the coal and gas corporations can’t buy their way out of the cap with offsets.”
Bandt said the bill will also include a pollution trigger that will require the climate change minister to test the impact of new or expanded projects against the country’s cap and net carbon budgets.
“For the first time in history, new projects must be assessed for their impact on climate pollution, and they can be stopped,” he said.
Another key amendment will see expansions to existing gas projects treated as new facilities, and therefore given a net zero baseline for the carbon emissions in the new fields. Another reform will ensure public funding through the Powering the Regions Fund is not directed to coal and gas projects and only supports future-focused industries.
Bowen said the finalisation of the Safeguard Mechanism Bill was a key milestone in achieving Australia’s 43% emissions reduction target by 2030.
“Today, we are a step closer to achieving net zero by 2050,” he said. “We thank those across the Parliament who continue to approach this legislation in a constructive way to ensure accountability, transparency and integrity for the scheme, and ensure flexibility and support for industry.”
“These reforms are crucial to our climate and our economy – supporting Australian industry and ensuring they will continue to be competitive in a decarbonising world.”
The changes agreed to by Labor and the Greens build on previously confirmed design features of the Safeguard Mechanism, including the creation of Safeguard Mechanism Credits which will enable large industrial facilities to earn credits when they reduce their emissions below their baselines.
Bowen said the government will finalise the further amended Safeguard Rules next month with the law expected to be in operation as of 1 July, 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/27/sparc-reports-exceptional-results-in-sodium-ion-battery-project/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 27, 2023",Sparc reports ‘exceptional’ results in sodium-ion battery project,"Sparc Technologies says its collaboration with the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) targeting the development of a low-cost hard carbon anode material for the sodium-ion battery market is progressing well with initial test results averaging about 45% higher than project benchmarks.
Sodium-ion batteries are emerging as a viable alternative to the prevalent lithium-ion technology but current hard carbon materials used for the production of anodes are typically sourced from fossil fuel feedstock and energy intensive processes.
Sparc, which announced in September last year it would team with QUT on a research project to develop a sustainably sourced carbon anode material, believes it may have uncovered a viable alternative utilising green bio-waste and less energy intensive processes.
The South Australia-based company said QUT has delivered the first project report which describes the results of sodium-ion half-cell battery testing and material characterisation for the anode material under a range of conditions.

QUT said multiple trials have produced anodes averaging about 45% higher reversible capacities compared to commercial hard carbon anode materials.
Sparc said while further optimisation, testing and process development work is required, reversible capacities for a batch of materials tested under controlled conditions exceeded 535 milliampere hours per gram mass (mAh/g) and averaged 477 mAh/g across five separate trials.
Sparc Technologies Executive Chairman Stephen Hunt said the results are well above the benchmark of 330 mAh/g set at the beginning of the research program and auger well for the development of sodium-ion batteries which he believes have strong market potential, particularly in industrial and grid-scale storage.
“The combination of green bio-waste feedstock and faster, less energy intensive processing with a very high-capacity anode material offers attractive potential for further research and development,” he said.
“Equally as exciting is the continued progress of sodium-ion batteries towards commercialisation as evidenced by recent activities of major global battery producers including CATL, BYD and Reliance Industries.”
Sparc said while sodium-ion technology is still in its infancy, it represents a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries, offering lower cost and greater availability of raw materials; safety and ease of transport; greater operating temperature range; and similar manufacturing techniques to lithium-ion tech.

Construction of the facility is expected to start within months after outgoing CS Energy Chief Executive Officer Andrew Bills and Senex counterpart Ian Davies met recently in CS Energy’s Brisbane office to finalise the joint venture agreement.
“Both of our companies recognise the enormous potential of renewable hydrogen to contribute to a low-carbon future in Australia,” CS Energy said in a statement.
“Under the JV, CS Energy will operate and hold 75% equity in the plant, while Senex Energy will hold 25% equity in the plant.”
The Kogan Renewable Hydrogen Demonstration Plant will include a circa 1 MW hydrogen electrolyser powered by a co-located 2 MW solar farm. The project will also include a hydrogen fuel cell now expected to be up to 30 kW, on-site hydrogen storage and out-loading facility.

The project is being built next to CS Energy’s existing coal-fired Kogan Creek Power Station and will form part of an energy hub that is to also include a 100 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage system.
CS Energy said the aim of the project is to produce green hydrogen and provide energy and other grid services while gaining expertise from an operational hydrogen project from production, storage, transport and handling.
No update has been provided on when the hydrogen project will be operational but IHI Engineering Australia, a subsidiary of Japanese industrial giant IHI Corporation, has been appointed to construct the Kogan Creek plant, and work expected to start in the coming months.

“Green” hydrogen is the production of hydrogen fuels using emissions free generations sources like solar and wind energy. While renewables-charged battery-powered vehicles and power plants are expected to make up a large share of the energy transition, green hydrogen has garnered interest for heavy trucking and industrial use cases due it its ability to dispatch high amounts of power. 
Production of green hydrogen typically takes the “indirect” approach using solar and wind to power electrolysers. These electrolysers have reached efficiencies of around 30%. 
A research team at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) Institute for Solar Fuels is investigating another pathway to emissions-free hydrogen production through a process they call the “direct” approach. The approach is outlined in a recent Nature Communications article. 
The team is developing photoelectrodes that convert sunlight into electrical energy, are stable in aqueous solutions, and catalytically split water into hydrogen. The photoelectrodes are coupled with catalyst materials, creating the active component in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. 
Today, the best PEC cells are able to achieve efficiencies near 10% and are made of low-cost and relatively stable metal oxide absorbers. Though they are significantly less efficient than their indirect green hydrogen counterparts, PEC cells have some advantages. The heat from the direct sunlight can be used to further accelerate reactions. And, since the densities range ten to 100 times lower with this approach, more abundant and inexpensive materials can be used as catalysts, said the researchers. 
Despite these promising elements of the PEC approach, techno-economic analysis and net energy analysis have shown that it is not yet competitive with the conventional green hydrogen production approach. Hydrogen fuel from PEC systems costs about USD 10 ($15) per kg, about six times more than “blue” hydrogen from fossil methane steam reforming at USD 1.50 ($2.25) per kg. Also, cumulative energy demand for PEC water splitting is estimated to be four to 20 times higher than for hydrogen production with renewable energy and electrolysers. 
Despite this gulf in cost efficacy between the approaches, the research team at HZB Institute is testing other potential benefits of PEC. The group tested the effects of how the hydrogen produced reacts further with itaconic acid in the same reactor to form methyl succinic acid (MSA). MSA is another chemical fuel that can be used to dispatch high amounts of energy like hydrogen. 
The PEC technology enables MSA to be produced at only one-seventh of the typical energy requirement of MSA fuel production processes. 
To find this, researchers calculated how much energy is needed to produce the PEC cell from light absorbers, catalyst materials and other materials such as glass, and how long the system must function to produce this energy in the form of chemical energy as hydrogen or MSA. 
For hydrogen alone, the energy payback period is about 17 years when assuming a modest 5% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. If only 2% of the hydrogen produced is used to convert itatonic acid into MSA, the energy payback time is halved. If 30% of the hydrogen is converted into MSA, the production energy can be regained after just 2 years. 
“This makes the process much more sustainable and competitive,” said Dr Fatwa Abdi, HZB Institute for Solar Fuels. “This approach offers a way to significantly reduce the production cost of green hydrogen and increases the economic feasibility of PEC technology. We have carefully thought through the process, and the next step is to test in the laboratory how well the simultaneous production of hydrogen and MSA works in practice.”

Researchers in Switzerland have developed a new methodology for energy storage siting and sizing, in response to the curtailment of PV generation and grid constraints. They aim to determine whether curtailment could be cheaper than energy storage in medium-voltage distribution networks with distributed-generation PV capacity.
The used a linearised power flow model instead of traditional non-linear AC optimal power flow models.
“We use a linearised power flow model because it can be applied to distribution grids with both radial and meshed configurations, as opposed to second-order cone relaxations that are typically valid for radial systems,” they explained.
They considered storage costs, operational costs, grid constraints, electricity costs, PV generation models, and loads. They also assumed that energy storage provides active and reactive power compensation in the event of overproduction from PV.
They found that the viability of storage systems and their sizing are strictly dependent on electricity prices, which can be influenced by higher or lower levels of PV generation. The scientists concluded that curtailment is cheaper than installing batteries.
“A sensitivity analysis showed that decreasing costs of energy storage technologies could make installing energy storage cost-competitive compared to curtailing PV generation,” they said.
They presented their findings in “Optimal sizing and siting of energy storage systems considering curtailable photovoltaic generation in power distribution networks,” which was recently published in Applied Energy. The research group includes scientists from the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Switzerland’s Institute of Sustainable Energy.
“Studying sizing and siting of energy storage systems, in combination with curtailment of PV generation for satisfying the grid constraints stands as the main contribution of this paper,” they concluded.
