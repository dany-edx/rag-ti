The project would connect to the grid via a nearby existing transmission line operated by Essential Energy.
The New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment finalised its assessment of the project in November last year but the project was referred to the Independent Planning Commission because it received at least 50 submissions objecting to the proposal when it was placed on public exhibition.
The Commission has now granted development consent for the $152 million (USD 99.8 million) solar and energy storage project, subject to strict conditions imposed to mitigate a number of the issues raised the community.
These include revising the design of the solar installation to increase minimum setbacks to 30 metres from the western and eastern boundaries of the site and update its landscaping plan to help shield the project – which is to comprise approximately 128,000 solar panels – from sight.
Elgin must also maintain the site’s agricultural land capability to maximise current and future opportunities for dual land use, including grazing and cropping.
The Commission said Elgin must also “engage appropriately with the local council and community during construction and operation and completely rehabilitate the site at the end of the project.”
Elgin has already entered into a voluntary agreement with the Bathurst Regional Council to make an $18,000 annual contribution for the life of the project to help fund community enhancement projects.
While imposing new conditions, the Commission highlighted that the proposed site is “suitable for renewable energy development, given its topography, solar resources, avoidance of major environmental constraints, access to the regional road network, and its proximity to existing and planned electricity transmission networks.”
In its ruling, the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said the project would assist in transitioning the electricity sector from coal and gas-fired power stations to low emissions sources.
Once operational, the project is expected to generate more than 132,400 MWh of clean electricity annually, enough to power approximately 23,000 homes.
The project is expected to generate up to 150 jobs during the construction phase.

Having already made a significant reduction in their use of grid electricity since installing 100 kW of rooftop solar, Colormaker integrated the ReVolve battery energy storage system with the existing solar energy infrastructure to gain further financial benefits from the asset.
Relectrify said key success metrics for the project include optimised solar self-consumption, reduced purchase of grid-supplied energy, and reduced demand.
Melbourne-headquartered Relectrify said early data indicates that both power and associated costs are poised to decrease to single-digit percentages compared to pre-battery installation levels.

The ReVolve battery energy storage product uses second-life Nissan Leaf electric vehicle (EV) battery packs coupled with patented cell-level control technology that combines an integrated battery management system (BMS) and inverter hardware solution.
The hybrid system replaces conventional BMS and inverters with a single electronic solution that allows for control of individual cells to generate grid-compliant alternating current (AC) directly from a battery pack.
Colormaker Managing Director David Stuart said the installation of the battery has marked a pivotal step in the company’s journey to achieving a net-zero operation, noting that the battery “gives us the opportunity to store the solar energy we’ve generated during the day and utilise it to meet our energy needs around the clock.”
Relectrify Vice President of Partnerships Juergen Barth said the Colormaker project demonstrates how battery storage products featuring CellSwitch technology can revolutionise the way companies manage and store electricity by both using second-life cells and eliminating the need for inverters.

The three batteries will serve as a pilot phase for the Power Melbourne project which would establish a network of neighbourhood batteries that could eventually be scaled up to 5 MW of energy storage.
The city said the battery network will help accelerate the transition to a renewable-powered city and maximise the benefits of its growing rooftop solar sector. Data provided by the City of Melbourne shows about 1,235 residential solar systems, with a total installed capacity of more than 1.3 MW, have already been installed in the city.
Origin Zero Executive General Manager James Magill said the pilot stage will see three batteries installed at council-owned locations, including a library, community hub and a residential site. The batteries will charge during the day when there is a higher proportion of renewable energy in the grid. Stored energy will then be released back into the grid when it’s needed most.
“We are looking forward to commencing work on this first trial phase,” Magill said. “This first stage will see our Origin Zero team, which works with large businesses and councils, install three batteries with a combined capacity of 450 kW / 1 MWh, equivalent to powering more than 70 homes each day.”
City of Melbourne Environment Portfolio Lead Rohan Leppert said the pilot phase is an opportunity to test the Power Melbourne model, and gain insights to inform the expansion of the battery network and retail offering in the future.
“Storage is the missing piece of the puzzle when it comes to providing residents and businesses with access to affordable renewable energy,” he said.
Leppert said the pilot will also support the city’s ambition of 100% renewable energy by 2030.

DarwinLink is the onshore element of SunCable’s proposed AAPowerLink project that includes the building up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of energy storage in the Barkley region of the Northern Territory.
The DarwinLink project plans to deliver up to 6 GW of renewable electricity to the Darwin region via 800 kilometres of overhead high voltage direct current transmission infrastructure. The offshore component of the AAPowerLink project, now known as SingaporeLink, will entail the delivery of at least 1.75 GW of clean energy to Singapore via a 4,300 kilometre submarine transmission link.
David Scaysbrook, Australian-based co-founder and managing partner of Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, part of the consortium that assumed control of SunCable in 2023, said the appointment of Garnsworth and Hay will be key to realising the onshore element of the project.
“[This] underscores our goal of delivering on the huge potential of DarwinLink which underpins our primary focus on this genuine superpower opportunity for the Territory and for Australia,” he said. “Delivering groundbreaking infrastructure projects like DarwinLink needs a team with experience, vision and real horsepower and we certainly have that with this team.”
No stranger to managing large-scale energy projects, Garnsworth has previously served as managing director of leading solar developer FRV Australia, a longstanding board member of the Clean Energy Council (CEC), and general manager of business development at EnergyAustralia.
Hay brings extensive and diverse experience in remote project delivery, stakeholder relations and energy transition optimisation, and has been involved with major gas projects in the Territory for more than two decades.
Jeremy Kwong-Law, chief executive officer of SunCable parent company Grok Ventures, said the addition of Garnsworth and Hay would give greater capacity to progress all key DarwinLink project milestones.
“Their extensive big project experience and demonstrated leadership will support the critical onshore components of SunCable’s flagship AAPowerLink project,” he said.
While no time line for the DarwinLink project has been provided, SunCable said it has been progressing key project milestones, including principal approvals, land use agreements, and procurement packages and offtake, with further milestone announcements expected in 2024.
