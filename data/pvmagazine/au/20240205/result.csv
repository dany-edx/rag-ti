A team of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) say “conservative” forecasts show that cumulative PV waste in Australia could reach 2 million to 3 million tonnes by 2050. Under ambitious installation projections, waste will be up to twice as much.
The researchers said their forecast is up to seven times higher than previous literature, and one to two times higher than the waste forecast published by the federal government’s Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. More than 80% of the end-of-life panels will initially come from small-scale systems but this share is expected to drop to 60% in 2050.
But rather than looming as a waste mountain, the team from the UNSW’s School of Photovoltaics and Renewable Energy Engineering said end-of-life solar panels are a source of valuable materials such as silver, copper, and high purity silicon, glass, and aluminium which can be utilised in the manufacturing of new modules.

Rong Deng, who co-authored the research paper with Renate Egan and Verity Tan, said end-of-life solar has multiple potential market and application opportunities.
“End-of-life PV panels are not waste, they are valuable material reservoirs for the manufacturing of new panels,” she said.
“In five years, end-of-life silver and aluminium from PV panels could supply 30% of future PV demand, 50% in 15 years, escalating to 100% in 25 years considering realistic forecast installations.”
“Imagining meeting all future demands by reusing and recycling, not mining – a truly inspiring prospect.”
In their paper, Solar photovoltaic waste and resource potential projections in Australia, 2022–2050, the researchers have gone beyond forecasting the scope of the waste stream to estimate the resource potential of waste PV material to assist in the manufacturing of new modules.

The team said exploring the reuse potential of secondary materials in the manufacturing of new modules will have significant benefits on material supply security within the industry.
“Understanding waste streams can assist in predicting the availability of these recycled resources and to what extent they can contribute to manufacturing of the required cumulative demand,” they said. “This will be increasingly important as the demand for manufacturing of new modules grows, thereby placing stress on critical resource reserves.”
The paper shows that, when all scenarios and lifetime variations are considered, end-of-life panels could in just five years supply more than 30% of aluminium and silver PV demand.
“Moving 10 years ahead, as the amount of waste surpasses 1 million tonnes, in 2038 there will still be ample demand for PV circularity if we install ambitiously or realistically,” the researchers said. “Specifically, an average of around 50% of future PV silver and aluminium demand could be supplied by end-of-life PV.”
By 2045, this supply potential of silver and aluminium begins to stabilise at approximately 100%, allowing up to 100 % circularity within the PV industry for these materials.
“This means there will be clear demand within the PV industry for end-of-life supply if panels are properly recycled,” the researchers said, noting that in practice the end-of-life PV material will likely have multiple potential market and application opportunities, including the battery, ceramic tiles, cosmetic and paint making, construction and bricks industries.
While pointing out the potential benefits that end-of-life solar will offer for material supply security within the industry, the researchers said the planning for PV end-of-life management needs to begin now, with little more than 10 years to prepare for 1 million tonnes of PV waste.
“We know the locations where PV waste will first arise allowing the planning of logistics, we know the PV waste will primarily comprise of silicon-based technologies, so we can investigate appropriate recycling methods, and we know that the majority of PV waste will come from residential and small-commercial users, enabling the development of consumer-appropriate policy,” they said.

The decision was announced on Jan. 30.
Worley will work with Tasmanian engineering company Pitt and Sherry on the project with Abel saying Worley’s scope includes multi-discipline engineering, procurement and construction services to support the project through to a final investment decision.
The Bell Bay Powerfuels project is expected to deliver a 240 MW green hydrogen and green methanol production facility. The hydrogen is to be mainly used as an input for the production of 300,000 tonnes of green methanol per year for the shipping industry.
The facility is scheduled to commence production of green hydrogen by 2028 with Abel aiming to start construction next year.
Still in Tasmania and Countrywide Hydrogen announced it has locked in land on the northwest coast for its proposed Devonport green hydrogen production facility.
Countrywide, which is developing 5 MW green hydrogen production plants near Bell Bay and another near Hobart in the state’s south, is aiming to create an ‘end-to-end’ green hydrogen supply chain from production through to distribution at the Devonport site.
The company said the site is ideally located in close proximity to TasNetworks’ substations and transport hubs that offer multiple offtake opportunities.
The site is expected to be among the initial locations of Countrywide’s planned “Hydrogen HyWay” project that is to include hydrogen fuelling stations dotted from Tasmania’s north to the south.
CountryWide said a final investment decision on the Devonport hydrogen production facility is expected during the first half of 2024.
In Western Australia, Province Resources’ proposed 8 GW HyEnergy green hydrogen project has received welcome support with the local council initiating a planning amendment that would facilitate the project.
The Shire of Carnarvon has proposed a change in zoning for the town common north of Carnarvon which would deem the area appropriate for development of the HyEnergy project.
The proposed amendment covers more than 6,000 hectares of land and has been referred to the state’s planning minister before being reviewed by the Western Australian Environment Protection Authority.
Province plans to build wind and solar farms on the site to support its green hydrogen ambitions. The proposed HyEnergy project comprises up to 8 GW of co-located solar and wind energy which would be used to produce green hydrogen for domestic use and export.
The project is to be developed in two stages with the first phase to deliver up to 5 GW of wind and solar capacity with the generated electricity used to produce approximately 300,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year.
The announcements follow the federal government’s recent commitment to invest $140 million into green hydrogen hubs in Tasmania and Queensland.
The Australian government named Edify Energy to lead the development of a hydrogen hub near Townsville in north Queensland, just days after formalising a $70 million investment to support the development of the Bell Bay Hydrogen Hub in Tasmania.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/05/smart-energy-council-rallies-support-for-federal-governments-new-vehicle-efficiency-standard/,"EV,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-05,Smart Energy Council rallies support for federal government’s New Vehicle Efficiency Standard,"Australia has long been a laggard on vehicle emissions standards. While most advanced economies require car makers to deliver vehicles that comply with emissions and/or fuel consumption standards, and have done so for many years, Australia has avoided doing so.
With the federal government now taking action, in the form of a proposed New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (NVES), the Smart Energy Council is urging its supporters to push for ambitious new standards during the one-month consultation period being provided.
The Smart Energy Council was ebullient in a mail sent to the solar community today: “This could be the most significant policy to reduce Australia’s soaring transport emissions in history! The Albanese Government is seeking your input on the preferred model over the next month. Your opinion is crucial. Access the Impact Analysis and share your thoughts on Cleaner Cars.”
The politics around vehicle emissions standards have been difficult in the past. In 2019, then Prime Minister Scott Morrison attacked Labor’s EV policy by saying that the then opposition wanted to “end the weekend”.
“He wants to say see you later to the SUV when it comes to the choices of Australians,” said Morrison at the time, who announced his retirement from politics this January.
In an apparent attempt to thwart such attacks, the current federal government is pitching its new policy as saving households money on petrol, increasing their choice of vehicles, and reducing emissions in the community.
“Most advanced economies around the world have introduced vehicle efficiency standards. Because Australia has not introduced a vehicle efficiency standard, the nation is being left behind.”
The government has published a consultation paper for its New Vehicle Efficiency Standard online.
The Smart Energy Council is “strongly supporting” the new standard and calling for people to support the “Option C” proposed by the government: “a much more ambitious approach – the Smart Energy Council’s preferred position.”
Smart Energy Council CEO John Grimes personally addressed the community in the email calling for action. “Congratulations again to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Ministers Chris Bowen and Catherine King for this major step forward,” wrote Grimes.
Even without emissions standards in place, hybrid and EV sales are surging in Australia, according to recent figures.
The public consultation period for the NVES closes on March 4.
