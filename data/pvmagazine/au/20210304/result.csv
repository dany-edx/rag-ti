https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/04/1-5-billion-initiative-to-boost-australian-battery-production/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 4, 2021",$1.5 billion initiative to boost Australian battery production,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison unveiled the Federal Government’s Technology Investment Roadmap on Thursday as part of its $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy which aims to leverage Australia’s mineral and resources sector to position the country as a world leader in the transition to renewable energy.
A key element in that transition is energy storage with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identifying it in its 2020 Integrated System Plan as a critical enabler of cost-effective and reliable low-emission electricity. AEMO suggested that up to 19 GW of new dispatchable resources, including battery storage, will be needed to back up renewables in the National Electricity Market (NEM) to 2040.
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said the new roadmap sets out a 10-year vision to build sophisticated manufacturing capability in Australia in the resources sector and shows how businesses can capitalise on Australia’s access to key resources.
“Opportunities outlined in the roadmap include turning critical minerals into high-value products like batteries and solar cells,” she said.
“This funding will back businesses to pursue those opportunities and turn innovative ideas into high-value products so we can build on Australia’s competitive advantage and secure greater investment and market share.”
Energy Renaissance managing director Mark Chilcote said Australia is the only country in the world sitting on all the raw materials needed to make lithium-ion batteries and the new roadmap presents an opportunity to position the country at the forefront of an industry rapidly growing in significance and profitability.
“The Commonwealth Government’s Resources Technology and Critical Minerals Processing Roadmap will increase the value and influence of Australia’s battery industry in the global lithium value chain,” he said.
The Technology Investment Roadmap announcement comes with the demand for resources used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries expected to rise sharply and is intended to provide a pathway for battery raw material processing to take place in Australia.

The announcement comes less than two weeks after the United States announced it will prioritise the domestic consumption and production of critical and rare earth minerals needed for batteries.
“Australia cannot afford to be at the end of a queue for these minerals. There is currently no commercial production of battery-grade materials and chemicals in Australia,” Chilcote said.
“But we will change this in the very near future when Energy Renaissance commences production of its batteries. We will be able to engage with suppliers of Australian nickel, cobalt, manganese, graphite, lithium, aluminium and copper and to use their materials in our batteries.”
The government announcement was delivered at Tomago, in New South Wales’ Hunter Valley where Energy Renaissance is preparing to construct a $28 million manufacturing facility.
The company broke ground for the 4,500 sqm purpose-built facility in October 2020 and a small-scale production of batteries is expected to start by July 2021 with full-scale production expected in October 2021.

It is expected the facility will have an initial battery production capacity of 66 MWh per annum, with plans to scale its Australian operation to 5.3 GWh of energy storage per annum with an additional investment of more than $200 million.
The Australian-made batteries will power stationary (grid and microgrid, renewables, community storage, mining electrification) and transport (buses, light commercial and industrial vehicles) applications. It’s expected that more than half of the batteries produced at the facility will be exported through the Port of Newcastle.
The government’s $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative also opened on Thursday to projects in the priority area, to help manufacturers scale-up production, commercialise products and tap into global supply chains.
“Our $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy is … focused on growing our entire manufacturing sector,” Morrison said.
“Our Modern Manufacturing Initiative will help position Australia as not just a global leader in the resources sector but also in the manufacturing of the technology used, as well as turning the raw materials into value-added products.
“Today’s funding will help unlock investment from industry to help build manufacturing capability and competitiveness in Australia’s resources sector while taking advantage of a significant global growth sector.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/04/overheating-issues-prompt-recall-for-lg-energy-battery-systems/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 4, 2021",Overheating issues prompt recall for LG Energy battery systems,"The ACCC has issued a recall notice for a series of batteries in LG Chem’s recently rebranded energy storage division’s lithium-ion RESU residential range due to the risk of the batteries overheating.
The independent statutory authority said LG Energy Solution’s RESU7H_Type R, RESU10, RESU10H Type-C, RESU10H_Type R, EM048063P3S4 and EM048126P3S7 home batteries were being recalled in Australia due to the risk of batteries overheating and catching fire.
“The affected batteries are equipped with cells from specific production lots manufactured between March 2017 and September 2018,” the ACCC said in a notice published late last week.
“If the batteries overheat, there is an increased risk of fire which may result in an injury or death and/or property damage.”
The ACCC’s move formalises the South Korean battery manufacturer’s voluntary Australian recall issued last month after reports of “thermal events” in the United States.
LG Energy Solution said it had received “isolated reports” about overheating incidents linked to home BESS installations.
“As a precautionary measure and out of an abundance of caution, LG Energy Solution has decided to replace all potentially affected home batteries, equipped with cells from limited specific production lots, free of charge,” the company said in a note on its website.
LG Energy Solution Australia said products included in the recall will be replaced free of charge.
The company said it is also implementing a remote software upgrade for a number of online affected RESU10H Type-R and RESU7H Type-R units to lower the maximum state of charge to 90% until they can be replaced. The upgrade is only applicable to online units which have sufficient online connectivity to be able to receive the software upgrade.
The recall shapes as a setback for LG Energy Solution which has been planning to roll out the third iteration of its RESU home batteries, including “the industry’s largest home battery”, the RESU16H Prime 16 kWh battery pack. The new Prime line-up was scheduled to arrive in Australia later this month.

In another blow for the company, LG Energy Solution is also embroiled in one of the first mass battery pack replacements conducted by a major automaker.
Hyundai has announced it will replace battery systems in some 82,000 electric vehicles (EV) globally at an estimated cost of more than $1.2 billion due to a serious fire risk.
There has been more than a dozen reported fires overseas related to the Hyundai Kona’s battery pack which use LG Chem cells. Hyundai was not aware of any incidents of Kona EVs catching fire in Australia.
The recall applies to nearly 76,000 Kona EVs built between 2018 and 2020. Some Ioniq EV models and Elec City buses are also included in the recall.
Hyundai Australia confirmed it will recall most of the 1001 Kona EVs sold in Australia since their launch two years ago, and many of the 755 fully electric Ioniq cars sold in Australia (but not the hybrid or the plug-in hybrid versions).
Hyundai said the battery system subject to the replacement was manufactured by LG Energy Solutions between November 2017 and March 2020.
Hyundai did not comment on the cause of the fires but suggested the affected vehicles should not be parked in a garage and should ideally be parked in an open space away from flammable materials to minimise further damage if the vehicle does catch fire.
Kona and Ioniq owners are also advised to limit battery charging to 90% of capacity until the battery has been replaced.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/04/province-resources-moves-ahead-with-1-gw-renewable-hydrogen-project/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 4, 2021",Province Resources moves ahead with 1 GW renewable hydrogen project,"Province Resources last month unveiled its HyEnergy Renewable Hydrogen Project, including plans for a 1 GW wind and solar PV facility to be established in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia. The energy from that project will be used to produce approximately 60,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, or up to 300,000 tons of green ammonia.
The Perth-based company, which enjoyed a major boost to its stock price in the wake of the HyEnergy announcement, this week revealed that within four weeks it will deploy a monitoring station at the proposed site to accelerate data collection required to support feasibility studies.
Province Resources managing director David Frances said the data collected will enable the proposed solar array network and wind turbines to be optimised prior to the final project scope and scale decision point.
“It is great to be able to hit the ground running on the exciting HyEnergy green hydrogen project,” he said.
“I look forward to progressing the feasibility studies as quickly as possible, whilst also planning the initial fieldwork programs to assess the salt, potash and mineral sands target areas within the greater Gascoyne Project.”
Province has declared the proposed location, near Canarvon in the state’s north-west, is ideal for the development of a large-scale renewable energy facility but said the monitoring station, provided by Sydney-based technology company Fulcrum3D, will collect preliminary wind and solar data every 10 minutes within the project area to assess the wind and solar resource potential.
Data already provided by Province indicates Canarvon’s solar is amongst the highest irradiance in the world, averaging 211 sunny days per year with an average solar exposure of 22 Mj or 6.24 kWh per day. And, due to being on the western edge of the continent, it has excellent wind resources.
Many developers of solar farms have avoided on-the-ground resource monitoring, opting to rely on satellite data alone but Province said it is crucial accurate solar data is captured for the specific site location for such large capital investments to build a solar array network of commercial scale.

The company said it will utilise Fulcrum3D’s Sodar (Sonic Detection and Ranging) weather monitoring system.
Fulcrum3D general manager Jo Hume told pv magazine reliable data is essential for effective project design and management – from both a technical and financial point of view.
“Accurate resource assessment for wind and solar energy developments is critical for bankability and risk management and for ensuring optimal power plant design,” she said.
“Bankers and asset owners do not welcome unpleasant surprises around project yield once the project is built. Accurate ground-based solar resource assessment is proving to generate more accurate yield assessments than satellite-based assessments.”
Fulcrum3D said there are now more than 170 Sodar units in operation around the world, with each one tailored to site specific project requests.
Province said it will look to commence feasibility studies for both the renewable power generation and green hydrogen production within the next 12-18 months.
Green hydrogen has dominated renewables news this year, with Australia eager to position itself as a key exporter of hydrogen.
Province acknowledged the hydrogen industry is in its infancy in Western Australia, but said in a statement “it is truly amazing how swift and significant the move into sustainable energy by both governments and corporations around the globe has been of late”.
“Green hydrogen produced from renewable sources, such as wind and solar energy, looks set to play a significant role in navigating society towards a decarbonised future and meeting the global aim of net zero emissions by 2050,” it said.

“A Mars a day,” as the confectioner has often said, “helps you work, rest and play”, but seeing as the company is now moving to offset 100% of the power at its six factories and two offices it might be said that utilising the solar energy of the day, helps them work, rest and play. 
Mars’s decision comes in an attempt to meet its global sustainability goals, which seek to reduce the company’s global greenhouse gas emissions by 27% by 2025, and 60% by 2050. 
This is no small task, either globally or in Australia specifically, where Mars consumed over 850 GWh of electricity in 2020. To meet these goals in Australia, Mars has signed a major power purchase agreement (PPA) with Total Eren’s 200 MW Kiamal Solar Farm in Ouyen, Victoria.

“The Kiamal Solar Farm is a unique project,” said Michael Vawser, Asia Pacific regional director at Total Eren, “not only because it is the biggest solar farm in the state of Victoria but also because it is backed by four PPAs and one large-scale Generation Certificate (LGC) contract, all to highly valued companies: Mars Australia, Alinta Energy, FlowPower, Zero Emissions Water and Origin Energy.” 
By that distribution of PPAs, 50 MW of the Kiamal Solar Farm will be generating for Mars, which is enough to produce 30 million 3kg bags of Pedigree and 185 million 180g bags of peanut M&Ms.

Bill Heague, general manager Mars Food Australia, said he was proud to make the switch to 100% renewable electricity. “At Mars, we believe business, government, and individuals must work together to take meaningful action on climate change. This move ensures we are playing our part to create a better world for future generations.” 
“We know consumers want to see action on climate change,” Heague continued, “With the majority of Mars produced enjoyed by Aussies being made here, our transition to renewable electricity not only makes sense for our business and the planet, it also means Australians can feel even better about buying Mars products – and that is something I am personally thrilled about.” 
Unfortunately there is still nothing that can make Australians feel better after having eaten Mars products, except exercise. 
Unhostile corporate takeover 
As Greenpeace’s REenergise campaign director Lindsey Soutar made note, a move toward renewables and sustainable practices by a corporation the size of Mars is demonstrable of a larger shift in corporate Australia towards renewable energy and emissions reduction. 
“Mars is shifting the dial on corporate renewable energy commitments” said Soutar, “and showing that stepping up to tackle emissions isn’t just good for the climate – it’s a sweat deal for business too.” 
The notion was seconded by RE100 Australia coordinator, Jon Dee, who said that Mars, one of the earliest members of RE100, “isn’t just reducing its impact on the environment, it’s also setting a great role model for other companies…In light of Australia’s fluctuating energy costs, it’s a sound business decision for Mars to invest in that amount of solar power. Other companies in Australia need to follow that lead.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/04/origin-energy-launches-one-stop-shop-for-ev-fleet-transition/,"EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 4, 2021",Origin Energy launches “one-stop shop” for EV fleet transition,"On a day in which Swedish-Chinese car company Volvo announced that it will only be selling 100% electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, Origin Energy and Custom Fleet announced that they’re teaming up to provide a solution to EV fleet transition in Australia. 
Origin 360 EV Fleet is being branded by Origin Energy as a “one-stop shop for EV fleet procurement, management and charging.” A possible solution to the slow EV uptake in Australia, particularly among fleet cars, which make up almost half of all new vehicle sales in Australia. 
The idea is to take all the stress away from fleet business customers by fully arranging their EV transition, charging infrastructure, load management and carbon neutral travel through carbon offsets. 
Tony Lucas, executive general manager of Future Energy at Origin, said that “Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require action across our economy, particularly transportation which is the third largest source of emissions in the country, making accelerating the uptake of EVs in Australia a crucial piece of the puzzle.” 
Shifting to EVs, as Lucas makes clear, should not be a difficult decision, “EVs are cheaper to run, allowing Origin to help businesses to reduce their operating costs.” 
“Origin is ideally placed to support businesses to electrify their transportation,” Lucas continued, “with Origin 360 EV Fleet a natural extension of the range of clean energy products and services we already provide to our business customers, including solar and battery solutions.” 
This is not the first time Origin and Custom Fleet have teamed up, after working together on Origin’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) funded EV smart charging trial last year. The ongoing two-year trial provided 150 smart chargers to current EV owners and EV fleet managers, connecting them to Origin’s virtual power plant (VPP) platform — an initiative it pioneered in late 2018 with the Victorian Labor Government.
According to Origin’s half FY results, release in February, the company has installed 38 MW of residential and commercial solar in this half year, representing a 47% increase from HY2020. It is hoped that this figure will continue to rise, especially if commercial solar solutions are provided in tandem with fleet transitions to EVs. 
“This strategic agreement with Origin will very much combine the strengths and expertise in each of our respective businesses” said Aaron Baxter, CEO of Custom Fleet Australia and New Zealand, “and place us at the forefront to help even more Australian businesses achieve their sustainability goals.” 
Origin is also walking the walk insofar as it has joined EV100 and committed to transition its own 600-strong fleet of cars to EVs by 2030.

Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow announced that a 350 MW solar power plant was grid-connected in Loc Ninh County, in the Vietnamese southern province of Binh Phuoc.
The project, which is currently Vietnam‘s second-largest operational PV plant, was built under Vietnam’s feed-in tariff scheme and is now selling power at a tariff of $0.0709 per kWh. The annual revenue generated by the solar park, which should produce around 700 GWh per year, is estimated at approximately $49.6 million.
“The owner of the plant is Thailand-based Super Energy,” a Sunrow’s spokesperson told pv magazine.
Construction on the facility, which was built with Sungrow’s central inverter solutions, had started in May. “Sungrow supplied the updated 6.25 MW turnkey solution, which integrates central inverters, the medium-voltage transformer and more devices in a 40-ft container, minimising the cost of transportation and O&M,” the manufacturer said. “The solution features off-grid commissioning function, ensuring a shorter commissioning duration.”
Vietnam‘s largest solar power plant is a 450 MW facility completed by Ho Chi Minh City-based construction company Trungnam Group in October.

Australia-based hydrogen specialist Enegix Energy is planning to build a green hydrogen plant on 500 hectares of commercial land in the Port of Pecém, in the Brazilian, northeastern state of Ceará.
The company said that a memorandum of understanding for the ‘Base One’ project was signed in mid-February with the state governor Camilo Santana and that the planned facility should generate over 600 million kilograms of green hydrogen per year.
“Enegix’s planned next-generation facility will be run completely using renewable energy, with zero emissions, and will harness the great renewable energy potential that Ceará has available, with solar and onshore and offshore wind to be realised, allowing Base One to be expanded to over 100 GW to meet global demand,” the Australian company said in a statement.
The US$5.4 billion plant is expected to be powered by around 3.4 GW of combined wind and solar capacity, which Enegix Energy said has already been contracted with Brazilian renewable energy company Enerwind. The chosen location is claimed to have direct access to all major international markets via ocean freight. 
“Our partnership with the Ceará state government is a major milestone for the company. Base One will turn Ceará into a major hydrogen export location and establish Enegix as a global renewable power producer aligning with our vision and strategy to replace expensive, high-emission power grids with renewable, baseload, and cost-effective zero-carbon grids,” Enegix Energy CEO Wesley Cooke stated.
The company has recently hired an unnamed international engineering firm for the feasibility study on the project and is currently seeking investors through an open capital round. The hydrogen plant construction may require up to four years.
The Brazilian state of Ceará is currently seeing strong development of unsubsidised PV projects linked to power purchase agreements. The region has very favourable climatic conditions for solar power projects.
