The BOI of the Philippines, an agency under the Department of Trade and Industry, has granted a green lane certificate to a solar project in the municipality of Burgos, Pangasinan province.
The certificate was awarded to Burgos Pangasinan Solar Energy Corp. (BPSEC), a development company under Rising Renewables Holdings, to develop the PHP 2.7 billion ($48 million) project.
The 65 MW ground-mounted solar plant will cover an area of approximately 71.5 hectares and is scheduled to operate from September 2026. It is expected to generate more than 500 local jobs.
The project has already been granted a Solar Energy Operation Contract by the Department of Energy of the Philippines.
“With the BOI’s support, we look forward to collaborating with all the concerned local and national agencies in the completion of the project’s permitting requirements and in achieving our shared goal of getting more clean energy into the grid as early as we can,” said Kyle A. Mina, a representative for BPSEC.
The Philippines has set a target of achieving a 35% share of renewable energy in the country’s power generation mix by 2030. In January, pv magazine reported that work was underway on a 4 GW solar park in the northern Philippines.

The disruption to Victoria’s electricity network occurred on Tuesday, Feb. 13. Severe winds knocked over several high-voltage electricity transmission towers, causing all four units of the Loy Yang A coal-fired power station to trip and go offline.
Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio described the blackout as “one of the largest outage events in the state’s history”.
The event has prompted questions about the reliability of the state’s electricity grid. But it’s important to note these extreme winds would have seriously disrupted any power system. It has little to do with the mix of renewable energy and conventional fossil fuels.
As climate change worsens, we have much work ahead to ensure our electricity grids cope with severe weather events. But in this case, the fact that a complete system blackout was avoided is testament to the resilience of the system.

An extreme storm, including strong winds and lightning, tore through Victoria on Tuesday afternoon. It caused two transmission lines near Geelong to collapse, prompting several generators to disconnect from the grid and cutting power to parts of the network.
Other customers lost power after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) ordered “load shedding”. This involves temporarily cutting off electricity supply to some customers to keep the network stable and prevent damage.
According to a statement from AEMO, the storm also damaged hundreds of powerlines and power poles and restoring electricity to all customers “may take days if not weeks”
The disruption to electricity transmission caused AGL’s Loy Yang A generator to go offline. This was an automatic response known as a “fault ride-through” mechanism. It’s much like a fuse blowing if you have a short-circuit at home.
When large electricity loads are rapidly and unexpectedly removed from the system, electricity supply and demand are no longer matched. It’s a dangerous situation and means electricity generators can be badly damaged or even destroyed if they don’t disconnect from the network.
It appears that Loy Yang A was the first generator to disconnect. The effect was to reduce supply and help bring the system back into balance, preventing a system-wide outage.
All generators have protection systems that stop them from being damaged in these kinds of events. Loy Yang A tripped up to protect itself from permanent damage and in doing so actually kept the system stable. It did what the system is designed to do.
When transmission lines fail, the whole system is affected. This includes all types of generators – wind, solar, gas, hydro and coal. The power outages on Tuesday were unrelated to the proportion of renewables and fossil fuels in the energy mix.
It’s possible that old coal power generators are more sensitive to transmission disruptions than newer technologies. But it’s far too early to say whether this had anything to do with Tuesday’s event.
Battery storage may have helped steady the grid. Batteries have ultra-rapid responses to these kinds of disuptions and can add or subtract power from the grid within milliseconds to keep the grid stable.
And looking ahead, one benefit of renewable energy systems is that they tend to be much more widely “distributed” geographically than coal generators. So when power lines go out, having a more distributed network actually provides more resilience.
In September 2016, wind storms in South Australia also blew over transmission lines. Cascading disconnections by generators meant the entire grid went black in a matter of seconds, causing a statewide outage.
It will take months to analyse all the data from the Victorian blackout. But it may well show that the lessons learned from SA blackout saved the Victorian grid.
For example, AEMO was reportedly unaware about the exact settings of “fault ride-through” mechanisms on wind farms before the SA blackouts. This has since changed, and may have helped minimise the impacts in Victoria.
We know more severe weather events are predicted under climate change. It will manifest in many different ways: strong wind events, heatwaves, bushfires and floods.
All infrastructure, but especially energy infrastructure, is vulnerable under these conditions. It means all of us – researchers, the market operators, and generator operators – must work hard to make energy systems more resilient as we move into an uncertain future.

Initially installed by PowerPlus Energy and Springers Solar in 2010 on K’Gari, formerly Fraser Island, 360 km north of Brisbane, the system included a 24 V off-grid solar and battery system, eight 900 Ah Raylite wet cell batteries configured for a total storage capacity of 43 kWh and a 2.5 kW Selectronic inverter.
In 2010, the two-bedroom home required a reliable source of energy to power lighting, refrigeration, a hot water system, and internet, and have enough power to cover daily consumption requirements without needing to micro-manage usage.
Springers Solar said the first Generation 2.5 kW Selectronic Inverter charger operated reliably to convert solar energy harnessed from the PV array into a viable power source for the residence with the total usable capacity of the battery system at 8.6 kWh per day or 20% of the rated capacity of the total battery setup.
Recent upgrades have changed the game for the household. The upgrades began in 2023 and include 430 W Trina Solar Vertex S+ modules, 40 of them in total, covering the north-east facing roof for a total solar capacity of 17.2 kW. The modules are designed to be resilient in the face of harsh environmental conditions.
Ten 48 V 4 kWh PowerPlus Eco4840P lithium-ion batteries for a total storage capacity of 40 kWh, is coupled with a 48 V 7.5 kW Selectronic battery inverter coupled with Fronius Primo solar inverters for 13.2 kW of combined power conversion capacity. The system utilizes an AC-coupled configuration, for handling substantial AC loads, and remote monitoring through Select.Live, for real-time performance metrics to complete the improvements.
At the core of the power system is PowerPlus Eco4840P lithium-ion batteries, installed in a PowerPlus Slimline PEF12 IP54 wall cabinet – with a total lithium storage capacity of 40 kWh. The system enables a daily cycling of up to 32 kWh, ensuring consistent and continuous power supply.
The batteries’ high depth of discharge capability provides a reliable power source for approximately five days during adverse weather conditions, enhancing system autonomy.
The technical transition on the battery chemistry side, from wet cell to lithium-ion technology, signifies a significant advancement in energy storage and contributes to the system’s overall efficiency and reliability, said PowerPlus Energy.
The upgraded K’Gari system provides continuous access to solar energy, effectively powering the home day and night, highlighting the integration possibilities of cutting-edge technologies for long-term energy solutions.
The huge technological improvement that has been achieved in less than 14 years, from first install in 2010 to today on K’Gari, demonstrates how much more is possible and the bright future ahead.

Corporations globally announced 46 GW of solar and wind PPAs in 2023, according to the latest report from BloombergNEF.
The figure represents a record high in a calendar year and a 12% year-on-year increase from 2022. The global PPA market has now grown by about one-third on average since 2015.
BloombergNEF said improving economics in key regions such as Europe, alongside imminent company clean energy goals, were the main drivers.
“It has never been easier to buy clean energy as a corporation,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability for BloombergNEF. “For the first time, a variety of contracting structures are now widely available around the world to help companies decarbonise their energy consumption. These contracts are now the centerpiece in many companies’ sustainability strategies, rather than a nice-to-have.”
Between 2022 and 2023, Europe saw its corporate PPA volumes grow 74% to 15.4 GW – by far the largest growth of any region. BloombergNEF said that as “supply chain woes eased and gas balances normalised following the region’s energy crisis in 2022, corporate PPA prices in the region dropped, often faster than power prices.”
The United States remained the largest market for PPAs, with 17.3 GW of deals announced, but was 16% down year on year on the record 20.6 GW achieved in 2022.
BloombergNEF said that economics for signing PPAs were weaker in the United States than in Europe in 2023.
“Power prices didn’t rise at the same rates, resulting in buyers holding off on signing deals until the market recalibrates,” said BloombergNEF.
Amazon was the world’s largest corporate clean energy buyer for the fourth consecutive year. It announced 8.8 GW of PPAs across 16 countries, including 5.6 GW of solar PPAs. Amazon was followed by Meta, which announced 3.1 GW of PPAs, all in solar.
BloombergNEF said companies with 100% clean energy targets under the RE100 initiative will need an additional 105 GW of solar and wind by 2030.
“With the rise of artificial intelligence, electrification of transport and increased need for manufacturing, we expect power demand from the private sector to surge in the coming years,” said Harrison. “Clean energy, especially through PPAs, will likely be many companies’ first, best option.”
Companies signed deals with more than 150 developer counterparts in 2023. French utility Engie led the way, selling 2.4 GW of deals. It was the first time Engie topped the leaderboard since 2019.
Earlier this year, a report by Mercom Capital Group found that solar companies raised $34.3 billion in corporate funding in 2023 – the largest amount in a decade.
