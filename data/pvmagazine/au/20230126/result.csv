The 100 MW/400 MWh Coleambally battery energy storage system, which is currently open for community feedback after Risen submitted a State Significant Development application for the project, is to be located adjacent to French renewable energy giant Neoen’s operational 150 MW Coleambally Solar Farm and would connect to NSW network operator TransGrid’s Coleambally Substation.
Risen said the big battery, valued at more than $30 million, would support renewable energy generation and increase the reliability of the grid as the nation transitions from its historical reliance on large-scale coal-fired generation.
“The proposal would benefit the electricity grid by balancing the network through the addition of energy storage,” the company said. “This stored energy would be utilised during periods of low renewable output into the energy grid.”
Risen said this is especially important during NSW’s transition from centralised to decentralised power generation with four of the five coal-fired power stations in the state expected to close within 15 years, starting with the Liddell Power Station which is to be shut down in less than three months.

The proposed Coleambally battery storage facility would provide storage capacity to the Coleambally Solar Farm – which has the ability to deliver close to 400 GWh of renewable electricity to the grid annually – increasing “the stability and reliability of the renewable energy supply in the area.”
“By co-locating the project adjacent to the existing solar farm and substation, it builds on and consolidates the area as a hub of renewable energy activity,” Risen said.
The project is to be built on an approximately 5-hectare site about 10 kilometres north-east of Coleambally and would consist of up to 40 blocks of battery systems, a transformer and about 1km of 132 kV transmission line routing to the Coleambally Substation.
It is anticipated the construction and commissioning phase would take about eight to 10 months and would generate employment for a construction workforce of 80. The project has an estimated operational life of 35 to 40 years, with the option for extensions.

The Coleambally battery is part of a growing pipeline of renewable energy generation and storage Risen is pursuing in Australia.
Risen said it will continue to develop and invest in renewable energy projects in Australia with a target of developing 3 GW and delivering 1 GW renewable projects by 2027.
This includes the 200 MW/400 MWh Bungama battery energy storage system project being developed near Port Pirie in South Australia.
The project, which received developmental approval in 2021 and is currently going through grid connection approval, is one of eight grid-scale battery projects to have recently been granted funding by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/26/scientists-source-silicon-from-solar-waste-to-build-better-batteries/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 26, 2023",Scientists source silicon from solar waste to build better batteries,"Scientists from Deakin University’s Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) have developed what they say is a sustainable method to extract silicon from solar panel waste and reconfigure it into nano-silicon which is then used to make high-energy anodes for lithium-ion batteries.
Silicon makes up a relatively small proportion of a solar panel cell and until now it has been difficult to extract that silicon and reduce it down to its nano particles without using hazardous chemicals like hydrochloric acid and nitric acid.
Material scientists Mokhlesur Rahman and Ying Chen, director of the ARC Research Hub for Safe and Reliable Energy, which is based at the IFM in Geelong, said they have developed a thermal and chemical process to extract the silicon from solar waste that is cheap, effective and safe for the environment.
The process then takes the purified silicon and reduces its size to nanoscale using a ball-milling process. Again, without the need for toxic chemicals.
The nano-silicon is then mixed with graphite to create a battery anode that the researchers said has been shown to increase lithium-ion battery capacity by a factor of 10.
“We are using that nano-silicon to develop low-cost battery materials that will help deliver the higher-performing, longer-lasting, affordable battery technology critically needed to drive Australia’s clean energy transition,” Rahman said.

The scientists said the process, which they have been investigating since 2019 and have repeatedly tested and reviewed to prove it can work and be scaled up for commercial use, is key to repurposing discarded solar cells and will prevent high-value waste from going to landfill.
“Solar panel cells are fabricated using high-value silicon but this material cannot be re-used without purification as it becomes highly contaminated over the 25 to 30 years of the panel’s life,” Rahman said.
“We have developed a process that returns silicon collected from used cells to greater than 99% purity, within a day and without the need for dangerous chemicals.”
Rahman said the process is far greener, cheaper, and more efficient than any other technique currently on the market and represents a breakthrough that could make recycling solar panels far more economically viable.
The current market price for nano-silicon is about $45,000 per kilo, compared to about $650 for regular silicon.
The IFM team estimate its technique could generate more than $20 billion in material recovery if extrapolated to the 78 million tonnes of solar panel waste expected to be generated globally by 2050.
Chen said the process – including purification, nano-silicon production and integration into new battery technology – “is a giant leap forward in how we tackle the problem of solar panel waste.”
“Silicon recovered from end-of-life solar panels can be a massive, sustainable source of nano-silicon to meet future demand for raw battery materials. Helping to power the homes, transport and communities of the future,” he said.
It is forecast that more than 100,000 tonnes of end-of-life solar panels will enter Australia’s waste stream by 2035.

Researchers led by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria have suggested the use of regenerative braking to store renewable energy at decommissioned mining sites.
Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that takes the wasted energy from the process of slowing down a vehicle.
The proposed underground gravity energy storage (UGES) concept consists of lowering sand into an underground mine and lifting this sand to an upper reservoir via electric motors to store energy at moments of low power demand.
“UGES uses regenerative braking to adjust the descent speed of the sand in the mine shaft and generate electricity,” researcher Zakeri Benham told pv magazine. “It has the advantage of making use of existing infrastructure and providing clean, cheap, and long-duration energy storage with no material intensity, on top of being already close to the electricity grid and roads.”
The system consists of a shaft with variable depths and diameters, a motor/generator, upper and lower storage sites, and mining equipment.
“To maximise power capacity, the sand containers in the shaft occupy approximately 50% of the shaft’s volume,” the scientists said. “The other 50% of space is required for filling and emptying the containers with sand.”
The charging mode consists of collecting sand from the lower storage site at the bottom of the mine with excavators and transporting the sand to the shaft with electric trucks or conveyor belts. Energy is stored using cheap or excess electricity from the grid or a large solar PV farm nearby to pull the sand up via the shaft with the motors/generators. After the sand reaches the top of the mine, the sand is stored in sand piles.
