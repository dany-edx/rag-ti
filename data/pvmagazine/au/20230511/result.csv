All of the hopefuls are working with lithium-based chemistries, and the vast majority manufacture in China. 
How ready each company is to enter the market varied significantly, with some tentatively scoping Australia’s battery landscape and searching for distribution partners, while others had established teams and strategies here. 
Among the newcomers were a handful of Australian companies, though most of these are catering to larger commercial and industrial (C&I) applications as well as off-grid solutions, which pv magazine Australia has covered in a seperate article. Chinese brands, on the other hand, seem to be more focused on home and portable battery markets, covered here. 
Alongside these two streams are a few international players, as well as solar giants moving into storage. Many newcomers had not set their Australian price points yet, with a number of representatives reporting they were waiting for the latest update on Tesla’s Powerwall prices, presumably looking to retail for less while still maximising profit potential.

Some new entrants had clearly clocked the growing competition and were entering Australia with a bang – most notably Franklinwh with its ‘buy one get one free’ offer running until September.
In the last six months, Vaulta has launched its 5 kWh and 14 kWh battery products. It has also just opened its manufacturing plant in Brisbane, the startup’s founder Dominic Spooner told pv magazine Australia. The facility employs around seven staff and has the capacity to produce 30 to 50 batteries per month. 
Vaulta is unique in the Australian battery market because, unlike other companies, its model revolves around designing for repair and recyclability. In other words, it has centre-pieced circularity in a way few other companies today do. “It all goes back to design. You design out the waste,” Spooner said. The company’s batteries are cylindrical and prismatic, which Spooner says work just as well and can also be easily disassembled. This circular design concept, Spooner says, has also helped the company push down its costs, since it only needs to price in the potential cost of repairing its battery systems rather than replacing them.
Where possible, Vaulta buys local products, though its cells are sourced from Eve – one of the more popular cell manufacturers. Spooner is aiming to have Vaulta’s batteries certified under the IEC international safety standard by midyear.
The third generation of Enphase’s IQ home battery is set to land in Australia in July, making it the first region outside the company’s home US market to see the system. The batteries feature triple the peak power and double the continuous power of the previous model, and boast a number of interesting features.
This Norwegian brand has been retailing bidirectional inverters and working in the community battery space in Australia for some years now, but it is looking to launch its residential battery, the Pixii Home, into the Australian market in the next 12 months. Its CEO, Kenneth Bodahl, told pv magazine Australia the Pixii Home had already sold out to European markets, so while it may arrive on Australian shores in Q4, it will more likely be 2024.
The residential battery comes with a few significant points of difference – the most important being that its smart home features come as standard. This is because Pixii is part of a bigger group, L-tech Holdings, which owns another company developing smart home technologies. Complete home energy optimisation and management come at an additional charge within Pixii’s app.
The battery has a three-phase configuration, DC-connection and is scalable up to 20 kW/ 20 kWh.
With the most competitive gimmick on show, Frankinwh is offering Australian installers and retailers an early bird ‘buy one get one free’ offer if they install a system before September 30. The product range will be available in Australia from July, and the offer extends to Franklinwh’s aPower and aGate, its battery and controller systems. Franklinwh’s batteries can be scaled up to 15 modules for a maximum storage capacity of 203 kWh, though residential batteries are the primary target.
Franklinwh has its US headquarters in San Francisco, and its team of over 300 global employees design the battery systems which are manufactured in Shenzhen, China. The company was founded in 2019 and has been delivering to the US market from early 2022. Franklinwh uses CATL cells and is yet to set a definite price for Australia, but said this will be finalised by July. The company is not seeking to market directly to consumers in Australia, but rather wants to enter the market via distributors, representatives said.
The company seems to be sitting in something of a grey area since it has been selling its systems in Australia for the last three years, but is only just now in the process of getting Clean Energy Council approval for storage products. The company expects that approval to come through in the coming months, representatives said, and with that it is hoping for greater uptake in Australia.
Cyclen focusses on battery manufacturing, though it was not clear if this extended to the cell level. The company’s batteries mainly seem to sell under other manufacturer’s branding, with the booth even promoting how simply its systems could be rebranded. 
DHDC is bringing a new home battery to the Australian market with a capacity of 5.12 kWh, stackable up to 15 units, its representatives said. The company seems to have been selling portable batteries in Australia a little longer, but is looking to move into more lucrative markets. Its representatives said it is looking for Australian distributors for the residential batteries.
Ecoflow has already been selling portable batteries in the Australian market, but late last year launched its home battery solution, called EcoFlow Power Kits. The company seems to have brought its experience making portable batteries to its residential offering which takes ‘modularity’ to a new level. The home batteries, which are stackable for up to 15 kWh of storage, can literally be unplugged and taken away, for instance on holiday or for a day at the beach. The Power Kits have a max AC output of 3600 Watts and are now available Australia.
While the company is targeting the residential home battery market, its main focus seems to be portable battery systems for camping and ‘van life.’
With most of its products branded ‘Toyo,’ this company has a rather expansive range it’s hoping to bring to Australia, from low voltage to high voltage home batteries up to small commercial. It is one of the few Chinese brands that had set its prices. For instance, its high voltage home battery with a capacity of 10 kWh wholesales for around $3600. Meanwhile, its low voltage range wholesales under $1000 (presumably these are Australian dollars, though this wasn’t specified on the datasheet). 
Again, the company is looking for a distribution partner in Australia. Its representatives said the company manufactures cells as well as integrated battery systems, and is already exporting to European, North American and African countries.
Ezy has been manufacturing its own cells since 2007, according to the company’s representatives. It is offering 5 kWh single phase batteries which are stackable to a maximum capacity of 30 kWh. By the end of the year, the company is hoping to be offering a three-phase battery which will stack in 10 kWh units, and will also cater to small commercial customers. It is also looking to enter the utility-scale battery market in the coming year, the representative said.
Ezy has already expanded into a number of European markets, including Germany and Italy, as well as North America. It is yet to finalise its wholesale prices for Australia.
A representative for the company said it had developed its energy storage system range around 18 months ago, but the Sydney expo was Hinen’s first time bringing its products to Australian shores. They also said the company is actually producing its own battery cells, rather than simply manufacturing the systems. Its range includes residential battery systems and portable power systems.
Hoenergy is a fairly new company, founded in Shanghai in 2021. It is manufacturing battery systems and inverters and uses Rept battery cells – all of which have been combined into its low voltage residential system, though it also offers a separated kit. Currently, it has a 10 kWh system and hopes to have a 30 kWh battery on the market by the end of this year, its representatives said. The company is currently in the process of getting CEC certification, its team said, and then will seek to base a team here in Australia. The price point for its batteries will be determined after that period, representatives said.
Australia is this Chinese company’s first target market in its global expansion. Its representatives said the company is aiming to set up a small team here, and is currently looking for a place to do so. Jevier is also looking for distribution and installation partners in Australia.
In terms of its products, the company is targeting both the residential and utility energy storage segments. It has a ‘all in one’ system, which includes an inverter and battery management system in its products. Its residential storage systems have a capacity of 8 kW/15 kWh. Jevier also has a system geared more towards the C&I segment at 22.5 kW/45 kWh.
One of Australia’s most popular solar brands, the company launched its residential battery in 2022. Like a number of other major players, it is seeking to have a ‘full stack’ product suite. Leo Ye, Jinko Australia’s Regional Sales Manager, described the move as a “natural evolution” for the brand, giving customers the ease of a single point of contact by having all their home energy equipment made by the same manufacturer.
Jinko is offering a split unit with the battery and inverter sold separately for flexibility. The current storage inverter is a single phase 5 kW offering, though the company already has a roadmap towards bigger capacities and three-phase options. In terms of the storage component, Jinko’s offering scales at 2.5 kWh increments. A residential solution with a 5 kW inverter and 10 kWh of battery storage wholesales for under $7,000, Ye said.
Jinko’s next battery evolution, a ‘concept product’ design for which was already on display at the expo, is considerably slicker and more compact. The company is currently collecting feedback on the design concept, Ye said. Jinko is also seeking to move into the industrial segment, with keen eyes on the growing market for community batteries. 
Chinese battery cell and system manufacturers, the company is now looking to expand its Australian reach and is targeting the residential segment. It has an agent in Melbourne, EV Power, its representatives said.
Another recently formed company, Raja New Energy is focussed on the residential segment with batteries stackable for capacities of 5 kWh to a maximum of 30 kWh. It seemed as though the company was geared up to sell its systems under different brand names, and was looking for Australian distributors.
Around six months ago, Chinese inverter company GoodWe launched its high voltage residential battery which can pair with its single-phase hybrid inverter and three-phase model. The batteries are scaleable up to 30 kW, with the inverters’ rating moving up in 5 kW increments. 
GoodWe also recently launched its commercial battery, which starts at 101 kW and can be scaled to 450 kW. The system works with GoodWe’s 50 kW hybrid inverters.
GoodWe Australia’s Marketing Manager, John Wright, and its country manager, Dean Williamson, said the battery cells are the only component in the system GoodWe doesn’t manufacture itself (it uses Eve cells), with the battery management system also developed in-house.
Established in 2007 in China, the company is now trying to break into Australia market and is currently looking for Australian partners to retail its products here. The company offers residential battery systems, portable systems and batteries specifically to be used for marine applications like boating.
The Smart Energy expo seemed to be more of a scoping exercise for Topa, with representatives saying the company ‘may be’ looking for an Australian distributor. The company seems to manufacture both battery cells and integrated system and is focussed mainly on portable batteries with some home battery products.
Wincle has been around for 12 years in China, but the expo was its first foray into Australia. A representative said the company is looking for an importer and distributor in Australia and is hoping to cater to both the residential and C&I segments. The company already has a presence in the US, Germany, Italy, Spain and other European markets, its representative said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/11/green-hydrogen-funding-a-step-forward-but-a-step-doesnt-win-race/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MAY 11, 2023",Green hydrogen funding a step forward – but a step doesn’t win race,"Two years ago, the hydrogen announcement in Tuesday night’s federal budget might have been more significant. But since then, Russia’s war on Ukraine has driven ever-faster moves to shore up energy security by going green. France, for instance, will invest $14.6 billion in hydrogen. The United States is offering tax credits equivalent to over $4 per kilo of green hydrogen produced.
Since Labor took office, they’ve spruiked Australia as a renewable energy superpower. On solar and wind that’s true – we’re world leaders. But solar and wind are mature technologies. Green hydrogen is not. We’re still working out the best way to do it.
That means you can’t simply allocate $2 billion and expect an entirely new industry to be created. One reason is we don’t have the pipeline of expertise yet – green hydrogen engineers or experts in the electrolysers which crack water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. It will take time and investment to develop local capabilities.
Image: Jim Chalmers
On paper, yes. There are now many projects across Australia, with different levels of progress and ambition. Iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest is betting heavily on green hydrogen with his Fortescue Future Industries company.
It could work – and work well. As coal and gas come out of our power production and cheap solar and wind rush in, we could use cheap daytime energy to crack water and produce hydrogen.
But it’s not guaranteed. It’s not like iron ore, where we have the advantage of large regions of red earth full of ore. There’s nothing special about hydrogen. You don’t have to dig it up. As long as you have access to the technology, the know-how and water, you can make it.
Across the US, Japan, Korea, China and the European Union, everyone is racing ahead. They see the long game – hydrogen will be useful, but only if it’s cheap and safe. That’s why they’re all heavily subsidising the industry.
Why are subsidies needed? Because the technology is still relatively new. Solar cells have been perfected over 40 years. While electrolysers – the key production technology – are well known, they’re currently too expensive. Storage, too, has to get better so we can safely use this flammable gas.
Labor’s $2 billion in subsidies is necessary. You can see the need clearly in the fact that, to date, these startup companies don’t have anyone to buy their product as yet. That’s one reason why South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas is in Germany at the moment, pitching his state’s product.
Subsidies are important. Many industries in their infancy rely on them. In fact, Australia’s place as the top liquefied natural gas exporter came about from early subsidies. But they’re not enough by themselves.
What we need is a high-level strategy, hashing out how to actually make this happen.
Here are some key problems we have to solve to make green hydrogen a reality in Australia:
1. Get expertise out of academia. To date, almost all hydrogen experts work in universities. Like me, they may consult to industry. But there’s still a big gap to overcome to ensure the green hydrogen industry has in-house expertise to make their product a commercial reality.
2. Build an ecosystem. Let’s say you want to install a large electrolyser. Who is able to certify that it meets Australian standards? Who is able to test it works under Australian conditions? It’s not as simple as install this machine and churn out green hydrogen at $2 a kilogram. The whole ecosystem needs to be built.
3. Create a domestic market. If we don’t have domestic buyers, it’s hard to jump to export volumes.
4. Make sure it’s safe. Storing a flammable gas is something we’re still figuring out. One answer is to convert it to ammonia for shipping and back to hydrogen at the other end. But the work is still being done. A better answer may to be start accelerating the development of solid state hydrogen storage.
Yes. There’s a lot of scepticism about the need for green hydrogen. But in tackling climate change, we will need it. Fuel cell cars, buses and trucks don’t have to rely on batteries which slowly degrade over time.

Green hydrogen will also be needed to decarbonise industries such as steelmaking.
And we will probably need green hydrogen as a way to store energy long term. Once it’s stored, you can keep it indefinitely and use it when you need it. It could be a good complement to solar, wind and storage. Plus, green hydrogen can produce heat for industrial processes.
Like it or not, Australia is in a race to secure part of this new market. We export gas and coal, but their time is ending. Think of how Taiwan went early to secure a lead in making the silicon chips on which so much of the world’s economy relies.
If we want to be competitive, we have to act decisively and fast. Yes, the budget announcement is a step forward. But a step doesn’t win a race.

This year, solar giant Jinko followed in the footsteps of Longi, moving towards providing utility-scale storage solutions. Australian battery companies, on the other hand, seem to more be catering to the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment, providing solutions for the telecommunications industry, as well as mining and farming.
Pv magazine Australia has outlined new entrants to Australia’s residential battery market here.
PowerPlus launched its ‘Escape’ battery storage system range at Melbourne’s All Energy event last October. PowerPlus’ Business Development Manager Nic Stone said those systems now meet all the CEC certification requirements. The battery range is largely targeted towards off-grid small commercial applications, though it could also be used for residential. The smallest ‘Escape 10’ option says its range goes from 7.4 – 15kW / 0 – 72kWh, while the largest battery system option reaches 1 MW / 2 MWh.
With this new range, Stone said the company has now taken responsibility for whole BESS system, whereas before PowerPlus just focussed on DC-battery storage, designing conversion equipment. The company’s team of 80 are mostly based in Victoria, and the company in March had a 33% stake acquired by PPK Group Limited for $1.8 million. Today, the company exports to New Zealand and other pacific countries, Stone said, and tries to source local materials – though, of course, there is no battery cell manufacturing done within Australia.
 
Previously focussed on inverters, the company has now pivoted towards storage. In November, it launched a storage system with 52 kWh of capacity, aimed at remote houses, farming and other small commercial operations. James Rutty, the company’s Business Development Manager, said the company’s storage solutions wholesale for around $0.62 per watt hour. The batteries are manufactured in Mount Kuringai and use Polarium battery cells. Solar Energy Australia belongs to the Powerbox Australia group.
 
Hithium focuses on stationary storage only, optimising its systems for particular applications in the C&I and utility-scale segments. Its products include a cabinet, aimed at the C&I segment, with a capacity of 399 kWh. Ten of these units go into its utility-scale container, which is 3.99 MWh. Alongside this, the company provides battery cells for residential battery makers – but doesn’t make any home batteries itself.
The company’s products stop at the DC-side, its representatives said, meaning they are classed as BESS (battery energy storage systems) rather than ESS (energy storage systems) products.
The Chinese brand, founded in 2019, has been in the US market for the last year, and says it has installed 5 GWh of storage to date – 90% of which has been in China, and the remaining 10% abroad. While the company is still relatively young, its representatives said its technology is built on a core patent that has been in development for far longer. That technology uses certain lithium compounds to decrease degradation.
Hithium’s representatives said the company is working with integrators for its cells, meaning its battery hardware and software is integrated into third party casings. Several lithium mining and refining companies have minority stake in Hithium, which its representatives said is part of the company’s strategy to secure its lithium supply.
Last December, Hithium and Australian solar developer Sun Valley HK Group signed an agreement on their intention to explore “various forms of cooperation” on eight solar farms either in the construction or planning stages. While few details were provided, the announcement referred to a total capacity of 200 MW / 400 MWh under construction and 400 MW / 800 MWh in planning.
Australia is this Chinese company’s first target market in its global expansion. Its representatives said the company is aiming to set up a small team here in Australia, and is currently looking for a place to do so, as well as searching for distribution and installation partners.
In terms of its products, the company is targeting both the residential and utility segments. It’s C&I offering has a capacity of 22.5 kW/45 kWh. At the utility scale, it offers two containerised systems at 1.5 MWh or 3 MWh.
One of Australia’s most popular solar brands, Jinko is moving into utility-scale battery storage with a 3.44 MWh containerised solution. The company has already quoted a few utility-scale projects in Australia, according to Leo Ye, Jinko Australia’s Regional Sales Manager. The company is currently in the process of delivering a 500 MWh storage project in Israel. 
Jinko is also seeking to move into the industrial segment, with keen eyes on the growing market for community batteries, Ye told pv magazine Australia.

As part of the funding package, the state government will invest $2.3 billion to deliver two new large-scale battery energy storage systems on the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
This includes funding the construction of a 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery energy storage system near the coal town of Collie in the state’s southwest. While no confirmation has been provided about who will deliver the four-hour battery, the government said it is due to commence operations before the end of 2025.
The spend also includes funding to deliver a 200 MW/800 MWh battery energy storage system to be built at the site of the decommissioned Kwinana power station south of Perth. The government-owned energy generator and retailer Synergy will build the four-hour battery energy storage system alongside the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana battery that is currently working through its commissioning process.
WA Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the new battery storage will be an essential part of WA’s energy future, collecting excess energy from the state’s vast rooftop solar resources during the day, and releasing green energy when it is needed at peak times.
“Keeping the electricity grid reliable and secure remains the state government’s priority for energy,” he said. “This significant investment in battery storage in this budget will ensure new renewable generation is ‘firmed’ so electricity supply can always meet demand in an increasingly green grid.”
The new budget also includes $368 million for up to 210 MW of large-scale renewable energy generation projects, including Synergy’s 150 MW King’s Rock wind farm project near Hyden in the wheatbelt region, and a potential expansion of Bright Energy Investments’ existing 180 MW Warradarge Wind Farm near Eneabba north of Perth.
“The South West Interconnected System, our main electricity grid, is in the middle of a significant transformation: moving from a high-emissions, thermal generation base, to a low-emissions, renewable future,” Johnston said.
“The McGowan government’s significant investments in wind generation, storage and transmission infrastructure in this state budget are a critical step forward in that transition.”

The budget release comes a day after Johnston announced a $126 million investment towards electricity network planning and transmission upgrades across the SWIS.
The funding announcement was made in conjunction with the release of the SWIS Demand Assessment report which found the SWIS may need around an additional 4,000 kilometres of new transmission lines and about 50 GW of new renewable electricity and storage infrastructure to support increased demand over the next 20 years.
“The SWIS Demand Assessment provides a vision of what the future grid might look like as industry seeks to decarbonise,” Johnston said.
The report anticipates an additional 7.2 GW of new industry electricity demand will occur in the SWIS by 2042 to supply an anticipated surge in demand for power from electrification, new green industries, critical minerals and renewable hydrogen.
Initial modelling indicates up to 51.1 GW of new generation and storage capacity – almost 10 times the amount of generation capacity currently on the SWIS – will be required to satisfy the forecast demand.
The report also indicates that investment in transmission infrastructure is essential, with the modelling indicating more than 4000km of new network could be required to connect industrial users with new renewable energy projects and unlock constrained areas of the SWIS.
Johnston said the funding commitment will allow regional utility Western Power to commence planning works in the northern, central, southern and eastern corridors of the SWIS, reflecting the highest anticipated growth areas.
The funding will support planning and purchase of long-lead items for initial upgrades in the north network, which is expected to see a boom in new energy projects, as well as upgrades in the east network.
“Transmission infrastructure is a critical enabler of our energy transition, being essential for connecting users with renewable energy resources,” Johnston said. “An expanded grid is the most cost-efficient way of supporting decarbonisation as it can reach further for wind and solar. The SWIS cannot rely on other electricity systems to support it, so having a strong transmission backbone is critical for reliable supply.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/11/shift-to-solar-and-storage-signals-major-savings-for-rail-project/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 11, 2023",Shift to solar and storage signals major savings for rail project,"The federal government-owned Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) has confirmed that it will utilise ground-mounted solar arrays coupled with battery energy storage systems to power more than 80 signalling sites dotted along the rail corridor when the Inland Rail line becomes operational.
Following a successful trial of a solar-powered signalling system at Coolleearlee, about 50km from Moree in northern New South Wales (NSW), ARTC has approved its use at the remaining 82 signalling sites that will operate along the rail corridor from Albury in the state’s south to Gowrie in southeast Queensland.
The Albury to Gowrie stretch is part of the ambitious Inland Rail project, a 1727-kilometre railway line that will connect the ports of Melbourne and Brisbane along a new route west of the Great Dividing Range. The line, which will bypass the Sydney metropolitan area, will also connect to the Sydney-Perth rail corridor.
Construction of the project commenced in 2018 and it was originally due to be completed in 2025 but the project has been beset by budget blowouts and construction delays. While there is no definitive date for completion of the project, ARTC has switched to a solar-powered signalling system in a move that will help deliver savings.
ARTC Inland Rail Acting Chief Executive Rebecca Pickering said using the solar and battery energy storage systems rather than mains power for the signalling system provides significant savings for the project with the move eliminating the need to use the local power infrastructure, or to acquire easements to deliver mains power services to the signalling sites.
“Using solar power also saved ARTC around $300,000 in costs, mostly savings from not building a new transmission line to connect to the electricity network and a reduction in trackside infrastructure associated with mains equipment, and over $10,000 per year in operational electricity cost savings,” she said.
“We also use remote monitoring technology on these solar powered signalling installations, which adds further savings by reducing the requirement for maintenance visits.”
If those savings are replicated across the additional 82 signalling sites, the switch to solar backed by battery energy storage will provide an estimated $25 million cost reduction for the project.
ARTC said the capacity of the individual solar generation and energy storage systems vary but Inland Rail’s communication and wayside monitoring project manager Matt Brown said all have been designed to meet the corporation’s solar standard which is 10 days of autonomy.
“The solar system is designed with battery back-up that provides for 10 days of back-up operation and delivers a system which runs 24-hours a day, 365 days a year,” he said.
“Delivering power to rural signalling systems can be a real challenge so the successful completion of this solar-powered system in Coolleearlee is a great outcome.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/11/indias-green-hydrogen-demand-to-reach-2-85-mmt-year-by-2030-says-usaid/,"ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,RESEARCH,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"MAY 11, 2023","India’s green hydrogen demand to reach 2.85 MMT/year by 2030, says USAID","From pv magazine India
If India maintains its current momentum and implements announced projects, it will achieve an annual green hydrogen demand of 2.85 MMT by 2030, according to SAREP. The transition will require a total investment of USD 57.6 billion ($85.3b).
The report states that the fertiliser and export sectors will account for nearly 37% (1.02 MMT) and 29% (0.81 MMT) of the total 2.85 MMT green hydrogen demand.
In the base case scenario, the report authors assumed that 10% of India’s refineries would switch to green hydrogen, 10% of existing city gas distribution pipelines would be blended with green hydrogen, 50% of ammonia-based fertiliser imports would be replaced with domestic green ammonia, and the country would meet 6% of its demand from target importing countries by 2030.

To meet these green hydrogen demand estimates, the report says India will need 62 GW of additional renewable energy capacity, 29 GW of electrolyser capacity, and 11 MMT per annum of ammonia infrastructure. This represents an estimated investment need of USD 36 billion, USD 15 billion, and USD 6 billion, respectively, by 2030.
Multiple oil public sector undertakings (PSUs) have announced internal targets for the adoption of green hydrogen. The report authors considered internal targets from leading oil PSUs in arriving at the estimates from oil refining and natural gas blending industries.
India is well positioned to emerge as a green hydrogen production hub, given its excellent renewable energy resources, including an installed capacity of 62+ GW solar and 42+ GW wind, existing consumption markets for hydrogen and its derivative products, and availability of suitable sites that can be developed into green hydrogen hubs. 
The report states these advantages will allow producers in India to achieve amongst the lowest levelised costs for green hydrogen and green ammonia, estimated at USD 3,800-4,800 per tonne and USD 850-1,100 per tonne, respectively.
The Indian government’s National Hydrogen Mission (NHM) has added further momentum to the growth of the sector. Under the mission, India targets a green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT/annum by 2030.
The report states India will require an investment of USD 99.4 billion under the best-case scenario where it reaches annual green hydrogen demand of 5 MMT by 2030 as targeted under the NHM. In this scenario, it assumes the government will introduce significant mandates, subsidies, and other incentives to drive demand in green hydrogen sub-sectors to push production capacity to at least 5 MMT by 2030, in line with the NHM target.

Informational site and solar calculator developer SolarReviews and the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) partnered to release an inaugural report on solar installers’ experience in the market.
The nationwide solar industry survey was comprised of nearly 500 participants, of which 62% were from residential and small commercial installation businesses, 6% were commercial installers, 6% were operations and maintenance companies, 4.5% electricians, 4% utility-scale installers, and 17.4% listed as other participants. 
Increased electricity prices were listed as the top reason customers are looking for solar, as 66% of respondents said prices are driving demand. Additionally, 62% of respondents said the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to improve their business.
Notably, 61% of respondents said pv magazine is their top solar industry news source. This makes pv magazine the number one trade publication, followed by Solar Power World (53%), state-level trade industry groups (40%) and Solar Builder (19%).
Additionally, 63% of respondents listed solar industry conferences as their most trusted source of news, many of which cited pv magazine as featured media partner. Meet this author at the upcoming RE+ Southeast event in Atlanta, and the CleanPower conference in New Orleans.
Respondents said top panel brands they procure include Qcells (66%), REC (41%), Canadian Solar (30%), Silfab Solar (25%) and JinkoSolar (20%).
The top inverter brands include Enphase Energy (74%) SolarEdge Technologies (60%), Sol-Ark (24%), SMA (23%), Fronius (14%) and Generac (13%).
Enphase was also the top pick for energy storage systems (58%), followed by Tesla, SolarEdge, Generac, and LG Chem, all hovering around 25% of respondents.
“Enphase post-install customer service is the best. Panel brands are mostly dictated by availability from our distributor,” said Ellen Castle, a survey respondent from A1A Solar Contracting.
Installers are split on how much growth they expect in 2023. About 37% said they expect to sell slightly more solar, while 36% expect much more. About 16% of installers said they expect to sell the same amount of solar in 2023 as 2022, while 11% expect a dip in sales.
Installers continue to alter their offerings as demand for new technologies emerges. About 15% of installed systems were oversized to meet the future demands of an electric vehicle charging at home. Over 80% of residential installers said they now offer battery energy storage, while 67% said they offer EV charging ports. About 40% of residential installers said they offer electrician services, and 28% of installers also perform roofing work.
Respondents said 21% of solar jobs included energy storage, while California, Florida, and Texas have battery attachment rates closer to 30%. Increased electricity prices, more frequent power outages, and shifting net metering policy are expected to drive up battery adoption further.
In the finance category, the largest group of customers are opting for solar-specific loans (44%), followed closely by cash purchases (42%), and power purchase agreements or leases (10%). Mosaic was listed as the top loan platform (20%), followed by Sunlight Financial (17%) and Goodleap (12%).
When asked about the biggest barriers to success, participants listed the high cost of financing as the greatest concern (42%), followed by customer acquisition (42%), difficulty hiring enough employees (38%), inflation (33%), and permitting and interconnection rules and cost (31%).
Respondents say the effects of inflation are leading to increased operational costs (70%), higher prices leading to solar demand (66%), and higher wages for workers (63%).
As solar businesses struggle to find employees, respondents listed finding trained installers as the greatest skill in need (71%). This was followed by trained electricians (67%) and construction workers (51%).
Respondents reported that 11% of their employees were NABCEP-certified. Interestingly, 42% of installers said they require installation workers to obtain Continuing Education Units (CEUs) each year, and 74% said they cover the costs of CEUs.
When asked about ongoing supply chain issues, respondents were split. About 34% of respondents said they experienced better supply chain conditions in 2022 than 2021, while 26% said it was about the same, and 41% said component supply issues are worse than the previous year. As international goods were in short supply, 42% of respondents said they turned to sourcing domestically produced solar components.
