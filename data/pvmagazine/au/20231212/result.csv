The $370 million Oxley project is located within the New England Renewable Energy Zone, where unrest has formed around the use of agricultural land for renewable energy projects, among other concerns.

More than 50 objections were lodged in response to the public exhibition of the 215 MW Oxley solar farm and battery proposal, triggering the project’s referral to the Independent Planning Commission. The Commission reviewed the proposal in October and on Monday, December 11, delivered the approval verdict.
The Commission said it found that the proposed site is “a suitable site for renewable energy development,” due to its location within a Renewable Energy Zone, its topography and proximity to transmission lines. 
The project must, however, complete full rehabilitation of the site, adhere to strict soil and water management measures, and prepare a Community Communication Strategy “to facilitate communication between the applicant, council and the community during design, construction and operation.” Oxley will also be required to provide a detailed landscape plan comprising additional onsite vegetation to ensure it is integrated into the landscape.

In August 2022, the project’s owner, China-based group Megawatt Solar, agreed to pay $5.9 million as a “community benefit contribution.” The payment links to a list of demands from councils within the New England Renewable Energy Zone who say large-scale projects deliver “significant financial and social costs with little tangible benefit to our regions.”
At that time, the Armidale Regional Council also noted the Oxley solar farm had “significantly scaled down the original footprint of the solar farm,” in response to community objections.
The Oxley site sits about 14 kilometres south-east of Armidale on land currently being used for agriculture, though poor soil quality means the land is only usable for grazing rather than cropping.

It is expected to go to market in the first quarter of 2024 and be worth around $4 billion (USD 2.64 billion), the Australian Financial Review has reported.
Global Power Generation (GPG) Australia should have a portfolio  capacity of around 1.3 GW either operational or in construction by the time of the sale, the outlet reported.
GPG Australia’s portfolio includes the Cunderdin project in Western Australia, a 125 MW (DC) solar farm coupled with a 55 MW / 220 MWh battery which was slated for construction in 2022; the 180 MW Berrybank 1 Wind Farm and the 109 MW Berrybank 2 in Victoria; the 96 MW Crookwell 2 Wind Farm and 57 MW Crookwell 3 in New South Wales; and a 10 MW / 20 MWh Battery Energy Storage System located in the Australian Capital Territory. 
The company’s sale is expected to attract similar interest to the high-profile CWP Renewables auction in 2022, which saw bids from Iberdrola, Tilt Renewables and Origin. CWP Renewables, the Australian outfit for CWP, was eventually acquired by Squadron Energy, part of the Andrew Forrest’s family’s Tattarang Group, reportedly for more than $4 billion.

The paperwork for the second battery was filed to the Western Australian Department of Planning on December 4, 2023. Alinta’s new 300 MW battery proposal will need to be reviewed by the Shire of Waroona and approved by the Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel to progress.
The duration of this new battery project has not yet been made public, but it is planned for site on Willowdale Road, just a few kilometres from Alcoa’s alumina refinery, among the state’s biggest electricity users.
The new battery plan comes just months after Alinta announced work had begun on its nearby 100 MW / 200 MWh battery, being delivered by electrical design firm Shanghai Electric Power Design Institute (SEPD) and Australian solar and battery installer Sunterra. The 100 MW project is scheduled to be commissioned during the “second half of 2024.”
Western Australia, the world’s largest islanded grid, is scrambling to shore up its power supplies after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) flagged the need for “significant and sustained investment in generation, storage and transmission to meet reliability standards” in the South West Interconnected System, WA’s southern grid.
In its latest Wholesale Energy Market Electricity Statement of Opportunity, AEMO predicted Western Australia will have an electricity shortfall of 945 MW by 2025-26.

Just yesterday, Monday December 11, Western Australia’s Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel approved Synergy’s plans to construct a 500 MW/2,000 MWh battery system near the coal town of Collie. The state-owned utility has also received a green light for infrastructure approvals to support a possible expansion to 1,000 MW/4,000 MWh.
Synergy has already completed the 100 MW/200 MWh Kwinana battery, about 30 kilometres south of Perth, which went into operations earlier this year. It has also started work on a new 200 MW/800 MWh big battery being built adjacent to that facility.
French renewables giant Neoen is also in the process of building a 1 GW /4 GWh battery in Collie as the state government seeks to ramp up energy storage capacity to support its planned transition from coal-fired power to renewables.
Neoen started construction of its Collie battery in June, about the same time the company was awarded a contract by AEMO to provide almost all of the project’s Stage 1 capacity to help smooth the state’s solar duck curve.
Alinta Energy’s 100 MW Wagerup battery has also won a contract with the AEMO to help solve some of the state’s supply challenges, making it the second privately owned battery project to do so.

The proposal includes a DC-coupled 345.9 MW / 691.7 MWh battery system – if realised, this will become Tasmania’s largest battery. 
The project is being developed by a new renewable energy player, TasRex, and was unanimously approved the local Northern Midlands Council on Monday night.

Launceston-headquartered TasRex first announced the project in October, and Tasmania’s Minister for Energy and Renewables, Nick Duigan, today applauded the council’s approval, describing it as “great news.”
The Northern Midlands Solar Farm will comprise of 677,000 solar panels spread across two areas – Solar East and Solar West – which together will be capable of generating 288 MW (AC) and 370 MWp (DC). It is set to be located on 600 hectares of privately-owned farmland.
The O’Connor family, who own the land and have a long history of grazing sheep on the vast property, plan to run their 22,000-strong sheep flock under the solar panels once construction has been completed.

In terms of the project’s timeline, construction is currently being planned for 2025, with an operations date set for 2026, granted the rest of the approvals process progresses as planned. If the project goes ahead, it will be Tasmania’s largest battery and solar project by a significant margin.
The Northern Midlands project is just the first of a series of large-scale renewable energy projects in the pipeline of TasRex, with the company saying in October that it is looking to develop up to 5 GW of solar, and onshore and offshore wind projects in Tasmania.
TasRex is headed up by Bess Clark, the former chief executive officer of the Marinus Link transmission project. In October, the company announced it also had in place a non-binding agreement to work with the Tasmanian government.

The international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 63 of the “solar cell efficiency tables” in Progress in Photovoltaics.
The scientists said they have added six new results to the new tables since June.
One of the six results added to the tables is the 25.2% efficiency that researchers at Northwestern University in the United States achieved for a 1-cm2 lead halide perovskite cell.
Furthermore, the tables now include the 22.4% efficiency that US-based First Solar achieved for a 0.45 cm2 cadmium-telluride (CdTe) cell, the 26.1% efficiency that China’s University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) obtained for 0.05 cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell, and the 26.1% efficiency the Northwestern University and the University of Toronto in Canada achieved for a 0.05-cm2 Pb-halide perovskite solar cell.
The fifth result added to the tables is the 36.1% efficiency that Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) and Dutch research institute AMOLF achieved in September for a multijunction solar cell based on silicon and III-V semiconductors such as gallium indium phosphide (GaInP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs).
The sixth result is the 33.9% efficiency the Chinese module maker Longi announced for a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell in early November.
In Version 62 of the tables, released in June the researchers added 21 new results, a record number for the Tables. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems and the Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH), Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/12/12/china-module-prices-slide-to-new-lows-manufacturers-cut-production/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"DECEMBER 12, 2023","China module prices slide to new lows, manufacturers cut production","From pv magazine Global
The Chinese Module Marker (CMM), the OPIS benchmark assessment for mono PERC modules from China, was assessed at USD 0.123 per W, down USD 0.003/W week on week, while TOPCon module prices fell USD 0.004/W to USD 0.131/W. These new record lows come amid muted year-end demand as module makers cut production.
Prices in China have seen particular declines. While most tier-1 players – including a top 5 solar major – generally offer modules at around the CNY1 ($0.21)/W mark, some sellers lowered prices past that psychologically significant threshold. PERC modules have been offered as low as CNY0.72 ($0.15), multiple manufacturers said.

The winter season is a “weaker period of the year, hence, lower demand,” a solar market veteran said. China’s module makers are trying to clear their inventories, according to a module seller, during this off-season. Before their fiscal year closes in December, Chinese companies are attempting to sell stock and “bump up their revenues,” a different veteran said.
Operating rates are falling in this oversupplied environment. Some medium-sized solar factories are already closing for a break, according to a module maker. Factories in China usually only break during the Spring Festival, and a break now two months ahead of that holiday suggests that “factories don’t have orders,” the module maker said. Module factory operating rates are said to be 50-60%, according to an experienced market observer.
Low prices continue to be on the horizon as 2023 ends and in the year to come. 2024 will be a challenging year, according to a major solar developer. Low prices will persist for a time, with the industry gradually starting to stabilize in 2025 and then recover, the developer said.
OPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.
