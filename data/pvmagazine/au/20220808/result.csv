Rechargeable batteries paired with sodium metal anodes are considered to be one of the most promising high-energy and low-cost energy-storage systems. However, the use of highly reactive sodium metal and the formation of sodium dendrites during battery operation have caused safety concerns, especially when highly flammable liquid electrolytes are used.
New research, published in the journal Nature Materials, suggests that by using polymer as the ion conductor rather than the flammable liquid solvents currently used in lithium-ion batteries, the energy storage is greener, safer, and less expensive.
Lead researcher Dr Fangfang Chen said the team used a computer-to-lab material design strategy, applying modelling and simulations to find the best compositions for polymer electrolytes.
“This work has been devoted to developing new polymer electrolyte chemistries that can be used with high-energy metals that are more abundant and less expensive than lithium, such as sodium and potassium,” she said. “The new materials can contribute to a more sustainable, greener future battery technology, as well as providing society with safer, high-performance energy storage devices.”
Chen’s research partner Professor Maria Forsyth said the work expands upon current knowledge of electrolyte systems and provides an alternative to the dominant lithium-ion technology.
“Lithium-based technology is expensive, in-demand and increasingly scarce, so breakthroughs that provide alternative, inexpensive, and safe energy storage options are of major significance,” she said.
“We can now offer an alternative path to realising polymer-based solid-state batteries. This is a significant milestone, and this process will act as a design criterion for further development in this field of research.”

The research results come after Forsyth and Dr Xiaoen Wang last month announced they had developed solvent-free solid polymer electrolytes based on a perfluoropolyether-terminated polyethylene oxide-based block copolymer for all-solid-state sodium metal batteries.
“Most industries that develop sodium batteries generally use carbon-based electrode and liquid electrolyte, which has low capacity and also can fuel a fire if the battery overheats,” Wang said.
“We are taking a different approach, using reactive sodium metal as an anode to increase battery capacity and in the process are developing safer electrolytes to ensure the safety of sodium batteries.”
A key component in the electrolyte – a fluorine-containing class of polymer – was developed by Dr Cheng Zhang and Professor Andrew Whittaker from the University of Queensland’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology. Originally used for biological applications, this is the first time the polymer has been used in solid-state sodium batteries.
Wang said one drawback of current sodium batteries is that they do not last as long as lithium batteries and have a lower energy density. However, in pairing them with the new polymer electrolytes, the researchers believe that sodium batteries could offer close to 1,000 cycles, comparable to current lithium-ion batteries.
The research team said small-scale testing of the batteries has been successful, with upscaling and prototyping coming soon. Wang said with further research, opportunities could be on the horizon for use in stationary energy storage such as solar or even in electric vehicles.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/08/cefc-commits-200-million-for-sme-investments-in-clean-energy/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2022",CEFC commits $200 million for SME investments in clean energy,"The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) announced on Monday it is investing up to $200 million alongside ANZ Bank to offer discounted financing to Australian small to medium (SME) businesses for upgrades and new investments in renewable technologies including installing solar PV and energy storage and to purchasing electric vehicles (EVs).
The CEFC and ANZ will provide cheap loans for a wide range of activities, with the two organisations each contributing 0.25% toward a 0.5% discount on loans of up to $5 million.
The CEFC said the loans could be used to fund a broad range of initiatives aimed at reducing emissions, ranging from using more renewable energy to buying energy efficient, precision agricultural equipment, recycling technologies and purchasing EVs.
“Small to medium businesses are a critical part of Australia’s economy,” CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth said. “As the cost of energy and other inputs continues to rise, it is important to help them access the benefits that renewable energy, battery storage and energy-efficient equipment can deliver.”
ANZ’s managing director of commercial and private banking, Isaac Rankin, said many business banking customers were trying to upgrade their operations to work in a low-carbon economy.
“(They are) moving towards a more sustainable future,” he said. “Whether it be an electric truck or solar panels, we want to give Australian businesses access to finance, services and advice to invest in equipment which will help them to shift to low-carbon business models and operations that put them on a path to net zero emissions.”
The Energy Efficiency Council has estimated that improving energy efficiency has the potential to save households and businesses up to $7.7 billion each year on their energy bills.
The CEFC’s commitment extends its collaboration with ANZ in a clean energy finance program initiated in 2017. The additional $200 million in finance announced on Monday will take the CEFC’s total commitment to the program to $450 million.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/08/wave-swell-energy-trial-delivers-conversion-rates-of-up-to-50/,"MICROGRID,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Wave Swell Energy trial delivers conversion rates of up to 50%,"Melbourne-based Wave Swell Energy (WSE) said the trial of its UniWave200 wave energy converter off the coast of Tasmania’s King Island had exceeded expectations with the test platform achieving conversion rates of up to 50% while supplying constant power to the island’s hybrid microgrid for a full 12 months.
WSE partnered with local utility Hydro Tasmania on the pilot project, integrating its 200 kW UniWave wave power unit – a boat-like platform that uses an artificial blowhole formation to create air pressure changes that drive a turbine – with a hybrid microgrid that supplies more than two thirds of the island’s energy needs through a combination of wind, solar PV and batteries.
The test platform was installed last year in the waters of Grassy Bay, on King Island’s south-east coast. The platform is partly submerged in about six metres of water about 100 metres offshore. From there, it has been contributing clean energy to the island’s microgrid for 12 months, supplying up to 200 kW of renewable energy around the clock.
WSE chief executive officer Paul Geason said the trial had proven the capabilities of the technology and in some cases had exceeded the company’s expectations.
“We set out to prove that Wave Swell’s wave energy converter technology could supply electricity to a grid in a range of wave conditions, and we have done that,” he said. “In some instances, the performance of our technology in the ocean has exceeded expectations due to the lessons we’ve learned through the project, technological improvements, and the refinements we have made over the year.”

The UniWave device uses an oscillating water column design which essentially mimics a natural blowhole. Wave swells force water into a chamber beneath the waterline, pressurising the air and forcing it to pass through a turbine at the top of the chamber. This power is converted into electricity that can be fed into the grid.
WSE said previous oscillating water column designs have all been bidirectional whereas the UniWave device operates unidirectionally, resulting in the turbine being simpler, more robust and reliable, and exhibiting a higher energy conversion efficiency.
Geason said the 200 kW test platform had achieved a rate of conversion from wave power to grid-compliant electricity at an average of 45 to 50% in a wide range of wave conditions.
“The conversion rates that we’ve been able to achieve in terms of the amount of electricity we are able to extract from the wave energy that comes into the unit is very high,” he said. “This is a vast improvement on past devices and shows that the moment has arrived for wave power to sit alongside wind, solar and energy storage as part of a modern energy mix.”
WSE said under the right wave conditions the 200 kW test platform is capable of generating enough energy for 200 homes.
“It’s important to stress that the demonstration at King Island was not about producing high volumes of electricity,” Geason said.
“Rather, it was to prove the capabilities of our technology in a variety of wave conditions. The results have met and at times exceeded our expectations. As an example, when the unit is generating 40 kW of power in reasonable wave conditions, you could extrapolate the amount of energy to be in the order of 1 MWh in a 24-hour period.”

While wave energy has not seen the cost reductions or widespread deployments that other renewable technologies have enjoyed, WSE is confident the technology will in time compete with wind and solar on cost, and said it has the added advantage of being more predictable and consistent.
The King Island platform is expected to remain in place at least until the end of 2022, and the company is now looking to commercialise the technology, having already attracted interest from Europe, the United States and India.
WSE said the 200 kW pilot can be scaled up to a 1 MW design and placed off any coastline anywhere in the world. The units can also be integrated into sea walls or breakwaters.
“Now we find ourselves in a position where we’ve proven the technology and the next stage is now to move forward and commercialise the technology and see it become mainstream as part of the global mix of renewable energies,” Geason said.
“In terms of the commercial scale-up … it will most likely be a bigger unit, and also have a bigger engine, so at least five times bigger.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/08/synergy-eyes-system-security-as-installation-begins-on-was-biggest-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 8, 2022",Synergy eyes system security as installation begins on WA’s biggest battery,"Western Australia’s state-owned energy generator and retailer Synergy said the first of more than 600 lithium iron phosphate battery units that will make up the Kwinana Big Battery had been installed on Friday at the project site about 30 kilometres south of Perth.
The project’s engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, Italy-headquartered energy storage specialist New Horizons Ahead (NHOA), which is delivering the project in partnership with Perth-based subcontractor GenusPlus Group, said the installation of the battery units will take approximately eight weeks.
Once completed, the 100 MW/200 MWh battery will be connected to the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), the state’s main grid, and will have the capacity to power the equivalent of 160,000 homes for two hours.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston said the battery will support the integration of more renewable energy into the grid, smooth fluctuations in demand and renewable energy supply and substantially contribute to grid security and stability.
“Increasing energy storage over the next decade will be crucial to addressing system security risks, such as high levels of rooftop solar generation, and ensuring reliable power supply to Western Australia’s main electricity grid,” he said.
“Synergy is also implementing a battery management system, to optimise its performance and longevity.”
Synergy, which will operate and manage the battery energy storage system, said it is a major component of its future asset mix and a demonstration of the gen-tailer’s commitment to the delivery of safe, reliable and affordable energy.

“Increasing levels of large-scale and rooftop intermittent renewable generation has led the rapid transformation of the energy sector, presenting a range of opportunities related to how electricity is produced, managed and consumed,” the company said. “The battery project will enable Synergy to optimise the use of its existing generation assets and provide network and system services to increase system security, providing a more sustainable, reliable and effective power supply to the wider region.”
Synergy said the Kwinana Big Battery would allow for renewable load shifting, absorbing excess energy from rooftop solar when demand is low and discharging during peak periods, helping to provide long-term system stability.
It is also intended to provide learnings towards other large-scale battery storage projects earmarked for the next five years.
The state government has plans to deploy 1,100 MW of new energy storage projects as part of a $3.8 billion new renewable energy infrastructure package announced in June this year.
Premier Mark McGowan said large-scale battery storage will help support the uptake of more renewables in the South West Interconnected System as WA transitions towards net zero emissions.
“This project is just one part of our massive investment in renewable energy infrastructure,” he said.  “The big battery forms part of our commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, and will support the transition of WA’s electricity grid to higher levels of renewables and storage.”

India had 691.4 MW of cumulative solar capacity by June 30, through the installation of standalone solar pumps and the solarisation of existing grid-connected agriculture pumps under the PM-KUSUM Scheme. The states of Rajasthan (282.6 MW) and Haryana (246.5 MW) led in PV capacity additions under the scheme.
The PM KUSUM Scheme, under its Component-B section, supports farmers in installing standalone solar agriculture pumps to replace existing diesel agriculture pumps in off-grid areas. Under Component-C of the scheme, individual farmers with grid-connected agriculture pumps are supported to solarise their pumps. Farmers can use solar power to meet irrigation needs, with excess solar power sold to distribution companies under a fixed tariff. 
A 2016-17 survey by the Ministry of Agriculture estimated India to have 11.2 million diesel agricultural pumps. As of June 30, the nation had installed 123,180 standalone solar pumps under Component-B of the scheme. The pumps are estimated to reduce 85 million litres of diesel consumption per year. Cumulatively, the nation had installed 385,000 standalone solar pumps by June 30, including solar pumps installed under the PM-KUSUM Scheme.
