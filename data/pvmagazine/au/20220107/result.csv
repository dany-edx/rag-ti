The power arm of Philippines-based brewing-to-energy conglomerate San Miguel Corporation (SMC) has said it is ready to start operation of an initial 690MW of battery storage facilities early this year. The company expects to complete 31 energy storage systems in 2021-22, with an accumulated capacity of 1GW.
SMC’s battery storage portfolio started to take shape last year when the company revealed it was nearing completion on projects across the country. It announced 31 batteries would be deployed by the end of this year, not only to improve power reliability and help frequency control, but also to make way for the integration of some 3GW of intermittent renewables capacity.
At the time, SMC president Ramon See Ang said his company would build solar plants in combination with battery storage at 10 locations throughout the Philippines. These are scheduled to go online by next year.
While there has been no update since on the progress of those solar-plus-storage facilities, a couple of big batteries owned by SMC have already been connected to the grid. Last year, German and U.S.-owned energy storage joint venture Fluence said it commissioned two 20MW/20MWh batteries out of a 470MW/470MWh energy storage portfolio it was contracted to supply and maintain for SMC Global Power. With project sites ranging in size from 20 to 60 MW, the SMC portfolio procured with Siemens and AES Corp-owned Fluence is spread across 13 sites.
Finnish tech company Wartsila announced commissioning of its first two battery storage projects for SMC Global Power in May. The projects have capacities of 20MW/20MWh and 40MW/40MWh and are part of previously announced energy storage orders for 100MW/100MWh of systems.
According to a stock exchange filing today, the battery storage fleet is intended to augment SMC’s renewable energy portfolio, “which includes the construction of solar, liquefied natural gas, and hydroelectric power plants to address the continuing need of the country for reliable and affordable power.”
While an increasing number of utilities are considering natural gas as a “bridge” to full renewables an unnecessary step, SMC Global Power, one of the Philippines’ largest power generators, appears to hold a different view. It operates the 1.2GW Ilijan Combined-Cycle Power Plant, the country’s largest natural gas facility, and is gearing up to build another 1.3GW plant, in Batangas City. SMC announced, in July, it will drop new coal projects from its expansion plans as it transitions to a low-carbon future.
At the time, the company announced it had scrapped “plans to put up three new clean-coal power plants with a capacity of 1,500MW in favour of new facilities that utilise cleaner, renewable energy sources.”

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will help the government of the Maldives tender for 20-30MW of solar generation capacity, to be installed in 1-2MW arrays across 20-25 of the state’s outer islands.
Floating solar could be set to contribute to the installations, with the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Technology having stated the panels will be a mixture of ground-mounted, rooftop and “near shore lagoon” systems.
A pre-Christmas announcement on the ministry website stated the ADB will provide technical assistance in holding a tender for the “PPP” solar “hybrid” systems which will help reduce the nation’s dependence on diesel as the Maldives government aims for carbon neutrality this decade.
pv magazine has contacted the ministry and the ADB to ask whether PPP refers to public-private partnerships and seeking more details about the tender and installation timetables.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/07/electrolyser-tech-to-produce-hydrogen-from-seawater/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",MARIAN WILLUHN,"JANUARY 7, 2022",Electrolyser tech to produce hydrogen from seawater,"From pv magazine Germany
German automotive supplier Schaeffler is currently working with partners from the Netherlands to extract hydrogen from seawater in a pilot project. With demand for car components expected to decrease as a result of the transition to electromobility, the supplier is planning to expand its activities in the field of hydrogen which, according to Schaeffler, should also be supplied to the automotive industry.
The idea of producing green hydrogen at sea, from large amounts of offshore wind energy is widespread. However, this type of hydrogen production faces the major challenge electrolysers require ultrapure water. That means seawater must first be desalinated and then painstakingly cleaned and filtered before it can flow to the sensitive membranes, and is a process that is driving up the cost of green hydrogen.
Schaeffler has set up start-up Hydron B.V. in the Netherlands to develop polymer electrolysis membrane (PEM) systems. To clean seawater before it reaches the membranes, the engineers have implemented a solution in which waste heat from the electrolysis process can be used to distill the salt water. The consortium says it has proven the functionality of its membrane distillation technology and the system was able to generate a kilogram of hydrogen per hour, with the membrane distillation making 10kg of ultra-pure water (UPW) available for electrolysis.
“The generation of green hydrogen from wind energy is an important growth area for Schaeffler,” said Bernd Hetterscheidt, head of the hydrogen strategic business area for the company. “In cooperation with our partners in the wind power industry, we want to become one of the leading providers of system components in this area. To do this, we combine the innovative technology of Hydron with the strengths of Schaeffler, such as our system understanding and our knowhow in the rapid scaling of products and projects in order to bring them onto the market as quickly as possible.”
Looking forward, Schaeffler wants to push ahead with scaling of the filters and desalination components for use on an industrial scale. In addition, the cost and resistance of the system will have to be improved. The aim is to reduce green hydrogen production costs from the current €4-10/kg to €2. Water treatment is of key importance to reduce the price of electrolysis and significant efficiency advantages could easily be converted into cost savings. Companies from the chemical industry, such as Canada’s HPQ Silicon Resources, and rail sector businesses including Alstom have also formed consortia in a bid to be part of the race for cheap green hydrogen from seawater and wind energy.
