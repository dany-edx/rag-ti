“Whilst funding proposals were provided, consensus on the future direction and funding structure of the company could not be achieved,” a company statement read.
The Australian described the news as a “spat” between software billionaire and Sun Cable chairman Mike Cannon-Brooks and Fortescue iron-ore magnate turn green hydrogen enthusiast Andrew Forrest. Whether or not the two major players have had a “spat” is not clear, but Cannon-Brooks’ optimism surrounding the company’s future suggests entering administration is primarily a strategy to get around the impasse.
Cannon-Brookes said he was confident the cornerstone Australia-Asia PowerLink project, which proposes to build up to 20 GW of solar and 42 GWh of battery storage in the Northern Territory, providing power to Singapore via unprecedented undersea cables, still has a future. “I’m confident it will play a huge role in delivering green energy for the world, right here from Australia. I fully back this ambition and the team, and look forward to supporting the company’s next chapter.”
Likewise, Sun Cable founder and CEO David Griffin described the megaproject as remaining “well placed for completion.”
FTI Consulting has been named as Sun Cable’s voluntary administrator. FTI Consulting’s Christopher Hill, David McGrath and John Park will now work with Sun Cable’s management to determine the company’s future.
Recapitalisation or the sale of the business appear to be likely moves.

The battery system is the first stage of a project that will go on to include a co-located 130 MW solar farm. The battery and solar farm will be part of New Zealand “gentailer” Meridian Energy’s envisioned Ruakākā Energy Park, one of the biggest renewable projects planned for the country.

French-headquartered Saft will supply the batteries for the project, as well as power conversion equipment, installation, commissioning and 20 years operational services. Specifically, Saft will be supplying 80 of its modular “Intensium Shift” battery containers to the site.
The 3 MWh containers, described by Saft as “scalable building blocks” use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology with 40 inverters, Freemaq PCSK GEN3, 20 Medium-Voltage Power Stations and a third-party’s Power Management System. The battery containers are fully populated in Saft’s factories, with the company saying they can reduce both the battery system’s footprint and site-related activities by 50%, allowing a faster deployment of utility-scale storage plants.

Construction on the Ruakākā Battery Energy Storage System is slated to begin in the first quarter of this year, with the battery anticipated to come online in the second half of 2024.
Meridian expects the battery will deliver annual revenues of up to $50 million (USD 35 million), thanks to the technology’s energy arbitrage potential and its ability to participate in the North Island reserve electricity market.

Known as Wallerawang 9, the battery has an approved dispatch capacity of 500 MW and will sit within the Wallerawang power station site where two 500 MW coal-fired generating units were decommissioned in 2014. The BESS will connect to the adjacent 330kV Wallerawang Substation.
As part of the acquisition, Shell Energy will be responsible for the grid connection process and, subject to a final investment decision expected shortly, is planning to build, own and operate the battery on 20 hectares of land to be leased from Greenspot.

A further 200 hectares of the total 620-hectare site has been identified as a potential employment hub and will continue to be managed by Greenspot. The NSW developer aiming to attract industrial, agribusiness and manufacturing to the site as part of its vision of creating a multi-use green precinct in the former fossil-fuel hub.
Before selling the project to Shell, Greenspot had anticipated a staged construction on the $400 million (USD 275 million) battery, beginning in the first half of 2022 with 300 MW of storage capacity before constructing the remaining 200 MW within five years. It is unclear if Shell will follow this timeline, though the company has emphasised the “maturity” of the project.
Wallerawang 9 is the second major battery slated for the NSW region with French renewables developer Neoen in 2021 filing planning documents for another 500 MW / 1000 MWh battery at Wallerawang.
Neoen’s Great Western Battery is proposed at a site not far from the Wallerawang power station and is currently in development with the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment placing the environmental impact statement on public exhibition in March 2022.
Greenspot CEO Brett Hawkins had previously said the Wallerawang 9’s location, on the southeast border of the planned Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone and connecting to the transmission line linking the zone with the major load centres in Sydney, would be important for firming the nearby renewable generation and stabilising the electricity grid.
Greenspot acquired the Wallerawang power station site from EnergyAustralia in September 2020.

Trina Solar has started producing n-type i-TOPCon solar cells in its factory in Suqian, in China’s Jiangsu province. It will use the cells, which are based on 210 mm wafers, to produce the new generation of its Vertex N solar modules for commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications. It says the new line will have power outputs ranging up to 605 W, and an efficiency of up to 22.4%.
“Benefiting from the innovative cell size and low-voltage, the Vertex N 605W modules are perfectly fit for 104-meter-long trackers, with no waste of space,” Trina Solar said in a statement. “Six to 12 more 605W modules can be connected on the trackers than is the case with conventional n-type 72-cell and 78-cell modules.”
The new factory is another step in Trina Solar’s focus on n-type technology.
“As p-type PERC approaches its efficiency limits, it is critical that production of n-type cells, which began to be commercialised last year, be stepped up,” it said.
Trina Solar expects its 210mm n-type technology module capacity to reach 30 GW this year. It started building the Suqian facility in July 2022 and installed the manufacturing equipment at the end of November. In August 2022, the company achieved a 24.24% efficiency record for a 210 mm n-type i-TOPCon solar cell.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/11/solar-cell-efficiency-growth-correlated-with-rd-volumes/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,LUXEMBOURG,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 11, 2023",Solar cell efficiency growth correlated with R&D volumes,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the University of Luxembourg and the University of Utah in the United States have discovered that the increase in solar cell efficiency over the past few decades was strictly related to R&D, which underscores the crucial role of scientific institutions in the race to turn PV into the future of global energy.
“Normally, the efficiency performance progress of solar cell development is measured as a function of time,” the scientists said. “However, what is important, is not the time that has passed, but the research effort required to achieve an efficiency improvement.”
They noted the need to quickly identify the potential of non-crystalline silicon technologies, in order to estimate the real possibility of achieving significant cost reductions. They used the cumulative number of technical publications as a proxy for R&D efforts and assumed that each new publication advanced the field in a similar way. They found that the number of researchers and the effectiveness of research, as well as time and available resources, are strictly correlated to efficiency increases.
“Our analysis suggests that the average efficiency return on effort, at least by those motivated by publishing R&D results, are very similar for halide perovskites, CdTe and CIGSe,” the scientists explained. “This implies that exponential growth vs. year is driven more by exponential growth in researchers and efforts expended than the technology being qualitatively different than these other high-efficiency polycrystalline thin film technologies.”
They also discovered that solar cell efficiency increased by 5% for every order of magnitude of published articles.
“Which means that to go from 5% to 10% efficiency one hundred publications are required, whilst to go from 10 to 15% one thousand publications are required, and so on,” they concluded.
They presented the new learning curve methodology in “Efficiency versus effort: A better way to compare best photovoltaic research cell efficiencies?,” which was recently published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
“While learning spillover from non-PV technologies, cross-pollination from other PV technologies, and hidden commercial effort are not accounted for by this metric, this analysis still yields useful and novel insights into PV technology trajectories,” they concluded.
