In its latest quarterly market update, SunWiz said wholesale pricing for panels and inverters have been on the decline in recent months while system prices fell in December 2023 to an average of $1.01 per watt, the lowest they have been since May 2022.
Despite the drop off in prices, SunWiz Managing Director Warwick Johnston said consumers are continuing to invest about $9,000 (USD 5,934) per rooftop installation – opting for larger systems with the average system size increasing to almost 10.5 kW in the final month of 2023.
“What we have seen in consumer spend, even as panel and system prices have come down, is that people are buying bigger systems,” he said.
“They are spending the same amount as they did previously. Even as prices have come down, people have still been paying that $9,000 mark because they’re buying bigger systems.”
“The other way that they’re doing it is buying cheaper equipment.”
Johnston said consumers have been trending away from premium panels and they are now also trending away from premium inverters.
“It used to be that they put Chinese panels on a premium inverter and nowadays half of the volume is Chinese panels on a Chinese inverter,” he said.
The trend for increased capacity saw the average size of a rooftop solar system cross the 10 kW threshold for the first time in December 2023. Driven in part by an increase in commercial installations, the average size of a rooftop system rose to an all-time high of 10.47 kW.
The increase follows considerable growth in the volume of 10-15 kW systems and modest growth in the 8-10 kW segment. The volume of 6 kW systems has been trending slowly downwards.

Johnston said the figures also showed the payback period for rooftop solar investments is trending downwards with most installations paying for themselves in less than five years and households in some states, including Queensland, better off financially in as little as three years.
“It’s the healthiest payback period for a residential system for quite a while,” he said.
More than one in three Australian households have rooftop solar systems – the highest penetration in the world. Australia now sits at 3.7 GW of small-scale volume with about 23 million projects installed to date.

The $440 million (USD 290 million) solar project is to comprise approximately 626,000 solar panels mounted on a single-axis tracking system spread across a 530-hectare site located about 30 km east of Three Springs.
ASX-listed Pilot said the proposed Wheatbelt Solar Farm is a key component of the company’s plan to develop the Mid West Clean Energy Project (MWCEP), an ammonia production and export project aiming to produce up to 1 million tonnes per annum of blue ammonia – ammonia produced using gas.
Pilot said the proposed MWCEP project includes two core elements: an offshore carbon capture and storage project that would utilise the company’s existing Cliff Head Oil Field infrastructure to permanently store the CO2 associated with blue ammonia production; and another that utilises the region’s renewable energy resources to make ammonia from blue and green hydrogen.
The company is confident it can deliver the blue project within its existing footprint and using technology sourced from United States energy tech company 8 Rivers can deliver blue hydrogen production by 2028 before moving into green hydrogen production.
Electricity from the proposed Wheatbelt Solar Farm would be transported to the MWCEP ammonia production facility approximately 100 km west via a private mid-voltage transmission network.
The company has indicated it will need about 130 MW of firm power from the blue ammonia project and that will be supplied by renewables.
Pilot plans to start the renewables build-out during the blue phase and then look to expand it as the project moves into green ammonia production.
The paperwork for the solar plant has been filed to the Western Australian Department of Planning and will need to be reviewed and approved by the Regional Joint Development Assessment Panel to progress.
Pilot said the timeframe for the proposed Wheatbelt Solar Farm will depend on what the end use of its output is.
The company has suggested that construction of the project could commence in 2025 or 2026. The project is expected to generate up to 60 jobs during the construction phase.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/25/new-joint-venture-targets-2-gw-solar-and-storage-build-out/,"ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,MARKETS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",EV FOLEY,"JANUARY 25, 2024",New joint venture targets 2 GW solar and storage build-out,"Gaw Capital Partners and BW ESS, a part of Singapore-headquartered shipping and energy group BW Group, have teamed to form Valent Energy which is to develop an initial portfolio comprising one solar farm project and eight big batteries, including three in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) that they say are fully approved and ready to build.
The venture partners announced they will invest and arrange more than $2 billion (USD 1.31 billion) in capital to support the development of the renewables projects, acquired by Gaw Capital in an acquisition in 2022 of GMR Energy, which included Maoneng Group’s Australian business.
The companies also said they will pool their resources in Valent to develop and grow its pipeline of development assets.
Valent’s existing portfolio includes the 240 MW Mornington battery energy storage system (BESS) being developed south of Melbourne in Victoria, the 250 MW Pine Lodge BESS near Shepparton in Victoria, and the 120 MW Apsley battery project south of Dubbo in NSW. The companies said planning and grid connection approvals have been secured for all three projects and contracts to start construction are being finalised.
In addition to the already approved projects, Valent said three other projects are expected to secure connection approvals early next year.
Among those projects in Valent’s development pipeline is the Merriwa Energy Hub planned for the NSW Hunter region. The project comprises a 550 MW solar farm and a 400 MW/1,600 MWh battery.
Former chief executive of Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and Macquarie Bank executive Oliver Yates, who has been appointed director of Valent, said the arrival of the new venture comes at an opportune time with the deployment of dispatchable grid-scale energy storage critical for Australia’s shift to intermittent renewable energy generation.
“With the rollout of substantial government policy to support battery projects, and the record periods of negative prices during daytime solar floods, the moment could not be a timelier for Valent to build large-scale batteries,” Yates said.
BW ESS Chief Executive Erik Stromso said the companies’ respective strengths in industry and capital markets will ensure Valent will be well positioned to accelerate the growth of Australia’s energy storage capacity, enabling its transition to clean energy.
In addition to Valent, BW ESS has built a portfolio of more than 1.5 GW of battery energy storage projects in the United Kingdom and Nordic countries, with more than 400 MWh currently under construction.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/25/fortescue-commits-to-major-manufacturing-facility-in-us/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,EV,HYDROGEN,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,UNITED STATES",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 25, 2024",Fortescue commits to major manufacturing facility in US,"Australia-based Fortescue has confirmed it will establish an Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Detroit after the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) agreed to provide grants and tax breaks valued at more than $45 million (USD 29.7 million).
Fortescue has announced it will invest an initial $53 million to refurbish an existing 38,000-square-metre facility in Detroit, turning it into a manufacturing and engineering workspace. The first battery line is expected to be installed in 2025, with the new facility scheduled to be operating at full capacity by 2030.
Fortescue said the plant will become a hub for the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and heavy industry, fast chargers, and electrolysers.
“The production in the facility will initially be focused on customers across North America, with high potential for international sales based on expected economic and technical competitiveness, along with international customer requirements,” the company said.
Fortescue Energy Chief Executive Officer Mark Hutchinson said the project will “breathe fresh life into the birthplace of the automotive industry.”
“We are committed to investing in the next generation of green manufacturing projects that will help decarbonise business and heavy industry, and in turn create a strong future for manufacturing jobs in the United States,” he said.
The project has attracted strong support from both Michigan and the city of Detroit with the state approving an almost $13.7 million performance-based grant, a 15-year, 100% essential services assessment exemption valued at almost $2 million, and state tax capture valued at more than $3.6 million. In addition, the project is requesting $7.9 million in tax financing.
The city of Detroit also will support the project through a tax break worth about $11.7 million and more than $6.4 million for the local portion of the redevelopment work.
Fortescue expects the new facility to generate 600 new manufacturing and engineering jobs.
The Detroit facility is part of Fortescue’s broader strategy for the north American market. The company late last year reached a final investment decision on a green hydrogen project in Arizona. Stage one of the Phoenix Hydrogen Hub is planned to include an 80 MW electrolyser and liquefaction facility capable of producing up to 12,000 tonnes of liquified green hydrogen annually.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/01/25/energy-transitions-speeds-up-as-rooftop-pv-records-tumble/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 25, 2024",Energy transition speeds up as rooftop PV records tumble,"The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report shows that new records are rapidly being set for the amount of renewable energy, including grid-scale and rooftop solar, being fed into the National Electricity Market (NEM), reducing the reliance on traditional coal-fired generation.
AEMO Chief Executive Officer Daniel Westerman said there were moments in time in the final three months of 2023 that show just how fast Australia’s energy transition is happening.
“Early in the afternoon of 31 December rooftop solar met 101% of South Australia’s total electricity demand,” he said. “While on the afternoon of 24 October rooftop solar and grid-scale renewables provided 72% of all electricity across the east coast.”
“These events are snapshots of the transition that’s happening, and they are becoming more frequent. We are regularly seeing records set for the higher contribution of renewables, and lower levels of energy drawn from the grid because of rooftop solar.”
The latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report shows that average distributed PV output reached an all-time high in Q4 2023 of 3,433 MW, 505 MW or 17% higher than the same period in 2022 and a new record for any quarter.
The market operator said distributed PV output reached record highs in all regions, with October yielding a particularly notable 44% year-on-year increase in monthly average for the NEM. By contrast, the NEM-wide November average rose only 7% year-on-year, with New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland experiencing decreases on 2022 levels.
In December, this position reversed, with monthly averages falling in Victoria and South Australia within a 7% NEM-wide increase. At 17% for Q4 as a whole, year-on-year growth of distributed PV output was lower than in recent quarters which had recorded annual growth rates of about 30%.
By region, New South Wales (NSW) experienced a 20% increase in distributed PV output, reaching a quarterly average of 1,155 MW, while Queensland saw an 18% rise to average 1,063 MW.

Maximum instantaneous distributed PV share of underlying demand across the NEM reached a record high of 51.3% at 1.30pm on 29 October 2023. At the time, distributed PV output reached 11,583 MW while the underlying demand was at 22,592 MW. This was 0.6 percentage points higher than the previous record of 50.7% set on 30 September 2023.
The increase in distributed PV output was accompanied by increasing grid-scale renewable output and a new record for maximum instantaneous share of renewable energy generation of 72.1% was reached during the half-hour ending 1pm on 24 October 2023.
Grid-scale variable renewable energy output reached an all-time quarterly average record high of 5,168 MW, 14% higher than the corresponding period in 2022.
AEMO said the increase was predominantly driven by new and recently commissioned units in NSW and Queensland lifting NEM average grid-scale solar output to a record high of 2,021 MW, up 23% from Q4 2022.
At the end of Q4 2023, new capacity totalling 36 GW was progressing through the connection process from application to commissioning. During Q4 2023, AEMO approved applications for 6.5 GW of capacity across 28 projects, a notable increase from 1.7 GW across 11 projects in Q4 2022.
With continued year-on-year increases in battery capacity, average generation from the NEM battery fleet increased 21 MW to reach 47 MW in the last quarter of 2023.
While the share of renewables rose to new highs, average NEM black coal-fired generation fell to a new quarterly low of 9,189 MW. Gas-fired generation fell by 55 MW, mainly in South Australia and Victoria, while hydro output was down 219 MW driven by lower output in Tasmania and Victoria.
The increase in renewable output also drove NEM total emissions and emissions intensity to record low levels of 25.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2-e) and 0.59 tCO2-e/MWh respectively.
