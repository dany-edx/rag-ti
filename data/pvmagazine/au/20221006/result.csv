The Regulated Electricity Network Prices Are Higher than Necessary report, which analyses Australian Energy Regulator (AER) network productivity data, shows the profit that network service providers (NSP) extracted from electricity consumers in the eastern states over 2014-2021 was 67% higher than the “normal” level of profit.
The IEEFA said the regulatory system designed to prevent sustained excessive network monopoly profits has failed due to weak laws and rules regulating networks and a lack of transparency over the extent of monopoly profits. The IEEFA said the “persistent sector-wide supernormal profits” are out of step with national electricity laws and the regulator’s objective of ensuring that consumers pay no more than necessary.

Report author Simon Orme said regulatory change must occur immediately and has called for an independent inquiry, warning that supernormal profits have hindered Australia’s transition to a low-carbon electricity system by diverting funds that could have been used to fund the energy transformation.
“Australia’s energy customers have been spinning golden silk for network providers for nearly a decade,” said the former New Zealand and New South Wales (NSW) Treasury officer. “They can’t be expected to fund super profits any longer. The extra burden must be removed.”
He noted that the inefficiencies from excessive network prices, and wealth transfers created by persistent sector-wide supernormal profits are also delaying the decarbonisation of the electricity system.
“The $10 billion in super profits extracted by electricity networks over 2014-2021 is approaching the capital cost of AEMO-identified regulated transmission projects necessary to support the closure of most coal-fired power generation,” he said.

The report shows NSPs, including United Energy, Endeavour, SA Power Networks and AusNet, have over the past eight years consistently been charging electricity consumers too much, with regulated network revenue for transmission and distribution networks nearly 11% higher than total network costs.
Orme said of the 18 NSPs analysed, 14 extracted profit above an expected range. He said this imposed an unnecessary extra cost of between $800 to $1,200 per energy customer over the eight-year period, depending on the state they live in, with no additional reliability benefits.
On average, across all networks, 6.8% was added to customers’ retail bills but the range was broad – from 0.2% for Essential Energy in NSW to 17.3% for United Energy in Victoria. The report shows that of all jurisdictions, only the Australian Capital Territory managed to constrain revenue close to costs.

The IEEFA said the supernormal profits occurred because the current regulatory system, which is managed by energy market bodies including the AER, the Australian Energy Market Commission, the Council of Australian Governments Energy Council and the Australian Competition Tribunal, consistently overestimated the actual costs that network businesses would require to build, operate and maintain the network. Networks charged those overestimated costs to consumers via retailers.
Orme has called for the federal government to establish an independent commission of inquiry into the economic regulation of networks to ensure future profit excesses are reined in, warning there “is no time to waste”.
“The supernormal profits issue needs to be examined and rectified,” he said. “If this situation is not improved, energy consumers will continue to pay more than required for electricity distribution and transmission network services, and up to 43% more for new assets into the future, increasing the cost of the energy transition and deterring investment in low-carbon generation.”
Orme recommends the commission of inquiry should work to better reporting and monitoring of networks’ profits, make changes to the rules and laws to improve regulation, and remove barriers to have more consumers represented in the regulation process.

The REC Alpha Pure-R panel features G12 HJT cells in a patented panel design, delivering a power output of up to 430 W in a module that is less than 2 square meters in size which the company said makes it ideal for residential and commercial rooftop installations, where space is limited.
The Alpha Pure-R solar panel went into production last month on new manufacturing lines at REC’s Singapore facility, prompting the company to doubled its production capacity, ramping up from 600 MW to 1.2 GW per annum to match expected demand.
REC chief executive officer Jan Enno Bicker said the first Australian shipments of the REC Alpha Pure-R solar panel are already spoken for with the company having received orders well before production started.
“With the REC Alpha Pure-R, we are bringing another 600 MW of a lead-free HJT product to the market but based on larger G12 cells in a compact panel format for residential installations,” he said.
“The many pre-production orders confirm that our customers have full trust in REC’s innovations and our newest product hits well the demand.
“Now that production is underway, customers worldwide can access the power, space and environmental advantages of this new solar panel for their installations.”

The REC Alpha Pure-R Series is available in three versions, with power ratings ranging from 410 W to 430 W, and efficiencies of 21.2% to 22.3%. The new product is made with 80 heterojunction, half-cut monocrystalline solar cells and its maximum system voltage is 1,000 V.
The open-circuit voltage is between 55.8 V and 56.3 V and the short-circuit current ranges from 7.12 A to 7.24 A.  All three versions of the solar module measure 1,730 mm × 1,118 mm ×30 mm and weigh in at 21.5 kg.
The panel, which is divided into four strings, which reduces the size of sections that switch off under shaded conditions, can be used with operating temperatures ranging from -40 C to 85 C and the operating temperature coefficient is -0.26% per degree Celsius. It is enclosed between 3.2 mm solar glass with anti-reflective treatment, and also features a junction box with an IP 68 rating, a black polymer backsheet, and an anodized aluminium frame.
The manufacturer offers a 20-year linear power output guarantee and a 25-year product guarantee. It said the module series is eligible for the premium REC ProTrust warranty package, which offers up to 25 years coverage on product, performance and labor, with a guaranteed power of at least 92% in year 25 of operation.
“Featuring heterojunction cells in the large G12 format in a patented panel design, REC’s newest product delivers power output of up to 430 Wp, while keeping the module under 2 metres squared in area,” the manufacturer said. “This makes the new product ideal for residential installations where space is limited.”

Cemvita has moved its microbes from the lab to the field to produce hydrogen from existing infrastructure for depleted oil and gas wells. The company is betting on the biological production of hydrogen in the subsurface through the consumption of trapped or abandoned resources. “Cemvita scientists increased microbe performance by six and a half times the rate needed to produce hydrogen at US$1/kg (AUD 1.5/kg), a key milestone necessary to advance the program toward commercialisation,” said the Texas-based company. “The subsequent field trial was completed in the Permian basin with a partnering company, where the team successfully measured hydrogen concentrations three orders of magnitude above baseline.”
Deutsche Bahn and Australia’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) have agreed on a cooperation plan. For their first project, the partners are working on modifying diesel engines for locomotives and traction vehicles to operate with ammonia and hydrogen. “The advantage over a pure hydrogen engine is that ammonia has a higher energy density than liquid hydrogen and is easier to transport and store,” wrote Deutsche Bahn. The ammonia-hydrogen engine features a cracker from Germany’s Ammonigy. The cracker splits a small part of the ammonia outside the engine into hydrogen and nitrogen. The hydrogen produced is mixed with the remaining ammonia as an ignition gas. The first prototype of the engine is currently being tested on an engine test bench. 
Alberta‘s government has started talking to a number of Japanese companies about collaborating on LNG, hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol, said Dale Nally, the associate minister of natural gas and electricity in the Canadian province. “Alberta is committed to being a global leader in hydrogen and liquefied natural gas,” Nally said, noting that the province now accounts for about 90% of Canada’s total oil sands production. Nally recently traveled to Japan to participate in Japan’s Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting and visit the Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field. Canadian companies are currently in talks with Japanese companies such as Itochu and Mitsubishi. 
Argus has launched a suite of new hydrogen cost indicators on the economics of hydrogen production in the context of carbon capture. The price reporting agency said that it now publishes hydrogen costs and prices for more than 400 locations throughout the world. The decision comes at a moment when several companies, like ICIS, are increasing hydrogen reporting. 
The European Commission has approved a €134 million (AUD 205 million) German measure to support BASF’s production of renewable hydrogen under EU state aid rules. The objective is to decarbonise its chemical production processes and promote hydrogen use in the transport sector. The direct grant will support the construction of a 54 MW electrolyser at BASF’s site in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Operations are scheduled to start in 2025.

Developers recently commissioned two different agrivoltaic projects linked to wine production in Europe.
Iberdrola commissioned a 40 kW array at the vineyards of Gonzalez Byass and Emperor Group in Guadamur, Spain. The installation will use trackers controlled by an AI algorithm capable of determining the optimal position of the solar panels. The degree of inclination will be established based on information collected by the sensors in the vineyards, which record information related to solar radiation, soil humidity, wind conditions, or thickness of the vine trunk, among others.
González Byass and Grupo Emperador will use the electricity production from the solar array for its wineries located nearby. Iberdrola will monitor the results of the project over the next year and states that it plans to replicate the project in other wine farms in Spain.
Techedge and PVH, a manufacturer of trackers and mounting structures, have also worked on the project, which is being handled by Perseo, Iberdrola’s startup program.
In a separate development, France’s TotalEnergies and Ombrea said they have switched on their first agrivoltaic pilot on the Rivals wine estate in Aude, in southern France. The 85.6 kW project extends over an area of approximately 3,000 square meters. It features Ombrea’s agrivoltaic system, which is controlled by an algorithm based on meteorological and agronomic data collected through sensors.
The pilot will shed light on plant physiology and photosynthetic activity, due to agronomic monitoring conducted in partnership with the French Institute of Vine and Wine (IFV), SudExpé and the Aude Chamber of Agriculture. The two companies said the first visual results for plant growth, water requirements, and temperature variation will be ready by as early as January 2023.
The companies plan to follow up on the research within five years.
“Thanks to the data collected and analysed on this pilot, we will be able, with Ombrea, to refine our knowledge and offer operators high value-added solutions,” said Alexandre Morin, development director for TotalEnergies Renouvelables France.
