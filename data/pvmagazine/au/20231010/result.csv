The offering pairs Panasonic’s CO2 Heat Pump with Reclaim Energy’s hot water system design and will be available in Australia from December.
Panasonic’s CO2 Heat Pump boasts a 6.1 coefficient of performance, meaning for every unit of electrical energy used, 6.1 units of heating energy is produced.

Heat pumps are gaining traction in Australia, with a recent report from Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator noting that air source heat pumps installations are up 70% compared to the first half of 2022.
Panasonic says it has installed approximately two million hot water heat pumps in the Japanese market and holds the country’s marketshare. “We’re very pleased to be rolling this technology out locally here in Australia,” Managing Director of Panasonic Australia, Paul Reid, said.
The heat pump system uses a heat exchanger to collect heat from the air outside to use as energy for the refrigerant, and transfers energy from the hot refrigerant into water to produce hot water.
Both heat pump and storage tank are designed to be installed externally.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/10/australia-opens-applications-for-2-billion-hydrogen-support-program/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Australia opens applications for $2 billion green hydrogen support program,"The Australian government has today opened to Expressions of Interest for its $2 billion (USD 1.28 billion) Hydrogen Headstart program, which seeks to bridge the commercial gap between the cost of producing green hydrogen and the market price for large-scale projects.
“We currently have the largest [hydrogen] project pipeline of any single country in the world,” the Clean Energy Council’s Policy Director for Decarbonisation, Anna Freeman, said. “But proponents have been finding it extremely challenging to convert this renowned potential into commercially viable projects.”

Even this may be an understatement, with the federal government’s Resources and Energy Major Projects 2022 report noting that just one hydrogen project reached the ‘committed’ stage last year. Moreover, only three out of 16 projects included in last year’s report progressed beyond the feasibility stage — of which one was a pilot program.
This is to say, there is a stark chasm between the plethora of hydrogen project announcements made in the last years and the reality on Australian ground. This chasm has become a major source of alarm with the introduction of the US’ massive renewables support program, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes substantial green hydrogen subsidies. Likewise, Europe and other nations have brought in significant policies and programs to compete for the burgeoning market, which is estimated to be worth trillions in coming decades.

The Hydrogen Headstart program is intended to help Australian keep a foot in the global door. The program was co-designed by the Commonwealth Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which will administer the program.
The program is expected to support a minimum of two large-scale projects with at least 50 MW of capacity over a 10-year period, via a production credit per kilogram of hydrogen produced, the Clean Energy Council said.
The EOI applications will be open until November 10, 2023. The proponents of shortlisted projects will then be invited to develop full applications.

As aluminium graphite, used in MGA’s technology, can react with water, there were initially concerns around the potential for an explosion, however this did not eventuate and the situation was brought under control within the day.
Startup MGA Thermal is currently in the process of commissioning its 5 MWh trial plant in Tomago, just north of Newcastle in New South Wales (NSW). The plant focusses on demonstrating the company’s technology which stores heat in blocks made largely from aluminium and graphite and dispatching it to generate electricity, taking a “miscibility gap alloy” approach to thermal energy storage.

Fire and Rescue NSW’s Deputy Commissioner of Field Operations, Jeremy Fewtrell said the novel nature of the technology and demonstration plant meant this particular emergency was highly usual, with it described as an Australian first. “Due to the unusual nature and large device size, the incident quickly escalated, and numerous specialists were consulted in person and remotely,” Fewtrell said. 
Scott Dodson, FRNSW’s Operational Media Coordinator, said MGA Thermal had been “excellent” at cooperating with fire crews and offering engineering help with the novel emergency.
According to 9News, the shipping container MGA’s pilot machine sits within was “glowing red.” An exclusion zone was created around the Tomago plant, including evacuations of nearby industrial buildings.

“After speaking with the site representatives, who were devastated by the events of today, I encouraged them to find their feet and continue their innovative efforts to produce green and clean energy,” Jeremy Fewtrell said.
MGA’s patented thermal energy storage blocks, about the size of a large house brick, consist of small alloy particles embedded within graphite-based blocks enclosed in a fully insulated system. Once heated the alloy particles can store heat for days with minimal energy loss. Heat exchangers are used a transfer gas to absorb heat from the blocks, with the heated gas or fluid suitable for industrial heat applications or to drive a steam turbine to generate electricity.
The pilot unit, believed to be the machine which overheated, measured about 12m x 3m x 4m, and had been fitted with approximately 3,700 MGA blocks.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/10/brookfields-18-billion-bid-for-origin-energy-approved-accc/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,LEGAL,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,CANADA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 10, 2023",Brookfield’s $18 billion bid for Origin approved by ACCC,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has granted authorisation for Canadian investment giant Brookfield to acquire Australia’s second largest energy generator and retailer, Origin Energy. While the ACCC flagged competition concerns stemming from Brookfield’s vertical integration, the regulator ultimately decided the public benefit of accelerating the energy transition outweighed potential detriments.
The board of Origin Energy gave the green light to Brookfield’s plan back in March, with Origin describing the ACCC’s decision as an “important milestone” in finalising the acquisition. That said, the deal still requires shareholder approval by at least 75% of the votes cast.
The ACCC focussed heavily on the what the deal would mean for Australia’s decarbonisation in its  authorisation ruling, noting that its process included two distinct assessments: whether the proposal would substantially lessen competition and whether public benefits would outweigh the likely public detriments.
“On the first limb of the test, we are not satisfied that the proposed acquisition would not be likely to substantially lessen competition. However, after a detailed review, we are satisfied that the proposed acquisition is likely to result in public benefits that would outweigh the likely public detriments,” ACCC Chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said.
In June, Brookfield made its case to the ACCC and upped the amount of money it said it would invest in decarbonising Origin, flagging figures as high as $30 billion (USD 20 billion), up from the previous $20 billion plan. The Canadian company says it will use that capital to develop up to 14 GW of new renewable generation and storage assets within the Origin Energy business by 2033, flagging its international supply chain and technology partnerships as enablers of its ambitious plans. Brookfield, a global asset manager, has approximately USD 850 billion ($1.32 trillion) worth of assets under management.
In terms of likely detriments, concerns essentially boil down to Brookfield’s controlling stake in AusNet, which owns significant energy network infrastructure in Victoria controlling its high-voltage electricity transmission system. “We are particularly concerned with Brookfield’s ability to influence AusNet to obstruct rival generators from connecting to the transmission grid or operate the transmission network to favour Origin’s generators,” Cass-Gottlieb said.
Despite concerns, the ACCC deemed mitigating factors enough to “limit obvious or extreme discrimination.” 
“These include AEMO’s Victorian-specific planning and connection roles in relation to the transmission network, the different ownership of the Brookfield funds making the investments, the ongoing role of regulators, the role of minority investors in the relevant entities and the enforceable undertakings given by Brookfield and AusNet to meet conditions imposed by the ACCC,” it said.
Brookfield also holds a 50% stake in smart metering company Intellihub.
The Origin shareholder vote is expected around the end of the year or beginning of 2024, but recently Origin Energy’s biggest shareholder, Australian Super, said it felt Origin’s shares had been undervalued, suggesting the $18.7 billion bid figure was not high enough. Australian Super has also recently raised its stake in Origin and now owns around 14%, meaning it controls a big enough stake to impact the shareholder vote.
Australia has seen a number of high-profile and novel corporate plays in the last 18 months, with Brookfield and billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes initially teaming up to bid for Australia’s biggest “gentailer” AGL. After that play was unsuccessful, Brookfield refocused this trojan horse strategy on Origin, meanwhile Cannon-Brookes bought a controlling stake in AGL to thwart its demerger plan. This is to say, even the corporate governance side of Australia’s energy industry has been in a state of major upheaval.
Finally, while the ACCC has given the greenlight for Brookfield to pursue its Origin vision, it noted the state of Australia’s grid might throw up technical problems. “Constraints within the electricity transmission network, particularly in the short-term, which may delay Brookfield’s ability to build renewable energy generation at the speed claimed,” Cass-Gottlieb said.
A largely overlooked facet of this story are the questions raised about Brookfield’s history of aggressive global tax dodging. Earlier this year, a report from the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability & Research  flagged Brookfield’s tax avoidance on a global scale.
Independent outlet Michael West Media has also published multiple articles and investigations into the company’s tax history in Australia.

German startup 1Komma5° has unveiled plans to build a solar module manufacturing facility in eastern Germany.
The Hamburg-based company said the new factory will be located in the states of Brandenburg or Saxony. It will start commercial operations next year. The facility will produce TOPCon panels and will initially have an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The company plans to expand the capacity to 5 GW by 2030.
This year, the startup launched new 415 W full black TOPCon modules. The company uses polysilicon from Wacker Chemie for its solar modules, which are currently manufactured in China according to its own specifications. Wacker Chemie’s polysilicon will also be used in production in Germany.
1Komma5° initially refrained from disclosing the source of the solar cells for its solar modules and the exact investment amount allocated for its production facility setup. Its response to pv magazine‘s inquiry is still pending. However, the company has recently expanded its supply chains to encompass the markets of Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Italy, and Australia.
