The facility will also include reciprocating gas fuel power generation, with gas to be supplied from the Goldfields Gas Pipeline, located 12km west of the mine site near Leonora in the Eastern Goldfields region of WA.
The contract includes provision for a potential upgrade of the power plant with power supply to the site expected to commence in early 2022.
Red 5 managing director Mark Williams said the PPA marked an important construction milestone for the King of the Hills project and would help the company reduce the carbon footprint of the project.
“We are pleased to have signed the Power Purchase Agreement with Zenith, an experienced power producer which provided us with a compelling hybrid thermal and sustainable power solution that includes renewable energy,” he said.
“Zenith’s combination of a gas and solar power station, supported by a battery energy storage system, provides the efficiency and stability required for the processing plant and infrastructure to enable King of the Hills to be a long-life, low-cost gold producer.”
The project expands Zenith’s portfolio of off-grid power stations to an even dozen, including the 26 MW hybrid solar PV-diesel power plant servicing the Independence Group’s Nova nickel, copper and cobalt mine in WA’s Fraser Range region.

Red 5 is just the latest mining company to recognise the value of solar PV with renewables-powered mining on the rise in Australia.
Global mining giant BHP announced in January it had signed an agreement with Risen Energy for the 100 MWdc Merredin Solar Farm in WA to supply up to 50% of the miner’s electricity needs for its Nickel West Kwinana refinery over the coming 10 years.
That announcement came after it had signed a five-year energy take-off agreement to use green sources for half of its Queensland energy needs.
Rio Tinto is also looking to transition to renewables, approving the construction of a $98 million solar and BESS at its Koodaideri mine in the Pilbara. The project will feature a 34 MW solar PV plant alongside a 12 MWh lithium-ion battery.
In one of the biggest renewable energy projects in the resource sector, Fortescue Metals has announced its Chichester iron ore mining hub in WA’s Pilbara region will be run entirely off renewable energy during the day, powered by a massive 60 MW solar farm coupled with a 35 MW/11 MWh battery facility.
Other notable developments in Western Australia include a 7.3 MW solar array and 2 MW/1 MWh battery at the Granny Smith gold mine in the Eastern Goldfields region and the DeGrussa project – a hybrid system located at Sandfire’s copper and gold mine site in WA, which comprises a 10.6 MW solar facility coupled with a 6 MWh battery facility – integrated with an existing diesel generator.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/04/02/aemo-publishes-engineering-framework-for-accelerating-energy-transition/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"APRIL 2, 2021",AEMO publishes ‘Engineering Framework’ for accelerating energy transition,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has built on its 2020 Integrated System Plan (ISP) and 2020 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (SOO) with the publication of its Engineering Framework March 2021 report, another effort toward organising the National Energy Market’s (NEM) infrastructure in the accelerating energy transition.
AEMO’s manager of future energy systems, Chris Davies, said support for the concept of an engineering framework had strong support from industry. “Together with industry, we’ll be working to identify possible future operational conditions for the NEM power system, understand current work underway to then collectively act to address the most urgent issues,” said Davies.
As indeed any engineer would approve, this March framework is more of a framework for the framework, or, as Davies called it, “a baseline for the Framework, so we can understand all the moving parts across industry and work out how they fit together, including future priorities for AEMO.”
A key focus of the report is the accelerating growth of wind and solar and what operational changes are underway to support that. According to AEMO wind and solar, which reached a high of 38% of electricity supply at one point in 2018, rose to 52% in 2020.

This acceleration means that, in the words of the report, “We are already in the realm of new and challenging operational conditions. The Renewable Integration Study (RIS) identified that for wind and solar penetrations greater than 50% coordinated action was needed to support a secure transition.”
Examples of these “operational conditions” include:
• Operation at very low operational demand.
• Operation with daily cycles from very low to very high levels of synchronous generation.
• Operation with high penetrations (>75%) of wind and solar in one or more neighbouring regions.
• Operation of a system with high volumes of price-responsive energy storage or demand response.

As a result, AEMO says that everyone needs to come together and “actively plan and consider what changes need to be made so we are prepared to operate during these periods. The Engineering Framework seeks to collaborate on operational conditions that may arise, so the power system continually delivers desired outcomes for consumers.”
“The NEM is rapidly moving towards operating for hours at a time with a completely different mix of generation sources,” continued Davies, “which will be unique for any large power system in the world. Working together as an industry we can plan our way through these changes to provide a sustainable energy system that delivers affordable, safe and reliable energy for all Australians.”

The Biden administration revealed a $2 trillion infrastructure investment plan intended to create millions of jobs, rebuild the country’s infrastructure, and target the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure investments to disadvantaged communities.
Solar made it into the American Jobs Plan in the form of a proposed 10-year extension and phase down of an expanded direct-pay investment tax credit and production tax credit for clean energy generation and storage.
The plan would also use the federal government’s purchasing power to secure 24/7 clean power for federal buildings.

Besides extending the investment tax credit, the Biden proposal would create an investment tax credit to incentivise the buildout of at least 20 GW of high-voltage-capacity transmission power lines and mobilises tens of billions in private capital.
Ageing transmission infrastructure has long been cited as an issue that will hold the clean energy transition back from achieving its full potential.
The plan would also establish a new Grid Deployment Authority at the Department of Energy. It would allow for better leverage of rights-of-way along roads and railways via financing tools to spur additional high-priority, high-voltage transmission lines.
Affirming his earlier commitment to move the federal vehicle fleet to electric vehicles (EVs), Biden also proposed a $174 billion investment in EV, aimed at spurring domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retooling factories to compete globally, and supporting American efforts to make batteries and EVs.
The plan also would offer consumers  point of sale rebates and tax incentives to buy American-made EVs that are affordable and manufactured in the U.S. State and local governments as well as the private sector would have access to grant and incentive programs to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.
 

The plan also includes goals of replacing 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and transitioning to an electric school bus fleet.
Biden once again noted U.S. declines in investment in research and development (R&D). Biden called on Congress to invest $50 billion in the National Science Foundation to create a technology directorate that would work with and build on existing programs across the government. The initiative would focus on a number of R&D fields, including advanced energy technologies.
Independent of this proposed $50 billion, Biden also called for Congress to invest $35 billion to address the climate crisis and “position America as the global leader in clean energy technology and clean energy jobs.”
The investment would include $15 billion in demonstration projects for climate R&D priorities, including utility-scale energy storage, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, floating offshore wind, biofuel/bioproducts, and electric vehicles.
The solar industry and broader clean tech sector greeted the proposal with near-uniform support .

Of the plan, Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA),  “President Biden’s infrastructure proposal is a significant step in meeting our collective clean energy goals. The plan creates jobs, spurs the economy, faces the climate crisis, and advances environmental justice.”
In an interview with pv magazine USA earlier this year, she emphasised the importance of stable policymaking, particularly at the federal level.
Gregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), had similar praise for the plan. In a statement, he commended the Biden administration for using the infrastructure bill to tackle the climate crisis. He said, “The American Jobs Plan will move the clean energy sector beyond the endless cycles of temporary stopgap incentives toward a stable, long-term tax platform that will put millions of Americans back to work, upgrading our outdated grid and building a 21st century renewable energy economy.”
But Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, criticised the plan, saying that it “falls short on climate.”
Rather than adopt a Marshall Plan-type approach to climate and renewable energy, he said the “industry-friendly infrastructure plan” includes “gimmicky subsidies for carbon capture, fantastically wishes the free market will save us, and fails to take crucial and ambitious steps toward phasing out fossil fuels.” He said that although the Biden administration has pledged to cut carbon emissions 50% and decarbonise the electricity sector “this proposal won’t even come close.”

Technology multinational Apple Inc has announced that 110 of its manufacturing partners around the world are moving to 100% renewable energy for the parts of their respective production which relate to Apple components.
The Cupertino-based company specified these suppliers are developing a combined renewable energy capacity of around 8 GW. “We are firmly committed to helping our suppliers become carbon neutral by 2030 and are thrilled that companies who’ve joined us span industries and countries around the world including Germany, China, the U.S., India, and France,” stated Apple vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson.
This initiative is part of the group’s plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. For its global corporate operations, this target has already been achieved, the company claims.
Among the suppliers, there are Netherlands-based DSM Engineering Materials, French-Italian semiconductor business STMicroelectronics, Belgian chemical company Solvay, U.S.-based semiconductor provider Alpha and Omega Semiconductor, U.S. flexible component manufacturer Marian, and U.S. chemical companies Chemours Company and Trinseo. “And, in China, 15 suppliers have joined Apple’s program since July 2020,” Apple added.
Apple revealed plans in 2018 to power its global operations with 100% clean energy. The plan covers its operations in 43 countries, including retail stores, offices, data centers and other facilities.
