The state’s announcement is fairly opaque, providing a link to the state’s public knowledge sharing reports rather than the study itself. It does, however, mention UK electrolyser manufacturer ITM Power and Germany’s Linde Engineering – presumably the international companies the government said it had partnered with to create the study.
According to the WA government, a 2 GW per annum electrolyser manufacturing facility in the state has the potential to create around 200 direct engineering technician jobs and 1000 indirect jobs. Moreover, it would inject $200 million per annum to the local economy through associated services.
The new industry would also support the creation of around 18,000 new jobs during the construction phase for new hydrogen projects and up to 2500 ongoing maintenance jobs, the state government said.
“The report also suggests a range of policy interventions to facilitate the development of an electrolyser manufacturing industry in the state,” the announcement notes, though no further details were provided.
“Developing a global-scale electrolyser manufacturing industry in WA will enable the state to better position itself in the renewable hydrogen supply chain,” Hydrogen Industry Minister Bill Johnston said.
“An update of WA’s Renewable Hydrogen Strategy is currently under way, which will consider options to explore how gaps in the supply chain can be addressed.”
“Companies seeking to pursue electrolyser manufacturing opportunities in WA are encouraged to apply for grant funding under the next round of the Investment Attraction Fund,” Johnston added.

The state government claims the new laws will fast-track the local hydrogen industry, unlocking $33 billion in economic activity by 2040. Essentially the legislation will apply the existing safety frameworks for Queensland pipelines to hydrogen and other renewable gases, including the requirement to develop safety management systems and comply with safety requirements.
Like Queensland, South Australia has recently been reforming its legal frameworks around hydrogen, introducing the Hydrogen and Renewable Energy Bill 2023 in September saying the new laws would facilitate and regulate the generation of hydrogen and renewable energy in certain areas of South Australia.
Coming back to Queensland, state Resources Minister Scott Stewart said: “this legislation not only enables the transportation of hydrogen through pipelines but puts in place conditions to make sure it’s done safely.”
“The Australian Hydrogen Council welcomes the progression of regulatory reforms in Queensland, which are critical for the hydrogen industry to plan and invest with confidence,” Dr Fiona Simon, CEO Australian Hydrogen Council, added. “It is important that states and territories address legislative barriers and extend regulation where appropriate to support the safe production, transportation and use of hydrogen.”
The Queensland government says it has more than 50 hydrogen projects underway across the state.

The company’s Charging as a Service works on a subscription model with no upfront installation costs for businesses, who can install the hardware and technologies at both their commercial premises and employee’s homes. JET Charge describes the solution as a “fuel-card-like experience” that is inclusive of installation, repairs and ongoing reporting.
The initiative has been supported by the government, via ARENA, because it says the approach will accelerate the electrification of Australia’s transport fleets which account for 50% of new vehicle sales in Australia. 
“Greater uptake among fleets will help grow a second-hand market and help get more Australians behind the wheel of an EV,” the statement from Chris Bowen, Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy, said. Bowen attended the JET Charge launch on Wednesday in Port Melbourne alongside ARENA CEO Darren Miller.
The project is expected to help drive the uptake of more than 3,100 EVs over the next three years, according to Bowen.

While Australia has lagged in its uptake of electric vehicles, Bowen noted that EV’s have now jumped from 2% of new car sales in May 2022 to almost 9% today.

While details on the cost of the “full service” monthly JET Charge subscription are not provided, Bowen’s media release notes that petrol vehicle cost around $2,400 per year to drive on average, indicating something in this ballpark.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/11/registrations-open-for-storage-underwriting-scheme-in-sa-and-victoria/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",Registrations open for 600 MW storage underwriting scheme in SA and Victoria,"Following the launch of the first Capacity Investment Scheme tender in New South Wales earlier this year, the South Australian, Victorian and federal governments have today come together to announce the opening of registrations for projects in the two southern states.
The program is open to utility-scale long-duration storage projects, including batteries, hydrogen and pumped hydro. Projects must be at least 30 MW in size and capable of storing energy for a minimum of two hours. 
In total, the tender is looking to underwrite 600 MW of storage capacity. During a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Chris Bowen, Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy, clarified the scheme is seeking 200 MW in Victoria, 200 MW in South Australia, and “200 megawatts up for the best bids across both jurisdictions.”
“Of course, South Australia and Victoria are very closely linked grids, and it makes sense to do this together,” he added.
The Australian Energy Market Operator’s AEMO Services will conduct the two-stage tender process. Announcements about finalised approved projects are expected to be made by early next year, according to Bowen.

Australia’s Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) was signed off by the Commonwealth, and all state and territory governments in December 2022. The underwriting scheme will essentially see the federal government pay revenue shortfalls based on a pre-agreed floor, guaranteeing storage projects baseline income. If revenues exceed an agreed price ceiling, the government will take a share of profits. That is, the program seeks to guarantee investment certainly for storage projects which has historically impeded the progress of such projects.
From today, storage projects in South Australia and Victoria can register with AEMO Services to be part of the scheme and are invited to provide basic project details. Projects can then submit a bid with AEMO Services once tenders officially open shortly, and AEMO Services will then ensure the projects are technically and financially sound.
Following that, the best projects will be invited to submit a full application, which will involve providing a revenue floor to support projects through times of low revenue. 
If a project is successful, it will get an agreement that lasts up to 15 years, called a Capacity Investment Scheme Agreement.
Back in August when the tender was first announced, the governments noted projects which had reached Final Investment Decision (FID) after the Capacity Investment Scheme was announced in December 2022 would also be eligible for support.
With New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia now folded in, the Capacity Investment Scheme will eventually be expanded to other parts of Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/11/australias-largest-battery-equis-2-4-gwh-battery-in-melbourne-secures-federal-approval/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,LEGAL,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",‘Australia’s largest battery’: Equis’ 2.4 GWh battery in Melbourne secures federal approval,"The Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub, set to include the Asia Pacific’s largest battery to date, was approved by Australia’s Minister for the Environment and Water, Tanya Plibersek, on Tuesday.
The enormous 1,200 MW / 2.4 GWh battery appears to the Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub’s (MREH) mainstay and is said to be capable of powering over 1 million households. The project also includes a small solar component and could potentially expand to include hydrogen and battery recycling facilities.
The project is to be located on a 90-hectare site in Plumpton, 25 kilometres northwest of Melbourne and is owned by Equis Development, backed by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board. The project was originally developed by Syncline Energy, which first unveiled  the plan in 2021, calling it the Melton Renewable Energy Hub. It was rebranded by Equis when it took full ownership of the project in 2022. At the time, it was reported than Equis had committed $1.9 billion (USD 1.22 billion) to the project.
Initially, Equis was aiming for the MREH to enter into operations by 2024. The MREH website currently says that a “notice to proceed for construction is planned for late 2023 with commercial operations expected to commence in 2025.”
Victorian government
In 2022, it was reported the project would use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry batteries provided by Finnish technology group Wartsila.
“MREH is Australia’s only BESS [battery energy storage system] above 200 MW in capacity that connects to the NEM’s [National Electricity Market’s] high voltage 500 kV transmission system, allowing a volume of electricity to be rapidly dispatched unmatched by other battery storage systems,” Equis has said of the project.
It added that the project has been “uniquely developed” with six separate 200 MW points of connection to the national grid, allowing the battery to satisfy different uses and grid responses simultaneously.
The website also noted the project will replace ‘system inertia’ as coal plants retire, meaning it will deploy grid forming inverter technology capable of providing network support services.

Previous developer Syncline also noted the battery’s position should allow it to support Victoria’s Murray River, Western Victoria and South Victoria renewable energy zones, with Equis adding that it is expected to be capable of stabilising about 1.6 GW of solar power or 1.2 GW of wind generation.
The information around the solar component of the MREH project is somewhat confusing, with the project’s website flagging a “1.6 GWh of energy storage and a 12.5 MW co-located solar farm.”
For one, the battery details here don’t seem to be correct, as Plibersek’s media release on Tuesday says the storage capacity will be 2.4 GWh. Moreover, a 12.5 MW solar farm seems comparatively minuscule, though when the project was initially launched by Syncline, it noted the solar component was simply to supply the battery’s ancillary cooling loads and ensure low cost, ‘net-zero’ operations.
Equis has been in the Australian market for many years and was originally Singapore-based. In 2018, Equis Energy was sold to Global Infrastructure Partners and was renamed Vena Energy. Not long after the sale, however, Equis Development emerged and included much of the company’s previous management.
The MREH project is just one of a 39 renewable energy, battery storage and waste infrastructure projects worth more than $6.5 billion that Equis has said it is currently developing in Australia.
While the MREH is the biggest of its battery projects, Equis has also announced plans to develop a 300MW/1,200MWh battery near Tamworth in New South Wales, a 200 MW/800 MWh energy storage system near Brinkworth in South Australia and two battery projects totalling 250 MW in Queensland.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/11/novel-thin-film-anti-soiling-coating-increases-solar-module-yield-by-over-3/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 11, 2023",Novel thin-film anti-soiling coating increases solar module yield by over 3%,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the Madison Area Technical College in the Wisconsin have tested superhydrophobic self-cleaning, anti-soiling coatings that, if applied to photovoltaic modules, can purportedly increase the panels’ yield by over 3%.
The coatings are based on nanoparticle oxide suspensions developed by US-based Microporous Oxides Science and Technology, LLC (MOST), which specialises in the preparation of stable suspensions of nanoparticulate oxides for use as coatings on several substrates to produce self-assembled porous thin-films for a wide variety of applications.
The researchers tested, in particular, anti-soiling coatings created via spray deposition and sol-gel synthesis, a wet-chemical technique commonly utilised for the production of both glassy and ceramic materials. The coatings were made with a nanoparticulate suspension containing a mixture of titania, titanium oxide (TiO2), silica, silicon dioxide (SiO2) and metal oxides.
The advantage of using sol-gel synthesis is not using heat to make the coating adhere to the underlying glass cover of the PV module, which allows the films to consolidate, cure, bond, and harden upon exposure to sunlight in the field.
“Metal oxide thin films containing nanoparticulate photoactive materials such as titania are capable of sintering upon excitation from ultraviolet radiation,” the scientists explained. “This sunlight-induced UV sintering process serves to chemically bond the nanoparticles to one another, and to the solar PV module’s glazing surface, rendering a durable thin film that is resistant to wear and dissolution.”
The research team coated the solar modules in an automotive collision repair spray booth with two different spray guns and nozzles. “After spraying, the modules were allowed to air dry in the spray booths, which were maintained at 15% relative humidity,” the scientists explained.
They then tested the coating on a PV system relying on eight 370 W south-oriented coated bifacial modules mounted with a tile angle of 10 degrees provided by Jordan-based Philadelphia Solar. Their performance was compared with that of eight uncoated reference panels of the same kind.
The field tests showed that soiling residues on the coated modules were thinner than those in the uncoated panels.
“Coated and uncoated solar modules also demonstrated significantly different wetting behaviour in the field that was easily visible to the naked eye,” the research group said in the report. “Rain deposited on the uncoated panels tended to bead up, forming raised droplets on the surface. By comparison, rain on the coated panels tended to sheet, wetting a much larger portion of the panel’s surface.”
The analysis showed that the coated panels achieved an annual power production of 1,097 kWh/kW, while the uncoated modules achieved a yield of 1,058 kWh/kW. “While a 3 to 3.5% energy gain may appear modest, improvements of this magnitude would be of significant financial importance to the industry,” the researchers said.
They also specified that the cost of thin film coating materials is approximately $80 per liter and estimated the cost per panel at about $2.6, which would represent an increase of about 1.4% in the total cost of the panel. “It appears clear that the MOST coatings tested in this study have strong potential to be a commercially viable product for solar manufacturing.”
The novel anti-soiling coating was presented in the study “Field tests of a self-sintering, anti-soiling, self-cleaning, nanoporous metal oxide, transparent thin film coating for solar photovoltaic modules,” published in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells.
“As of August 2023, we have successfully coated modules from several different manufacturers, including Adani, Axitec, Crossroads, REC, Silfab, Trina and Yingli,” the scientists said referring to the future direction of their work. “We hope to report on field tests using those coated modules in the next year or two.”
