The government also announced the state-owned energy company Stanwell is progressing plans to develop a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to the 1.4 GW Tarong Power Station site near Nanango in the South Burnett.
The big battery blitz comes after a turbine failure at the coal-fired Callide Power Station left nearly 500,000 homes and businesses without power for several hours on Tuesday night.
The power outage sparked calls for the introduction of more utility scale batteries capable of providing security for the state’s electricity network and Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the government is moving quickly to invest in storage solutions that support the continued uptake of renewables.
“Large-scale battery storage completely changes the game for how our electricity system operates,” he said.
The first of the utility scale batteries to connect to the grid will be the Wandoan South BESS with government-owned transmission service provider Powerlink collaborating with Vena Energy to progress the project. located near Wandoan, 400km north-west of Brisbane.
“The $120 million Wandoan BESS project is the first to connect a large-scale battery directly to the state’s grid,” de Brenni said.
“The battery will have the capacity to power up to 57,000 homes every year, and store 150 MWh of energy, so it’s around 25 times the capacity of the largest battery currently operating in Queensland.”
Powerlink chief executive Paul Simshauser said project works are expected to be completed in the coming months.
“A kilometre of underground transmission cable is being installed to safely and efficiently transfer stored battery power into the grid from the existing Wandoan South Substation,” he said.
“Works at the substation are being completed over various stages to upgrade an existing substation bay so we can accommodate the new battery connection.”
Meanwhile, Stanwell is progressing plans to develop a 150 MW/300 MWh battery alongside the coal-fired Tarong Power Station.
Stanwell acting CEO Adam Aspinall said a feasibility study had confirmed there are commercial opportunities in locating a large-scale energy storage system in southern Queensland and the company is now looking to complete Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) work with a view to reaching a final investment decision in the second half of 2021.
“By locating battery storage at Tarong Power Station, we can capitalise on existing land and connection infrastructure, support the investment in renewables within the region and help maintain system security and reliability,” he said.
It is expected the initial 150 MW battery will commence operation in 2023 while there is potential to increase the battery’s storage capacity for further deployment between 2025 and 2030.
Aspinall said large-scale energy storage will play an important role in Queensland’s future as higher levels of renewable energy enter the system.
“According to the Australian Energy Market Operator’s 2020 Final Integrated System Plan, over 3,600 MW of new large-scale energy storage will be required in Queensland over the next 20 years,” he said.
“Energy storage will be critical as it helps facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the energy system by storing electricity generated by wind and solar and supplying it to the market when required.”.
Aspinall said Stanwell had been investigating energy storage opportunities since early 2018, confirming the company has lodged two connection enquiries with Powerlink for a battery facility at both the Tarong and the Stanwell power station sites.
“As a business, we are investigating a range of future energy solutions to ensure we are in the best position possible to respond to changing market,” he said.
“We are investigating a range of opportunities to incorporate technologies into our asset portfolio, including hydrogen, energy storage, wind, solar and bioenergy.”
The latest announcement adds to a string of proposed big battery developments for Quuensland.
AGL Energy plans to build a 100 MW/150 MWh battery next to the 453 MW Cooper’s Gap wind farm near Kingaroy while Neoen is planning to build 150 MW of battery storage as part of its proposed 460 MW Western Downs Green Power Hub to be constructed near Chinchilla and has also submitted plans to develop a 100 MW battery project in Queensland’s far north.
The Queensland Government has also announced plans to install five large-scale, network-connected batteries, with a combined capacity of 40 MWh in regions across the state as part of a community battery trial.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/27/dug-technologies-targets-renewables-hot-spot-for-new-data-centre/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 27, 2021",Dug Technologies targets renewables hot spot for new data centre,"Perth-based Dug Technology has announced plans to build a 6 MW data high-performance computing campus on a 45-hectare site at Geraldton in the state’s mid-west and plans to power the facility using solar PV and wind power.
Dug Technology’s CEO and founder, Matt Lamont, said the installation of an onsite hydrogen battery system is also being investigated as part of the $5 million first stage.
The company, which already has data centres in Perth, Houston, London and Kuala Lumpur, said the decision to build in Geraldton was based on the city’s growing reputation as “one of the world’s premier renewable energy regions”.
“It has an ideal climate for both wind and solar, which complement each other to enable round-the-clock power supply,” the company said in a statement.
The region is fast becoming a renewable energy hotspot with the State Government last year calling for expressions of interest into its potentially 1.5 GW solar and wind hydrogen hub at Oakajee, 23km north of Geraldton.
Danish investment firm Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is also looking to the region to further develop its green hydrogen initiatives, joining with Hydrogen Renewables Australia as it looks to develop the 5 GW Murchison Renewable Hydrogen Project near Kalbarri.
Dug Technology, which provides high-performance computing and software solutions for the global technology and resource sectors, said its Geraldton campus would utilise the company’s patented immersion-cooling technology, avoiding air-cooling infrastructure which it labelled inefficient, expensive and environmentally unfriendly.
The Dug Cool cooling system submerges standard HPC servers into a non-toxic dielectric fluid. The company said the system reduces energy usage and costs by 46%.

“As demand for HPC continues to grow exponentially around the world we must invest in world-leading, carbon-free, cost-effective HPC solutions for our clients,” Lamont said.
“We developed our award-winning Dug Cool immersion system to reduce the energy footprint of our data centres.
“Having the ability to utilise this technology at scale would solidify the Geraldton campus as the world standard in environmentally-friendly HPC.”
Once complete, the Geraldton facility will be the largest site in the company’s data centre network.
Construction of the site, subject to approval, is set to begin in the third quarter of 2021 with the stage 1 data hall due to be commissioned in the first half of 2022.
Dug Technology’s announcement comes just weeks after fellow Australian software firm Edge Centres unveiled its model for grid-independent data distribution.
Edge Centres has established an off-grid data centre in Grafton, on the New South Wales north coast. The centre is powered by a 1 MW solar array which is backed up by lithium-ion battery storage.
The solar-powered model has already attracted interest from Japan and Edge Centres has plans to roll out 20 centres out across Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/27/motoring-body-says-evs-at-turning-point-as-road-tax-passes/,"EV,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 27, 2021",Motoring body says EVs at turning point as road tax passes,"With Victoria to become the first state in Australia to tax electric vehicle (EV) drivers after legislation passed through parliament earlier this week, the Motor Trades Association of Australia (MTAA) has declared the Federal Government needs to provide some certainty for Australia’s $39.35 billion automotive industry.
In its new 2021 Industry Report, the MTAA said Australia was nearing a “revolutionary turning point” in its transition to zero-emission vehicles but moves by various state and territory governments seem to be steering in the wrong direction.
In its first major review of the industry in four years, the MTAA said the Federal Government must provide leadership and certainty for businesses and the broader community in regards to EV taxes with a “patchwork of state-based levies on battery electric cars” serving to slow their uptake in Australia.
“There is considerable apprehension amongst consumers and businesses as to whether the Federal Government will impose its own tax regime on low emission vehicles on top of the state levies already being designed,” the report reads.
“If double dipping occurs,” referring to the prospect of both federal and state taxes being introduced, “this will create a major disincentive for the purchase of electric vehicles.”
Victoria has already confirmed it will introduce a tax for EV drivers after the legislation passed without amendment in the Upper House on Tuesday night.
From July 1, EV drivers will pay a levy for every kilometre travelled on public roads in the state. Drivers of electric and other zero-emission vehicles will pay 2.5 cent/km while drivers of plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles will pay 2.0 cent/km.

The Victorian tax is expected to raise $30 million over four years and is forecast to cost the average EV owner between $260 and $300 annually.
Victorian Greens MP Sam Hibbins said the tax would make Victoria a “global laughing stock” and ensure the state continues to lag in the uptake of EVs.
“This is climate vandalism in the midst of a climate crisis,” he said.
Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas has previously described the tax as “modest”, claiming it is about half the rate of what other vehicle owners pay through the fuel excise.
“Everybody who uses a road should pay their fair share to maintain them,” he said.
The take-up of electric vehicles in Australia has been slow compared to other developed nations.
Data released by the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) shows Australia is way behind in its EV adoption as other markets around the world are hitting the accelerator hard.
There were 6,900 EVs sold in Australia in 2020, a 2.7% increase from the 6,718 sold in 2019. The 2020 EV sales figure accounts for just 0.7% of total new car sales.
By comparison, EVs in the EU increased their market share to 10.2% in 2020 while in the UK it climbed to 10.7%. In California, EV market share climbed to 8.1% while in Norway it rose from 56% in 2019 to 75% in 2020.
The MTAA said that by 2030 EVs are tipped to account for 26% of all new vehicle sales in Australia but the nation’s car fleet is not expected to be fully electrified until 2050.
The industry body however said the “ongoing technological advancements and economies of scale may bring about a quicker-than-expected price advantage for electric vehicles”.
“This may sway many consumers towards purchasing EVs very quickly,” the report reads.

The MTAA also said analysis on the uptake of EVs in China, Norway and the United States shows that investing in technology like electric charging stations “is much more effective than subsidising consumer purchases to promote EV sales”.
Victoria countered its new EV road tax by announcing last month it will provide 20,000 subsidies of up to $3,000 for new EV purchases under $69,000, as part of a $100-million plan to encourage EV use.
As part of the package, the state will also spend $19 million on new charging stations and $10 million to expand the government EV fleet by 400 cars over the next two years.
Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said it made “no sense” to subsidise EVs while also imposing a “big new tax” on them.
“It’s like putting on the heater and the air conditioning at the same time,” he said.
South Australia was the first state to announce its intention to introduce a user charge on EVs, but Treasurer Rob Lucas has put the plans on hold until July 1, 2022.
NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has foreshadowed a “holistic” tax plan for electric vehicles in next month’s state budget.
The New South Wales government, meanwhile, is still deciding the make-up of its EV policy with Transport Minister Andrew Constance earlier this month proposing the government incentivise EV purchases before introducing an equivalent road tax.
The Australian Capital Territory government has opted for a different direction, earlier this month announcing a fleet of incentives for EV owners as the territory looks to cut its carbon footprint.
Residents and businesses in the ACT will receive two years of free car registration when they buy an EV. The deal includes to new or used EVs bought between 24 May and 30 June 2024.
ACT homeowners can also apply for a $15,000 loan to go toward sustainable energy products including EVs as the territory aims to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.
EVs sold in the ACT are already exempt from stamp duty with the territory looking to move its fleet of government cars to electric by the end of the year.
ACT Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Shane Rattenbury, said the territory was “leading Australia” on EV incentives.
“We want to enable and support community action to reduce emissions, and making zero emissions vehicles more available and affordable is one of the ways we can do that,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/27/holographic-light-collector-to-improve-solar-panel-yield/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 27, 2021",Holographic light collector to improve solar panel yield,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the University of Arizona in the United States have created a holographic light collector which they claim is able to increase the efficiency of solar panels by up to 4.5%.
Presented in the paper “Holographic low concentration optical system increasing light collection efficiency of regular solar panels”, published in the Journal of Photonics for Energy (JPE), the collector is built with a low-cost holographic optical element (HOE) and a diffuser and can be easily embedded into conventional PV modules, according to its creators.
In this system design, the optical element is placed symmetrically at the center of the solar panel in order to increase the length of the effective light collection region. “The left half of the HOE diffracts light to a PV cell on the left side of the inactive module surface area (IMSA), and the right half of the HOE diffracts light to a cell on the right,” the academics explained, adding that each hologram in the proposed system is able to separate the colours of sunlight and direct them to the solar cells within the solar panel.
According to the researchers, this system configuration allows the light diffracted from the collector to exceed the critical angle of the module’s glass cover, which in turn extends the distance over which light can be collected and transferred to the solar cells. The diffuser scatters the light that is not diffracted by the HOE.
The light collector was tested in PV systems with dual-axis and single-axis tracking, as well as in a fixed non-tracking array. Multiple interactions of light scattered by the diffuser and diffracted by the hologram into the PV cell surface were also considered in the simulation. The thickness of the cover glass was assumed to be 3.2 mm. The US group also specified that the IMSA distribution was assumed to be uniform for simplification purposes, although it is not uniformly distributed in conventional solar panels.
“The corresponding improvements to the annual energy yield for a system with modules that have an IMSA of 8.25% are, respectively, 4.5%, 4.1%, and 3.8% with direct illumination,” the scientists stated. “With direct and diffuse solar illumination, the corresponding annual energy yield improvements are, respectively, 4.3%, 4.0%, and 3.6%.”
A cost assessment for the integration of the technology into commercial solar products was not provided.
Looking forward, the scientists intend to test the collector in materials with optimised thickness and refractive index modulation profiles, such as dichromated gelatin.
In another recent research project, Russian scientists developed a holographic film based on prismatic concentrators that is able to reduce the operating temperature of solar panels, including thermal-photovoltaic devices.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/27/mission-possible-csiro-launches-68-million-hydrogen-industry-mission/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 27, 2021",Mission Possible: CSIRO launches $68 million Hydrogen Industry Mission,"Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO, has launched a new $68 million Hydrogen Industry Mission (Mission) with the aim of driving the cost of hydrogen production to under $2/kg as the National Hydrogen Strategy seeks to establish the country in the driver’s seat of the global hydrogen economy by 2030. 
CSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall said this “unique mission-based partnership” is key to the development of a new future fuels industry for both Australian domestic use but also for export. 
According to a 2019 Deloitte report, Australia’s potential hydrogen sector could create thousands of jobs and increase national GDP by up to $26 billion. Goldman Sachs has called green hydrogen a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” and estimated that green hydrogen alone (not including grey and blue) “could give rise to a €10 trillion addressable market globally by 2050 for the utilities industry alone.”
That $68 million will go to more than 100 projects over the next five years with collaborators Toyota and Hyundai, and operated by an array of partners including: 
“Australia can become a renewable energy leader through the production, use and export of hydrogen,” said Marshall, “but it will only become a reality if we breakthrough the $2/kg barrier. That needs Australia’s world class science working with CSIRO’s commercialisation expertise turning breakthrough science into real-world solutions.”
Marshall believes that only a national mission “Team Australia” style approach will get this industry developed against the clock. “Taking a Team Australia approach is essential to creating the 8,000 jobs and $11 billion a year in GDP that hydrogen can contribute to Australia’s economy as we build back better from the impacts of Covid-19.” 

Australian Hydrogen Council CEO Fiona Simon agreed that a concerted and collaborative mission was the way forward. “We need a coordinated series of investments in industrial-scale research and demonstration activities,” said Simon, “along with the supporting research and infrastructure that can bring the technologies that are available and emerging to the industry that needs to deploy them.” 
According to Patrick Hartley, CSIRO’s Hydrogen Industry Mission Lead, the CSIRO’s “unique position at the nexus of research, government and industry gives us the ability to bring together stakeholders, and our track record of partnering and leveraging research funds means that we are able to grow this new phase of the industry without the need for everyone to do it alone.” 
According to the CSIRO, the Mission has been divided into four key categories:
Australia’s Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley, backed the Mission saying Australia must be “bold and ambitious when it comes to transitioning towards a low-emissions economy. Hydrogen is well placed to be a key element in this transition, but the emerging Australian hydrogen industry is at a critical stage. Research development and demonstration partnerships like we are seeing as part of CSIRO’s Hydrogen Industry Mission are vital to enabling the development and growth of this exciting new industry.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/27/microgrid-research-project-aims-to-help-farmers-and-the-network/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,MICROGRID,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND",BLAKE MATICH,"MAY 27, 2021",Microgrid research project aims to help farmers and the network,"Australia’s farming communities have suffered droughts, fires, and floods in recent years, and now a plague of mice are laying the first good crop in yonks to waste. The only respite, perhaps, it is that it is not all bad news. 
In four farming regions of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD), a smart energy grid research project is underway to discern practical, pragmatic, replicable and effective microgrid scenarios for Australia’s agriculture industry. 
The project, which received grant funding through the Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund, is being led by the Queensland Farmers’ Federation (QFF), Constructive Energy, Cotton Australia and ReAqua. It has already installed over 50 smart meters that are being used to take measurements and build models for how microgrids in these areas can benefit farming communities and their electricity networks. 
At times as tough as these, reductions in a property’s electricity bill is like a small answered prayer, but first, a good deal of real-time energy data needs to be collected. “The project will utilise smart meters to create four virtual microgrids and test their suitability in different circumstances,” said QFF CEO Georgina Davis, “including at a winery near Pokolbin, a cotton farm near St George, a mixed commodity farm near Wee Waa, and seven cane farms and a water service provider near Mackay.” 
The collected data will provide detailed insights for participants and project stakeholders on a custom platform. Ultimately, the data is inserted into a “proprietary modelling tool” which will declare whether a microgrid is the best option for each agricultural situation, and, what is more, what manner of microgrid. 
“Impacted by changing and uncertain electricity tariff prices, and charges and restrictions on solar exports, farmers are considering alternative energy assets to maximise productivity and existing infrastructure investments,” continued Davis, “This study hopes to offer data driven solutions for farmers while recommending improved service opportunities for energy network service providers.”
The virtual microgrids will test the following four overarching questions:
Four case studies will be completed to test the concept in different scenarios:
Panel to table
Sarah Ciesiolka is a farmer and a participant in the project. Her farm is struggling with “very high energy bills and a complex network of electricity infrastructure,” and she joined the project because she thought it might present some great opportunities on those fronts. 
“The project will help us determine how to reduce that complexity, decrease our energy costs and work out what renewable generation might fit best within our farming operations,” said Ciesiolka, “From there we can start considering the options for how best to use that excess energy, which is a fantastic position to be in.”
 A fantastic position indeed. Microgrids are an ideal solution to the twin regional costs of electricity and energy infrastructure. Not only do farms enjoy more stable electricity, unhindered by incidents along the vast interconnected network, but they’re also more cost-effective, they reduce grid losses as the generated energy will be utilised locally, and they reduce grid costs at the same time as increasing reliability. All those benefits, and the energy is also renewable. 
Another participant is Tulloch Wines’ primary vineyard in the NSW Hunter Valley. Tulloch Wines has already installed solar onsite but it has several meters operating at various locations around the vineyard which they are hoping to link to form a microgrid in itself. 
It is a slightly different story for a cotton farm on the flatlands west of Brisbane which is right at the end of the grid, dealing with frequent brownouts and fluctuations. Like Tulloch Wines, solar has already been installed on site to meet some of their needs, but since they are at the end of the line they are limited in what they can put back into the grid, and therefore what they can share with their local community. 
The project is set for completion in June 2022.
