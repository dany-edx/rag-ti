The Australian government is targeting 82% renewable energy in the grid by 2030 and that means a rapid acceleration in the roll out of renewable energy generation, energy storage and transmission projects; given only about 34% of the power in the National Electricity Market (NEM) was supplied by renewables last year.
To achieve the 82% target, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has estimated Australia needs to increase grid-scale wind and solar from approximately 17 GW now to 44 GW by 2030. Storage capacity in the form of batteries, pumped hydro, and virtual power plants needs to increase from 2 GW to 15 GW by the end of the decade while there needs to be an increase in distributed solar from 15 GW to 35 GW over the same period.
To deliver these increases, the Australian Electricity Workforce for the 2022 Integrated System Plan: Projections to 2050 report shows there needs to be rapid growth in the renewable energy construction workforce.
The modelling shows 12,000 more workers are needed by 2025 to build the wind and solar farms, batteries, transmission lines and pumped hydro storage required to transform the nation’s energy system.

“The problem is, these workers don’t exist at present,” the report says, adding that unemployment rates are low and the peak demand for labour in solar and wind farm construction would outstrip the entire current workforce in some regional areas.
“To add to the challenge, skilled workers tend to live in major population centres, but clean energy projects are virtually all in the regions. So the clean energy sector must compete with big infrastructure projects in the cities, which pay more and don’t involve travel,” the report continued. “You can see the challenge. If we don’t get this right, the clean energy transition just won’t happen.”
The report, prepared by researchers from the University of Technology Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures (ISF) working in collaboration with AEMO colleagues, provides estimates of how many workers are needed to deliver the market operator’s 2022 Integrated System Plan (ISP), the 30-year roadmap of investments required to meet the federal government’s renewable energy targets.
The workforce projections cover electricity generation, storage, and transmission construction for three 2022 ISP scenarios including the step change, the hydrogen superpower and the slow change. Under the three growth scenarios, a rapid scale up of the energy workforce is needed to implement all scenarios except the slow change.
Under the Step Change scenario, considered the most likely scenario by most stakeholders, the combined workforce for renewable generation, storage, and transmission construction needs to increase by 12,000 in just two years to 2025.
Overall electricity sector employment is expected to grow by 37,000 from 2023 to peak at 81,000 jobs in 2049.
The ramp up needed for the Hydrogen Superpower scenario is far steeper, with a combined increase of 31,000 needed by 2025.

ISF Research Director Jay Rutovitz said with the current labour market conditions, there’s a real risk skills shortages will become a constraint on construction timetables.
“The rapid increase needed for in-demand occupations brings a high risk of skills shortages which could impact on the achievement of the ISP,” he said. “Skill shortages create the risks of delays and increased project costs.”
While the modelling warns of a labour shortage, RACE for 2030 Chief Executive Officer Jon Jutsen said the electricity workforce needed nationally to deliver the energy transformation is far larger and more diverse than outlined in the report.
“The modelling does not include Western Australia or the Northern Territory, both with significant renewable growth projected, as the ISP only covers the NEM,” he said.
“The modelling does not include the growing requirement for jobs in energy efficiency, demand-side and energy management, or electrification, which could more than double the workforce projections.”
The researchers called for state, territory and federal governments to work together to plan and implement skills, training and workforce development before it is too late.
“Workforce planning should be brought into overall energy system planning,” they said. “Most electricity planning favours ‘just in time’ construction, where infrastructure is built as it is needed.
“It’s vital governments take action now. Acting early would help future-proof our clean energy workforce and maximise benefits for regional areas.”
AEMO said it as well as helping inform future workforce needs in Australia’s energy sector, the report will be used in upcoming consultation on the Draft Inputs, Assumptions and Scenarios Report (IASR), a key resource used to develop the 2024 ISP.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/13/queensland-targets-microgrid-tech-for-regional-resilience/,"ENERGY STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Queensland targets microgrid tech for regional resilience,"Queenslanders living in regional and remote communities can now apply for funding to improve their energy independence and resilience through renewable energy microgrids with the state government announcing a pilot fund to help develop and deliver microgrid projects as part of the transformation of the state’s energy system.
The state government said the $10 million Queensland Microgrid Pilot Fund (QMPF) will be used to develop a series of microgrids that will be connected to the main grid but also able to operate independently if required.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the fund aims to improve the resilience and reliability of electricity supply in the state’s regional and remote communities, some of which still rely on diesel-fuelled generators.
“The two-year program offers grants for communities on the edge of the electricity grid to deliver shovel-ready microgrid projects or provide support to develop future projects through feasibility studies,” he said.
“We know that regional and remote communities endure tough weather conditions and are at risk of power outages so this fund is designed to support innovation to improve reliability of energy supply.
“Our plan is to help people to take advantage of Queensland’s clean energy revolution, by installing new renewable generation and storage, as well as contributing to the decarbonisation of regional Queensland.”

Assistant Minister Lance McCallum said the microgrids fund is also a “huge opportunity” for remote Indigenous communities which want to take more ownership over their energy independence.
“One of the program’s objectives is to demonstrate how the deployment of a microgrid will have unique benefits for First Nations people within the community,” he said.
“As a proud First Nations Queenslander I know how important energy resilience and independence for these communities can be.
“Microgrids will provide the ability to recover quickly or maintain energy supply during network outages caused by extreme weather events.”
De Brenni said the fund would work in conjunction with existing federal and state initiatives to help communities attract investment in renewable energy.
The fund will initially offer grants of up to $5 million to support the construction of microgrid projects, and between $250,000 and $750,000 to help projects that meet the program objectives and eligibility requirements get “shovel ready”.
The fund is one of the first programs to be delivered under the Queensland government’s Energy and Jobs Plan, a 10-year vision for the state’s energy transformation that is expected to command $62 billion worth of public and private investment over the next 15 years.
Queensland is aiming to supply 50% of the state’s energy demands from renewables by 2030, and 80% by 2035.
Applications for the QMPF will close on 16 March, 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/13/bowen-backs-australian-made-to-maintain-energy-security/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Bowen backs ‘Australian made’ to maintain energy security,"Tindo Solar, Australia’s only PV panel manufacturer, has officially launched its new production and innovation facility at Mawson Lakes in Adelaide’s northern suburbs. The factory is more than three times the size of the company’s previous manufacturing facility and includes an assembly line that has the capacity to produce up to 150 MW of solar panels per annum.
The facility also houses the Australian Centre for Excellence in Photovoltaics (ACEPV) which the company said is designed to bring together industry and research partners with the goal of increasing Australia’s module manufacturing capability while also improving production and efficiency of final installed systems.
Tindo Solar’s new production line was commissioned late last year but the entire facility was officially launched this week with a ceremony attended by Australia’s energy minister who used the opportunity to call for an expansion of the domestic solar panel manufacturing capacity, saying the nation needs to maximise the benefits of its world-leading research and development to build sovereign capability and maintain energy security.
Australia leads the world with the rollout of rooftop solar with an estimated 33% of houses having solar panels on their roofs but Bowen said less than 1% of those installed solar panels are made in Australia. Most panels, and their component parts, come from China.

Bowen said an estimated 85% of the world’s solar panels are currently manufactured in China, and it is estimated that nation’s share of the market will rise to 98% over the next three or four years.
“The irony is, the solar panel, the modern solar panel is effectively an Australian invention, invented at the University of New South Wales and Australian National University,” Bowen said. “That technology that you see in more than 90% of the world’s solar panels comes from Australian ingenuity.”
“Yet, apart from this building,” he said, referencing the Tindo facility, “we don’t make solar panels in Australia. Over the last decade we’ve put 60 million solar panels on our roofs, and 1% of them have been made in our country, an Australian invention. It is unthinkable that we let that continue like that.”
Bowen said the government is working to formulate policy settings that would foster a domestic solar panel manufacturing industry and is “very, very confident” that it will eventuate in the coming years.
“With the right policies in place, we will be a renewable energy and manufacturing powerhouse,” he said.

Tindo Solar Managing Director Glenn Morelli said the company and the ACEPV is committed to playing a role in the development of a PV supply chain.
“For Tindo, this factory is just the beginning, and we want to be the catalyst for a domestic solar supply chain that means every part of the panel can be manufactured locally, creating thousands of jobs and giving every Aussie the opportunity to have locally made panels producing power on their roofs,” he said.
“At the ACEPV we have the engineers and the technical skills to commercially produce one of the highest-performing solar panels in the world.
“If Australia is going to lead the world in the energy transition, we have to develop a sovereign capability in renewables.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/13/solar-powered-water-desalination-tech-for-off-grid-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Solar-powered water desalination tech for off-grid applications,"From pv magazine Global
Boreal Light, a German technology company, has developed a PV-powered water desalination machine for off-grid applications.
The Winture Planet Cube machines have capacities from 1,000 litres per hour to 50,000 litres per hour. The size of the solar array needed to power these machines is a function of three factors: their capacity, the salinity of the water, and the depth of the borehole which water is extracted from. The technology uses seawater, wastewater, brackish water, or surface area as inputs.
“On average, a machine of 2,000 litres per hour needs a PV array with an installed capacity of 11 kW, for most projects we developed in Sub-Saharan Africa,” Hamed Beheshti, CEO of Boreal Light told pv magazine. Other projects include a 15,000 litre per hour machine in Iraq using a 90 kW PV system.
Boreal Light oversizes the solar arrays to sidestep the need for using batteries.
“We are extremely against using batteries because it brings a lot of extra costs, transportation, and maintenance. Instead of storing electricity from the solar panels, we produce more water and store it – it is way cheaper,” said Beheshti. “The machine in the Iraq project, for example, needs a maximum of 49 kW of electricity.”
The excess water is usually used for fish farming, irrigation, and sanitation. The company also uses the electricity excess for charging electrical cargo bikes used for distributing water, and for charging battery banks of nearby schools.
The solution uses 460 W monocrystalline silicon PV panels from DAH solar. The water desalination machines employ a low-pressure reverse osmosis membrane with a lifetime of three to five years and are built to last 25 years, according to Beheshti. Their production cost of water from direct seawater is €0.50 ($0.78)/m3. For brackish water, the price decreases to €0.28/m3. Depending on capacity, the machine can cost from €20,000 to €1 million ($311,000 – $1.56 million). The company’s clients range from aid organisations and NGOs to businesses, farms, and hospitals.
The Winture Planet Cube is connected to the internet via a SIM card, which allows Boreal Light to perform remote monitoring and control the machines from Berlin.
“We can read 36 sensors in the machines from Berlin. We can also give orders and update the mahine software with a click. Such remote controlling for us is part of making the operation simple in remote parts of the world,” said Beheshti.
The company claims that 80% of the machine’s maintenance can be performed by a standard plumber using only a wrench and a screwdriver. It currently has projects in 14 countries across Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/13/q-cells-announces-3-6-billion-investment-in-solar-supply-chain/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SOUTH KOREA,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,"JANUARY 13, 2023",Q Cells announces $3.6 billion investment in solar supply chain,"From pv magazine USA
In what is being called the largest investment in US solar history, Q Cells has announced that it will invest more than USD 2.5 billion ($3.62 billion) to build a complete solar supply chain in the United States. This makes the South Korean company, a subsidiary of Hanwha Solutions, the first to establish a fully integrated, silicon-based solar supply chain in the US market.
Q Cells intends to break break ground on the new, state-of-the-art facility in Bartow County, Georgia, where it will manufacture 3.3 GW of solar ingots, wafers, cells, and finished modules. It also has a facility in Dalton, Georgia, where it will assemble an additional 2 GW of modules. With plans to boost Dalton production by another 5.1 GW, Q Cells anticipates that its total production in the state will reach 8.4 GW in 2024.
The announcement was made by Q Cells’ parent company, Hanwha Solutions, headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.
“As demand for clean energy continues to grow nationally, we’re ready to put thousands of people to work creating fully American Made and sustainable solar solutions, from raw material to finished panels,” said Justin Lee, CEO of Q Cells. “We are committed to working with our customers as well as national and Georgia state leaders to bring completely clean energy to millions of people across the country.”
Q Cells cited Senator Jon Ossoff’s Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, now part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as playing a key role in promoting additional investments in the United States. The IRA offers numerous tax credits for clean energy manufacturing.
Q Cells has been a top player in the US solar market for the past five years, according to the Q4 2022 US PV Leaderboard report by Wood Mackenzie. It has also been the leading module provider for the US commercial sector since 2019. But now, Q Cells plans to thwart the solar supply chain challenges that are currently stalling development by producing ingots, wafers, and cells, as well as modules.
Q Cells is already involved in the production of silicon. In March 2022, parent company Hanwha Solutions became the largest shareholder in REC Silicon, a silicon producer based in Moses Lake, Washington. That facility is expected to start production in the second half of this year.
Back in March 2022, Lee hinted at the company’s intention to manufacture across the solar supply chain.
“Our commitment to the US is more serious than ever before,” said Lee. “We plan to make investments to secure capabilities across the entire solar supply chain, with the goal of supplying our partners with ‘Made in America’ products that will help the US regain its leadership in clean energy solutions.”
