The 1.5 MW solar system itself will be located on farm paddock in Grong Grong, one hour west of Wagga Wagga, in the mid-south of NSW.
The project has been many years in the making and has sought to import to Australia a community-owned solar model already common in Europe.

The aim now is to secure 333 solar ‘gardeners’ for each of the project’s plots, who will all be members of the Haystacks co-op. Once their $4200 one-off payment has been collected, the construction of the solar farm will begin.
With the help of partnering organisations, the co-op will build and own the solar project. Each member will then get the same return, in the form of a dollar amount off their electricity bill, from the sale of the energy generated on their plot into the grid.
Importantly, members do not pay for maintenance of the array. Instead, a small portion of the money generated from the solar energy sale goes towards upkeep of the solar garden.
The Haystack’s solar garden plots will be on sale until September 30 with the team behind the project holding information sessions throughout September.
“It’s an exciting model to be pioneering for Australia that other countries have been enjoying for years,” Haystacks Solar Garden Project Manager Kim Mallee said.
“With the Albanese Government committing to fund 85 solar gardens around the country we’ll see many more households given the chance to access solar.”
The project has been funded by the NSW government in association with Community Power Agency, Pingala, and Komo Energy, with support from several other organisations.

Alongside being the largest shareholder in the program, TMT will be supplying product from its Murchison Technology Metals Project as feedstock for the vanadium redox flow battery focussed research. Those feedstocks, the company says, includes magnetite concentrate and vanadium pentoxide.
Through its subsidiary vLYTE, the company hopes to eventually leverage the project’s findings, adding value to its own resources.

The study will involve experimenting with additives and stabilising agents and measure the effect of impurities to ultimately determine the optimal concentrations for VRFB electrolyte.
The majority of the research is set to be completed at Murdoch University in Western Australia.
ASX-listed company TMT is currently focusing on a processing technique to produce high purity vanadium pentoxide. The company’s goal is to become one of the world’s largest single primary vanadium producers, catering to the expanding flow battery market.
In terms of projects, the company appears to have rolled both its Gabanintha and Yarrabubba vanadium projects into one umbrella it is referring to as Murchison Technology Metals Project. The project will involve both a mine and a processing facility.

Teaming up with the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre seems a natural fit then as the government backed agency has long advocated Australia expand its onshore battery material processing capacity. It argues this is by far the best way for the country to capture the value presented by its large reserves of battery minerals like vanadium.
“By 2050, in a net-zero scenario, 70% of all renewable spend will be on batteries,” Future Battery Industries CEO Shannon O’Rouke said.
“Vanadium batteries are compact, durable, and infinitely recyclable, making them excellent for long-duration storage.
“The technology was invented in Australia, and we’re pleased to be looking at ways to lower costs and improve quality.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/02/native-forest-wood-waste-burning-to-be-excluded-from-renewable-classification-senate-report-recommends/,"LEGAL,POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022","Native forest wood waste burning to be excluded from ‘renewable’ classification, Senate report recommends","On Thursday, the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee which has been looking into the Climate Change Bill 2022 recommend the bill pass but the inclusion of electricity generated from native forest wood waste as ‘renewable’ should be amended.
The classification has been controversial since the federal government of former prime minister Tony Abbott moved to include native forest wood waste as a source of “renewable energy” in 2015.
Conservation groups have strongly opposed the use of leftover logging wood for power generation since, claiming it is an incentive to continue cutting down native forests. Moreover, numerous groups globally have pointed out the carbon accounting which deems wood-burning “net zero” or “carbon neutral” is highly dubious since the practice has emissions which may rival coal. 
The Senate committee yesterday recognised this, citing the argument that burning biomass, a term used to describe any fuel derived from plants including wood and wood processing waste, as “in direct opposition to the requirements of the [Climate Change] bills to reduce emissions.”
“It was argued that the use of biomass for energy generation–particularly from native forests was not only highly inefficient, but was also not ecologically sustainable, a source of greenhouse gas emissions and would destroy valuable forest resources that draw down and sequester carbon,” the report read.
Unlike other countries, Australia hasn’t historically relied on biomass for energy, and therefore has avoided some of the problems which have plagued Europe and the United States, where most woodchips are sourced.
Nonetheless, as our energy systems are now undergoing massive changes, projects relying on biomass are increasingly popping up.
Biomass or wood burning is attractive, especially to the burgeoning hydrogen industry, because it provides predicable, base load power. Solar and wind, as abundant as they are in Australia, remain intermittent.
In 2021, Verdant Earth Technologies bought the mothballed Redbank Power Station in the New South Wales Hunter region. It plans to recommission the 151 MW power station station, now called Verdant Power Station, to run purely on biomass sourced from local sawmill offshoot, Sweetman.
That same company, Sweetman, has also entered into a $15 million deal with Singapore’s CAC-H₂ to construct the Australia’s largest wood-fed hydrogen production plant.
Continuing on the hydrogen track, Patriot Hydrogen is putting biomass at the centre of its production plans. Its P2H units, as they’re named, are essentially modular, hydrogen producing kits which run on biomass, with the company boasting they can be powered up anywhere, anytime.
It is not clear how these projects would be impacted by the proposed changes since the recommendations don’t seem to span the burning of all biomass energy but only that from native forests. 
That being said, the report does seem to acknowledge the science behind the “carbon neutrality” of wood burning as suspect.
Janet Rice, the Greens party spokesperson on forests, said the committee had heard evidence that “destroyed the false claim that biomass from native forests should be classified as renewable energy.”
Alongside the native forest amendment proposal, the Senate committee recommended the Climate Change Bill establish a transition authority for coal and gas workers.
The recommendation has been supported by unions and the Greens.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/02/largest-dc-coupled-hybrid-project-in-australia-acquired-by-spanish-company-in-major-expansion-strategy/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022",Largest DC-coupled hybrid project in Australia acquired by Spanish company in major expansion strategy,"Via its subsidiary Global Power Generation, a joint venture with Kuwait Investment Authority, Spain’s Naturgy Energy Group has purchased the Cunderdin project which boasts 125 MW (DC) of solar coupled with a 55 MW / 220 MWh battery.
The project was originally developed by Perth-based Sun Bred Power and its construction is slated to begin by the end of the year, with commercial operation anticipated in the first quarter of 2024. 
Naturgy described the acquisition of its first solar project in Australia as a “milestone,” saying its vision is to reach a renewable portfolio of 2.2 GW by 2025 in Australia as part of its strategic plan.
A major Spanish company, Naturgy began investing in solar in the Spanish speaking world in around 2017, soon after rebranding from its original name Gas Natural Fenosa to today’s Naturgy.
The company now appears to be honing in on Australia, noting it wants to expand its portfolio in Western Australia to add to existing projects in Victoria, New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).
Its newly acquired Cunderdin project is located about 150 kilometres east of Perth, and will connected to WA’s islanded grid, the South West Interconnected System (SWIS).
Naturgy says the project will be the largest DC-coupled solar and battery project to be built in Australia, adding this configuration will improve energy conversion efficiencies and “contribute to drive down solar-plus-storage costs in comparison with the conventional AC-coupled facilities.”
The Cunderdin project’s battery system will come from Chinese brand Sungrow.
Global Power Generation, of which Naturgy holds a 75% stake while Kuwait Investment Authority holds the remaining 25%, currently owns a number of wind farms in Australia. 
Its Australian portfolio has 276 MW of operational capacity from the with the Crookwell 2 Wind Farm (96 MW) in NSW and the Berrybank 1 Wind Farm (180 MW) in Victoria. 
A further 109 MW from Berrybank 2 Wind Farm is under commissioning and will be operational in Victoria this year in conjunction with a 10 MW / 20 MWh Battery Energy Storage System located in the ACT.
Global Power Generation also owns a 417 MW portfolio of projects under development in Victoria, it says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/02/sungrow-mulling-another-new-inverter-factory-outside-of-china/,"INVERTERS,BRAZIL,CENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA,CHINA",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022",Sungrow mulling another new inverter factory outside of China,"From pv magazine Global
Ada Li, head of Latin America at Sungrow, told pv magazine that the Chinese inverter manufacturer is carefully evaluating the possibility of opening a new factory outside of China. Such a factory would assemble inverters, with parts imported from China.
Separately, Sungrow said it has reached 9 GW of total delivered capacity to South America, with 6 GW of the total delivered to Brazil alone. It said about 3 GW in Brazil were delivered for utility-scale PV projects, with central inverters accounting for a 70% share of the market, and string inverters accounting for the remainder.
“We think that in the next five years Brazil will continue to be in the top five of PV markets worldwide. The biggest growth will be in distribution generation, for the residential segment,” said Li.
For Sungrow, financing is still the most challenging aspect of working in the Brazilian PV market.
“We see one restriction for demand – not so much module prices, but bank interest rates here in Brazil,” Li said. “This is the main issue.”
Brazil’s baseline interest rate currently sits at 13.75%, leaving its PV market sensitive to the capex of solar projects. Public and private credit lines with more attractive interest rates have been created to incentivise the installation of solar.
Beyond Brazil, Sungrow is currently looking at Chile for utility-scale storage, and Mexico for commercial and industrial (C&I).

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/02/yingli-unveils-n-type-topcon-solar-panel-with-22-0-efficiency/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2022",Yingli unveils n-type TOPCon solar panel with 22.0% efficiency,"From pv magazine Global
Yingli Solar has unveiled a new bifacial n-type solar module based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) solar cells.
“Our n-type solar modules based on TOPCon cells can be mainly used in large-scale systems and harsh environments, because of their high bifaciality and high reliability,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
The Chinese solar module manufacturer said its TOPCon 24.5%-efficient cells are based on front-laminated composite film passivation, which enables the back tunnel oxide passivation contact technology to improve the cell open-circuit voltage by more than 710 mV.
“The backside micro-processing and ultra-thin tunnelling passivation layer improve the backside efficiency, as well as the cell bifaciality to over 90%,” the spokesperson said.
The 156-cell Panda 3.0 PRO module is available in six versions, with power outputs ranging from 590 W to 615 W and efficiencies ranging from 22.11% to 22.0%. Its open-circuit voltage is between 54.74 V and 56.44 V and the short-circuit current is between 13.72 A and 14.12 A. The maximum system voltage is 1,500 V.
The panel measures 2,465 mm x 1,134 mm x 30 mm and weighs 35.0 kg. It also features an IP67 enclosure and 2 mm tempered glass. It has a temperature coefficient of -0.30% per degree Celsius and its operational temperature ranges from -40 C to 85 C.
The new products come with a 30-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The degradation in the first year is purportedly 1.0% and 30-year end power output is guaranteed to be no less than 87.4% of the nominal output power.
“Yingli’s TOPCon cell capacity will be 5 GW at the end of this year, and will reach 10 GW next year and 15 GW in 2024,” the spokesperson explained. “All these capacities are located in Chinese manufacturing bases including Hebei province and Tianjin city. The production capacity of modules corresponds to it.”
