Queensland government-owned transmission network service provider Powerlink will use the funds to construct and operate two new switching stations in the southern portion of the Southern Downs REZ and a planned 65-kilometre high-voltage overhead transmission line which will connect the 1,026 MW MacIntyre Wind Precinct being built 60 kilometres west of Warwick to the National Electricity Market (NEM), helping power an estimated 700,000 homes.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the new investment would also allow another 500 MW of new capacity to be connected in the same area.
“Connecting the massive project to the national grid not only unlocks $2 billion worth of investment, it also boosts reliability of power across the three east Australian states, with clean Queensland-made energy,” he said.
CEFC chief executive officer Ian Learmonth said the funding agreement demonstrates a new way to deliver a renewable energy zone with the project marking the first time that generator contributions will cover the cost of building critical REZ assets.
Learmonth said the CEFC capital will enable Powerlink to develop the infrastructure at scale, rather than in stages, keeping connection costs down for the initial or foundation generators while unlocking greater renewable generation capacity in the Southern Downs REZ.
“The CEFC has created an investment structure that helps Powerlink bridge the financing gap for generators through an initial lower connection charge,” he said. “Our innovative finance is helping overcome the financial challenges of these early generators which means lower power prices for their customers. And by backing Australia’s energy pioneers as they develop a REZ as part of a stronger, cleaner grid, we are supporting energy system transformation, which is critical to Australia’s transition to net zero emissions.”
Energy Users Association of Australia (EUAA) chief executive Andrew Richards said the new market-driven model “fundamentally changes the way that transmission businesses are looking at delivering this type of infrastructure,” and said it should be replicated across Australia.
“It is fantastic, and we want to see more of them adopt this approach across the country,” he said.
The first of projects to be connected in the Southern Downs REZ will be the MacIntyre Wind Precinct which comprises the 923 MW MacIntyre Wind Farm majority owned by renewable energy firm Acciona, and the 103 MW Karara wind project which is controlled by Queensland government-owned renewable generator CleanCo.
Powerlink chief executive officer Paul Simshauser said work on the new transmission infrastructure has already commenced.
“At more than 1 GW, this is easily Powerlink’s largest connection project to date,” he said. “Importantly, it will also deliver Queensland’s second REZ development, unlocking an additional 1,500 MW of hosting capacity in the region.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/11/regulator-unveils-new-online-toolkit-for-energy-businesses/,"LEGAL,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 11, 2022",Regulator unveils new online toolkit for energy businesses,"The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has unveiled an interactive website and online portal designed to help energy businesses understand regulation within the National Electricity Market (NEM), navigate energy sector stakeholders, and explore options to launch new energy business models under existing frameworks.
The AER said the Energy Innovation Toolkit provides information on the NEM regulatory regime to energy innovators and aims to reduce barriers for new energy business models. It will be supported by an enquiry service that will enable innovators to contact the regulator with specific queries.
The AER said the enquiry service will be a first stop for businesses seeking both informal regulatory guidance and a pathway to regulatory relief.
Businesses will be able to access the service to gain an understanding of what regulations and market entry requirements might apply to a specific project. They will also be able to explore options to adapt business ideas to progress under current frameworks and identify what agencies to contact and what processes and applications they might need to undertake to progress a project.
The AER said the toolkit is supported by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC), the Essential Services Commission of Victoria (ESC), and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
“We draw on the combined expertise of the AER, AEMC, AEMO, ESC, state regulators and other government agencies, and can make targeted referrals to any of these bodies if we identify that your question is best placed with them,” the regulator said.
AER chair Clare Savage said the new website will support Australia’s transition to a renewable energy generation and storage model, the success of which will be influenced by how quickly new technology and innovation can enter the market.
“The regulatory landscape may be overwhelming for new energy businesses wanting to enter the market and we don’t want that to be a barrier to achieving better outcomes for consumers,” she said. “The Energy Innovation Toolkit is a one-stop shop for energy businesses and start-ups to access multiple regulatory bodies. It opens up a pathway for discussion to drive innovation and market competition and offers a range of resources to help businesses test ideas.”
The AER said new energy laws expected to be introduced later in the year will help broaden the online service to allow the granting of temporary waivers and trials.aer,

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/11/whos-holding-back-electric-cars-in-australia-its-time-to-clear-the-road/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"AUGUST 11, 2022",Who’s holding back electric cars in Australia? It’s time to clear the road,"The finding, by think-tank the Australia Institute, puts further pressure on the new federal government to bring our fuel efficiency standards in line with Europe and other developed nations.
Unlike other comparable countries, Australia does not have fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles. On the face of it this is puzzling; aside from lower costs for motorists and fewer emissions, the policy would also decrease our reliance on imported oil.
But opposition from vested interests – including oil refineries and the car dealership industry – has held Australia back. The onus is now on the Albanese government to enact this obvious and long overdue policy which is crucial to the electric vehicle (EV) transition.

So how would a fuel efficiency standard work?
Under a likely model, the government would set a national limit, averaged across all new cars sold, stipulating grams of CO₂ that can be emitted for each kilometre driven. This measure depends on fuel-efficiency: that is, the amount of fuel burnt per kilometre.
The limit would not apply to individual cars. Instead, each supplier of new light vehicles to Australia would have to make sure the mix of vehicles does not exceed the limit. Low-efficiency vehicles could still be sold, but car dealers would have to balance this out by selling enough high-efficiency vehicles.
Because EVs don’t use fuel (or use less, in the case of hybrids), a fuel efficiency standard would give suppliers an incentive to include electric vehicles in the mix of vehicles they supply.
The prospect of fuel efficiency standards on light vehicles has regularly hit the national agenda in recent years.
In 2014, the Climate Change Authority prepared a detailed plan for a standard and estimated the likely economic savings. The plan seemed well timed. Australia has traditionally produced large, fuel-guzzling cars like the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon. At the time of the plan’s release, however, the last remaining domestic car manufacturers had just announced plans to close, removing the most likely source of political resistance.
But the Coalition government sat on the idea. It ran a string of reviews before ultimately letting the issue drop.
In 2019, then-Opposition Leader Bill Shorten pledged fuel efficiency standards, as well as a target for electric vehicles to comprise half of new car sales by 2030. But he soon ran into Scott Morrison’s jibe that Labor wanted to “end the weekend” and take away people’s utes.
Labor, of course, lost that election and Anthony Albanese dumped the fuel standards idea on becoming party leader.

A fuel efficiency standard would deliver significant benefits to Australia.
The first is economic. The report released this week is just the latest of many studies showing motorists would have been slugged far less at the bowser if our cars used fuel more efficiently.
The second benefit is tackling climate change. Transport accounts for nearly 20% of Australia’s emissions and this share is increasing.
And while lab tests suggest cars sold in Australia are becoming somewhat more efficient, real-world testing shows the opposite. If we are to achieve emissions cuts consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement, cutting emissions from transport is essential.
Third, Australia is almost entirely dependent on foreign fuel. So new efficiency standards would decrease overall liquid fuel consumption, leaving us less reliant on imports.
So why hasn’t Australia introduced this clearly beneficial policy? In short, because fuel inefficiency is deeply embedded in Australia’s automotive sector.
The strongest initial resistance to fuel efficiency standards came from the operators of refineries. Fuel-efficient cars require high-quality fuel. But Australia has long had among the dirtiest petrol in the developed world in terms of sulphur content.
Australian refiners resisted fuel efficiency standards because they said the cost of upgrading their plants would put them out of business. But the Morrison government last year funded upgrades at Australia’s last two oil refineries, removing one obstacle.
Further resistance has come from car dealers. From a dealership perspective, it’s easier to sell a car with a low sticker price even if lifetime running costs are higher.
Fuel efficiency standards, and the subsequent large-scale shift to electric vehicles, would fundamentally undermine the business model of the Australian car dealership industry. Much of its profitability comes from after-sales services required to maintain warranty protection, such as oil changes, transmission fluid and tune-ups.
None of these are needed in EVs. The lifetime costs of maintaining an electric vehicle engine are about half those for a comparable internal combustion engine. At some point in their lives, an electric vehicle will require a new battery. But this will occur long after the initial sale.
Given all this, it’s not surprising the car industry is reportedly campaigning to limit any new fuel efficiency standards and delay the shift to electric vehicles.
The Albanese government has proposed some incentives to encourage a shift towards electric vehicles. But these limited measures won’t drive the dramatic transition that is needed.
Strong fuel efficiency standards would save motorists money, cut emissions and reduce Australia’s dependence on imported fuel. Anyway you look at it, the policy makes sense.

Origin’s Energy Supply and Operations executive general manager Greg Jarvis confirmed the energy major, the owner of the ageing 2.8 GW Eraring power plant at Lake Macquarie in New South Wales (NSW), has purchased the renewable energy project as it prepares for a future without coal.
“This week we took a further step on our journey to build Origin’s renewable energy portfolio, acquiring the 60 MW Yanco Solar Farm in south-central NSW from European renewables developer ib vogt,” he said.
The estimated $99.3 million Yanco project is proposed for development on a 152-hectare site on the outskirts of Leeton. The 60 MW solar farm is planned to be co-located with on-site battery storage units of up to 81 MW rated capacity.
“Yanco is at an advanced stage with land tenure, planning consent and a connection agreement in place and is targeting commercial operations in the first half of the calendar year 2024,” Jarvis said.
Origin, which earlier this year announced the Eraring power station will be closed in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled, said the “transaction is further demonstration of our progress in accelerating the growth of renewables”.

The purchase of the Yanco project comes just months after Origin acquired the 900 MW Yarrabee Solar Farm development also in the Riverina region and the 74 MW Carisbrook Solar Farm in central Victoria.
The Carisbrook solar project, which was also developed by ib vogt, is targeted to reach commercial operations in 2023. No completion date has yet been announced for the Yarrabee project, which was originally co-developed by Reach Solar Energy and PwC Australia.
Origin said its Commercial Transactions and Generation & Development teams are now progressing these projects towards financial investment decisions and exploring additional opportunities to grow its portfolio of renewables and storage projects.
The new solar investments are part of Origin’s plans for “multi-gigawatt” growth in renewable energy this decade as it prepares to replace the capacity set to be withdrawn from the grid with the impending closure of the Eraring power station.
As well as building out a fleet of solar PV generators, Origin has secured planning approval for a 700 MW/2.8 GWh grid-connected battery to be developed at the site of the Eraring power station near Newcastle by the end of this year.
Origin also plans to grow its in-house virtual power plant (VPP) – comprising rooftop solar installs, electric vehicles and batteries linked to demand-management technology to control electricity flows – from about 200 MW to 2 GW.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/11/mga-thermal-secures-federal-funding-for-energy-storage-project/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 11, 2022",MGA Thermal secures federal funding for energy storage project,"Through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) the Federal Government has committed $1.27 million to University of Newcastle spin-off MGA Thermal to help finance the construction of a 5 MWh thermal energy storage pilot project in the Hunter region of New South Wales.
The $2.85 million project will showcase MGA Thermal’s proprietary Miscibility Gap Alloy (MGA) technology, a material which co-founder and chief executive officer Erich Kisi said will play a critical role in the nation’s energy transition, because it will make it possible to retrofit existing thermal power plants with renewable storage technology.
“If the current industry sentiment and the impacts of climate change are telling us anything, it’s that we can no longer hold off on the renewable energy transition,” he said.
“While conventional storage technologies like batteries play an important role, a complementary, grid-scale dispatchable energy solution is required to power a seamless transition to renewables nationally.”
To be located at MGA Thermal’s facility in Tomago, Kisi said the pilot plant will have charging and discharging capabilities of up to 500 kW and will help take the company’s technology from lab to market.
The company’s patented thermal energy storage blocks, approximately the size of a large brick, consist of small alloy particles embedded within graphite-based blocks enclosed in a fully insulated system. Once heated the alloy particles, which melt and solidify for many thousands of cycles, can store heat for days with minimal energy loss.

“It accepts energy in the form of electricity renewably generated electricity, ultimately, that heats up the blocks,” Kisi said. “And they sit at around 600 degrees Celsius, storing heat almost indefinitely. It loses very little heat over time. And then the energy is dispatched by making steam, high-temperature, high-pressure steam for power generation, or we can derate it to address the harder-to-abate markets like process heat in industry.”
The pilot plant is expected to be commissioned in December of this year with Kisi saying it is the next step of commercialisation for MGA Thermal’s technology which “can be scaled up many hundreds of times bigger” than the planned 5 MWh pilot plant.
The company said the plant will provide performance data on charging and discharging behaviour, fluid dynamics and temperature distributions, and validate the efficacy of mid-to-long term thermal storage in a practical system. It will also offer a tangible demonstration of MGA technology for prospective customers.
With significant investment in flexible and dispatchable capacity required to support the uptake of variable renewable energy, particularly as thermal assets retire in the coming decades, ARENA chief executive officer Darren Miller said MGA’s technology has the potential to be a cost-effective medium-duration storage technology due to its energy density, low-energy degradation, modular design and low cost.
“The electricity transition is going to require a variety of storage technologies that are able to discharge over a range of timeframes from hours to days,” he said. “MGA Thermal’s novel approach could make a real difference in the medium and longer-term storage category, supporting hydrogen and pumped hydro.
“With potential deployments for industrial heating end uses, MGA Thermal could play a valuable role in decarbonising both the electricity grid and heavy industry, which often requires high-temperature heat and steam for their manufacturing needs.”

The MEG HP1 project in Northam, which is now set to include a hydrogen refuelling station, builds on the existing 11 MW Northam Solar Farm. 
Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce up to four tonnes of renewable hydrogen a day for transport use by early 2024. 
IGE has now secured enough land to potentially double the site’s production to eight tonnes a day, and now has room enough for a hydrogen refuelling station and storage for eight hydrogen-powered trucks. 
“IGE has the land, renewable electricity, project expertise, initial customer base and financing options to produce WA’s first commercial-scale renewable hydrogen in Northam,” said IGE CEO Stephen Gauld.

The hydrogen refuelling station will be the result of a partnership between IGE and WA fuel distributor Refuel Australia. Refuel Australia managing director Ian Burrows said the company is “thrilled to be working with Infinite Green Energy to bring renewable hydrogen into our product offering, starting with the planned Northam fuelling station.” 
“Renewable hydrogen will likely form a significant part of the fuel mix as the world moves towards net-zero carbon emissions,” continued Burrows. “Hydrogen is particularly suited to the medium and heavy transport operators that form the core of our customer base. We are excited to be an early mover in the supply of green hydrogen”. 
MEG HP1 appears to be a warm-up of sorts, with IGE more prominently showcasing its Arrowsmith Hydrogen Plant, which it says will produce up to 25 tonnes of green hydrogen daily. Arrowsmith sits a fair way north of Perth, on the state’s coast. IGE says this project will incorporate 65 MW of solar and 90 MW of wind in stage one, though timeframes for the project have not been given.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/11/ampt-lawsuit-asks-that-solaredge-remove-inverters-and-controllers-from-market/,"LEGAL,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"AUGUST 11, 2022",Ampt lawsuit asks that SolarEdge remove inverters and controllers from market,"From pv magazine USA
Ampt, a power electronic specialist based in Fort Collins, Colorado, has filed a lawsuit against SolarEdge for allegedly violating a series of their patents.  According to Ampt, the violations at the heart of the issue are “power optimisers that contain high-efficiency power converters that both allow maximum power-point output, and use operational boundary conditions that continue producing power during conditions that might otherwise require the optimiser to be bypassed.”
The filing asks that the whole of SolarEdge’s inverter and optimiser lineup be removed from the marketplace for violation of these patents. Ampt contends that they, and other manufacturers, could replace SolarEdge’s hardware if needed.

Ampt filed with two separate courts – the Count of International Trade (ITC), whose online filing can be found here, and the US District Court of Delaware whole filing can be found here.
In the ITC Complaint filing, two patents were specifically highlighted – U.S. Patents Nos. 9,673,630 (‘630) and 11,289,917 (‘917).
The ’630 patent was issued in 2017, while the ’917 patent was recently awarded on March 29, 2022. Both patents claim priority to a provisional patent application filed in 2007. Ampt notes they were founded in Colorado in 2007.
The filing includes a circuit (below) that contains both a buck and boost converter. Ampt states that this “power optimiser circuit of (their) invention…describes a dual-mode configuration that provides high efficiency for their specific use-case.”

Buck converters step voltages down, while boost converters step voltages up. Solar optimisers regulate the voltages and amperages of individual solar panels in combination with their inverter, among a string of solar panels arranged in a series circuit.
The longer form filing with the ITC court includes an image of the circuitry inside of a SolarEdge optimiser, pointing out the location of the buck-boost converter.

The filing also highlighted operational boundaries and how they interact with over current and voltage, while attempting to optimise for the maximum power point (MPPT).
To this author’s very limited electrical knowledge, all inverter manufacturers use these two techniques to manage solar power. Solar charge controllers in off-grid systems specifically focus on these designs in order to keep voltages consistent when charging batteries from variable output solar panels.

pv magazine USA reached out to SolarEdge for a comment late last week. SolarEdge says that because they have not yet been served, they can’t comment on the specific patents yet. SolarEdge says that they have been in a patent negotiation with Ampt, which was being moderated by the USPTO, and that SolarEdge was awarded patents as a result of the discussion.
