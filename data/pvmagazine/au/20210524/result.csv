On Friday, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) announced an exciting trial that will use renewable energy to process bauxite into alumina — a project which represents a positive in the Government’s vastly mixed bag of energy-transition responses.
At Alcoa’s Wagerup plant in Western Australia, the company will soon begin testing Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR) powered by renewables, to recycle waste steam that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.
Vapour recompression is a way to upgrade energy by compressing lower pressure vapour up to a higher pressure. In the mechanical variant of this process a motor — in this case electric — or steam-driven turbine is the mechanical means of compression. (The other type of VR is thermo compression which forces steam through a nozzle to compress a lower pressure vapour to intermediate pressure.)
The process is itself a refinement of the proposition that renewables could be harnessed to produce the high-pressure steam needed to remove residues and solids from the bauxite.
Fewer renewable megawatts will be required in this more efficient MVR process that is expected to reduce both the cost of energy used and emissions generated during processing of alumina.
“This technology represents an opportunity to electrify a refining process that is currently powered by fossil fuels, using a renewable solution,” said ARENA CEO, Darren Miller.
Australia is the world’s largest exporter of alumina and the industry is the country’s sixth-largest export earner, valued at $12.7 billion in 2019-20, and employing more than 22,000 people.
It also accounts for around 20% of Australia’s direct, non-electricity (Scope 1) manufacturing emissions, or 11 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year.
The MVR technology “has the potential to be a game changer for the aluminium industry,” said Angus Taylor, Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, in a statement announcing the initiative, adding that it “could reduce total domestic emissions by up to 1.5% in future.”
It makes sense for the local industry to distinguish itself as a producer of green aluminium, which is already becoming sought after in supply chains for the automotive industry.
German car manufacturing giant, BMW, recently contracted with Emirates Global Aluminum for an annual 43,000 tonnes of aluminium produced using solar energy.
Bloomberg noted that this was “among the first times that consumers and producers agreed to pay a premium on aluminum with a smaller carbon footprint… The sales indicate that some consumers are willing to pay more for greener aluminum.” 
ARENA is contributing $11.3 million towards the $28.2 million project, which will be conducted in two stages.
An initial dual-stream feasibility study will: investigate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of integrating MVR powered by renewable energy in Australian alumina refining processes and consider the commercialisation pathway to retrofit the technology at existing alumina refineries; and complete a detailed assessment for implementation of a full scale 3 megawatt (MW) MVR module at Wagerup.
If the project proves a good fit, it will lead to Stage 2: detailed design, procurement, execution, deployment, integration, commissioning and operation of a full-scale 3 MW MVR module that will be powered by renewable energy, and integrated with the evaporation step of alumina refining.
ARENA says on its project web page that, “Demonstrating successful operation of the technology for evaporation could enable its use to be extended to other process duties, further displacing fossil fuels.”
The construction phase of this Wagerup module is expected to create 25 jobs, but far more significant is the potential to secure those 22,000 positions in an industry that could become more viable and competitive in the context of the global energy transition and consumer demand for greener products.
Miller said, “It’s great to see companies like Alcoa take the initiative to create a pathway to reduce their emissions in what is an energy-intensive, hard-to-abate process.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/24/the-winning-ways-of-the-australian-technologies-competition/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 24, 2021",The winning ways of the Australian Technologies Competition,"The opportunity to swim in the same tank as 5B, RayGen, GreenSync, Planet Ark Power and Iron Matrix has been extended to June 7. No sharks, just mentoring and potential partnerships to take startups through scale-up. 
The Australian Technologies Competition (ATC) is in its 11th year, and the need has never been stronger to bring great clean-energy innovations to commercial fruition.
Of course, the Competition, sponsored by the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, the Victorian Governments, AusIndustry Entrepreneurs Program, National Energy Resources Australia, the Australian Space Agency and other organisations with clout, is not only for startups working in the renewable energy space.
But of 270 startups that have made their way to ATC semi-finalist or finalist stage over the years, 90 have been in green energy generation, storage, management and related fields, says Patrick Mooney, whose consultancy, Impact Tech Ventures, has run the competition in recent times.
“Scale up is the stage where we feel we can do the most good,” says Mooney of the seven-month ATC program. He tells pv magazine Australia, “Historically, scale up is where the Australian tech sector has fallen over; technology has been licensed or acquired overseas, or companies have just not gone anywhere because they haven’t had the resources, or in many cases, the management expertise.”
Although he says applicants to the ATC are initially attracted by the potential “award-winning” boost and exposure their innovations might receive through winner or finalist status, they ultimately find the program’s capability building of far greater benefit.
Semi-finalists are invited to participate in an intensive growth masterclass (a fee is payable) which covers, among other topics, which markets to launch in, which organisations to partner with, how to build teams in early-stage companies, how to coach those teams to be effective, and how to manage intellectual property in different geographies and set up reliable supply chains.
During Stage 2 of the semi-finals participants are carefully matched with mentors — at least one, sometimes two per startup.“It’s very interactive, and our great pool of mentors includes people who’ve run tech companies and have been in senior corporate roles; they have very good international connections.”
Finalists in 11 categories of technology present their five-minute pitches to a judging panel and a live audience, and subsequently participate in the Awards ceremony.
In 2020, Village Energy took out the Energy award, for its artificial intelligence-driven platform that optimises the social, technical and commercial performance of distributed electricity systems.
Wayne Liubinskas, Co-Founder of Village Energy, says of the ATC program, “Just going through the process is valuable. It forces you to take the time to articulate your business and your own plans.”
In post-program surveys conducted by the ATC team, the masterclass alone has been consistently rated 9 out of 10 by participants.
The culmination of the mentoring and masterclass components is in partner-connect events where ATC finalists and alumni are introduced to senior investors and corporates in their sectors.
Incubators such as EnergyLab and Startupbootcamp beat a path for their fledglings to ATC. Says Mooney, “It’s probably Australia’s biggest pipeline of energy and related tech.”
Applications for ATC21 are open online until June 7.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/24/discovered-sandwich-structure-of-quasi-2d-perovskite-film-nourishes-next-gen-solar-development/,"RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 24, 2021",Discovered: Sandwich structure of quasi-2D perovskite film nourishes next-gen solar development,"Two-dimensional thin films used in perovskite solar cells that hold promise for commercialisation have been found to have a structure more like two layers of bread with filling in between than the previously assumed “gradient” structure of a cracker with topping.
Findings of new research led by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science in collaboration with scientists at Australia’s CSIRO, and Shandong University herald the potential for greater efficiency of perovskite solar cells, and have just been published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry C.
The newly discovered 2D  structure — of small-n Ruddlesden Popper perovskites (RPPs) sandwiched between layers of large-n (RPPs) — encourages excitons, the quasiparticles instrumental in converting sunlight to electricity, to move from the central layer to the surfaces of the film. At the same time free carriers transport the resulting charge for collection by electrodes, such that when the perovskite film is incorporated into solar cells they facilitate more efficient solar generation.
“There’s been quite a lot of controversy in the literature” published on the structure of thin-film perovskites, says Professor Ken Ghiggino, one of the authors of the new paper. He adds, “The advance that we’ve achieved is to find out what the real structure of these films is and how they work in a solar cell.”
The ARC researchers based at the University of Melbourne used scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements to identify the revised understanding of the thin-film materials.
Two-dimensional perovskite films are a leading contender to form the next generation of solar PV technology, and are valued for their stability and durability compared to 3D perovskite cells, their potential low cost, and their likely contribution to development of light-weight, flexible solar panels. But as recently as February this year, researchers were remarking that they showed “limited charge transport” and a “large bandgap” for solar applications.
“This is the first time a sandwich structure had been proposed versus the conventional gradient distribution model,” says the University of Melbourne’s Dr Fei Zheng, lead author on the new paper. “We think this discovery will help design and device optimisation for higher performance of the 2D cells and LEDs.”
Prototype 2D devices have so far demonstrated 13% efficiency. Researchers can now attempt to drive up that efficiency by changing the thickness of the layers within the ‘sandwich’.
In line with the remit of ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science — which is to discover and develop new materials that improve solar technology, lighting and security systems — 2D perovskite films also have potential application in light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors used in video imaging, security systems, biomedical imaging, gas sensing and optical communications.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/24/australia-china-relations-continue-to-sour/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,CHINA",,"MAY 24, 2021",Australia-China relations continue to sour,"While no specific energy and natural resources projects were a part of the formal China-Australia Strategic Economic Dialogue agreement, deteriorating relations are unsettling Australia’s commodity producers. Beijing is now actively discouraging Chinese investment in Australia’s energy and natural resources sectors, while China’s use of selected import bans, restrictions and other hurdles looks likely to continue – and potentially widen – across a range of Australian exports.
But despite Beijing’s increasingly hard line, a more widespread import ban looks unlikely, particularly on the Australian iron ore that is so critical to China’s infrastructure boom. LNG, too, has so far dodged any significant punitive action, with volumes into China continuing to rise through the first four months of 2021. Australian LNG projects will welcome this, but could they be next in Beijing’s crosshairs if relations continue to sour?
Several Australian commodities were already facing restrictions in the Chinese market ahead of last week’s announcement by the NDRC. An informal ban on thermal coal has been in place since 2020 and has affected trade flows and seaborne prices over the past six months. Second-guessing how long such bans might continue is risky, given that NDRC referred to an “indefinite suspension” of dialogue, but we assume the impact on thermal coal will continue at least through 2022.
Similarly, Chinese smelters remain closed to copper concentrates from Australia. China’s unofficial ban started to impact exports from Q4 2020 and, while some limited quantities of Australian concentrate imports were reported in October and November last year, imports ground to a halt from December onwards. WoodMac’s copper team estimates that the annual volume affected is around 1 Mtpa of concentrate, forcing China to look elsewhere in a very tight market.
China depends on high-quality Australian iron ore, with around two-thirds of its imports coming from Australia. While an outright ban would be almost unimaginable, various forms of restrictions, delays or increased administrative burdens on Australian iron ore imports could yet happen. China did amend some iron ore import screening regulations in June 2020, introducing measures that could be used to target Australian iron ore. But given ongoing constraints to Brazilian supply, it seems unlikely that Beijing will want to go much further while the market remains tight.
The potential for the dispute to impact Australian LNG exports to China is becoming clearer. Australian LNG is essential to meeting Chinese demand, with volumes up 8% already in 2021 and accounting for around 45% of China’s total LNG imports. But could this be at risk?
Unconfirmed media reports this week have suggested that smaller LNG buyers in China have been told that Australian spot LNG cargoes are now off limits. If true, then while the impact will be relatively limited – China’s second-tier LNG importers only account for around 10% of the country’s total imports – it would signify a further escalation in China’s use of trade in what is an essentially political dispute.
Beyond this, Beijing could look to further impact Australian LNG exporters. Given the volumes at stake, an import tariff similar to the 25% slapped on US LNG exports in 2018 would likely be too painful for Chinese buyers and consumers. But Beijing might consider moves to deter Chinese buyers from signing new long-term contracts with Australian projects. This could be politically expedient, allowing Beijing to highlight its willingness to widen punitive actions on Australian exports, while having a minimal impact on China’s future LNG supply options given the relatively limited volume of Australian pre-FID supply.
Despite such concerns, there is likely to be minimal impact on existing LNG contracts. Australian volumes are essential to meeting China’s domestic gas demand, while several Australian projects have significant Chinese equity participation. Reported moves by Chinese buyers to invoke force majeure clauses in LNG contracts as the Covid-19 crisis first emerged in China in early 2020 ultimately made little progress. And while buyers may be unenthusiastic to repeat that experience, might efforts to renegotiate contract terms find fresh support in Beijing?
Much has been made of China’s moves to target trade with Australia. But while Beijing will likely continue its selective restrictions on imports from Australia, Canberra is simultaneously tightening rules on inward Chinese investment, including in Australia’s energy and natural resources sectors.
As a result, Chinese M&A activity in Australia looks increasingly difficult. Without a tangible improvement in relations, for example, it looks very unlikely a Chinese company could acquire a significant LNG or upstream asset in Australia, either directly or through investment in a domestic company. For sellers in Australia’s active upstream and LNG M&A market, this won’t come as welcome news. Chinese buyers, particularly the NOCs, on the hunt for future equity investment in LNG projects may look elsewhere, including Russia and possibly Qatar.
Sadly, trade disputes rarely end well. Despite both Australia and China benefitting hugely from their well-established trade in energy and natural resources, decades of trusted and reliable partnerships are being put at risk. To pull back from this, dialogue, not rhetoric, is needed – and soon.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/24/unsw-digs-the-data-how-much-solar-energy-is-lost-through-automated-inverter-settings/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MAY 24, 2021",UNSW digs the data: How much solar energy is lost through automated inverter settings?,"As installations of distributed residential rooftop systems continue to rise in Australia, network service providers and regulatory bodies such as the Australian Energy Market Commission are grappling to manage energy flows and the stability of the grid, while trying to devise rules of grid engagement  that demonstrate fair treatment of prosumers who have invested in PV… A new study by UNSW hopes to inform their decision making with data that provides visibility over how inverter standards are already affecting rooftop solar generation, and how householders feel about curtailment of returns on their clean-energy investment.
“I’m excited to be able to give evidence-based, data-driven research to industry and regulatory bodies,” Dr Baran Yildiz, Senior Research Associate at SPREE, and Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM), tells pv magazine Australia, “so that they can make the most appropriate decisions for energy users and aggregators.”
The $100,000 combined technical and social study, Curtailment and network voltage analysis study (CANVAS), is funded by the Commonwealth Government RACE for 2030 Cooperative Research Centre (where RACE stands for Reliable, Affordable Clean Energy) and also aims to enable policies that support further integration of renewables into the energy system at scale.
The proposal for the project refers to the many “opportunities and benefits” that distributed energy resources (DER) offer consumers, but states: “There remains a limited evidence base regarding the severity of DER curtailment in Australia, and its potential role in assisting network voltage management.”
UNSW’s School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) has negotiated access to anonymised data sets of rooftop solar generation from participants in AGL’s South Australian virtual power plant (where battery inverters manage interaction with the grid), and from Solar Analytics’ system-performance monitoring platform (from the South Australian customer base using solar PV inverters to interact with the grid). The dual datasets will allow a first-time comparison of curtailment as managed by battery inverters and solar inverters.
It is one of the biggest DER data sets available for research purposes in Australia, says Yildiz. The high-resolution data from AGL alone takes up tens of gigabytes of processing capacity, and the initial fast-track, six-month project phase would not be possible without a computing-power grant from Microsoft Azure’s AI for Good program.
Various state and Federal bodies in Australia have for years made changing demands of inverters sold in Australia, in relation to how they respond to irregularities of voltage detected in the grid — meaning they may have been required to reduce or switch off the output of small-scale solar systems to the network when thresholds are about to be breached.
In South Australia, where more than 35% of households have solar on top, the State Government and network service provider (NSP), SA Power Networks, in 2020 enforced a rule that requires every new household connecting solar to the grid to have an inverter capable of being switched off entirely by an external agent in the event of pending grid imbalance caused by peak solar production and related very low energy demand — say, when midday solar output on spring weekends is peaking but it’s not hot enough for everyone to switch on the air con.
Most of these inverter responses, however, occur automatically (SA’s big turn-off capability has so far only been invoked once since it was introduced on 28 September, 2020), and it’s difficult to know which customers are using inverters of which vintage, conforming to which standard. There is no oversight — for consumers, NSPs or market operators — of how much solar energy is being jettisoned.
“Users may notice that in the middle of the day, when their solar should be generating at full capacity, that it’s off, or it’s not performing as expected,” says Yildiz. 
That doesn’t mean they’re being curtailed, he adds, explaining the opacity of current data. There could be several reasons, related to either solar panel or inverter functioning, why a system is operating below par.
The CANVAS team, which also includes Naomi Stringer, Shanil Samarakoon, Dr Anna Bruce and Assoc. Professor Iain McGill,  is correlating its findings of irregularities in expected solar output with information on conditions in the network at that time, provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator, thereby firmly pegging it to voltage disturbances.
It has just finished top-line, fast-track analysis of the AGL data and is now casting a net through Solar Analytics’ offering.
“Every site is being analysed separately,” says Yildiz, “then we quantify what percentage of sites are losing, and to what level,” and — this is where it gets even more interesting — “what they may lose if inverters were abiding by different rules and settings for each site.”
This scenario modelling will help guide regulator decisions, and will be accompanied by social research already under way, which is testing the palatability of different scenarios with householders who have invested in solar. 
Yildiz expects the focus groups and interviews with energy prosumers, led by his colleague Sophie Adams, a human geographer at UNSW who is investigating the social license to automate, to yield a rich variety of insights, but was able to share a preliminary finding with pv magazine. 
One question asked of focus groups in the CANVAS study is how they would respond if they found out they weren’t getting the expected return on their investment — either as solar energy for their own use, or as solar exported to the grid for a feed-in tariff.
Yildiz said prosumers indicate they would be tolerant of actions taken during infrequent emergencies, where the burden of curtailment was equally borne by people across an affected region. However, if the events were frequent, or if some people were disproportionately affected, or if their returns were severely impacted, they would be discouraged from investing further in solar systems, and from recommending solar investment to friends.
The fast-track stage of analysis is due to be completed in July, with insights to be shared across the industry, and specifically to regulatory bodies, such as the Australian Energy Market Commission, which recently published a widely criticised draft decision to require householders and small business to pay an annual fee — a ballpark $100 — to export their excess solar energy to the grid.
The next stage of CANVAS will continue to add new emerging data to the study as it also deepens its analysis.
“Australia leads the world in rooftop solar installations, said RACE’s Chief Research Officer, Dr Chris Dunstan in a statement, “It is crucial that we remove barriers to growing this clean and low-cost resource. We are delighted to see this project underway.”
