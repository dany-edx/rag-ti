AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the approval will allow the energy giant to move forward with assessing the economics and viability of the project.
“As the largest ASX operator of renewables assets, a key focus is to invest in storage and firming capacity to ensure we continue to provide reliable and affordable electricity to households and businesses,” he said.
The proposed Loy Yang big battery is part of AGL’s planned national roll-out of 850 MW of grid-scale batteries with the gen-tailer confident its coal power generation sites can leverage off their existing access to the power grid, road, rail and water infrastructure.
“Our generation sites provide rare and unique redevelopment opportunities as they are established sites with a surplus of land, road and rail access, transport facilities and storage infrastructure embedded in the environment,” Brokhof said.
“As we continue on our pathway to net zero by 2050, we will progress our plans to develop these sites into integrated industrial energy hubs, with the Latrobe Hub set to create regional jobs and opportunities well into the future.”
Among AGL’s pipeline of grid-scale batteries is the 250 MW/1,000 MWh battery being developed at the site of its gas-fired Torrens Island power station in South Australia. AGL has indicated construction of the battery will commence before the end of the year.
AGL has also received the tick of approval from the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) for a 50 MW/100 MWh battery in Broken Hill and is seeking planning approval for a 150 MW battery with one hour storage to be developed at the site of its Liddell Power Station in the Hunter Valley.

At Liddell, the coal-fired generator scheduled to close in April 2023, AGL has committed to a 150 MW battery but is seeking approval from the NSW government for a big battery of up to 500 MW and four hours storage.
AGL already operates the 30 MW/8 MWh Dalrymple North battery in South Australia.
Should AGL reach a final investment decision on the Loy Yang grid-scale battery, the project would be part of Accel Energy following AGL’s proposed demerger.
The development approval for the Loy Yang grid-scale battery follows the registration earlier this week of Neoen’s 300 MW/450 MWh Victoria Big Battery (VBB).
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) officially registered the VBB on Tuesday to deliver Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS).
Under the System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) contract Neoen has signed with AEMO, the VBB will unlock up to an additional 250 MW of peak capacity on the existing Victoria to NSW Interconnector.

The registration follows weeks of testing and commissioning, which was initially delayed after a fire in two of its Tesla Megapacks in late July set the process back by several months.
The VBB is the fourth big battery in operation in Victoria with another at the Gannawarra solar farm (25 MW/30 MWh), one at a Ballarat (30 MW/30 MWh) and a fourth at the Bulgana wind farm (20 MW/34 MWh).
EnergyAustralia has also announced plans to develop a 350 MW/1400 MWh big battery at the site of its Yallourn power station before the closure of the coal-fired plant in mid-2028.
Melbourne-based renewables developer Syncline Energy has also revealed plans for a 600 MW/2400 MWh battery storage project to be built 25 kilometres west of Melbourne.
The Melton Renewable Energy Hub has been fast tracked by the Victorian government under its planning scheme amendment, and Syncline hopes to reach financial close by the second quarter of 2022, with production to begin by the second half of 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/26/shoalhaven-solar-farm-serves-as-roadmap-for-others-say-developers/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 26, 2021",Shoalhaven solar farm serves as roadmap for others say developers,"The Shoalhaven Solar Farm, made possible through a collaboration between not-for-profit solar company Repower Shoalhaven, Melbourne-based energy retailer Flow Power and Shoalhaven City Council is set to power up next month and will play a key role in providing the City of Sydney with 100% renewable electricity.
Set on 10 hectares of land owned by Shoalhaven City Council, which has granted a 30-year-lease on the property, the solar farm was co-developed by social enterprise Repower Shoalhaven, which raised $500,000 through community investors, and Flow Power which contributed $4.5 million.
The facility, near Nowra on the south-east New South Wales coast, comprises about 8,000 solar panels which are expected to generate an estimated 5.9 GWh of clean electricity annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 5,500 tonnes per year.
The electricity generated at the facility is being sold via power purchase agreements (PPAs) through Flow Power. Already 20 per cent of the project’s output has been purchased by the City of Sydney under a PPA signed in 2019 while the other 80% will be offered to local businesses.
Flow Power chief executive officer Matthew van der Linden said the solar farm exemplifies a true community project and provides a roadmap for other Australian communities looking to launch their own renewable projects.
“The Shoalhaven Community Solar Farm is the first renewable energy project of its kind in Australia. These projects present a challenge, but the rewards are immense,” he said.
“We’re incredibly grateful for the support of visionary organisations, like the City of Sydney, who recognise, not only the cost and sustainability benefits for themselves, but the flow-on effects for other communities.
“If organisations can follow in the city’s footsteps, a net-zero carbon future is achievable.”

City of Sydney CEO Monica Barone said the city, which helped subsidise the solar farm’s renewable certificates cost, allowing the farm to sell off some of its surplus power at a competitive rate to local customers, was proud to have played a part in the facility’s development.
“When the City of Sydney switched to 100% renewable electricity last year, we did so by signing an innovative, first-of-its-kind, $60 million power purchase agreement with Flow Power,” she said.
“The agreement not only means that all of our operations run on 100% renewable electricity, at a saving of half a million dollars a year, but we’re also actively contributing to developments like this regional NSW renewable energy initiative.
“It’s the first of its kind in the region but I’m sure it will not be the last.”
The City of Sydney also purchases renewable energy from Sapphire wind farm in Glen Innes and Spark Infrastructure’s 120 MW Bomen Solar Farm near Wagga Wagga as part of its $60 million agreement with Flow Power.

Repower Shoalhaven chair Walter Moore said as well as delivering renewable energy for the City of Sydney, the new solar farm will also provide power to the University of Wollongong’s Shoalhaven and Bega campuses and the graduate school of medicine accommodation in Nowra by Christmas.
“This is an amazing achievement when you think construction of the 8000-panel farm started in July,” he said.
“It shows that the local community and regional businesses have a desire to source locally produced, clean energy, even in the absence of any clear government policy or financial support.
“The SSF also provides a working model where community groups and businesses can collaborate to help reduce our carbon emissions and energise the local economy at the same time.”
Installation of the solar modules at the Shoalhaven Solar Farm is scheduled to be finished this month, with the farm expected to be switched on in early December.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/26/vsun-tests-flow-battery-technology-with-standalone-ev-charger/,"EV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"NOVEMBER 26, 2021",VSUN tests flow battery technology with standalone EV charger,"VSUN Energy, the renewable energy generation and storage subsidiary of Perth-based miner Australian Vanadium Limited (AVL), has completed the first phase of a trial of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) technology that it said could deliver a truly green charging network for electric vehicles (EVs).
The trial, based at the AVL and VSUN Energy Research and Development Centre in the Perth suburb of Bayswater, tested an AC charger coupled with a 5 kW/30 kWh VRFB powered entirely by a 3 kW rooftop solar PV system.
VSUN business development manager Zamien Sumich said VRFBs were the “missing piece of the renewable energy jigsaw” and the trial opens the way for standalone EV charging stations to be installed anywhere in Australia.
“The VRFB is well suited to the capture and storage of large quantities of renewable energy, enabling stable power output,” he said.
“Vanadium electrolyte doesn’t degrade, meaning that thousands of EV batteries can be charged from the one station.
“The VRFB’s long life, exceeding 20 years, makes it one of the most sustainable and long-lasting ways of storing renewable energy. At the end of the battery’s mechanical life, the vanadium electrolyte can be reused indefinitely.”
The penetration of EVs in Australia lags behind many developed nations with the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) indicating only 6,718 were sold nationally in 2020. That contrasts with China, the world’s largest EV marketplace where 1.3 million vehicles were sold last year.
EVs are however gaining momentum in Australia with new car sales data revealing that 8,868 battery and plug-in EVs were sold in the first half of 2021, which is more than in any calendar year.

The Federal Government has forecast that 30% of new car sales in 2030 will be electric, compared to about 1% at present but Perth-based federal Labor MP Patrick Gorman said the lack of reliable EV charging infrastructure – at departure point, en route and at the destination – has been identified as a sticking point to increased ownership.
“Australia lags well behind the rest of the world when it comes to the uptake of electric cars,” he said.
“This trial is significant in that it removes one of the barriers to the take-up of electric vehicles in Australia – the distance between and availability of charging stations.
“Having a stable renewable energy charging system for electric vehicles will be a big boost for the Australia electric car market.”
VSUN is collaborating with its Singaporean partner V-Flow Tech and Western Australia-headquartered EV charging hardware and software provider Gemtek Goup for the trial.
Gemtek commercial manager Florian Popp said the company has tested a wide variety of power systems with its EV charging technologies and the solar-power VFRB is well suited for Australian conditions.
“The VSUN Energy storage system’s unique capabilities and operating life provide a substantial advantage in high temperature and remote environments,” he said.
VSUN said while the initial trial of the VFRB-based standalone charger had been a success, further installations will require initial testing prior to deployment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/11/26/utilities-and-financial-investors-are-investing-in-renewables-especially-hydrogen-like-never-before/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,UNITED STATES,WORLD",PV MAGAZINE,"NOVEMBER 26, 2021","Utilities and financial investors are investing in renewables, especially hydrogen, like never before","From pv magazine USA
Ernst & Young (EY) released a report detailing transactions in power and utilities (P&U) for Q3 2021, which shows that utilities are putting significant financial support behind their environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. Investments in gas and electricity networks, the broader energy transition, and energy services; including storage, EVs and waste-to-energy, accounted for US$57.2 billion (AU$79.6 billion) of the quarter’s total of US$72.8 billion (AU$101 billion) in deal value.
This trend of a higher focus on renewable deals began its ramp up in the first half of 2020. EY strategy and transactions partner, Miles Huq, in previous conversations with pv magazine, said individual deals in renewable energy are typically lower in value, so the total value driven by these transactions shows continued investor confidence.
That mark of US$72.8 billion (AU$101 billion) in deal value represents the highest level of investment in the last eight quarters, showing the potential of a return to pre-pandemic levels of deal activity. Corporate investors acquired US$8.3b (AU$11.5b) of renewable assets in Q3, as compared to US$3.2b a(AU$44b) acquisitions by financial investors.
There were 53 deals in the Americas, which includes Central and South America, with cumulative deal value of US$23.9b (AU$33b), a 69% increase from Q2. Value was driven by very large “megadeals” in energy services and networks assets. Renewable assets drove deal volume with 17 deals.
The report also asserts that utilities are trying to sell off their fossil fuel generation assets, instead focusing on keeping nuclear, renewables and regulated businesses in their portfolios. In return, financial investors are jumping at discounted assets that are critical for grid stability. To illustrate this point, the authors point to the Public Service Enterprise Group selling off its 13 gas-fired plants to ArcLight Capital, a private equity investor, for US$1.9b (AU$2.6b) against the assets’ book value of US$4.5b (AU$6.2b).
And while emergent climate and renewable tech historically have been slow in drawing large investment activity, that narrative may be changing, as Q3 saw significant investments in hydrogen technologies. According to the report, gas utilities are increasingly betting on hydrogen to help them transition to clean energy companies.
For example, the report outlines that Avangrid announced plans to construct a 20 MW electrolyser and hydrogen storage facility for its Connecticut gas and electric utilities, powered by renewable energy from offshore wind. Across the country, American utilities have announced more than 26 hydrogen pilot projects.

South Korean floating PV specialist Scotra has completed construction on a 41 MW floating solar array on a water reservoir at the Hapcheon dam, in South Korea’s South Gyeongsang province.
The plant was constructed for Korea Water Resources Corp., which is a governmental agency that manages water resources.
The facility is the largest floating PV plant built in the country to date. It was built with the Q.Peak Duo Poseidon modules for floating projects provided by South Korea-based manufacturer Hanwha Q-Cells and floating structures supplied by Scotra itself.
The floating plant has the shape of a flower and, according to the project developer, will also become a tourist attraction.
Scotra previously built a 25 MW floating solar plant on a reservoir in Goheung county, in the South Korean province of Jeollanam, and a 500 kW pilot floating array at the Hapcheon dam itself.
The company is also developing a 72 MW project at the Saemangeum sea wall on the Yellow Sea, for which it has also built a new 300 MW factory to produce floaters and frames.
In March, the South Korean Ministry of Environment announced a plan to install around 2.1 GW of floating PV capacity by 2030. The new 2.1 GW program is part of South Korea’s plan to become carbon-neutral by 2050. It will add to the 2.1 GW floating solar complex the South Korean government is developing near the Saemangeum tidal flats, on the coast of the Yellow Sea.
The KRW4.6 trillion (AU$5.3 billion) project was unveiled in 2019. It will be built in two stages, with the first 1.2 GW phase set to come online in late 2022 and adding the remaining capacity by 2025
