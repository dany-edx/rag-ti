In the Northern Territory this year, 11 fires have been caused by DC isolators, compared to just four in 2022. The state of Victoria saw 27 fires caused by isolators in the last financial year, up from 15 the year before. Meanwhile, Queensland had 11 last year, and Western Australia had 14 fire incidents caused by DC isolators. The ACT had at least one incident in the last year, while New South Wales authorities did not respond to requests for data. No data was shown for Tasmania.
Until 2021, Australia mandated DC isolators be part of every system. It was the only country to have such a requirement. After industry experts lobbied against the use of DC isolators, saying they actually made systems more vulnerable to fires and faults, the mandate was finally abandoned in November 2021. Since the requirement for DC isolators was only revoked in practice six months later in mid-2022, the vast majority of solar installations on Australian rooftops will have DC isolators.
A spokesperson from Energy Safe Victoria told the ABC that a key driver in the increase in fire incidents was a lack of servicing of rooftop solar systems. He said that their research showed that although people with photovoltaic installations on their roofs understand the importance of servicing, they still don’t do it.
While existing laws recommend owners have their PV system inspected regularly and annually for system components like DC isolators, regular inspections are not required under state and territory electrical safety laws. As pv magazine reported in November 2021, another disadvantage of isolator components is that they can degrade from environmental exposure. This can be due to specific installation methods and product types, increasing the likelihood of water ingress and ultraviolet radiation damage. This was again reflected in the accounts of those experiencing the fires in a report broadcast by the ABC yesterday. In 2021, pv magazine concluded that DC isolators may need to be replaced within the life of the panels of a PV system.
NT Worksafe has now issued a safety warning and advised people to check their solar installations – especially to make sure that DC isolators were not on or near wooden surfaces.

Just 10 months ago, in December 2022, Energy Estate gained partners Idemitsu and DS Energy to help take the HyNQ project to its next stage of funding a pre-front-end engineering design (pre-FEED) study on the feasibility of producing and exporting green ammonia from the Port of Abbot Point near Bowen. Now, HyNQ says it has completed pre-FEED activities on schedule during Q3 2023 and will move forward to the FEED study in Q1 2024, with a final investment decision in 2025.
The hydrogen hub will be powered by solar and wind generation and expects to support over 1 GW hydrogen electrolyser capacity. The company is targeting North Queensland as the offtake market for its liquid green hydrogen, and plans to produce green ammonia for export markets. While solar, wind and green hydrogen do not produce direct greenhouse gas emissions, green ammonia is not without its environmental issues, primarily due to the massive of ammonia for fertilisers in the agricultural industry.
The exported green ammonia from HyNQ is intended to power industry activities, and the newest member of the consortium specialises in this field, both within Japan and internationally. Kensuke Yamamoto, Associated Director of IHI Corporation, said: “IHI Corporation is a global technology leader in the use of green ammonia to decarbonise industry – in Japan and other markets around the world. We see HyNQ as an opportunity to secure long-term supplies of green ammonia for the Japanese market and build upon the foundations of the strong and enduring partnership between Queensland and Japan.”
The project is being supported by the Queensland government as part of its recently announced Collinsville Renewable Energy Zone. The government is also supporting the accelerated development of Abbot Point as a green export hub, which boasts the advantage of an existing deep-water port. The Queensland Government is investing $8.5 million (USD 5.47m) in the Abbot Point Activation Initiative under the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan hydrogen hubs program to advance the master planning, development and infrastructure agreements required and the planning required for water and power supplies to produce hydrogen at scale.
The HyNQ consortium says it is “committed to the development of common user infrastructure at Abbot Point and ensuring that large-scale exports of green ammonia and decarbonisation of domestic industry plays a key role in unlocking the world-class renewable energy and critical mineral opportunities in North Queensland.”
This is not the first Australian hydrogen project joined by IHI Corporation.  The Japanese corporation’s portfolio includes working with Woodside Energy on green ammonia projects in Tasmania and New Zealand. For its part, beyond the early and further development of this North Queensland project, Energy Estate also has the Hunter Hydrogen Network (H2N) in New South Wales and Hydrogen City, Texas, USA.

The windup notice was commenced by one of Reclaim PV’s competitors, Lotus Energy Recycling, with whom the company had a Brisbane stock dispute throughout 2023.
Reclaim PV had ceased trading by the end of 2022, and removed its website in the first half of 2023. The last version of that website, captured in February, said Reclaim PV’s partners included Canadian Solar, Qcells, Suntech, SunPower (Maxeon Solar Technologies), and Yingli. It also had a partnership with Australia’s only panel producer, Tindo Solar.
Strangely, Canadian Solar recently claimed 2.6 MW of end-of-life solar capacity was dealt with via its partnership with Reclaim in 2022. “Through a partnership with Reclaim PV, Canadian Solar reports that 7,865 pieces of modules totalling 2.6MW were diverted from landfill through end-of-life management activities over the course of the year,” Renew Economy’s coverage read in an article posted last month, August 2023.
Reclaim PV was perhaps Australia’s most recognised solar recycling company, and had a warehouse in the south of Adelaide, South Australia and Brisbane, Queensland.

Clive Fleming, Reclaim’s founder, previously said the company folded under the pressure of years spent developing a recycling methodology in-house on a low budget, coupled with initiating manufacturer networks, establishing collection channels, and pitching for investors.
Solar recycling involves highly complex processes and is a nascent industry, meaning many financial and regulatory hurdles are yet to be resolved. 
Today, almost all of Australia’s handful of solar recyclers are yet to start processing, meaning they are still in the phase of collecting panels and stockpiling them. 
Once Reclaim PV ceased trading, it begun working with another recycler, Solar Recovery Corporation (SRC), to organise the offtake of its stock from its Queensland and South Australian warehouses. In May, Lotus Recycling began moving the Brisbane stock offsite after striking a deal with the warehouse landlords. 
Pv magazine published an in-depth look at Australia’s solar recycling, including its financial and regulatory hurdles, in its June edition.

The statements made by some market participants about quantities of Chinese solar modules in EU warehouses, rock-bottom prices and suspected “dumping” practices are increasing and somehow diverging from each other.
A classification based on numbers may help us to understand the new reality of the rapidly growing global PV market, which is poised for further expansion this year.
Global production capacity in terms of GW, modules
2019: 118 GW or around 340 million modules
2023: 380 GW or about 844 million modules
EU market in GW, modules
2019: 16.7 GW, or around 48 million modules per year, 4 million modules per month
2023 (optimistic scenario): 80 GW or 178 million modules per year, 14.8 million modules per month
EU module inventory “normal” (two-month cycle)
2019: 2.8 GW, or around 8 million modules
2023: 13.3 GW, or around 30 million modules
Inventories in the double-digit gigawatt range in the European Union are the new “normal” in an ever-growing PV market. “Horror scenarios” of 120 GW in EU warehouses by the end of the year would mean 290 million modules in warehouses.
Inventory values of modules (base €0.15/W)
1 GW = €150 million ($248 million)
10 GW = €1.5 billion
120 GW = €18 billion
“Horror scenarios” of 120 GW in EU warehouses would therefore require almost €18 billion of “dead” capital. How will this be financed? The new “normal” requires capital.
Purchasing prices for large PV projects in Germany
2019/20: €0.16W to €0.19/W
September 2023: €0.15W to €0.17/W
Price reduction based on the PV learning curve
2019-23: €0.04/W to €0.06/W
After roughly looking at the photovoltaic learning curve, the expected price in 2023 would be between €0.10/W to €0.15/W.
Solar module costs according to a document published by the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) on Sept. 11
EU stock: €0.33/W
EU: €0.299/W
China: €0.254/W
Solar module costs (excluding margins) from an ESMC member (as of the end of 2022)
EU: €0.198/W
China: €0.169/W
Share of silicon produced in China from Xinjiang (estimates for 2023):
Around 30%
The 380 GW of new PV installations expected throughout the world in 2023 could be produced entirely without silicon from China’s Xinjiang region.
Variable costs for polysilicon
Global average: $8.20/kg
Wacker (Germany): $18/kg
Success in climate protection
Modules in 2019-20 were mostly up to around 350 W and based on monocrystalline PERC technology. Currently, monofacial, monocrystalline PERC modules are slowly being phased out, with PV technologies such as TOPCon and heterojunction that are taking over the market for projects, with module outputs of up to 575 W.
Chinese module suppliers have grown rapidly since 2019 to supply this impressive global market. And the learning curve in production continued – the modules are much more efficient now and PERC products are destined to disappear from the market. What a success for global climate protection, which cannot be achieved with the current EU policy.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/15/a-terawatt-of-solar-module-capacity-expected-within-16-months/,"MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,CHINA,WORLD",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2023",A terawatt of solar module capacity expected within 16 months,"From pv magazine Global
The terawatt era has arrived, and the world is unprepared. As the industry explodes in volume, solar and related professionals must prepare, adapt – and deploy.
In its recent Q2 PV Supplier Market Intelligence report, Clean Energy Associates (CEA) highlighted significant growth in solar module manufacturing by Chinese solar module manufacturers. From a 405 GW manufacturing capacity in 2022, a projected 114% increase is expected, reaching 866 GW by the end of 2023. Following that, a subsequent 21% surge in 2024 will bring the total to an impressive 1.043 TW globally.

This rapid growth surpassed many industry predictions. Still, insiders within the Chinese government, having played a pivotal role in this boom, likely foresaw such a rise.
A closer look at the numbers reveals that by the end of 2024, Chinese domestic capacity could be responsible for approximately 0.93 terawatts of their total global capacity. Southeast Asia is anticipated to account for less than 7% (0.068 TW), the Americas just over 2% (0.023 TW), and non-China Asian markets might contribute about 1% (0.011 TW).
Major, European and American manufacturers, such as Meyer Burger and First Solar, were not considered in this study. The assessment predominantly revolved around:

The majority of this capacity is earmarked for n-type solar cells. Yet, a bottleneck seems evident in the production process. CEA’s data suggests that cell production lags behind module manufacturing, with wafer and polysilicon ingot capacities trailing by several hundred gigawatts.
China’s heavily centralised solar power market, underpinned by extensive governmental oversight, might see these predictions shift. Whether solar module manufacturing capacities will be fine-tuned remains uncertain.

Aligning with – and surpassing – these projections, Bernreuter Research suggests that long term Chinese plans include up to 3.5 TW of manufacturing capacity by 2027. PVEL’s findings indicate that the 3.5 million metric tons of capacity might be operational by the end of next year. Considering 2.2 grams of polysilicon are required for a watt of solar panels, PVEL estimates that polysilicon supplies could generate 1.6 TW of solar modules.
If we build it, will they come?
The question remains: if this manufacturing capacity is available, will there be adequate installers, grid capacity, and batteries to absorb the surplus daytime production?
Analyst Jenny Chase of BNEF splashed a little cold-water on our enthusiasm, pointing out the reality that oftentimes, solar module factory capacity is 1.5 to 3 times greater than actual installed capacity. Underutilization of manufacturing capacity is normal.
Chase noted:
Maybe 1 TW will be installed in 2025, but not just because the module factories exist.
BloombergNEF’s recent projections estimate 392 GW to be installed in 2023 and around 500 GW in 2025. These figures are based on their medium volume projections, though they also offer both lower and higher range projections.

Integrating such a large volume safely into the power grid poses daunting technical challenges. The U.S., the world’s second-largest solar market, has experienced delays in interconnections, slowing solar’s rapid ascent. Specifically, the PJM territory, within the broader United States’ Eastern Interconnection region, halted all new renewable energy projects for two years while grappling with hundreds of gigawatts of projects vying for grid access. As the U.S. interconnection queue nears 2 TW of capacity, both the time and cost of connections have escalated.

State markets have also put the brakes on their local distribution markets. When Massachusetts’ SMART program was launched, National Grid’s territory was overwhelmed with applications, causing unforeseen halts in development. Using public data, pv magazine USA predicted that National Grid’s area would instantly fill its entire 800 MW project tranche. Our prediction was spot on. Yet, the utility expressed astonishment, stating, “we’re all a little surprised by how quickly we got to this saturation.” As a result, they slammed the brakes on development, putting a billion dollars of projects on standby.
This unexpected turn prompted a state investigation. Despite this, grid connections remained sluggish, and currently, numerous substations within the state can’t accommodate additional solar projects.
China, the world’s largest renewable market, initially managed the surge in wind and solar by curtailing excess generation. They later developed a nationwide high voltage direct current (HVDC) network to channel power from the interior regions to the densely populated coast.
The growth rate of solar energy is undeniably accelerating. Having achieved our first terawatt of installed solar in early 2022, discussions swiftly transitioned to reaching 1 TW of capacity annually before the end of the decade. We then speculated that a second terawatt might be realized in just three years.
There’s a budding optimism that we might witness a unique milestone: a terawatt installed within a single year in the near future. Truly, that would be an accelerating transition.
