“Our supply forecasts strongly suggest there is insufficient capacity in the training and migration pipelines to meet this demand,” the federal government’s ‘Clean Energy Generation Workforce’ report, published on Tuesday, says.

The workforce transformation required by the energy transition is “substantial but not unprecedented,” the report adds. “Like the post-war industrial transformation and the digital transformation of the late twentieth century, a new generation of workers will be required.”
Alarmingly, the report paints a picture of an industry not particularly apt at attracting and keeping the workers it needs. The energy industry is overwhelmingly male – something the report says requires serious redress. “The energy sector also has the third highest incidence of workplace sexual harassment, with 71% of women having experienced sexual harassment in the last 5 years,” the report notes.
“Many female engineers report experiencing gender discrimination and bullying in the workplace and do not feel they have equal access to career progression opportunities, salary advancement or mentoring.”

The industry also ranks poorly for migrant participation, which is underrepresented. Moreover, migration alone cannot plug Australia’s skills gap, the report says, noting that competition for skilled migrant workers is incredibly high, which many other nations also vying to attract clean energy workforces.
“We can’t grow the workforce at the pace and scale required if large groups of the population are excluded, including women, First Nations people, people with disability, and recent migrants whose skills’ potential are underutilised,” the report says.
Workers in clean energy are also typically paid less than traditional energy salaries, and the jobs are in regional and remote Australia which can make the jobs inaccessible for some.
For more job opportunities to be filled by local regional Australia though, “there needs to be substantial uplift in education and training,” the report says.
“The next seven years will be critical in establishing or strengthening the education, training, and migration systems to ensure that we have the workforce to deliver the energy transition,” Clean Energy Council Director of Workforce Development, Dr Anita Talberg, said.
She added that resolute action to attract the new talent, particularly across STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] fields and construction is needed to fulfil the capability gaps that currently exist in Australia’s clean energy workforce.
The biggest shortfalls are projected not among university graduates, but those from TAFEs and other Vocational Education and Training (VET) qualified workers.

The company has also signed a seperate supply agreement, which will see EH2 supply 1 GW of its electrolysers to Fortescue so it can deliver the green hydrogen projects it is developing worldwide.

“Right now there are not enough electrolysers in the world to support the amount of green hydrogen we are set to produce,” Fortescue Energy CEO, Mark Hutchinson, said. “That is why we are partnering with other world leaders in this space to secure our green energy supply chain.”
EH2, founded in 2020, boasts electrolysis systems able to make nearly 50 tonnes of green hydrogen per day “at transformational low cost,” Fortescue says. Indeed, the startup seems to be a roaring success story, with Reuters reporting this latest funding round valued EH2 at USD 1 billion ($1.59 billion).
Its capital raise was well oversubscribed, with Fifth Wall, Energy Impact Partners, and many more joining Fortescue to invest. Amazon, Honeywell, Equinor, Rio Tinto, and Mitsubishi have also invested in EH2.
Electrolyser manufacturers are facing massive global backlogs due to high demand and low manufacturing capacity in operation today, resulting in lead times of multiple years. This fact is likely what has driven Fortescue to set up its own manufacturing facility in Gladstone, Queensland. While Fortescue’s factory is hoping to start producing by the end of the year, the scale evidently will not be enough to cater to Fortescue’s proposed projects.

Moreover, relatively little is known about the PEM electrolyser technology Fortescue has developed “in house” and is hoping to manufacture after the company’s deal with another US manufacturer, Plug Power, fell apart earlier this year.
EH2, on the other hand, has developed a full 100 MW “electyrolyser system.” In May, it announced its first factory in Devens, Massachusetts. “The Devens factory will have an annual manufacturing capacity of 1.2 GW with production of EH2’s 100 MW green hydrogen electrolysers commencing in Q1 2024,” it said at the time. 
It would seem, then, that Fortescue will be taking the bulk of EH2’s electrolyser production, but given the lack of timeline detail in Fortescue’s announcement, it is hard to say.
While Fortescue has not disclosed the value of its supply deal with EH2, the Australian Financial Review claimed it to be worth almost $100 million.

The 500 MW / 1 GWh Blackstone battery is proposed on a site in Swanbank just 40 kilometres from Brisbane, Queensland. The project is still very much in the development stages and only expected to reach final investment decision in the second half of 2025. To realise the project, Octopus still needs to organise connection agreements with network Powerlink, as well as secure offtake, according to the Australian Financial Review.
Octopus acquired the battery project using capital from its OASIS fund, a platform it set up in 2022 for institutional investors. The OASIS investment platform has raised $550 million (USD 346 million) in the last year, attracting backing from superannuation giants Hostplus and Rest Super, as well as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).
Octopus Australia has undoubtedly had a busy year, acquiring the 175 MW solar farm + 400 MWh Ardandra project, which sits adjacent to Octopus’ existing 180 MW Dulacca Wind Farm – both of which are in Queensland. In May, Octopus also acquired a 400 MW Hay Plains wind project in southwestern New South Wales.
Earlier in the year, Octopus revealed its plans to fold two proposed hybrids projects into its OASIS and OREO investment platforms. Those are the Fulham project, set to include an 80 MW solar farm coupled with a 120 MWh battery in southeast Victoria; and Blind Creek, an agrisolar project with up to 350 MW (AC) of solar and nominally a 300 MW / 600 MWh battery, located in southeast New South Wales, near Canberra. 
Desert Springs Octopus, a majority Indigenous-owned company backed by Octopus Australia and formed in 2022, also signed a series of agreements with First Nations groups from Darwin and Katherine in August. The intention there is for Octopus to work with the groups to develop a number of renewable projects in the Northern Territory, saying it will pursue a near-term investment of $1 billion into grid connected renewables along the Territory’s islanded grid, the Darwin-Katherine Electricity System.

“With prices panel prices falling again, we’re now back under the average,” he adds. “Still pretty high but it’s turned the corner.”
The variation between states has become particularly marked in the last year though, with Queensland departing from its New South Wales and Victorian peers – especially when it comes to battery storage. “We’re starting to see Queensland having a significant shortening in battery paybacks. To go from 10 years to 6.6 years in the space of six months is pretty crazy.”
Looking at residential solar + battery storage, payback periods have dropped across the board since Q4, 2022, with declines in all states bar South Australia. While paybacks have improved, including in New South Wales and Victoria, the timelines in both states remain considerable at 9.36 and 10.13 year respectively – well above Queensland. “Victoria and NSW still at their highest level, but Queensland is really driving low,” Johnston says.
While not as stark as Queensland, Western Australia has seen a noteworthy drop in battery paybacks at 7.64 years today, down from just below 10 years in Q4, 2022.
In terms of residential PV only, the state variation is again stark – but mostly in the least populace regions. Shifts in Tasmania appear to be particularly violent, moving from five years in early 2023 to just 0.72 years, according to the data. Payback periods in the Northern Territory have similarly plunged this year.
The declines in all other states pertaining to solar only have been more reserved. “I suspect it will go further, driven by panel prices,” Johnston says.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/04/around-40-of-the-workforce-in-global-pv-industry-is-female/,"MARKETS,RESEARCH,WORLD",ANGELA SKUJINS,"OCTOBER 4, 2023",Around 40% of the workforce in global PV industry is female,"From pv magazine Global
Global solar PV employment sat at 4.9 million in 2022, up from 4.3 million in 2021, according to the recently published Renewable Energy and Jobs Annual Review 2023 by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Among all renewable energy technologies – including hydro, wind and biogas – solar PV was the “fastest-growing” sector and accounted for over one-third of the total renewable energy workforce (13.7) million, the report claimed.
China, home to a majority of the world’s PV manufacturing sector, recorded the most workers with 2.76 million; the also country retained a “commanding position” across the supply chain, from ingots and wafers to cells and modules.
India employed the second largest number of workers, with 281,400 staffers, with on-grid solar estimated to have generated 201,400 jobs and another 80,600 in off-grid settings, the report stated. The US comprised the third-largest solar PV workforce in 2022 with 264,000 employees.
“Increasing solar PV installations in Brazil boosted employment in this industry to 241,000 jobs. Japan added less capacity in 2021 than the previous year. IRENA estimates its workforce at 127,000,” the report stated.
Europe accounted for roughly 11% of the solar PV industry’s total workforce with 540,000 workers in 2022. The report stated that the European Union experienced a “surge” in PV imports in the first half of 2022 due to the Ukraine crisis and subsequent efforts to reduce reliance on oil and gas imports. “However, installation rates trailed due to shortages of inverters and skilled labor, which subsequently slowed imports during the second half of the year,” stated the report.
Female representation in the solar industry was higher than any other renewable energy in 2022, with 40% of the workforce being female – twice as much as in wind, oil and gas sectors, the report claimed. However, women’s participation still falls “somewhat short” of the share of women employed in the overall economy.
Women’s employment in the industry was “uneven”, with females mostly hired for administrative positions (58%) followed by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (38%) and non-STEM technical positions (35%). Women accounted for only 30% of managerial jobs and only 17% of the total senior management.
More “effective actions” – such as greater awareness, “further” national policies and “better” workplace practices – are needed to ease women’s entry into the industry and improve their career prospects, the report stressed.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/10/04/swedish-startup-to-use-green-hydrogen-plasma-in-pilot-reactor-for-solar-grade-silicon/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,SWEDEN",VALERIE THOMPSON,"OCTOBER 4, 2023",Swedish startup to use green hydrogen plasma in pilot reactor for solar grade silicon,"From pv magazine Global
Swedish startup Green14 is planning to produce polysilicon by using novel green hydrogen technology.
The company is currently cooperating with Sweden’s Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in the development of a pilot reactor process where hydrogen plasma acts as a quartz reductant to remove oxygen from the silicon dioxide.
“It also acts as a refining step because of the very high temperatures in the plasma section,” Green14 CEO, Adam Podgorski, told pv magazine, noting that green hydrogen represents an alternative to the use of coal and chlorine as the processing reactants in conventional solar silicon production.
Green14 used a plasma spray process that requires an output of 85 kW in a lab-scale setup with the aim of simulating bulk silicon production from quartz in the presence of hydrogen plasma as a reductant and refining mechanism. The process collects silicon on plates in the plasma plume.
According to Podgorski, the process is able to deliver silicon at 5N to 6N purity levels (99.999% to 99.9999%). He said these results were validated by Norwegian research institute SINTEF and Czech plasma technology provider PlasmaSolve.
“Our pilot aims to repeat this 6N purity at scale and push it even further before integrating it into post-processing steps,” said Podgorski.  The hope for the pilot reactor is to achieve “high purities on timescales of seconds rather than the hours that it takes for Siemens polysilicon.”
The startup plans to build a 25-kilotonne plant in Northern Sweden, equating to an annual wafer capacity of 10 GW. “We have a letter of intent (LOI) in place from key customers and we are working on more,” said Podgorski, without providing further details.
When asked about green hydrogen sources, he said that Sweden has several large renewables-driven hydrogen electrolysis projects underway, such as H2 Green Steel.
