The Roadmap, launched in 2020, seeks to bring at least 12 GW of renewable energy generation capacity and 2 GW of long-duration storage online by the end of the decade as the state prepares for the exit of its coal-fired generators. Auctions are to be held twice a year until 2030 at least to ensure enough renewables capacity is built to support the transformation of the state’s energy system.
AEMO Services, which is administering the tender process in its capacity as NSW Consumer Trustee, received bids for more than 8 GW of generation and storage projects in response to its first auction.
Those projects have now been trimmed to 16 comprising more than 4.3 GW after what AEMO Services Chair Dr Paul Moy said was a rigorous and independent assessment against a set of criteria covering a wide range of factors including technical capability, deliverability and social licence.
Moy said the shortlisted project have been identified as those currently best placed to support the NSW electricity transition and will now proceed to a financial value assessment. This assessment will identify the projects that meet the criteria of being in the long-term financial interests of NSW electricity consumers.
“A key part of our task as consumer trustee is ensuring that the most promising projects, in terms of quality and efficiency, receive support to bring new energy infrastructure to market sooner than would otherwise have been the case,” he said.
Moy said the interest in the tender demonstrated the value of the investment opportunities available under the Roadmap.
“We are pleased with the selected shortlist and encouraged by the pipeline of projects that will compete in future tenders,” he said. “We expect competition to intensify over time as the Renewable Energy Zones are developed, and as the market continues to deliver new solutions to the energy transition.”
AEMO Services Executive General Manager Paul Verschuer said the shortlisted projects would now have to demonstrate long-term financial value.
“Those projects which clear this financial value assessment will be recommended for long-term energy service agreements (LTESAs) to support market entry,” he said. “We expect proponents to bid aggressively, recognising the value of the investment opportunities presented by the Roadmap and the unique features of our LTESA contract.”
AEMO Services said short-listed projects could submit their financial value bids by 10 February 2023.
Verschuer said projects that are unsuccessful in the current tender round will be able to participate in future rounds.
“We’ve designed the process to facilitate repeated applications at minimum cost to project proponents, and those projects now have the chance to update and improve their bids for the next tender round, scheduled to take place in around six months’ time,” he said.

The three-way partnership brings together Evergen’s optimisation technology and ability to orchestrate Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) via microgrids and demand response networks with Sassor’s resource aggregator system and Sharing Energy’s expertise in developing and distributing solar and battery storage systems.
Sharing Energy, whose programs include the Share Denki (electricity) rooftop solar and energy storage package, is seeking to expand its aggregation business to maximise the benefits associated with the deployment of renewable technologies.
The company said it will look to Evergen to provide alerting, monitoring, fleet management, manual dispatch, reporting, site optimisation and control application programming interface (API) via its software platforms.
Evergen said its technology enables digital optimisation of the energy supply chain, maximising the benefit from deployment of renewable technologies including residential and commercial solar and battery systems. The technology also allows batteries, generators and loads to be orchestrated in fleets enabling energy generators, retailers and distributors to use these systems as VPPs.
Sharing Energy said the partnership with Evergen and Sassor is expected to demonstrate the potential of community-based renewable energy to contribute to achieving both a stable supply of electricity and carbon neutrality.

Sharing Energy Chief Executive Officer Kazuyuki Uemura said the company would look to embrace the learnings and expertise of Evergen and Sassor to understand how to best commercialise the growing adoption of distributed energy resources in Japan.
“We are confident that this pilot project will demonstrate the potential of community-based renewable energy and pave the way for the widespread adoption of similar projects in the future,” he said.
Through the use of Evergen’s API and Sassor’s resource aggregator system, Sharing Energy will integrate and remotely control its residential PV systems and home batteries and explore the benefits of commercialising aggregation services such as demand response and VPPs.
Evergen Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Ben Hutt said the partnership is “a good opportunity to demonstrate Australian technical excellence in the Japanese context.”
“We can bring a lot to Japan’s unique combination of high energy prices, advanced technology, government support, ambitious targets to increase renewable energy and the management of DER,” he said.
There are high expectations for aggregation businesses that utilise DER sources to help maintain the balance between the supply and demand of electricity in Japan. The Japanese government is aiming to reduce carbon emissions by 46% from 2013 levels by 2030 with renewables to account for 36-38% of the country’s energy generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/27/perovskite-pv-tipped-to-become-competitive-in-rooftop-segment/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 27, 2023",Perovskite PV tipped to become competitive in rooftop segment,"An international research group, including scientists from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), has assessed what levels of efficiency and stability perovskite solar cells have to achieve to become an economically viable technology to compete with crystalline silicon cells in the rooftop segment.
“The weight of photovoltaic modules drives up costs for installation, transportation, and labor,” Michael Saliba, the research lead author and director at the Institute for Photovoltaics at Germany’s University of Stuttgart, told pv magazine. “Utilising lightweight, high-performance perovskite modules can lower these costs and open a new market in which perovskites are a competitive option.”
The scientists assessed the necessary lifetime (LT) of a perovskite module, which they defined as the time until a module has 80% of its initial efficiency, as a function of efficiencies to be competitive in the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE).
They found that perovskite solar modules might need to provide 20% efficiency for at least 36 years, or 25% efficiency for a minimum of 21 years, if they want to compete with conventional PV panels.
“This demonstrates that even with the significantly lower production costs of perovskites, it is challenging to become competitive with silicon, mainly because of the low LT of current perovskite solar cells and the limited experience with perovskite module stability,” the scientists said.
However, perovskite tech may have some interesting cards to play if the scientific community and the industry will become able to reduce its installation and structural balance-of-system (BOS) costs, as these usually account for around 10% of a PV system costs.
“With lightweight or flexible modules, the installation becomes significantly less arduous,” they said, noting that transport costs would be significantly lowered. “Materials costs could be reduced if simpler installation such as glueing could replace racking.”
The academics assumed a levelised cost of electricity for the United States of $0.119/kWh to $0.136/kW for residential PV systems based on conventional panels in 2021. Their estimates ranged from $0.055/kWh to $0.063/kW for the same installations in 2030.
Their analysis showed that by using flexible substrates, perovskite solar modules would need to achieve lower target efficiencies of 15% and LTs spanning from 13 to 22 years to compete with crystalline silicon in the 2021 scenario, and efficiencies of 17% and LTs spanning from 16 to 34 years in the 2030 scenario.
“This offers a wider corridor of possible combinations in which perovskites could reach the same electricity cost as silicon,” they concluded.
The scientists presented their findings in “Toward commercialization with lightweight, flexible perovskite solar cells for residential photovoltaics,” which was recently published in Joule.
The group features academics from the UNSW, the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and the University of the Basque Country in Spain.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/01/27/scientists-unveil-dirt-repellent-coating-for-solar-panels/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,GERMANY",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 27, 2023",Scientists unveil dirt-repellent coating for solar panels,"From pv magazine Global
Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Organic Electronics, Electron Beam and Plasma Technology (FEP) claims to have applied crystalline titanium oxide to ultra-thin glass for the first time in a roll-to-roll process.
“The ultra-thin and lightweight glass can be applied subsequently to facades or directly incorporated into solar modules as a composite material – and even onto curved surfaces,” said Fraunhofer FEP researcher Valentin Heise. “Dirt-repellent, easy-to-clean surfaces ensure transparency and cleanliness for facades and more efficient and consistent energy production for solar, with less maintenance costs.”
The researchers said titanium dioxide is a material that is hydrophobic when not exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and superhydrophilic when radiated.
“In the case of photoinduced hydrophilicity, the surface changes from hydrophobic to superhydrophilic after approximately 30 minutes of irradiation with sun-like UV light,” they stated.
They said the dirt on the solar panels can be removed by the coating at night, when the hydrophobicity of the surface washes it away with the aid of beads of moisture. The cyclical alternation of hydrophobic and superhydrophilic effects prevents the dirt from adhering to the panel surface during the day.
The scientists fabricated the first coating prototype with a long roll of thin glass with a thickness of 100 micrometers. They used a titanium oxide film with a thickness of 30 nanometers to 150 nanometers and a pilot plant for roll-to-roll coating provided by German equipment supplier Von Ardenne.
The research team said it is currently working on improving the technology by adjusting the properties of the titanium dioxide and thin glass in a cost-efficient way.
“In the future, work will also be done by Fraunhofer FEP on layer systems that can be activated not only with UV light but also with visible light,” they said. “The production and embedding of nanoparticles or doping with nitrogen, for example, are also being considered.”
