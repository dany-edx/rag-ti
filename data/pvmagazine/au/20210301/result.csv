Pilots, trials and demonstrations of green hydrogen technology will have access to $6.2 million in new grant support, while potential industrial users of green hydrogen can apply for a scoop of a further $1 million that will help develop business cases and feasibility studies for use of renewable hydrogen. Both funding lines come under the existing Accelerating Victoria’s Hydrogen Industry Program.
A hallmark of the Renewable Hydrogen Development Plan is its integration of new and existing hydrogen initiatives with planned renewable energy infrastructure, gas networks that can be adapted to distribute hydrogen blends, education of workforces to innovate and administer safe hydrogen production and distribution, transport networks that will utilise hydrogen, and export facilities.
“I commend the Victorian Government on its comprehensive plan focused on renewable hydrogen opportunities,” said Dr Fiona Simon, CEO of the Australian Hydrogen Council (AHC), on Friday.
The Council is the representative body of the Australian hydrogen industry, and includes members likely to align with the Plan, such as Arup, Australian Gas Infrastructure Group, BusTech Group, Engie, H2H Energy, Horizon Power, Star Scientific, Sumitomo Australia, Toyota Australia and Transit Systems.
Simon said that the AHC has also been calling for “a Federal Hydrogen Market Development Plan” that includes a target date for reaching the Commonwealth Government’s viability mark for H2 under $2 per kilogram to produce.
That is, if hydrogen needs to be available at $2 or less per kilogram to be competitive with alternative fuels deployed at large scale across the country, the AHC wants to see at least “the minimum number of projects needed to reach the price target”, says Simon.
The Victorian Renewable Hydrogen Development Plan references the H2 under $2 national “stretch goal” as a mechanism for tracking “how hydrogen is progressing on its cost curve”,  and proceeds to outline Victoria’s vision for “a thriving renewable hydrogen economy”.
That vision recognises the many industrial, state-based and national programs now underway to accelerate hydrogen development. It aims, for example, to assist projects to plug into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s $300 million Advancing Hydrogen Fund, and to dovetail with National Energy Resources Australia’s (NERA) Regional Hydrogen Technology Clusters to build “a well-connected supply chain network”.
Although the Plan focuses on renewable hydrogen, the Victorian Government says its development “has been informed by and aligns with the policies, projects and initiatives which support other forms of hydrogen production in Victoria”. It refers to the $496 million Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) pilot which is testing the feasibility of exporting brown hydrogen produced by burning coal onsite at AGL’s Loy Yang power station, capturing the carbon generated, and exporting “clean-burning” hydrogen fuel to Japan via a first-of-its-kind in Australia liquefaction and loading terminal at Victoria’s Port of Hastings.
Victoria’s Renewable Hydrogen Development Plan is organised in terms of three “focus areas”, each of which encompasses six desired “outcomes”.
Of the focus areas, establishing a “Foundation for renewable hydrogen” is already underway. It involves regulating and adjusting for cross-sector issues such as safety, skills development and workforce planning; and supporting research and development.
The second focus area — “Connecting the Economy” — will see the strengthening of sector-coupling opportunities.
That is, Victoria will have progressed the integration of renewable hydrogen with its transport sector (Outcome 9); hydrogen will play a clear role in “supporting a secure, reliable and resilient electricity system” (Outcome 10); the industrial sector will be “primed for renewable hydrogen” (Outcome 11); and renewable hydrogen will by this stage enable the export of Australia’s renewable energy.
In the medium to long term, the plan envisages a Victorian state focus on “Leading the way”: that is, the Plan foresees, “Hydrogen opportunities across the state will be linked through market connectivity and a fully integrated supply chain”, strategies and communication will have ensured that ,“The community understands and trusts hydrogen” (Outcome 14); and the Victorian Government will use its purchasing power to strengthen the state’s renewable hydrogen sector (Outcome 15).
The AHC’s Simon believes “There is a distinct opportunity in Victoria to generate sustainable jobs and sustainable energy”, and applauds the political will shown by the Victorian Government to progress to net zero emissions by 2050, while capitalising on the economic opportunities inherent in that transition.
The new $10 million in state government funding, although not yet fully allocated, complements other Andrews’ Labor Government investments such as the $20 million used for a statewide trial seeking solutions for a zero-emissions bus fleet, which includes trialling hydrogen buses; the $10 million recently provided to support CSIRO and Swinburne University of Technology in development of a Hydrogen Technology Demonstration Facility that includes a refuelling station for hydrogen vehicles.
Of course, the hydrogen economy will be built on further development of Victoria’s renewable resources, and the Plan acknowledges the role of the state’s six nascent Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) — identified by the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Integrated System Plan as strategic areas in which to colocate solar/wind/hydro generation, storage and energy-hungry industry — as potential hydrogen-production hubs.
It says that renewable hydrogen production sites that are located close to significant renewable generation facilities “have the potential to extract value by avoiding network constraints that might otherwise limit the generation of power from renewable sources”.
At the same time, the large-scale, high-density energy-storage capability of hydrogen has the potential to support the grid and the Victorian Government sees it as “a viable option for holding and distributing energy to match grid power demand”.
The Plan’s main benefit appears to be in co-ordinating Victoria’s enablers of a hydrogen economy (renewable resources, world-class education and research institutions, an extensive gas network, a connected transport system and export infrastructure) with the many initiatives, funding allocations and potential opportunities currently associated with hydrogen both within the state and nationally. 
Driving these towards specific outcomes provides a blueprint to advance the envisioned hydrogen economy, and potentially also Victoria’s stated Renewable Energy Target of 50% in the electricity system by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/01/victorias-minimum-solar-feed-in-tariffs-to-drop-by-34/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 1, 2021",Victoria’s minimum solar feed-in tariffs to drop by 34%,"After an extensive stakeholder engagement process, Victoria’s Essential Services Commission has released its decision on the minimum feed-in tariff (FiT): from 1 July 2021 excess energy generated by households and businesses and sold back to energy retailers in the state will attract a minimum single FiT of 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour, down from the current minimum of 10.2 cents/kWh.
The Commission says the drop reflects a 30% decrease in the wholesale cost of electricity generation, which makes up almost a two-thirds of the FiT; a trend which the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) said would continue at a rate of around 14% per annum to the 2022/2023 financial year, in its Residential Electricity Price Trends Report 2020 (published in December).
“While the days of high feed-in tariffs appear to be over, the benefits [of rooftop solar] remain, especially for those who alter the way they consume power,” said Marcus Crudden, Pricing Director with the Victorian Essential Services Commission, when the Commission’s final decision was announced last week.
He said savings of around $890 per annum are possible if households “make small changes to the way they use their electricity — such as operating power-hungry appliances during the day”.
The Commission’s public engagement on reducing FiTs began with publication of its draft decision paper published on 17 November 2020, which proposed a new minimum of 7.1 cents/kWh. It subsequently held two online public forums and invited questions and submissions on the proposed changes, which closed on January 8 of this year.
The process brought 79 submissions and questions from 50 stakeholders, with almost all submissions from solar customers being in disagreement with the proposed minimum FiT rate as being “too low and unfair to people who have invested in solar systems”, while Tango Energy and Energy Australia expressed the view that the minimum FiT was too high and inefficient.
In its Public engagement summary: Minimum feed-in tariffs review for 2021-22, the Commission said: “The final minimum feed-in tariffs are lower than our draft decision,” because, “They reflect the most recent wholesale electricity price forecasts.”
It added that the revised rates mean, “Solar customers receive the true value of their solar exports without non-solar customers subsidising them through higher retail rates.”
The AEMC’s 2020 Residential electricity price trends report attributed the fall in wholesale electricity prices in Victoria to significant increases in renewable generation capacity, “particularly wind farms”, and lower gas prices.
“The results in Victoria demonstrate how new sources of electricity generation like solar and wind are driving down wholesale prices,” said AEMC Chief Executive Benn Barr at the time.
Meanwhile, Victoria’s Solar Homes program is partly responsible for an increase in rooftop solar generation in the state. In January it announced it had driven adoption of rooftop solar in the residential sector, to power more than 510,000 homes. 
The program aims to inspire a further 260,000 Victorian households to generate their own solar energy by 2028, as the state strives to achieve 50% renewable generation in its grid by 2030.
In October last year, Tristan Edis, Director of Analysis and Advisory for Green Energy Markets consultancy, foreshadowed  in pv magazine Australia that low daytime wholesale power prices driven by ongoing uptake of rooftop PV would “ultimately flow through to feed-in tariffs offered to solar system owners”.
Western Australia had at that stage already announced a reduction in its FiT (between 9am and 3pm) to 3 cents/kWh, from 7.1 cents/kWh, which came into effect 6 November 2020.
Edis said, “A fall in FiTs matters a lot because the typical household system exports roughly 80% of its generation.”
With FiTs in eastern Australian states served by the National Electricity Market at 10 cents or higher going into this new calendar year, FiT revenue has been equal to about half of the financial benefit of rooftop solar to a householder.
In the face of great surges of solar energy hitting the grid in the middle of the day, and driving market prices to their lowest, more expensive generation from coal-fired plants is pushed out of the market challenging the ability of those plants to effectively operate — they struggle to remain online in order to meet evening demand when solar has retreated.
Household battery systems will help householders to store peak solar generation for use later in the day, evening out both solar feed-in to the grid, and demand on the grid throughout the day, and perhaps resulting in revised feed-in tariffs that reflect the ability of households to support grid supply as needed.
Victoria’s Solar Homes program also provides a point-of-sale rebate on battery purchase of up to $4,174 (this rebate is locked in until June 30) for eligible households, with the aim of encouraging 10,000 homes to regulate their own solar energy storage and use by 2028. 
The state government maintains that the typical Victorian household can save a further $640 a year by self-consuming stored renewable energy. For many, the upfront cost of batteries still doesn’t appeal — but this perception may shift as FiTs are reduced, thereby also reducing income from solar output during peak sunny periods of the day.
As Crudden explained, “Retail tariffs are much higher than feed-in tariffs due to the other costs retailers face when they deliver electricity to their customers, such as business overheads, network charges and customer expenses,” and potentially the cost of keeping currently still needed coal-fired generation assets in the game.
To avoid paying higher retail rates, said Crudden, it’s “in solar customers’ interests to use as much of the electricity they generate from their solar panels as possible”. At the moment, the most cost-efficient way to do that is to shift energy-heavy loads — such dishwashers, clothes dryers, water heating and pool cleaning to do their thing in the middle of the day.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/01/synergy-community-fund-spreads-more-solar-love/,"COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",NATALIE FILATOFF,"MARCH 1, 2021",Synergy community fund spreads more solar love,"Synergy, Western Australia’s government-owned energy generator and retailer, is calling for applications to its 2021 Synergy Community Solar Fund, which has been a glowing example of how solar on the roof can avoid electricity costs and free up cash for vital services.
The Fund is now in its fourth year, and in 2021 is offering a total of 30 kW of solar and energy efficiency audits — at a combined value of $40,000 — to community groups, charities and not-for-profit organisations with premises in the South West Interconnected System, and which do not already have solar installed.
A 2020 fund recipient, Second Harvest, which provides food relief to people in need, had a 3.85 kW system, sized for its energy use profile, installed just a few months ago, which is anticipated to save the organisation around $1,080 a year — money that will instead be spent on providing a broader selection of staple foods in greater quantities for purchase at much reduced prices for people experiencing financial difficulty.

Native Animal Rescue which operates in Malaga in Perth’s northern suburbs had a 14.26 kW system installed on 27 August 2019 under the auspices of the Fund, and has since saved $4,417.42 on energy bills, according to Synergy.
Most importantly, these savings have enabled the rescue organisation, which takes in more than 3,000 sick, injured, orphaned or displaced creatures each year — to provide effective heating for a room that houses injured or orphaned birds and reptiles in particular. Previously, Native Animal Rescue could only afford a heating globe/lamp for the purpose, but the increased capability conferred by its renewable rooftop PV resource has allowed it to care for more animals and a wider range of species.
The Fund helps a minimum of two organisations plug into solar each year, but 2020 saw six systems awarded, including to Communicare, which provides a range of family, education, employment and legal services to the West Australian community; Foothills Information Referral Services in the city of Kalamunda; Claremont Therapeutic Riding Centre, which provides therapeutic and learning experiences through horse riding for people with disabilities; and the Spare Parts Puppet Theatre in Fremantle, a performance company dedicated to furthering the creative possibilities of the puppetry art form.
“We are proud of the benefits the Synergy Community Solar Fund has delivered so far,” said the gentailer’s Chief Executive Officer, Jason Waters, in a statement that reported a total of 16 charities have so far received more than 250 kW of solar capacity from the Fund — which has enabled a collective saving on energy bills of some $81,000.
Waters said that aside from helping not-for-profit organisations free up cash for reinvestment in the services they provide, the Fund also contributes to “a better understanding of sustainable energy use”, in the community, “and the role solar can play in this journey”.
The size of awarded systems is determined according to the consumption profile of each entity, with the maximum system size of any award capped at 20 kW, and installation preceded by an energy efficiency audit.
Applications for the 2021 Synergy Community Solar Fund will be accepted until midnight on Sunday 2 May this year, with winners announced in the second half of 2021.
