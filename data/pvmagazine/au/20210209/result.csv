First mooted in 2018, the Bookaar Solar Farm – a joint project of Infinergy Pacific and landowners, former Corangamite MP Stewart McArthur and family – would feature up to 700,000 solar modules, inverters, a substation and battery storage across a 558-hectare site.
The proposed facility is expected to have an operational life span of up to 30 years and would generate up to 420 GWh of zero-carbon electricity per year but the project has repeatedly failed to secure development approval.
The Corangamite Shire Council rejected the initial proposal in 2018 with loss of agricultural land and community opposition contributing factors.

A subsequent appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) was dismissed in 2019 with Victoria’s planning arbitrator pointing to a lack of information around drainage and bushfire management in the application submitted.
Infinergy said the updated application, including a detailed design of the solar farm, has been submitted to the Minister for Planning who is now the responsible authority for large-scale solar developments in Victoria.
“In response to the Tribunal’s decision not to grant an approval, Bookaar Renewables has further refined the proposal to ensure that the issues identified by the Tribunal have been addressed,” Infinergy said in a statement.
“In particular, the solar farm has been designed in response to further detailed hydrological and bushfire assessments.
“However, it should be noted that the proposal remains a design for a 200 MW solar farm of the same dimensions and characteristics, located within the same design envelope as the previous planning application.”
The location of the substation, battery and operations buildings have been rearranged to avoid a flood-prone area but they remain on the western boundary of the site, adjacent to the high-voltage transmission line that will connect the facility to the National Electricity Market (NEM) via the Terang and the Ballarat substations.
Inter-row spacing of the single-axis tracking system has been adjusted from 12m to 12.75m south of the 220 kV transmission line and 13m north of the transmission line.
The number of site access points has been increased from five to eight in response to the bushfire assessment while the number of water tanks for fire prevention has been increased from one to eight.
“The Infinergy Australia team has been working hard to address concerns raised by the VCAT decision handed down in July last year,” Infinergy said in the statement.
“With the benefit of additional assessments, we are confident that it can be demonstrated that the proposal will not have any unacceptable environmental impacts.”
If approved, it is estimated the solar farm will take approximately 12 months to construct with Infinergy suggesting operations could commence in 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/09/south-australian-trial-provides-blueprint-for-vpp-integration/,"GRIDS & INTEGRATION,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 9, 2021",South Australian trial provides blueprint for VPP integration,"In a new report released on Tuesday, the ENA said SA Power Networks’ Advanced VPP Grid Integration Trial shows the way forward for Australia’s distribution networks as the national electricity market (NEM) continues to decentralise and VPPs become larger and more prevalent.
South Australia is home to the Tesla home battery-based SA VPP which is shaping to be the world’s biggest. Since its launch in 2018, the SA VPP has been rolled out across more than 1,000 Housing SA properties. Phase three of the VPP was launched late last year and is expected to take the scheme to another 3,000 homes with the eventual aim to roll the VPP out across 50,000 South Australian homes, both public and private. At full scale, the Tesla VPP would provide up to 500 MW.
The ENA, the national industry body representing Australia’s electricity transmission and distribution and gas distribution networks, said it is clear VPPs will supply critical wholesale energy into the grid, but warned the aggregated operation of thousands of rooftop solar PV systems can easily exceed distribution network limits.
The ENA said VPPs need dynamic information about available network capacity to operate to their fullest potential and SA Power Networks’ grid integration trial had shown that current export limits can be as much as doubled.
“It was the first project to demonstrate the active adaptation of dispatch limits by a VPP operator, to maximise access to the energy market without breaching distribution network constraints,” ENA said.
“Since October 2019 this innovation has enabled Tesla’s 1000-customer 5 MW SA VPP to dispatch at higher power levels and generate greater value while trading in wholesale and FCAS markets.”
ENA said the project lays the foundations to transition to flexible export limits for all distributed energy resource (DER) customers.
During the trial, SA Power Networks worked with Tesla, the CSIRO and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to provide a real-time data feed of available local network capacity to the VPP, enabling it to export more energy to the market but operate within the network’s technical limits.
SA Power Networks said this was achieved by implementing an interface that exchanges real-time data on location and network capacity between the electricity distributor and the customers’ VPP operator.
The project co-designed and developed technology to enable the SA VPP to operate within continually updated ‘operating envelopes’. Instead of the normal 5 kW per-customer dispatch limit, this increased to 10 kW per customer, when the network has capacity.
The results of the SA Power Networks trial have been outlined in ENA’s Network Innovation Report 2021.
ENA chief executive officer Andrew Dillon said the report, a compilation of the submissions received to the ENA’s 2020 Industry Innovation Awards, provides an opportunity for networks to share learnings from across the sector and receive insight into what other businesses were achieving.
“The energy sector is undergoing one of the most momentous periods of change since the introduction of electricity into the home,” he said.
“With the integration of renewables, the increase in battery storage uptake and innovative market and system design, networks are creating a smarter grid, giving customers more control over their energy use and encouraging better management of electricity demand.”
ENA received 11 entries for the annual Industry Innovation Awards, including from Endeavour Energy, Energy Queensland, Horizon Power, Jemena, TransGrid, United Energy, Western Power and the winning SA Power Networks entry.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/09/renewable-hydrogen-projects-planned-for-victoria-wa/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 9, 2021","Renewable hydrogen projects planned for Victoria, WA","AGN, part of Australian Gas Infrastructure Group (AGIG), has announced it will expand its renewable hydrogen capacity, partnering in two new project bids submitted to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) last month.
AGIG chief executive officer Ben Wilson said AGN will partner with French renewables giant Engie to develop a 10 MW renewable hydrogen project in Victoria’s Murray Valley and will team with international integrated energy group ATCO to develop a similar project on Western Australia’s northwest coastline.
Wilson said the two projects add to AGIG’s current hydrogen developments in South Australia and Gladstone in Queensland and demonstrates the company’s commitment to target 10% renewable hydrogen by 2030 into its Australia-wide network which provides more than 2 million customers with natural gas.
“Both of these projects are eight times larger than our existing Hydrogen Park South Australia, which is the biggest hydrogen project under commissioning in Australia and one of the largest in the world and demonstrates our commitment to play a leading role in Australia’s renewable hydrogen journey,” he said.
The 10 MW Hydrogen Park Murray Valley (HyP Murray Valley) project will be co-located with the West Wodonga Wastewater Treatment Plant and supply renewable hydrogen blended with natural gas to customers on the existing Albury-Wodonga gas distribution network.
Wilson said the HyP Murray Valley project will put about 40,000 existing residential, commercial and industrial connections in the Albury-Wodonga natural gas distribution network on up to a 10% renewable hydrogen blend while the facility will also be able to supply industry and transport markets.
“Hydrogen Park Murray Valley will be globally significant in terms of market outreach, to around 40,000 connections, and its co-location with a wastewater treatment facility,” he said.
“It will demonstrate sustainable outcomes across the water, gas and electricity sectors.
“It aims to deliver a highly replicable model enabling the decarbonisation of more than 5.2 million gas connections in Australia.”
The HyP Murray Valley bid has been submitted to ARENA alongside the Clean Energy Innovation Park (CEIP) project proposal which will be located alongside renewable electricity generation assets in Waradarge, about 250km north of Perth.
It comprises a 10 MW electrolyser and will be capable of producing 4.0 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per day for use in gas networks, industry and transport.
“The CEIP in Western Australia delivers highly efficient renewable hydrogen production at around 4,000 kg per day,” Wilson said.
“ATCO and AGIG are already significant players in the Western Australia gas market, providing distribution and transmission services respectively, the CEIP joint venture brings together our strengths to establish a commercial hydrogen sector in the state.”
The projects come hot on the heels of AGIG announcing a major milestone for its the Hydrogen Park South Australia, with the first production of renewable hydrogen taking place at the facility in December during commissioning of the 1.25 MW electrolyser.
Construction at the plant in the Tonsley Innovation District commenced in late 2019. It was expected to be fully operational by late 2020 but Wilson said the final stages of commissioning were still to be completed.
“We have reforecast our aim to deliver Australia’s first renewable gas blend to households from 2020 to the first quarter of 2021,” he said.
Once operational, more than 700 residences in parts of the Adelaide suburb of Mitchell Park will be the first recipients of the plant’s blended 5% renewable gas.
AGN’s Hydrogen Park Murray Valley and the CEIP were among seven projects invited by ARENA to submit a full application as part of the $70 million Renewable Hydrogen Deployment Funding Round after Expressions of Interest were lodged in May 2020.

Japan‘s northern island of Hokkaido has seen strong development of large-scale PV and wind in the past two decades due to relatively low costs of land compared to other regions in the country. As a result, however, renewables grid integration and grid stability have become challenging in the area, especially because the island has low energy demand. Although in 2019 a 300 MW interconnection line was switched on to enable some electricity exchange with Japan’s northeastern region of Tōhoku, grid congestion and stability in the island remain critical and grid operators are allowed to enforce curtailment against wind and solar power producers without compensation up to 30 days per year to balance supply and demand.
A possible solution to make large-scale solar still viable in the region and to avoid curtailment from local network operators is the construction of plants connected to storage. A good example is being provided by a 6 MW / 21 MWh facility that Chinese inverter manufacturer Sungrow energised at the end of 2020. The plant relies on inverters and a containerised storage solution based on lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NCM) provided by the company and occupies a surface of around 85 hectares.
“The batteries smooth the power generated, allowing it to be integrated into the grid more effectively,” the manufacturer said in a statement. “The robust design makes it durable and weather-resistant, especially important in Hokkaido where the temperature can be lower than -35 degrees Celsius.”
Sungrow explained that the project is entitled to a high feed-in tariff of 21 JPY ($0.19)/ kWh but that the connected AC capacity of the plant is limited to only 845 kW due to limited grid availability. “As one of the countries with the most stringent grid codes, Japan presents us lots of opportunities and challenges,” Sungrow added, without providing more technical or financial details on the project.
In October, SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational conglomerate holding company SoftBank, completed a 102.3 MW / 27 MWh solar-plus-storage plant built on 132 hectares of land near the town of Yakumo.
On the island of Hokkaido, there is currently another large-scale solar-plus-storage project under development. Property developer Tokyu Land is building a 92 MW of solar with 25.3 MWh of lithium-ion storage capacity.
