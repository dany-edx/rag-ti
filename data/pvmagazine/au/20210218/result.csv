Energy Transformation Taskforce chair Stephen Edwell said on Thursday the rapid transformation being experienced in the electricity sector means the market systems, standards, obligations and frameworks that underpin the operation of the power system in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) are under increasing pressure.
Edwell said the taskforce, established in 2019, has been responsible for developing constrained-access arrangements which will maximise the benefits of renewable energy and facilitate more equitable and efficient use of capacity on the Western Power network.
“We all know the benefits of the revolution in renewable energy technology are immense, however, to capture these benefits energy markets need to be carefully transitioned away from traditional thermal generation to a new renewable energy paradigm and this transition needs to reduce barriers to entry, to create opportunity to monetise the value that these new technologies can bring to our system,” he said.
“The design and resilience of energy markets worldwide is being significantly tested by these new technologies, technologies not contemplated as most energy markets have evolved over time from a basic design around baseload generation fuelled by coal and gas.
Edwell described the SWIS supply chain as “very sensitive” to frequency and voltage fluctuations, low daytime demands and the steepening ramp up in evening demand and said any change would require careful management.
“The reality is that high levels of renewable energy penetration are stressing power systems not designed for high levels of variable generation and two-way flows of energy,” he said.
“In order to maximise the benefits of renewable energy we need a strong and co-ordinated oversight of power system transformation.
“In all its guises renewable energy needs to be fully integrated into the power system to support the power system and extract value for doing so.”
The existing SWIS design, first implanted in 2006 has separate mechanisms for capacity and energy and Aden Barker, Delivering the Future Power System project director, said under the new WEM design that basic construct has been retained.

Barker said the short-term energy market would be retained while the balancing market will be transformed into a far more real-time market while the reserve capacity mechanism, which ensures the system has enough capacity to deliver power when its needed most, has also been retained with the addition of Network Access Quantities (NAQs).
The NAQs represent a change in the way that capacity credits are assigned currently under the reserve capacity system and are a core element in the move to a constrained grid.
The NAQs establish a priority order for assigning capacity credits and also promotes new investment in areas of the network where the capacity can contribute to overall system reliability. The NAQs can only be assigned up to the residual network capacity. Once the capacity of a network Is full, new entrants seeking to locate in those areas will not receive a NAQ and won’t receive capacity credits.

In another change, the government-owned Synergy will no longer bid into the market as a portfolio. Each of its facilities will be bid and dispatched separately like other independent power producers (IPPs).
The redesigned WEM is set to be implemented from the 2022 cycle onwards.
The taskforce has already released a distributed energy resources (DER) roadmap with 38 actions to fully integrate small distributed energy assets into the power system by 2025 and a whole-of-system plan which takes a macro perspective of the revolution of the generation mix to 2040.
“The redesign is intended to remove barriers to new technologies, establish new revenue streams but keep the SWIS as a good place to invest and also establish competitive tension to achieve efficient price outcomes for consumers,” Barker said.
“Above all, it is a wholesale electricity market that supports the power system to be reliable and secure.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/18/intellihub-calls-for-change-to-metering-services-framework/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Intellihub calls for change to metering services framework,"In its submission to the AEMC’s review of the regulatory frameworks for metering services, Intellihub said competition in the metering sector had delivered a better and more efficient service but elements of the rules have created unintended barriers to a timely deployment of smart meters in Australia.
“As a result, Australia is on track for one of the slowest smart meter deployments in the world, with full deployment unlikely until after 2040,” Intellihub CEO Adrian Clark wrote in the submission.
“Outside of Victoria, only 18% of small customers in Australia have a smart meter.
“In contrast, most overseas rollouts have been completed in around seven years. New Zealand reached 50% penetration in just six years under its competitive approach and now close to 90% of New Zealand customers have a smart meter.”
Intellihub, which operates in both the Australian and New Zealand markets, said network meter testing rates have also slowed in Australia and so too have replacements of old, failed meters with an estimated 2.4 million electricity meters in Australia now older than 25 years, with 350,000 of those 50 years or older.
“Proactive meter replacements by electricity retailers are not occurring at the rates that were envisaged three to four years ago, mainly because retailers are absorbing almost all of the costs of smart meters despite the benefits being shared by a range of industry participants,” Clark wrote.
“Without material changes to the rules, customers will be locked in to using old, last-century metering technology for many decades to come.”
The AEMC launched a review of the metering services regulatory framework in December, seeking to examine whether the reforms introduced as part of the competition in metering (CIM) rule change rolled out in 2017 have met expectations and whether changes to the current framework are required to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Intellihub said the CIM rule, which transferred the metering-related roles and responsibilities from the distribution network service provider (DNSP) to a metering coordinator (MC), had succeeded in many areas, delivering better and more efficient service, less cost and cheaper prices, increased innovation and new technology.

“Today, smart meters give insights in real-time; optimise the home for solar, batteries and electric vehicles; and enable new services like demand response and virtual power plants (VPPs) and dynamic control of hot water,” Clark wrote.
“They give more control over household energy costs, and when deployed at scale they reduce costs to serve, putting downward pressure on electricity prices and help deliver a more competitive electricity retail market.
“They are a vital enabler of the energy transition and facilitate a greater use of renewable energy in homes and businesses across the country.”
The AEMC has acknowledged the potential benefits of smart meters but in its consultation paper highlighted they are not currently providing many of the services they are capable of delivering, noting the ‘general sentiment amongst stakeholders is that smart meter data is being under-utilised in the NEM’.
Clark agreed that some of the services available with smart meters are currently under-utilised but said this would be improved if penetration rates increase and current regulatory barriers are removed.
“The technology is available now … but its use is limited by regulatory barriers, transaction costs and insufficient incentives,” he wrote.
“Regulatory reforms can address these challenges and improve outcomes for customers, while maintaining the competitive metering model and current consumer protections.”
Intellihub’s submission calls for reforms which will strengthen testing requirements for old and failed meters and ensure they are replaced; change how distributors recover costs of old meter assets; encourage the use of smart meters as a more efficient and modern control of hot water systems; and make it easier to access data to help manage the increasing penetration of renewables on the grid.
The submission also recommended a focus on reforms that accelerate the rollout of smart meters and reduce the costs of smart meters by removing unnecessary regulatory costs and barriers.
Intellihub cautioned against reverting to a more regulated approach to smart metering, warning it “would lead to massive disruption to the market”.
Intellihub is one of more than 30 stakeholders who have made submissions to the consultation paper.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/18/nsw-looks-to-make-solar-simple-for-strata-titled-buildings/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",NSW looks to make solar simple for strata-titled buildings,"The NSW Government has taken another step in the transition to renewable energy with the passage of new amendments in Parliament on Wednesday that are designed to make it easier to install renewable energy into strata-titled buildings.
While rooftop solar has been increasingly popular in Australia, with data from the Clean Energy Regulator estimating one in four homes now have solar installed, figures published by body corporate management company Stratacare Australia indicate that only about 0.5% of strata schemes nationwide have followed suit.
The decision-making processes associated with strata-titled properties and the perceived complexity of installing solar have often served as disincentives but the changes to the Strata Schemes Management Act now mean only 50% of owners need to agree for the installation of renewable energy infrastructure to go ahead in their apartment buildings.
Minister for Better Regulation and Innovation Kevin Anderson said the changes would make it easier for strata committees to install sustainability infrastructure, such as solar modules, battery storage and EV charging points.
“The reality is that apartment buildings have been held back when it comes to installing renewable energy, and that had to change,” he said.
“For too long the high voting thresholds needed to approve these types of installations has made it far too hard for owners and residents living in strata.
“Today we’ve changed the law so that strata committees only need 50% of owners to agree to install clean energy infrastructure in their apartment buildings, making it drastically easier to make the switch.”
The change continues NSW’s transition away from coal-fired power to hydro, wind and solar, outlined in the $32 billion renewable energy plan unveiled last year and ensures those in strata-titled buildings are not left behind.
“This government is committed to creating a strong, safe and sustainable environment for the 82,000 people living in strata buildings in NSW,” Anderson said. “Every dollar counts at the moment, and I won’t allow red tape to stand in the way of those people accessing clean energy and the lower bills that come with it.”
Anderson said the State Government will now consult with key stakeholders on any other barriers to the uptake of sustainability infrastructure in apartment complexes.
“Now that we’ve made it easier than ever to get approval to install sustainable infrastructure, we want to ensure there’s nothing else standing in the way,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/02/18/old-mate-barnaby-joyce-attempts-to-hijack-cefc-with-tedious-proposals/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",BLAKE MATICH,"FEBRUARY 18, 2021",Old Mate Barnaby Joyce attempts to hijack CEFC with ‘tedious proposals’ ,"Ever a man for involving himself in affairs above his emotional and intellectual pay-grade, Joyce wants the publicly funded emissions reduction corporation to invest in new fossil fuel projects while warning Prime Minister Scott Morrison against committing to mid-century emissions targets. 
The legislation in question would see the government establish the $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund to increase new energy generation, energy storage and transmission infrastructure. However, Joyce seems to think such funds should be available to fossil fuels as well, particularly coal. 
In a speech, Joyce “warned the Parliament was falling victim to the ‘quasi religion’ of not being allowed to mention coal.” Joyce attempted to rationalise his amendment through laissez-faire principals, arguing that it should be the market’s decision as to whether new fossil fuel power stations should be built. 
Although Joyce conceded the transition to clean energy was “logical”, the real irony of his amendment, described as “tedious” and “an unnecessary distraction” by the Clean Energy Council (CEC), is that the market already has decided to stop building new fossil fuel power stations, indeed, not only that, but the market has decided to accelerate the closure of fossil fuel plants with technical life left in them. 
Take the coal-fired Bluewaters Power Plant (Bluewaters) in Western Australia, the state’s newest coal-fired power plant. In November 2020, Bluewaters’ Japanese owners, the Sumitomo Corporation, reported a stunning US$251 million loss on their investment. Meanwhile, Australia’s biggest energy companies are accelerating the retirements of their coal-fired assets and simultaneously accelerating their investment in energy storage, typically on the same sites. Origin Energy announced plans last month for a 700 MW megabattery at the site of its Eraring coal generator in the New South Wales (NSW) Hunter region. Eraring is Australia’s largest coal generator and set to retire in 2032, a date that could very well be brought forward. 
What Joyce is doing is not advocating for the free market at all. He is merely exacerbating the Coalition’s policy vacuum, an inaction which is itself a significant action and serves to deter investment. Moreover, another irony exposed inadvertently in Joyce’s speech was his simultaneous affectation to support coal and coal exports, while declaring that the “biggest issue for our nation” is “not climate change” but “the preeminence of China as a growing superpower”. Somehow, by some wangle of cognitive dissonance, Joyce fails to recognise that the growing power of China is a product of the coal exports. 
The real “quasi religion” is not one, as Joyce seems to think, where coal cannot be mentioned, but rather, one where believers feel the mention of coal is necessary almost everywhere, like a priest corralling every conversation back to Jesus. Religion, as evidenced by Joyce’s zealousness, is what people turn to when they’ve got nothing left.
The CEC has met Joyce’s amendment with a strong demand to keep the CEFC clean as the name suggests, and laments that debate over the Grid Reliability Fund “has been hijacked by tedious proposals that promote the use of fossil fuels.” 
“It’s time to get on with the job and focus on what’s important – targeted government funding to kick-start urgent investment in the future-ready network,” argues CEC Chief Executive, Kane Thornton. 
“A 21st-century economy needs a modern electricity network that supports reliability, security and lower emissions technologies, and delivers low-cost energy to consumers, ” Thornton continued. “A lack of transmission investment is now one of the most critical challenges facing the industry. This underinvestment is stifling new generation investment, constraining existing generation and resulting in increased energy security and reliability risks as well as higher power prices.” 
The CEC urges Parliament to throw out proposed changes to the definition of”low-emission technology,” which would allow the CEFC to support high-emissions generation. 
“There is no such thing as clean goal and gas is not a low-emissions technology,” Thornton said finally. “The best way to manage the declining reliability of the ageing coal fleet and scheduled plant closures is through timely investment in transmission, renewable energy generation and storage.” 
Of course, Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister, Angus Taylor, who has already proven himself a fellow saboteur of the CEFC, believes the proposed amendment deserves consideration. 
Shadow Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen described Joyce’s proposal and recent scrutiny of signs the Coalition was easing towards setting mid-century emissions targets as “humiliating”. 
As if the undermining of the CEFC by official government policy isn’t enough, Old Mate ⁦@Barnaby_Joyce⁩ is moving an amendment to allow the CEFC to invest in coal. Labor will vote against it. I presume the Government will too! pic.twitter.com/TNmhOnABjc
— Chris Bowen (@Bowenchris) February 16, 2021

According to the ABC, Bowen said blamed antics like those perpetrated by Joyce as the reason “this bill has been languishing in the parliament for over six months” and “proves it was never about grid stability, but was about giving the embattled Minister Taylor unprecedented power to direct clean energy funds into fossil fuels.” 
Stagnation on the Grid Reliability Fund is yet another continuation of embarrassing behaviour at the Federal level, perhaps best evidenced by the contrasting efforts of State governments, particularly NSW. That the Coalition is still dragging its political tail on the related issues of climate and energy policy after the decade-long Climate Wars is evidence their own “quasi religion”, much like the “quasi religion” of detached Japanese soldiers fighting on decades after the Japanese surrender in WWII because they didn’t know the war was over.

However, it is not all good news as a further 32 generators with a total capacity of 3,301 MW which completed their registration in 2020 are still waiting to come online. 

AEMO says these projects will begin commercial operation “in coming weeks and months.” However, considering how long some of these projects have already been waiting, such as the 81 MW Yatpool Solar Farm in the notoriously grid limited region of north-west Victoria, a project that has been in the queue for over a year. Other examples include the 200 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm, the 170 MW Wellington Solar Farm, the 110 MW Glenrowan West Solar Farm.
The notorious north-west of Victoria, part of the West Murray Zone, is said by AEMO to be making “good progress”. There is currently 3.6 GW across 29 projects still in the application stage in the West Murray Zone and AEMO says that it has finalised a new sequencing approach for uncommitted projects. 

So, a record number of projects came online, but it seems as if a record number have also joined the queue. Indeed, AEMO says that 2020 also saw 15 projects with a total capacity of 3,004 MW have completed the first stage of connection, making them committed projects but not yet energy-generating ones. 
Nevertheless, AEMO is also happy to declare that the pandemic seems to have not affected the interest and progression of new projects, and that the number of inquiries and applications for batteries have “increased substantially.”
