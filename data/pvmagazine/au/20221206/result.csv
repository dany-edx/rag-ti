While the announcements were slanted towards hydrogen, they also included changes for solar, wind, critical minerals and other energy-linked industries.
First up, the state government committed $22.5 million to streamline its approvals process, creating new teams to assess critical minerals, hydrogen and renewable energy projects.
The government says the funding will “slash approval timeframes” and “overhaul the state approach to environmental approvals.” To that end, a new dedicated cross-government ‘Green Energy Assessment Unit’ is expected to be operational by mid next year.

“Western Australia is on the cusp of becoming a global green energy superpower, with an unprecedented number of renewable energy and critical minerals proposals currently under environmental assessment and a significant number of new referrals in the pipeline,” the state government’s announcement said.
“The new multi-pronged approach will help to drive investment in conventional wind, solar and wave power generators, hydrogen industries, lithium mining and critical minerals processing, and green energy product manufacturing.”
In a more controversial vein, the state government is moving forward with its target of having green hydrogen comprise 1% of the state’s electricity generation.
Following stakeholder consultation, the government says it will progress to the detailed design phase for the Renewable Hydrogen Target for electricity generation in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), WA’s main grid.
The Australian Energy Council (AEC), the peak body for electricity retailers and generators, has raised concerns over WA’s hydrogen target, saying the policy won’t decarbonise the grid but will increase costs. Blending hydrogen with natural gas in pipelines has long been a contentious route, with many even within the hydrogen industry questioning the concept. Hydrogen has a lower energy density than natural gas, so mixing it into pipelines has been interpreted as spending more to produce less.
For AEC’s WA Policy Manager, Graham Pearson, the state government’s hydrogen support would be better directed towards manufacturing and heavy industry uses. “Industries such as steel makers are heavy carbon emitters, able to easily replace natural gas with renewable hydrogen, and are far better placed to support the establishment of the hydrogen sector,” Pearson said.
The WA government opened the Renewable Hydrogen Target policy for feedback in October, and said the period showed further work is required to “ensure the scheme balances providing benefits to the SWIS with demand stimulation.”
Energy Policy WA will undertake a study into the role of renewable hydrogen in the SWIS, targeting areas such as long-term storage and peaking generation, to inform further work on outstanding design elements, including how certificates are created, the determination of liable entities, and identification of a regulatory agency, the government said.
It added the initial 1% target “represents an important first step in the development of a broader use-agnostic Renewable Hydrogen Target scheme.” That broader use-agnostic scheme will consider all potential use cases for renewable hydrogen, including transport, industrial feedstock, electricity generation, and pipeline blending.
Energy Policy WA and the Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation will report back to Government in mid-2023 on next steps and timelines regarding the target.
Finally, large-scale hydrogen proponents looking to access or use Crown land will now have access to additional guidance with the state government releasing new policy on the topic.

“SunSPOT V3 has been built by engineers at UNSW’s world leading School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering specifically to help people understand what solar can do for them – not to sell them solar,” Dr Anna Bruce, SunSPOT Project Leader and UNSW Associate Professor said.
Australian households and small businesses can use SunSPOT to find out what solar system size will give them the best return on their investment and get an estimate of the cost and annual savings in less than five minutes. Users can also compare the costs and annual savings with different battery sizes.
“It’s the only independent tool tailored to your circumstances that’s publicly available in Australia. All other solar calculators seek to capture personal information and generate sales leads,” Dr Bruce said.
“Now, with nationwide delivery and improvements to its usability and accuracy, SunSPOT will be able to help the vast majority of Australians confidently navigate the complex solar market.”
Previous versions of APVI’s flagship tool have only been available in areas where there is spatial mapping LiDAR data available and the local council has taken up a subscription.
Now there are two versions of SunSPOT available: the premium, council subscription version which maps the area with LiDAR data and the standard version which is free for all Australians.
Users of both versions can also add their smart meter data and electricity tariffs for even more accurate estimates, if desired.
“Householders no longer need to depend on salespeople to educate them. With this latest version of SunSPOT, everyone can get reliable tailored answers to common questions about solar and batteries,” Dr Mike Roberts, SunSPOT Project Leader and UNSW Senior Research Associate, said.
“The APVI has found that Australia has the potential to install 179 GW of rooftop solar capacity – but so far we’ve installed less than 10% of that,” Dr Roberts added.
“179 GW of solar would generate more electricity annually than the total current annual electricity consumption in the national electricity market.”
Jenny McAllister, Federal Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy, noted the government is also developing a ‘Solar Consumer Guide’ which will provide further guidance for consumers and will incorporate feedback from key industry stakeholders. The guide is expected to be launched in mid-2023.

The funds, secured through the European funding programme “InvestEU,” will be used to build a commercial demonstration plant for the production of active precursor cathode material (pCAM) for electric car batteries.
The company plans to convert a derelict, brownfield industrial site owned by subsidiary Königswarter & Ebell in Hagen near Cologne, West Germany, into the commercial manufacturing site.

Precursor cathode active material or pCAM is used in the production of advanced lithium-ion cells with nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) chemistry. 
The main difference between PBL’s process and conventional processes for producing pCAM is its simplicity. PBT’s patented ‘NMC Direct’ approach does not separate nickel, cobalt and manganese to produce metals and metal salts before recombining them in the pCAM – a process which is energy-intensive, complicated, and expensive. Instead, the technology combines selective leaching and purification processes to produce pCAM directly.
Importantly, thePBT process can use recycled battery material known as black mass as a feedstock, a major bonus for the EU which is pushing a circular economy approach.
In total, PBT claims the carbon emissions from its pCAM production process are 70% less than the current industry average.

“With its resource-friendly and innovative approach, the PBT refinery in Germany is well positioned to become a key player in the electric vehicle battery market in Europe,” European Investment Bank Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle said. “As it stands, the skyrocketing demand for electric vehicle batteries is likely to cause a major pCAM supply bottleneck.”
Alongside the German plant, PBT is working to build a pCAM hub in Western Australia. The hub will be established in Kalgoorlie and will initially produce 50,000 tonnes per annum of precursor Cathode Active Material – enough to produce up to 500,000 lithium-ion EV batteries. 
The project, which is being pursued in partnership with Poseidon Nickel, secured a $119 million grant from the Australian government’s Modern Manufacturing Initiative earlier this year.
PBT is headquartered in Brisbane, with its German subsidiary Königswarter & Ebell based in Ettlingen. The company was founded in 2017 to commercialise the battery processing breakthrough made at the University of Queensland and currently employs around 50 people, including 35 in Germany.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/06/pvhs-success-in-australia-there-are-no-obvious-choices-for-us/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,RACKING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,SPAIN",PILAR SÁNCHEZ MOLINA,"DECEMBER 6, 2022",PVH’s success in Australia: ‘There are no obvious choices for us’,"From pv magazine Spain
From supplying its solar trackers to just one plant in Australia in 2019 to leading shipments in 2022, PV Hardware’s ascendency has been lightning fast. “With 2 GW delivered in Australia, this year we are number one according to Rystad Energy statistics,” Alejandro Cantos, country manager of PVH APAC, tells pv magazine.
The keys to success lie, according to him, in the starting conditions, the vertical integration of Gransolar’s business model and having survived the initial ‘trial by fire’ the company faced when it first arrived in the country.
“PVH is the only tracker and fixed structure manufacturer able to guarantee the strength and efficiency of the installation in the extreme wind conditions of certain areas of the west coast of Australia. The tests have been carried out in wind tunnels by independent bodies. The AI [artificial intelligence] and programming implemented in the control systems allow the behaviour of the trackers to be adapted to weather forecasts with independent defence mechanisms to protect the installation in any terrain and conditions,” says Cantos.
“PVH’s in-house production guarantees the supply of customised products. Every project and every site has its own set of on-site challenges and this is where PVH makes the difference. In Australia, this already positive point coincided with supply problems during the height of the pandemic, so it created the perfect storm.”
On the other hand, while Australia is not as winding as Europe, it does have a lot of rock, the ground is very hard. “We came with our Monoline, which is one of the most robust trackers on the market, and we realised that we needed special configurations. It was a very expensive project and even more complicated because we were dealing with something that no one else had done. But the key was to survive the first trial by fire,” he explains. “We have adapted, with project-specific configurations that allow us to move several modules with a single engine. The Australian market already knows that we are more than just a technology provider. PVH is a solution provider. Our Axone and Monoline series have evolved and our product portfolio has nothing to do with what we had three years ago”.
This was coupled with the fact that in December 2019 they trained installers from two EPC companies, “so suddenly we had more allies. So we had a product, we had installers and we could carry out projects that the other players had dismissed due to their complexity,” Cantos says.
“Today we have become famous in Australia for taking the plants that nobody wants, and improving them. For example, we apply backtracking to winding terrain,” he adds. At the moment, although labour in Australia is very expensive, the government is encouraging local manufacturing. “We have already built a plant with 93% local steel with a certificate of origin,” he explains.
“We have experienced first-hand that every region, location, country is different, every project is different –  so why should we always use the same tracker?” Cantos says. “PV Hardware is an expert in adapting its in-house manufacturing structures to new landscapes and project phases. We are a structure design boutique,” he says, and shares that this year they have incorporated two new features: they design and pre-assemble the components in the factory, so that on-site assembly is faster, easier and contributes to reducing the number of hours per worker and, consequently, the final cost. “We used to do the pre-assembly on site and now we do it from the factory, indoors, so we can also move forward regardless of weather conditions,” he says. “Another innovation is our unloading platform, which is able to unload in 15 minutes what used to take hours,” he explains. “There are no obvious choices for us… if at some point we don’t have the expertise, or the product we need doesn’t exist, we develop the innovation.”
PVH is involved in some of the world’s largest solar parks under construction, such as the one that will connect Singapore to Australia – the world’s largest solar and storage plant – and the VRET (Victoria Renewable Energy Target) initiative. “PVH is bidding to supply structures and trackers in some of the world’s most important projects, and this is no coincidence,” he says.
PVH accounts for almost two thirds of Gransolar’s total revenue and employs more than 700 people worldwide. “GRS acts as one of many PVH customers globally, but speaking specifically about Australia, in 2022 we have supplied the same number of plants within our group as for customers outside our group. The goal is to continue to grow as PVH, maintaining our newly acquired top-tier position in Australia, where we still have a long way to go,” concludes Cantos.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/12/06/panasonic-unveils-vehicle-to-home-system-for-pv-powered-homes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 6, 2022",Panasonic unveils vehicle-to-home system for PV-powered homes,"From pv magazine Global
Panasonic Electric Works, a unit of Japanese electronics giant Panasonic, has developed a vehicle-to-home system (V2H) that facilitates two-way flows between solar-powered homes and electric vehicles.
The company said it will start selling its Eneplat system in Japan from February.
“In addition, from next summer we will also sell an upgraded version of our AiSEG2 management system that links various home appliances and equipment with Eneplat,” it said.
The company said its new V2H system is the first in the industry to handle the simultaneous charging and discharging of electric vehicles and batteries. The AiSEG2 system can reportedly forecast surplus power based on daily power consumption and automatically control the charging and discharging of batteries..
It has a rated output of 6 kW and can be charged with a maximum PV power output of 9 kW. The standard lithium-ion battery has a storage capacity of 6.7 kWh.
“The V2H system has a compact size and can be installed on a floor space smaller than that of one air conditioner outdoor unit,” Panasonic explained, adding it measures 1,250 mm x 420 mm x 210 mm and weighs 60 kg. “It is easy to install, even in a limited space in a parking lot.”
It said the system can increase the self-consumption rate of homes with rooftop PV and storage from about 50% to approximately 90%. It will sell for JPY 1.76 million ($19,210).
The company also said that in February, it will reveal which electric car models will be compatible with the new V2G system.
