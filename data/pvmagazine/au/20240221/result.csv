These scenarios are Progressive Change,  Step Change and Green Energy Exports. Progressive Change would see 43% emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050. The Step Change scenario is based on consumer driven investment to maintain temperature below 2 C. While Green Energy Exports foresees a limiting of temperature increase to 1.5 C, requiring rapid electrification, green hydrogen production, and bio-methane solutions.
The Projections for distributed resources – solar PV and stationary energy battery systems report found under the Progressive Change model, a capacity by 2053/54 of 66 GW, which is higher than CSIRO’s projection used by AEMO for the same period, of 48 GW.
Forecasts for the globally favoured models, Step Change and Green Energy Exports, landed on a 98 GW capacity from Green Energy Markets projections, and 92 GW from CSIRO.

“No matter which way we cut this, these forecasts indicate we are headed for an amount of rooftop solar capacity (taking into account panel degradation) that is close to, or greater than typical average electricity demand,” Tristan Edis, the director of Analysis and Advisory at Green Energy Markets and co-author of the report.
“Then on top of this we also have solar capacity in solar farms and large commercial installation above 100 kilowatts per system. For many, such a large amount of rooftop solar capacity seems to stretch the boundaries of credibility.”
Edis says there are four reasons to install more rooftop solar capacity than typical total electricity demand across residential customers, but every sector of the economy as well.
“Over time, given that solar panels can last 20 years, we end up with a steady accumulation of more and more capacity, even though overall the number of new sites installing solar each year is expected to decline substantially from what we’ve experience in the last few years,” Edis said.
As capacity grows and curtailment ensues, and the value of solar generation in the wholesale electricity market, along with feed-in tariffs declines, Edis said the caveat is heavily contingent on the price of home battery storage systems declining too.
Thirdly, Edis reasons that despite common beliefs, distribution networks do have demonstrated capability to manage very high levels of household solar adoption with scope to better manage voltage at modest cost to integrate solar capacity.
“When you examine data on the proportion of households with solar by postcode in Australia, you find that distribution networks are already managing to handle geographic areas with very high concentrations of solar system adoption. In addition, in the future once batteries become attractively priced and widespread, this will substantially mitigate the voltage rise created by solar,” Edis said.
Capacity growth of household solar systems increased 380% from 2011 to 2021 when a then, record amount of STC-registered rooftop solar capacity of 3.2 GW was installed. However, Edis continued, the number of individual solar systems installed in that period was only up by 5% as the dominant driver of capacity growth was bigger systems, not more installations.
“Rooftop solar capacity is likely to accumulate over time to reach levels that dominate the electricity market, it doesn’t mean it will necessarily grow at the speed governments ideally need it to in order to achieve their emission reduction goals.
“Given the long lead times we are currently confronting with the build out of large utility-scale renewable energy projects, rooftop solar – which will need to be coupled with batteries – becomes especially important in helping Governments maintain progress towards their emission reduction goals.”
“However, it is very far from given that we will follow the Step Change or Green Energy Export trajectory of growth. Stakeholders need to recognise that these scenarios are intended to represent a very large scale-up in the rate of emission reduction effort in this country.
“Our own modelling has assumed a range of new government policies would be introduced, which we are yet to actually see implemented,” Edis said.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/21/a-cell-makers-survival-guide/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,OPINION & ANALYSIS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,WORLD",,2024-02-21,A cell maker’s survival guide,"From pv magazine Global 02/24
As 2024 opens, the solar industry faces serious surplus after manufacturers accelerated production capacity commissioning across the supply chain in 2023. Driven by technological shifts, the cell segment saw the most excess supply, with total annual manufacturing capacities reaching beyond 1.1 TW in 2023. There was 506 GW of existing passivated emitter rear cell (PERC) solar capacity and 670 GW of tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), negatively doped, “n-type” production lines. That was twice the level of end-user demand.
Prices collapsed. With end-user demand still sluggish while module prices continue to decline, manufacturers producing M10-wafer-based PERC cells in 2023 experienced price falls led by polysilicon during the first half, and then a 20-week period of consecutive price declines from the third quarter on. InfoLink’s survey showed that most makers producing PERC cells have been facing an income deficit since November 2023. At first, manufacturers could safeguard their production operations and cashflow by using unbranded original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and dual distribution channels. As the market quickly switched to n-type products, however, OEM fees for PERC cells dropped as positively doped, “p-type” cell orders continued to decrease. It became difficult for manufacturers to profit from OEM use at the end of 2023 and, overall, they would lose money on production.
After undergoing two months without profit, since November 2023, many manufacturers started shutting down their older lines to avoid bigger losses. Some manufacturers even stopped production entirely or withdrew from the market. As of the end of 2023, some 50.6 GW of annual PERC production capacity has been marked for shut-down or a production halt, accounting for around 10% of the total. Most of the companies affected are professional cell makers. The majority of vertically integrated companies, with advantages in downstream channels, maintained operations and are planning for capacity phase-out or modified schedules. In markets outside of China, most PERC cell lines are still operating as the technological shift is taking place more slowly. However non-Chinese PERC cell production capacities will also be gradually eliminated as new capacity comes online and n-type demand continues to rise.

Moreover, many production capacity expansion plans for new technology have slowed or even halted as prices are low and business profitability has shrunk. As of the end of 2023, at least nine companies had halted TOPCon cell projects with 120 GW of production capacity, which is quite significant.

Judging from expected 2024 trends, the scale of hold-ups in production capacity expansion and the rate of older capacity phase-out will continue to widen. Meanwhile, upgrade projects from PERC to TOPCon are also in the pipeline, with most manufacturers watching for the outcome of leading cell makers’ line modifications. Manufacturers are also mulling over whether to acquire halted TOPCon projects in a bid to elevate their competitive edge while avoiding line modification risks.
After manufacturers evaluate the suspension of their production capacity expansion plans, and the scale of any PERC cell line modification, InfoLink projects that the market share of PERC and TOPCon will come in at 23% and 65%, respectively, in 2024. The market share of PERC will then decrease to a single-digit percentage from 2025 onwards and become a customized product.
The historic industry cycle indicates surplus supply usually lasts for a certain period and will facilitate healthy and sustainable development after a reshuffling of production capacity and the retirement of old capacity, as well as technological transformation and profit recovery.
Although the recent p-type price collapse drove prices to a new low, cell prices stopped falling at the beginning of 2024 after manufacturers cut or paused production at a large scale. As n-type cell prices have sustained their premium, compared to p-type products, and costs will continue to reduce as conversion efficiency increases, businesses that produce n-type products will enjoy a certain profitability in the long term after eliminating older lines and filtering new production capacities. Given manufacturers have usually actively engaged in R&D when profits were slim in the past, it is expected that technical breakthroughs and cost reduction will accelerate during this period. Cell makers in particular will continue R&D and mass production of n-type and other new technology while phasing out older lines at a faster pace. For instance, laser-enhanced contact optimization technology emerged in the third quarter of 2023 and can help enhance TOPCon cell efficiency by more than 0.3% and bring module power output up by 5 W to 10 W. Currently, most manufacturers are planning to adopt the technique, which is expected to become standard this year.
Development of the solar industry is closely tied with cost reduction, efficiency improvements, and reliability. The downturn in the industry may help drive an industrial transition and businesses may demonstrate their resilience through technological breakthroughs, paving ways for the industry’s “high-quality development.”

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/21/tidal-wave-of-investment-gives-queenslands-energy-transition-momentum/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,QUEENSLAND",EV FOLEY,2024-02-21,Tidal wave of investment gives Queensland’s energy transition momentum,"Called the Queensland’s Energy Transformation: From Coal Colossus to Renewable Energy Superpower report, its key findings show renewables are the fast-growing energy source in the state’s grid, on track for its coal fleet to retire by 2035. State government policy, the report concludes, is attracting billions in private sector investment into renewable energy infrastructure.
This month the Queensland government legislated a 75% emissions reduction by 2035, and net zero by 2050, complementing its ambition of 70% renewables by 2032 and 80% by 2035, earmarking 25 GW of zero-emissions generation and 40% of the total current National Electricity Market (NEM).

The 25 GW target capacity would result in over $45 billion of investment into large-scale clean energy generation, of which $21 billion will be from private capital, ensuring majority public market share, the report said.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has also identified 41 GW of utility scale wind and solar in the investment pipeline for Queensland, representing $73 billion of investment proposals from private developers, with state government investment in transmission projects to be $10.4 billion.
The state government is also investing $5 billion into CopperString, a 1,000 km high-voltage transmission highway connecting far north and west regional Queensland, to facilitate isolated communities to invest in grid-connected rooftop solar and batteries.

Rooftop solar, batteries, EV and heat pump regulatory and capital barriers need to be overcome, the report said, to incentivise uptake, but the state leads the way globally with the world’s highest penetration of rooftop solar at one in three households.
The price for rooftop solar in Queensland has halved in the past decade. Alongside this progress, lithium-ion batteries have seen cost declines of 90%.
The wider impact of the renewable energy adopting is having a positive impact on power prices. CEF finds that reduced exposure to fossil fuel prices and increased renewables penetration has seen wholesale electricity prices drop 38% to $79/megawatt hour in the fourth quarter 2023.
Tim Buckley, Director CEF, and report co-author said Queensland’s leverage of multibillion-dollar revenue from progressive coal royalties to reinvest in public infrastructure enabling the state’s decarbonisation is good policy.
“We are headed at last in the right direction, and it’s time to accelerate. Economies the world over are rapidly decarbonising. Global leader, China, is greening its economy at a staggering pace and the US government is investing US$1 trillion in the Inflation Reduction Act … now driving massive deployment of renewables, jobs, and GDP growth.”
The CEF is urging the government to commit another $100 billion to the energy transition in the May Federal Budget.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/21/raising-consumer-confidence-critical-to-energy-transition-finds-ey-report/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UNITED STATES",ANNE FISCHER,2024-02-21,"Raising consumer confidence critical to energy transition, finds EY report","From pv magazine USA
EY, the global professional services network, released the Energy transition consumer insights report, which finds that only one-third of consumers say they take more actions to improve the environmental sustainability of their lifestyle. With the energy transition upon us, authors of the EY report state that we are dependent on the other 70% for the success of the energy transition.
The EY team arrived at its findings after surveying nearly 100,000 residential energy consumers over a period of three years. These consumers included those who own homes, renters, bill payers and non-bill payers, and represented all ages and income levels.
The report indicates that the low level of consumer confidence in how much more they can do to make sustainable changes indicates that “consumer fatigue” has set in and that we must address this “energy apathy dilemma” immediately if the transition to clean energy is to be successful.
“US consumers are concerned about the costs and accessibility of clean energy options, underscoring the need for energy providers, regulators and policymakers to work together to progress carbon ambitions,” said Trey Thornton, EY Americas power & utilities leader. “Broad consumer action is the biggest driver for demand of lower-carbon and renewable energies, yet our research concludes not enough is being done to spur greater consumer adoption of these products.”
The findings
The report found that “energy apathy” is a common occurrence, as three-quarters of consumers say they’ve done as much as they can to be sustainable. EY research also revealed a decline in climate action on the part of corporations.
Affordability is a concern among those who are not planning to invest in sustainability. For 84% respondents, energy is a budgeted expense, and more than half (67%) indicate they can’t absorb a 10% increase in their energy bill.
Interest is not turning into action, yet, as two-thirds say they are interested in rooftop solar and electric vehicles (EVs), but they won’t invest in them in the next three years. Despite public policy, rebates, credits and other incentives, consumers are not engaging. For example, only 11% of say a heat pump is their first choice of investment in energy products and services planned over the next three years.
Despite the reluctance to invest in sustainable actions, 40% indicate that they don’t know what energy-related actions to take. Only 30% of US respondents are confident that they can access clean energy options and 31% are confident that their energy provider is providing value for them and the community. Furthermore, only one in four believe that the energy transition is fair and equitable. Low-income respondents and renters were found to be two to three times less likely to invest in new energy solutions.
The bottom line finding in the report is that those in the clean energy industries must shift the ways in which they engage with the consumer in order to help these consumers to make more sustainable choices.
The EY research concludes that consumers must have “affordable, accessible and appealing” energy options in order to take action toward their sustainable energy future. Some consumers distrust new technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and are skeptical of engaging in an all-electric lifestyle.
The report authors state that current approaches taken by the clean energy industries and other stakeholders are not effective or are not working fast enough. They call on energy providers, government and the broader energy ecosystem to make fast changes for the good of the energy transition.
“Energy providers can galvanize this change, transforming energy consumer engagement by first transforming themselves,” said the report. Providers must raise up the access, appeal and affordability of clean energy, and those that get it right will have helped to shape the clean energy future.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/21/bloombergnef-forecasts-global-solar-installations-to-hit-574-gw-in-2024/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,2024-02-21,BloombergNEF forecasts global solar installations to hit 574 GW in 2024,"From pv magazine global
PV installations could reach 574 GW in 2024, according to a new Global PV Outlook report from BloombergNEF. It said that new solar installations hit 444 GW in 2023, surpassing its previous forecast of around 413 GW.
The research firm said it also expects new global PV installations to reach 627 GW in 2025 and 672 GW in 2026, and then grow further to 718 GW in 2027 and 722 GW in 2028. For 2029 and 2030, it predicts annual PV growth of 820 GW and 880 GW, respectively.
These figures diverge substantially from those released by UK-based energy analysts Wood Mackenzie in January. It predicted flat annual average growth over the next eight years, bucking the trend of rapid growth over the last decade.
“The challenge in making forecasts is that if you keep predicting growth at current rates, you end up forecasting the entire world being covered with solar panels,” Jenny Chase, a solar analyst at BloombergNEF, told pv magazine. “Our 2030 forecast is already over 6.7 TW, well above BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario and relatively comparable with global power generation capacity of 8.5 TW at the end of 2022.”
Chase said that Portugal and Greece could generate 50% more electricity from solar by 2030 than the two countries did in 2022.
“At those levels, we will have negative feedback mechanisms, and those are what is really hard to predict,” she added. “Power will already be priced very low when the sun is out, and storage isn’t free – so why would anyone build more solar, at least at historical rates of growth? That’s what BNEF’s regional analysts have to grapple with now that solar is not small anymore, and it’s no wonder that they can seem like cowards. Forecasting that the future will be dramatically unlike the past is always difficult.”
