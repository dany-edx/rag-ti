CKP is one of the region’s largest generators of renewable electricity, and yesterday reported record-high revenues for 2021, driven largely by the sales of electricity from its Nam Mgum 2 Hydroelectric Power Plant. Strong results have led the company to earmark $111 million for renewables investment in 2022. 
CKP aims to invest the bulk of that war chest outside of Thailand and forecasts that within five years the company’s electricity generation will be entirely renewable.

“There are massive new opportunities arising from the disruptive global shift to renewables-based electricity,” says CKP managing director Thanawat Trisivavet. “Our position as one of the region’s largest renewables-based electricity producers enables us to leverage these emerging opportunities well, and, at the same time, contribute significantly to Thailand’s drive towards decarbonisation to tackle global warming.”

“We will increase our installed capacity to be 4,800MW by 2024 through six new electricity generating facilities in Thailand and the region,” continued Trivisvavet. “All of our new installed capacity will be based on renewables, including solar power, hydro power and wind power.”
Along with the ten-fold increase in solar, CKP is also planning to double its wind capacity, ensuring its supply is ready for the projected doubling of energy demand in Southeast Asia over the next 20 years. 
Currently CKP is currently linked to 29MW of installed solar capacity.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/23/australias-only-panel-manufacturer-enters-utility-market-with-world-beating-module/,"MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,WORLD",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 23, 2022",Australia’s only panel manufacturer enters utility market with ‘world beating’ module,"Adelaide-based Tindo Solar has today launched its first panel aimed at the utility-scale segment. Ahead of its product listing with the Clean Energy Council, the 545W Karra module was evaluated by TUV SUD Korea which found the panel actually generated 5 watts more than its rating.
Specifically, the engineers at TUV found Tindo’s utility-scale panel produced 549W of power at around 21% module efficiency and 23.1% cell efficiency, recording a 0.07% cell-to-module (CTM) loss.
The industry average energy efficiency of a solar module is between 17 and 19%, and the average CTM loss is 2-3%, Tindo noted.
The testing, Tindo said, found its 545W Karra module “one of the most efficient panels available in the world.”
The 545W panel is considerably larger than Tindo’s largest residential rooftop module, the 410W Karra, and is specifically designed to be used in utility-scale arrays, either on a rooftop or ground-mounted applications. It is 2283mm x 1149mm in size, weighs 29kg and includes a 25-year limited product warranty.
The 545W Karra panel will be available in commercial qualities from March 2022.
The panel was designed to coincide with its new production line in South Australia that uses the latest global standard for solar cells, the M10, Tindo said.
“Over the next decade there will be a steeper increase in demand for panels in large-scale projects than from our core market of rooftop retail and commercial,” Tindo Solar Chief Executive Officer, Shayne Jaenisch, said.
Jaenisch added the typical utility-scale panel used in Australia is imported and doesn’t require a Clean Energy Council (CEC) listing. Jaenisch said there was strong interest in Australia-made panels built for utility applications, which reflected concerns about performance but was also linked to waste going to landfill and forced labour in foreign supply chains.
“Many corporate owners of solar projects have internal policies about forced labour and they want some assurance about their supply chains,” Jaenisch said. “Our cells do not come from Uyghur Province and our suppliers were not named in the damming report on forced labour, In Broad Daylight. The modules are made at Mawson Lakes and we have an open-door policy – customers and regulators can come down and watch the panels being made.”
Tindo Solar
 “Owners of solar projects want a high-quality Australia-made option, and we now have a market-leading product we can sell them, made right here in Adelaide.”
Jaenisch said disused panels going to landfill is also against many organisations’ sustainability policies, which could be partly addressed with quality modules. “Large solar arrays use hundreds – even thousands – of panels, which don’t have to be registered with the CEC. They are low-cost and low-quality and they have a typical life of less than seven years. We’ve built a utility-scale panel to last 25 years and it will be listed by the CEC. We believe our approach aligns much better with sustainability policies and the broader goals of renewable energy.”
 Tindo Solar has a program to repurpose its second-hand panels for social and environmental initiatives, and last year formed a partnership with Adelaide-based Reclaim PV, which can recycle 98% of a solar panel.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/23/tasmanian-installer-convicted-and-two-agents-suspended-following-regulators-investigations/,"LEGAL,AUSTRALIA,TASMANIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 23, 2022",Tasmanian installer convicted and two agents suspended following Regulator’s investigations,"After growing its arsenal of solar fraud-detection tools and taking over as sole regulator of the federal solar scheme last year, the Clean Energy Regulator’s investigations have led to the prosecution of one Tasmanian solar installer and the suspension of two agents. Of the two suspended agents, ECA Energy Solutions lost its registration for one year while the second, Super Chief, has been permanently suspended.
Robert Andrew Camplin has been convicted of providing false or misleading information after he was found to have supplied a “false system owner signature” on a Small-scale Technology Certificate (STC) assignment form. STCs dictate the total rebate solar owners get from the government, and their fraudulent creation has been named by the Regulator as one of the key areas on which it will now crackdown.  
After the Regulator took its investigation into Camplin to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the 49-year-old Tasmanian solar panel installer was prosecuted in the Launceston Magistrates Court. He has entered into a recognisance of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for two years and was ordered to pay the court costs.
Camplin’s accreditation as a solar installer has been cancelled by the Clean Energy Council.
A spokesperson for the Clean Energy Council told pv magazine Australia that in instances “where we deem fit… the person may never re-apply for accreditation,” though it did not specify whether that would apply here.
Camplin appears to have been operating under an ABN he registered for ‘Camplin Electrical’ back in 2006, though he also registered the company name ‘Sunrise Solar and Storage’ in February 2021.
“We have zero tolerance for fraudulently created STCs whether through fraudulent signatures or false or misleading statements,” Piet Powell, the regulator’s General Manager Compliance told pv magazine Australia.
The Clean Energy Regulator has also suspended the registration and Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry accounts of two agents, saying it has found them “no longer fit and proper under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000.”
The first, ECA Energy Solutions Pty Ltd , has been suspended for one year from October  2021 after the Regulator found it provided false and misleading information to other registered agents who use that information to create STCs.
This is somewhat confusing since agents like ECA Energy Solutions are usually the final stop in certificate creation, using the information given to them by installers and retailers to create certificates. 
ECA Energy Solutions, however, also have a retail branch. It was in the company’s capacity as a retailer that it provided false and misleading information to other registered agents, the Regulator confirmed. 
The second, Super Chief Pty Ltd, has been permanently suspended after it was found to have created STCs that it was not entitled to create. The Regulator also found the company’s officers were previously involved in other companies that had been suspended from the scheme due to improper conduct, seemingly alluding to the practice of “phoenixing.”
“In the event that office holders of either ECA Energy or Super Chief attempt to re-enter the scheme through different companies we will take these suspensions into account and may refuse registration,” the Regulator said.
In December 2021, amendments to the  Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001 passed into law. The amendments were made in response to the Integrity Review of the Rooftop Solar PV Sector which was finally published in September of last year after months of delay. The review was requested by the Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, in August 2020.
Previously the regulatory structure of the Commonwealth’s Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme meant the Clean Energy Regulator was better positioned to pursue agents who created the STC certificates than installers and retailers which actually supplied the false information. This structure has now changed.
The Clean Energy Regulator is also now able to disqualify installers and designers, retailers and components from participating in the SRES scheme.
It has been holding webinars this month aimed at informing the industry about how to comply with the changes. From 1 April 2022, new requirements for solar retailers to provide written statements to agents claiming STCs will also be introduced.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/23/australias-biggest-steelmaker-refines-its-green-steel-plans/,"HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"FEBRUARY 23, 2022",Australia’s biggest steelmaker refines its green steel plans,"BlueScope Steel on Monday posted a first half profit of $1.64 billion, its highest since it split from BHP 20 years ago. In its announcement, the company, which has its steelworks in Port Kembla on the New South Wales south coast, laid out a plan to reline and upgrade its currently mothballed No. 6 Blast Furnace.
The company said it expects low-emissions steel to enjoy “significant take-up across the steel industry” into the 2040s, adding it expects breakthroughs in steelmaking technology will develop over the current and following decade.
In December, Bluescope announced it would partner with oil major Shell to investigate the design, construction and operation of a pilot-scale 10 MW renewable hydrogen electrolyser to explore and test the use of green hydrogen in the blast furnace at Port Kembla. The hydrogen could also potentially be used for other purposes, such as to feed a pilot direct reduced iron plant, the companies said at the time.
BlueScope said it is now transitioning to a full feasibility assessment of the reline and upgrade, which it expects will around $1 billion, up from the initial indicative range of $700-800 million. “The increase is due to both a broadening of the scope, including environmental upgrades,” the company said.

BlueScope didn’t give any specifics about whether the upgrade would enable the use of hydrogen in furnace No. 6, though it did note the furnace would secure its domestic ironmaking needs from 2026 and pointed to its 2050 net zero goal. “[This] provides a challenging but credible timeframe for the development, scaling and commercialisation of new low emissions technologies,” it said.
“The reline does not lock BlueScope in to blast furnace steelmaking for the full 20 years if technology is ready earlier. However, achieving this will be dependent on several enablers including access to low cost green hydrogen, firmed and affordable renewable energy, the development of suitable raw material supply chains and appropriate policy settings.”
The company plans to spend around $120 million on “long lead-time items” for the upgrade this financial year.
NSW government has declared BlueScope’s $1 billion upgrade a project of Critical State Significant Infrastructure. 
Just yesterday the company said it had become the first steelmaker in the southern hemisphere to be awarded a ResponsibleSteel certification.
Last year, the University of Newcastle’s Jessica Allen, an expert in low-emissions energy technologies and thermal transformations, and Tom Honeyhands, Director at the Centre of Ironmaking Materials Research, published a piece in The Conversation explaining that direct reduced iron technology offers the greatest opportunity for the use of green hydrogen.
The process currently accounts for less than 5% of steel production and often uses methane gas to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are then used to transform iron ore into iron.
Stahl-Zentrum/ArcelorMittal
Allen and Honeyhands wrote that, “up to 70% of the hydrogen derived from methane could be replaced with green hydrogen without having to modify the production process too much”, and added that development of a process using 100% green hydrogen as feedstock is under way.
Honeyhands and Allen point out that the green-hydrogen reduction method still produces CO2 emissions, and requires more electricity than the currently dominant blast-furnace method based on coking coal, but that its “overall emission intensity can be substantially lower”.
BlueScope and Rio Tinto, who also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) last year, said they plan to further process the iron ore reduced using green hydrogen “in an electric melter to produce metallic iron suitable to be finished into steel” — they say that, like the electricity used to power the hydrogen electrolysers, the electricity running the melter would also be sourced from renewables.
The steel sector today accounts for around 8% of all anthropomorphic CO2 emissions; and steel production is expected to grow by 25-30% by 2050.
Inspired by the success of the Hybrit consortium’s production of fossil-free iron in northern Sweden, a new “green steel” industry is rapidly emerging globally, Christian Roselund wrote in pv magazine’s January edition.
Hybrit and other projects have shown that the process of using hydrogen as a “reducing” agent to separate the oxygen from iron in iron ore is eminently practical, if you have inexpensive renewable power and local ore – which Australia does. 
Automakers like Mercedes Benz, Scania, and Volvo have all lined up to buy “green steel,” despite its higher cost. 
Currently Europe is leading the green steel charge, though projects in China are also kicking off.
With Australia moving to become a hydrogen heavyweight (our project pipeline second to none), experts have pointed out that using hydrogen to create green steel and other industrial downstream products is among the best ways for the country to capture the most profit from the future fuel.
BlueScope steel will also be involved in developing a hydrogen hub in the Illawarra, which has been flagged as a priority site by the state government along with the northern Hunter Region.

India and Australia have agreed to jointly work towards reducing the cost of new and renewable energy technologies and scaling up deployment to accelerate global emissions reduction. 
The two sides signed a letter of intent (LoI) in this regard during the 4th India – Australia Energy Dialogue, co-chaired by India’s Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy, R.K. Singh, and Australia’s Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor.
The focus of this LoI will be scaling up the manufacture and deployment of ultra-low-cost solar and “clean” hydrogen.
“Clean hydrogen,” a term frequently used by the Morrison government, refers to hydrogen made from fossil fuels where emissions are claimed to be captured by carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. It is otherwise known as blue hydrogen, and not to be confused with green or renewable hydrogen.*
Energy transition was a major area of discussion in the dialogue and both the energy ministers spoke in detail about the ongoing energy transition activities in their respective countries with a focus on renewables, energy efficiency, storage, electric vehicles, critical minerals, mining, etc. The Indian side also highlighted the need for climate finance for meeting the energy transition goals of developing countries.
The two sides agreed on a forward action plan for areas like energy efficiency technologies; grid management; R&D collaboration on flue gas desulphurisation, biomass or hydrogen co-firing, water cycle optimisation, renewables integration, batteries, and electric mobility.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/02/23/100mw-of-modules-detained-in-the-us-under-hoshine-wro-released/,"LEGAL,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,POLICY,UNITED STATES",PV MAGAZINE,"FEBRUARY 23, 2022",100MW of modules detained in the US under Hoshine WRO released,"From pv magazine USA
Hundreds of detained shipping containers housing roughly 100MW of LONGi solar modules have been released, reports ROTH Capital Partners in an industry note.
On top of the 100MW of LONGi modules released, ROTH also believes that Trina has had the vast majority of its detained product released, if not all of it entirely.
The modules were originally detained under the Withhold Release Order (WRO) applied to silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. (Hoshine) and its subsidiaries, which was instituted after Customs and Border Patrol identified two indicators of forced labour during its investigation of Hoshine.
The action was taken under Section 1307 of the Tariff Act. Section 1307 prohibits the importation of merchandise mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced or indentured labour, including forced child labour. Such merchandise is subject to exclusion and seizure, and may lead to criminal investigation of the imported goods.
ROTH believes that LONGi may still have more detained product, and the outlook following the release has been mixed, with the industry note describing the release as “a step forward toward more product for utility scale projects that are desperately needing modules.”
Just how big of a step it will be still has yet to be determined. ROTH believes this month’s round of anti-circumvention cases being filed against Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and now Cambodia casts a shadow over the ability for LONGi and Trina to actually restart their facilities in SE Asia and to ship to the U.S.
One of the signers of the most recent petition, Auxin Solar, claims that Chinese manufacturers are shipping cells to the aforementioned countries to avoid paying tariffs that have been in place since 2012.
ROTH said under this case, all crystalline-silicon modules from each of the four countries could be subject to a tariff. Unlike the first case, this one is designed to be focused on entire countries, rather than specific companies. This new petition adds Cambodia, as Auxin claimed Chinese companies were moving operations to the country in anticipation of tariffs. Historically, Cambodia contributes less than 3% of all US C-Si module imports.
ROTH also outlines that remaining uncertainty over how the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will be implemented only compounds the difficulty for  LONGi and Trina to re-establish their manufacturing and shipping processes for the US market. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would ban all imports from the Chinese region of Xinjiang unless the products are determined to not be connected to forced labour, a time-consuming and costly process.
