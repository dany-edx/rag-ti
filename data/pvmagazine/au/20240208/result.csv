The GPS requires NT solar farms operate in a scheduled way, sustaining the exported power at their dispatch target during each dispatch interval, which has left some existing, non-compliant NT solar farms unused.
Victor Depoorter Managing Director Proa said the company’s technology offers hope to solar farms in the Northern Territory sitting idle since the strict government regulations were imposed.
“Proa’s system, as well as all the experience we have accumulated at the Defence sites, could help to get these sites up and running. We have a proven track record of cracking complex problems and creating innovative solutions in the energy industry,” he said.
The 3.2 MW RAAF Base Darwin and 11 MW Robertson Barracks solar farms can act like scheduled gas, coal, or hydro generators, being able to deliver to exact energy export commitments.
“The farms completely manage the uncertainty and variability of their generation caused by clouds, bad weather or scheduled outages, backed with small battery energy storage systems (BESS), and our intelligent proprietary tools act as the brain of the Defence sites, making decisions dynamically on how much can be offered to the market,” Depoorter said.
“For example, when there is the risk of clouds causing sudden ramps in the electricity generation, our system will pre-curtail the plant to a safe level that could be ‘firmed’ with the support of the onsite BESS.”
The system includes a high redundancy design and failover mechanisms to ensure 99.99% availability for the “brain” of a power plant, he said.
Commissioned on Feb. 1, the 9,000-panel, 3.2 MW RAAF Base Darwin solar project, located 8 km from Darwin city is the first of five large-scale solar generators connected to the Darwin-Katherine electricity network which has achieved commercial dispatch of energy at 100% of the plant’s capacity.
Djuna Pollard Chief Executive Officer Power and Water, the NT electricity provider, said they are working closely with Defence on other renewables projects.
“We are pleased to be working closely with Defence on other renewables projects, as well as a number of other large scale solar generator projects in the Northern Territory, and look forward to continuing this collaborative relationship,” Pollard said.
The Australian Government is investing $13 million (USD$8.5 million) in solar energy generation and BESS’s at five Defence sites across the Northern Territory, which include Tindal, Larrakeyah Barracks, and Harts Range, as part of the nationwide Defence Renewable Energy and Energy Security Program.
Robertson Barracks, 15 km from Darwin, is a 27,000-panel, 11 MW solar farm and 2.5 MW BESS, scheduled to come online later this year.
The Northern Territory Government has a target of 50% of electricity consumed in 2030 from grid connected installations, including all Aboriginal communities supplied by Indigenous Essential Services to be sourced from renewable energy by 2030, which forms a key part of the Northern Territory Climate Change Response: Towards 2050.

Super Bowl LVIII will pit the Kansas City Chiefs against the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, February 11. This will be the first Super Bowl that takes place in Allegiant Stadium, home of the Raiders, which is 100% powered by renewable energy.
A 100% renewable sports stadium is no easy feat. During a game, an NFL sports stadium can use as much as 10 MW of power for five hours, or 50 MWh. Electric utility NV Energy told a CBS reporter that 10 MW is roughly the equivalent consumption of 46,000 homes.
Allegiant Stadium is taking an all-kinds approach to its sustainability and renewable energy goals. Solar energy is the dominant renewable energy source for the Las Vegas Raiders stadium, whose organization in 2019 entered a 25-year energy supply agreement with NV Energy to purchase generation from an off-site solar array managed by the utility.
The stadium subscribes to a portion of a massive 621,000 solar panel system that also has supply contracts with some of the resorts on the Las Vegas strip.

The solar supply deal took a two-stage approach in which the facility purchases power from the wholesale market, with excess capacity purchased from NV Energy’s current fleet of power plants. Beginning in the second half of 2023, new off-site renewable energy and energy storage facilities will reach commercial operations, and the stadium will source power from these new sites.
The $1.9 billion state-of-the-art stadium has taken many other measures for energy efficiency and emissions reduction. The building is LEED Gold certified, and additionally sources electricity from hydroelectric dams, geothermal energy and wind power.
Other Raiders and Allegiant Stadium sustainability measures include:
“It has been and will continue to be our mission to develop and improve sustainable policies that reduce our environmental footprint while bringing world-class concerts, sporting events, and corporate events to Las Vegas,” said Chris Wright, general manager, Allegiant Stadium.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/02/08/rooftop-solars-success-results-in-struggling-large-scale-segment/,"INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",JONATHAN GIFFORD,2024-02-08,Rooftop solar’s success results in “struggling” large-scale segment,"There’s no doubting that Australian rooftop solar installations are on a tear and showing few signs of letting up. Green Energy Markets’ data show that rooftop installations grew 14% in 2023, to 3.14 GW – only 65 MW less than 2021, the record-setting year for rooftop PV installs.
While that is good news for the distributed generation segment, and for householders making savings on their electricity bills, it is leaving little room in the market for utility-scale solar. And, energy economist Bruce Mountain observes, increasingly it is putting the squeeze on wind.
“Rooftop solar has pulled prices down during all of the time that large scale solar has a market to the level that without storage, large scale solar is going to battle for grid supply,” Mountain told pv magazine Australia. “For grid supply, certainly in South Australia and Victoria, it [large scale solar] is struggling.
Mountain says that current prospects in Queensland is better for solar farm development, but that investors will have seen how quickly daylight wholesale prices have declined in South Australia and Victoria and would be reluctant to invest.
“Even though you’re not yet seeing the same wholesale price effects in Queensland, I think investors are likely to anticipate it.”
Installation data confirms the observation. Solar consultancy SunWiz found that while the rooftop PV segment remains strong, the large-scale is lagging. In 2023, Sunwiz found 10 new solar farms were completed, for a capacity of 1.1 GW – 60% down on the 2.9 GW completed in 2022.
Rooftop solar percentages of total daytime demand tell much of the tale. During summer, rooftop PV is already supplying more than 100% of grid-demand during much of the day in SA, and 135% at midday. In Victoria, those numbers come in at 35% and 42% respectively, figures that are still hugely impactful for large-scale solar project development.

On electricity markets, Mountain notes, one impact has been to squeeze wind generation from the market during peak solar production periods. When generation is annualised, the solar generation (dotted yellow) profile in VIC (left) and SA (right) in 2023 resulted in wind generators being squeeze out of the market at the times of peak production (dotted green).
While difficult for wind projects and developments, this market development leaves little room for solar farms.
“The economics will be solar-plus-storage versus wind. Wind will spill during the middle of the day as we’re seeing now, but it has decent production through the sea breeze, pretty consistently year-round – so it gets the evening peak pretty consistently without the need for storage.”
There do, however, remain opportunities for large-scale solar in the short term, says Mountain. “It probably still has a standalone market for mines and off grid supply and new supplies cause its economics fundamentally are very attractive – it’s very cheap and forecastable and all of those things.”

The project was approved only four months after its submission to council. It also came a month before Northern Midlands Council also approved the construction of the TasRex 288 MW Northern Midlands Solar Farm (NMSF).
The Palmerston BESS will sit adjacent to the NMSF which will also include a DC-coupled battery sized at 345.9 MW / 691.7 MWh BESS. It is also located close to the overhead 15 km 220 kV transmission line, connecting the farm to the nearby Palmerston Substation.
Council documents reveal that the Akaysha-owned BESS will comprise two dedicated areas on site, with multiple lithium-ion battery units connected in series. The batteries systems are the 3 MWh Tesla Megapack containerised unit. It will also include a 33 kV underground reticulation, also to the Palmerston Substation.
Cogency Australia, a climate change focussed consultancy that prepared Akaysha’s submission to council, announced the news on LinkedIn last week, highlighting a successful community engagement program, which saw no objection to the project, the consultancy reports.
“The BESS project did not receive work, objections and slated the swift approvals down to robust design, detailed technical work and comprehensive stakeholder engagement,” a Cogency spokesperson said.
Council concluded the proposed use and development of the Palmerston BESS will contribute to the Northern Midlands Council and Tasmania’s social, economic and climate goals, including the 200% Tasmanian Renewable Energy Target (TRET) by supporting the continued expansion of the local economy and increased renewable energy generation.
“By providing support for the further integration of renewable energy resources into the electricity grid, the Palmerston BESS proposal can support climate change action through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector,” the council papers said.
