At the gateway to the Simpson Desert, William Creek has a population of just 50 but hosts approximately 26,000 tourists each year. Previously the town was 100% reliant on diesel generation but is now powered by a 200 kW ground-mounted solar array coupled with a 280 kWh battery energy storage system.
Juice Capital, which financed the project as part of a long-term commercial power purchase agreement (PPA), said the off-grid system, which went live in November 2022, has supported in the town’s ambition to be self-sufficient and sustainable while significantly reducing its power bill.
Juice Capital Commercial Sales Manager Dan Howard said the town’s previous diesel-generated power was priced at approximately $1.20 per kWh. Now the town purchases its electricity for $0.287 per kWh.
“We are really proud of this project as it has bridged a gap between the outback and grid-connected towns,” he said. “Communities like William Creek have been left to fend for themselves when it comes to delivering their own energy.”
“To power a town like this using only diesel was expensive. They now have an option.”

Designed and developed in conjunction with Adelaide-headquartered engineering firm MyEnergy, the William Creek renewable energy system comprises 330 Trina solar modules and 135 kVa of Victron Energy Quattro inverters DC coupled using Victron 450/200 smart solar chargers and AC coupled using Fronius International ECO inverters. This is partnered with 280 kWh of energy storage provided by Pylon Technologies’ US5000 batteries. The system is remotely controlled using technology provided by Victron Energy.
Howard said one of the key challenges associated with the William Creek project was the “sheer remoteness” of the location.
“William Creek is one of the most remote communities in Australia,” he said. “There is over 300 kilometres of dirt road to get there.”

Juice Capital will own, operate, and maintain the solar and battery power plant on behalf of William Creek for the life of the asset which is one of a growing portfolio the company has throughout Australia.
The Sydney-headquartered company said it has more than 350 on-site solar power plants with a combined capacity of more than 15 MW operating on commercial business sites in all states and territories.
Howard said the company’s solutions include solar systems, grid energy, storage and emerging energy technologies.
“Our customers are SME’s, farmers, hospitality, and a broad range of service businesses,” he said. “We help business reduce their carbon footprint, save money and work toward their net zero goals without the use of their own capital.”

The virtual power plant (VPP), installed and operated by Shell Energy in partnership with the state government, has been designed to aggregate the battery storage units to help stabilise demand and supply on the electricity grid.
Department of Planning and Environment deputy secretary Leon Walker said the batteries will store excess solar output and feed up to 1,280 kWh of energy back into the electricity network during peak demand periods.
“This is enough energy to keep up to 1,000 household air-conditioners running on a hot summer day when the electricity grid is under stress,” he said.
“So far, 13 of our regional commercial office sites have installed the new batteries, with the final three due to be installed and switched on by June.”
Shell Energy Australia Chief Executive Officer Greg Joiner said the VPP has been designed to coordinate multiple battery storage units that can be simultaneously dispatched, helping PDNSW to optimise its renewable energy assets while contributing to a cleaner and more resilient power system.
“Shell Energy has developed a solution that will enable PDNSW to participate in and realise value from a rapidly decarbonising and digitised energy system,” he said.

The costs of the project have been jointly funded by PDNSW and the NSW Office of Energy and Climate Change’s Smart Batteries for Key Government Buildings initiative.
The latter initiative was established to support the installation of battery energy storage solutions at schools, hospitals and other government buildings with rooftop solar systems.
Shell Energy has a $3.2 billion long-term retail contract with the NSW government to supply the electricity needs for state-owned hospitals, schools and other buildings.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said the 10-year 1.8 TWh per annum electricity retailing contract, announced in 2021, will play a key role in supporting the state government’s plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
“The NSW government is the second biggest energy customer in the state and we are using our purchasing power to leverage new dispatchable capacity to help power our schools, hospitals, traffic lights and tunnels,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/03/oil-and-gas-companies-needed-to-make-green-hydrogen-a-reality/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 3, 2023",Oil and gas companies needed to make green hydrogen a reality,"The current energy crisis has handed these oil and gas companies windfall profits. In fact, BP hit profits of $40 billion (USD 26.9 billion) last year, while scaling back its green ambitions.
But these companies are not just going to disappear. Even after we stop burning oil in engines, we will need oil and gas as raw materials for plastics, glues, solvents, industrial chemicals and fertilisers. Eventually, we’ll find greener alternatives. But that will take decades.
Are they the enemy? They’ve certainly done a lot to slow down the shift to clean energy. But this will – and is – changing. Inside some of these companies, people know change will have to come. The companies which embrace their role as broader energy and chemical companies will make the transition first.
We’ll also need their expertise and ability to handle uncertainty, risk and large projects to make green hydrogen and green chemicals a reality.
In the last few years, BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil have announced net-zero climate pledges.
They've spent millions of dollars advertising their investments in clean energy.
Last week, all 3 companies changed up those plans and said they are doubling down on fossil fuels.

If you’ve been following climate change discussion, you’ll have noticed plans to phase out coal crop up a lot more often than plans to phase out oil and gas.
That’s because – for now – we’re much more reliant on these hydrocarbons. Firmed solar and wind can now take up the slack as ageing coal plants retire. But we’re still a way off being able to avoid burning oil or gas for transport or in industrial processes.
That means these companies will be with us for decades yet. But over time, they will think of themselves less as fossil fuel extractors and more as energy and chemical conglomerates, where oil and gas is a smaller part of what they do.
You’re right to be sceptical. But there are legitimate signs of change.
Shell just bought into a green hydrogen megaproject in Oman, for instance, where it will be the lead operator. Late last year, BP bought a controlling stake in Australia’s largest renewable project, the Asian Renewable Energy Hub. If built in its entirety, this project would generate the equivalent of a third of Australia’s 2020 electricity production.

Hydrogen is tricky. The lightest element can diffuse through many materials and escape. That makes storage and transport difficult.
But oil and gas companies are experienced in handling hydrogen. That’s because it’s widely used in oil refineries to scrub sulphur out of oil and to help crack heavy oil into lighter grades. In fact, it’s so useful that most of the world’s hydrogen is used in oil production. At present, hydrogen is usually made by breaking up natural gas, which means it contributes to global heating.
But if we can figure out how to cheaply extract hydrogen from seawater, this green hydrogen could sub in for fossil gas. For this to happen, we’ll need oil and gas majors on board. The realities of green hydrogen would be daunting for most companies. Pipelines to transport it. Ways of storing it. Tankers to ship it across the sea. Heavy engineering projects with a high capital expenditure.

Oil and gas companies have had to pioneer a great deal of new technology to keep the fuel coming, given how much oil and gas has already been tapped, shipped and burned. Take fracking, which was invented out of necessity. Or the ability to drill for oil underneath kilometres of seawater in places like the North Sea.
To have a chance of getting to net zero by 2050, we’ll need scale. If green hydrogen or ammonia is to actually be useful, we need lots of it.
Not all oil companies are the same. Some will keep drilling for oil as long as there is demand. And state-owned oil companies such as Saudi Arabia’s Aramco are the main source of their country’s wealth. It’s hard to see them changing.

But some will move to grasp the future. Many people inside these companies can see very clearly where the world is going – and the risk of going extinct if they do not reinvent themselves. The first movers are likely to benefit the most, if they use their advantages to help the transition.
At present, oil and gas companies make money by drilling, processing and selling oil and gas to burn in engines. But as the clean energy transition gathers pace, there will be new opportunities.
If one major oil company figures out how to do green hydrogen at scale, they could take advantage of their integrated corporate network, from production to transport to service stations or other consumer points. Others might move into synthetic aviation fuel, or specialise in swapping LNG tankers for hydrogen vessels.
Even after you displace dirty fuels from transport and power sectors, there are many areas left over, such as chemical manufacturing.
Without fertilisers, we would have much lower yields from our farms. It’s estimated the equivalent of half the world’s population relies on food made possible by synthetic fertilisers. These come from natural (fossil) gas.
Similarly, paints, varnishes, glues and plastics currently need hydrocarbons as a feedstock. To replace these means changing the whole chain.
Just last week, the European Union hit the symbolic target of EU€100 ($157) per tonne of carbon.
As carbon prices rise, it makes fossil fuel projects less attractive – and will make the economics of many marginal projects in renewables, green chemicals and hydrogen work.
You and I and most people alive have benefited from the intense energy stored in fossil fuels. They’ve underpinned the huge advances in our economies and technologies for over a century. But now the costs are plain. So let’s use all the tools we have available – even those wielded by climate villains like oil and gas companies.

ClearVue’s solar glazing technology solution features PV cells around the edges of each IGU. The units incorporate a nanoparticle interlayer and spectral-selective coating on the rear external surface which allow much of the light to pass through but redirects infrared and UV light to the edge of the IGU where it is harvested by solar cells.
The 12-month study will assess the optical properties, energy harvesting and energy efficiency of ClearVue’s solar glass technology that aims to preserve glass transparency to maintain building aesthetics whilst generating renewable power on site, improving building energy efficiency and ultimately helping to reduce overall carbon emissions of the built environment.
ClearVue Executive Chairman Victor Rosenberg said the properties of the company’s technology will be compared against existing conventional glazing and the data used to determine the suitability and value of the technology for potential use in other Hong Kong government buildings.
“The selection of the ClearVue product by the EMSD for completing this study is testament to how the ClearVue product is now being seen globally – that is, as one of only a few commercially available glazing products that, in addition to offering power generation on site, genuinely offers a compelling energy efficiency solution for advanced building envelope design,” he said.
The initiative marks the first sale of the company’s technology into the Hong Kong market and while the agreement provides no guarantee of future sales, ClearVue is confident that the findings of the study will generate sales.
ClearVue said EMSD endorsement is a prerequisite for government engagement in Hong Kong.
The announcement of the Hong Kong study is the latest of ClearVue’s moves in the Southeast Asia market. It comes after the company signed a letter of intent with Cambodia’s AZ Group and its subsidiary MyWindows that sets the framework for a distribution arrangement for Cambodia and Laos.
The intent is for the parties to enter into a supply and purchase agreement, with ClearVue to initially supply AZ Group with the company’s glazing products to explore project opportunities in Cambodia, Laos and nearby markets.
ClearVue said if the arrangement is successful, the two companies will work towards a joint venture or full manufacturing and distribution licence.

The Smart Energy Schools Pilot Project kicked off in 2020 as a testing ground to find the most effective way to deploy renewable energy across NSW public schools. The first two stages of the project tested the use of solar and battery storage systems along with Virtual Power Plant (VPP) technology across NSW public schools.
In Stage 2 of the program, 18 schools will receive solar-plus-storage and join the government’s VPP trial – set to begin by mid-2023. Some of the newest solar recipients include Ballina High School, Hurstville Public School and Georges River College Oatley Senior Campus.
A total of 79 schools are now up and running in the program.
Minister for Education and Early Learning Sarah Mitchell said the solar installations from the first stage of the program have already generated more than 460 MWh of energy, enough to keep the lights on at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Melbourne Cricket Ground for a full year.
“These solar systems have also helped reduce the schools’ electricity costs by almost $100,000 (USD 67,200) and cut carbon emissions from electricity supply by more than 50%,” said Mitchell.
Until March 7. 2023, the NSW government will be open to Expressions of Interest (EOI) for proposals to finance, deliver and operate renewable energy systems across 2,200 public schools; in addition to the 1,500 NSW public schools which already host existing solar.
“We want to maximise the role our schools play in delivering a renewable energy solution,” continued Mitchell. ”
