The industry-led National Energy Resources Australia (NERA) committed $1.85 million in February to establish a network of 15 regional clusters across all states and territories designed to establish Australia’s global identity in hydrogen technology and expertise .
“Technology clusters are geographic concentrations of interconnected businesses and organisations in a particular field, that both collaborate and compete to increase productivity and innovation,” NERA said at the time.
Startupbootcamp Australia will lead the Greater Geelong Hydrogen Technology Cluster and has plans to identify collaboration opportunities and projects within the hydrogen sector which, according to a 2019 Deloitte report, could increase the national GDP by up to $26 billion.
Startupbootcamp Australia CEO Trevor Townsend said the cluster will focus on helping decarbonise sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, energy, and transportation to create a market for hydrogen.
“It’s our firm belief that this hydrogen technology cluster will not only deliver economic benefits to the Greater Geelong and Barwon South West region but also put it on the map globally as a centre of innovation and technology in the growing international hydrogen economy,” he said.
“Our focus will be on commercialising hydrogen and building a market by prioritising projects and collaboration with corporates, start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs.”

Townsend said the Geelong Cluster would waste no time with Expressions of Interest from parties looking to participate in the ecosystem to open on June 8, 2021. They will remain open until the end of the financial year.
“We will be seeking innovative demand-side projects in the region and looking for supply-side interest to participate in these trials or projects,” he said.
Townsend said the goal for the cluster is to create 100 start-ups and to move hydrogen projects up through the technology, commercialisation and investment readiness levels.
“The cluster is by design a way to improve collaboration among its supporters and help bridge the gap between the desire of companies to reduce their carbon footprint and the action to do so,” he said.
“Alongside our goal to develop the demand side, we’re looking to develop a hydrogen innovation economy, creating a global exporter of hydrogen innovation and business models alongside the commodity itself.”
The Greater Geelong Cluster is one of four hydrogen technology clusters planned for Victoria. The Clayton Hydrogen Cluster centres on Port Anthony in the state’s east while the Mallee Hydrogen Technology Cluster covers the north west of Victoria. The Gippsland Hydrogen Cluster will help identify new hydrogen-focussed technologies in the state’s south east.

Victorian Minister for Energy Lily D’Ambrosio, who officially opened the Greater Geelong Cluster on Friday, said it will help the state to play a leading role in the development of Australia’s hydrogen industry.
“Industries like hydrogen from renewables have huge potential, not only to boost power supply and reliability, but to create jobs locally and tackle climate change globally,” she said.
“Our four Regional Hydrogen Technology Clusters will enable Victoria to take the lead in developing a hydrogen industry that will benefit the state’s regional economies such as Greater Geelong.”
The launch of the Geelong Cluster comes just days after the addition of both the Gladstone and Toowoomba clusters in Queensland to the national network.
As part of the launch, Startupbootcamp also unveiled the H2 StartupBase platform which maps the hydrogen start-ups around the world.
Startupbootcamp’s energy program director Abs Bulbuliya said the H2 StartupBase is a valuable platform that will help accelerate and connect hydrogen start-ups locally, nationally and internationally with projects and customers.
The platform, which will continue to grow, already features more than 3,500 hydrogen related start-ups and organisations from around the world.

West Australian Alannah MacTiernan addressed the crowd Wednesday morning, saying she wants to see her state producing 10 GW of green hydrogen in the next 10 years. While she acknowledged big “10 GW plus” projects are unlikely to get off the ground before 2027, she was adamant that by then momentum would be on West Australia’s side.
“Certainly our aspiration is that we think we could do 200 GW by 2040,” she said. Putting that massive number into context, she noted the total size of the stationary energy market in Australia is only about 70 GW.
“But if we’re going to become a big exporter, we’ve got to be producing some big numbers,” MacTiernan said.
MacTiernan also noted this push towards hydrogen, primarily green hydrogen, was “to a very large extent” driven by customers who are “demanding accountability.”
Western Australia is one of the world’s largest natural gas exporters, commanding around 13% of total world supply. In the last year, major offtakers like Japan and South Korea have committed to net-zero emissions and with that solidified a “green hydrogen future,” MacTiernan said.
Repeating the mantra, ‘the customer is always right,’ MacTiernan noted Australia not only has a moral imperative to decarbonise but it also has a business imperative.
The minister said that while natural gas exports may not be the state’s longterm future, they have set Western Australia up with the foundations it needs to pursue its greener hydrogen future. MacTiernan said the plan is to “capitalise” on the state’s store of skills and expertise built from natural gas production and direct this towards hydrogen.
MacTiernan was not the only minister spruiking such a plan though. Speaking via video-link on Thursday, Victorian Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Lily D’Ambrosio, also pointed to her state’s gas use.

Victoria has the highest household gas use of anywhere in Australia, she said. Decarbonising this sector is seen as one of Victoria’s biggest challenges. “I prefer to see it as having the biggest opportunity for us,” D’Ambrosio said.
Because of its high gas use, Victoria also has an extensive gas pipeline network – one which D’Ambrosio, like so many at the conference, wants to see filled with hydrogen.
“It’s an exciting time for those with the foresight to capitalise,” D’Ambrosio said, also leaning strongly into a narrative around reusing workforce expertise and knowledge bases stemming from natural gas.
The Victorian minister concluded by imploring international investors to understand they have a “friend and collaborator in the Victorian government.”
Queensland’s Minister for Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen, Mick de Brenni, also presented via video link. Like Western Australia, his state is home to a sizeable hydrogen project pipeline. He acknowledged that to get the infant industry off the ground, significant government investment would be required.
New South Wales’ Minister for Energy and Environment, Matt Kean, South Australian Minister for Energy and Mining, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, and Tasmania’s Minister for Energy, Guy Barnett, all addressed the conference too, similarly painting their states as future hydrogen leaders.
Endeavour Energy
While there could be little doubt about almost all of Australia’s state governments’ drive for hydrogen, talk is, as they say, cheap. Former prime minister Malcom Turnbull did not dance around this point when he addressed the conference Wednesday morning. “We need to [actually] get some big projects underway.”
He called Australian governments’ current hydrogen investments “very modest by international standards.”
Where Australian governments are pledging millions, Germany, for instance, has committed €9 billion (more than AU$14 billion). “We have to get on and do it,” Turnbull said of seizing Australia’s hydrogen potential.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/28/australia-experiences-never-seen-before-level-of-collaboration-with-hydrogen/,"EVENTS,HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 28, 2021",Australia experiences ‘never seen before’ level of collaboration with hydrogen,"Speaking at the Australian Hydrogen Conference held Wednesday and Thursday in Sydney, Larry Marshall, Chief Executive of the CSIRO, said the collaboration he’s witnessing around hydrogen is of a level “which Australia really hasn’t seen before.”
On Wednesday, the CSIRO launched its new $68 million Hydrogen Industry Mission (Mission) with the aim of driving the cost of hydrogen production to under $2 per kilogram to get Australia in the driver’s seat of the global hydrogen economy by 2030. Marshall said the Mission builds on decade of research conducted by the CSIRO and its partners.
Since taking the helm of the CSIRO, Marshall said he had “doubled then doubled again” the nation science agency’s hydrogen investments.
Coinciding with this journey towards hydrogen, Marshall said the CSIRO had also greatly expanded its partnerships, doubling the number of industry and research partners it has in the last five years. Today the CSIRO is working with about 3000 parters, he said.
Together with these partners, the CSIRO is now working on over 100 projects which Marshall said are “aimed at showing that a breakthrough is possible in areas previously thought to be show-stoppers for hydrogen.”

Without “giving away the game,” Marshall said some of the agency’s current endeavours include trying to create hydrogen and ammonia under ambient temperature and pressure. There is also a strong alliance between hydrogen research and agricultural food teams happening at the agency, with the potential to “revolutionise” agriculture.
“Solving the seemingly impossible with science harnesses every single branch of science and engineering and technology that your national science agency has,” Marshall said. “It reaches from artificial intelligence to predict the right alloys to mix to enable the hydrogen cracker, to social science to predict human behaviour and how we might more rapidly drive the change, and every branch of physical science, engineering and technology in between.”
Marshall said hydrogen holds particular promise as, in his experience, changing behaviour is one of the hardest parts of new technology uptake. Since hydrogen is a physical substance which can works as a fuel, he described it as having a significant leg up on this front.
The CSIRO, Marshall said, had worked with aviation giant Boeing on its National Hydrogen Roadmap, which is an industry for which hydrogen holds great potential. “Industry needs fuel,” Marshall said.
Marshall sees hydrogen as supplementing aviation fuel by 2035, and replacing it entirely by 2050.

The combined entity will be named Tritium. A SPAC is a company with no commercial operations formed to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO).
Founded in Brisbane in 2001 by David Finn, James Kennedy and Paul Sernia, Tritium designs, develops and manufactures fast-charging DC technology for EVs.
The company said it has already secured a sales and support footprint in 41 countries across four continents and has provided more than 2.7 million high-power charging sessions, delivering more than 55 GWh of energy.
Tritium chief executive officer Jane Hunter said the DCRN transaction announced this week will allow Tritium to invest in a new production facility in Europe, expand its existing site in California and further develop the Brisbane facilities where the company is headquartered.
“We have offices in Amsterdam, we have offices in Los Angeles, and then we have the headquarters in Australia, and we have factories and warehouses at each of those sites,” she said.
“We will beef up production in Los Angeles and will open a new factory in Europe to service that market because that is 70% of our revenue (and) we will continue to build out of Brisbane to service the Asia-Pacific region.”
The former Boeing executive said Tritium is already servicing an extensive list of customers including Shell, BP, BMW and Ionity which has the largest fast-charging DC network across Europe.

“The majority of our customers are currently charge point operators, they’re the ones who operate a fleet of charge points, followed by that it’s probably fuel and utilities so it’s a very diverse customer base,” Hunter said.
“In terms of expansion, we just want to continue to capture those top tier customers and compete at that global level and have that blue-chip customer base.”
While the DCRN deal has provided a financial windfall for Tritium, Hunter admitted the company is “not currently profitable”.
“It’s been a company that’s been in start-up mode really for the last four to five years,” she said.
“So very typical company, from start-up seed funding into growth funding and now this next stage of our growth into becoming a global corporation.
“We’ve had investment to date of around $160 million and that investment has really been used to fund growth so we have a global footprint.
“You have to spend up money to get to where we get to and what we see is that in early 2023 we will be positive EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and free cash flow so we’re not too far off that.”
Image: Tritium
Hunter said Tritium is now ideally positioned to benefit from accelerating and sustained long-term growth of the global passenger EV market, which is projected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 20% through 2040.
Global EV charging hardware sales are projected to have an average CAGR of more than 25% each year over this period.
The company’s intellectual property includes the world’s only fully liquid-cooled, IP65-rated charger, providing customers with technology that is ingress-protected and sealed from outside elements, thus reducing the total cost of ownership.
“The accelerated electrification of the transport sector globally is now underway and has extraordinary implications beyond the benefits to individual consumers,” Hunter said.
“Our industry is essential to achieving global emission reduction targets both through increased adoption of electric vehicles and the deployment of EVs for mass energy storage technology.
“As batteries on wheels, EVs will help pave the way for more renewable power to be introduced into national energy mixes.”
DCRN chairman Robert Tichio, who will join the board of directors of the combined company at the close of the transaction, said Tritium’s demonstrated track record will allow it to maintain and expand its position as a market leader in the charging hardware space.
“The company has developed an incredible team of more than 340 employees on four continents and a diversified base of blue-chip customers, while positioning Tritium to be the leader in DC fast charging as the adoption of electric vehicles continues to accelerate,” he said.

The company said the Woodside Power Project would be developed on the Burrup Peninsular and would comprise more than 210,000 solar panels, making it one of the largest solar projects in Western Australia.
While the project is only in its formative stages, Woodside said it has already completed environmental, geotechnical and engineering studies and is progressing key stakeholder consultations ahead of seeking regulatory approvals for the power project.
Woodside acting chief executive Meg O’Neill said the company was looking to capitalise on the region’s “world-class renewable energy resources” and the willingness of industry, government and other key stakeholders to co-operate on new energy opportunities.
“Woodside’s vision is for large-scale supply of renewable energy to existing and future industry on the Burrup Peninsula,” she said.
“We are lucky to have access to abundant natural resources, safe and reliable energy operations and both industry and government that are motivated to drive sustainable energy outcomes.”

As well as powering the Pluto LNG plant, the Woodside Power Project would supply 50 MW of solar PV power to the Karratha Urea Project being developed by the Western Australia-based Perdaman Group, which would also use gas from the Pluto venture.
“Our work with Perdaman is another demonstration of the important role the gas industry can play in driving the energy transition and achieving net zero emissions by 2050,” O’Neill said.
Perdaman estimates incorporating solar PV power would reduce the facility’s fuel gas consumption by about 50% while reducing emissions by at least 200,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year, over 20 years. The initiative would also allow Perdaman to increase production of ammonia.
Perdaman chairman Vikas Rambal said the use of renewable energy is strategically in line with the company’s commitments to greenhouse gas management and carbon neutrality by 2050.
“This exciting initiative with Woodside will further enhance the manufacturing of blue ammonia for supply to the Asian market and help position Western Australia as a first mover in implementing renewable energy in a world-scale downstream industry,” he said.
“We look forward to working with Woodside on our shared objectives for a lower carbon future.”
The Woodside Power Project is the second renewable energy initiative the oil and gas producer has unveiled this month.
Woodside revealed last week it had signed a heads of agreement with Japanese companies IHI Corporation and Marubeni to investigate the production and export of green hydrogen produced from renewable hydro power in Tasmania.
They will explore using a small-scale hydrogen electrolysis plant to produce green hydrogen as feedstock for green ammonia export, with Woodside already involved in the proposed H2TAS project in Tasmania’s Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone, near Launceston.
While it is expected to initially be a 10 MW pilot project, producing 4.5 tonnes of green hydrogen per day, Woodside said the capacity of the proposed plant could eventually be scaled up to as much as 250 MW.

Woodside’s solar PV announcement comes just days after oil and gas company Shell was ordered by a Dutch court to cut its greenhouse gas emissions.
In a ruling sure to have far-reaching effects, the court determined on Wednesday Royal Dutch Shell is liable for its contributions to climate change, finding the massive energy company’s ongoing fossil-fuel operations undermine basic guaranteed human rights.
The court ordered the company to act immediately to reduce those harms by slashing its global carbon-dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030.
The judgement is being seen as a landmark ruling that could trigger legal action against energy companies around the world.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/28/fronius-launches-new-inverter-for-large-scale-pv-plants/,"INVERTERS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 28, 2021",Fronius launches new inverter for large-scale PV plants,"From pv magazine Global
Austrian inverter manufacturer Fronius has unveiled Fronius Tauro, a new inverter solution for large-scale solar power plants that can be deployed with a decentralised approach next to the PV modules or centralised at the grid connection point.
The three-phase device is available as a Tauro and Tauro ECO and has a power output ranging from 50 to 100 kW. It measures 755 x 1,109 x 346 mm for all four variants of the new product. The 50 kW product weighs 92 kg while the 99 kW and 100 kW versions weigh 103 kg. 
The efficiency of the 50 kW device is 98.6% and that of the 100 kW product is 98.5%. The European efficiency for the two inverters is 98.1% and 98.2%, respectively.
The 50 kW Tauro device comes with three maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inputs while its DC input voltage range is 200-1000 V. Its maximum input current (DC) spans from 134 A to 175 A and the maximum short circuit current from 72A to 125 A. “The Tauro ECO has one MPP tracker, is optimised for cost and efficiency and is available in the 50, 99 and 100 kW power categories,” the manufacturer specified.
The new product is equipped with IP65 protection, active cooling technology, a double wall system and can be used with temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 65 degrees Celsius.
“A reduction in the BOS costs, which can account for roughly a third of the investment costs (CAPEX), make the Tauro unbeatable,” Fronius explained. “The innovative AC Daisy Chaining option allows the installer to link the AC cables of a number of Tauro inverters together directly in the device.”
The inverter’s housing offers enough room in the AC connection area for third-party components, according to the company. “No external box or similar is required, thus saving on costs. V-type terminals and a mounting bracket ensure extremely easy handling, saving more money as fewer additional components such as cable lugs are required.”
The Fronius Tauro Eco inverter will be available starting from June and the Tauro device from September.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/28/using-excess-heat-from-pv-modules-for-lithium-extraction-process/,"MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UNITED STATES",DAVID WAGMAN,"MAY 28, 2021",Using excess heat from PV modules for lithium-extraction process,"From pv magazine USA
A Canadian company whose past ventures include medical marijuana and women’s health care filed provisional patents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a technology that it said could boost PV system output by 10% or more and reduce panel heat stress.
Kelowna, British Columbia-based Enertopia Corp said its technology would enable it to create a closed system loop where only solar energy is used to extract lithium from source rock at its Nevada mine.
The technology takes excess heat from solar panels and uses it to heat a brine solution from 122°F (50°C) to 140°F (60°C) during a typical three- to four-hour hour processing cycle.
The company said that as it moved toward creating a low-carbon lithium extraction pilot plant, it realised that inefficiencies associated with PV panels could be used to its advantage. In particular, it found that the PV panels are subject to heat stress as temperatures rise. Manufacturers generally rate PV panels at a temperature of 77F (25°C). But field work in the Nevada desert showed temperatures on the back of solar panels regularly exceeding 140F, potentially damaging the panels and reducing output.
The company said that its provisional patent addresses this heat issue.
According to Enertopia, if a panel is rated to have a temperature coefficient of -0.50% per 1.8°F above 77 °F, then that panel’s output power will fall by half of a percent for every 1.8°F (-16.7°C) the temperature rises above 77 °F. It said that a solar array in the Nevada desert operating 60°F into the heat stress zone would experience a decrease of 15% or more on the solar array output.
The technology is designed to be retrofitted onto existing PV panels. An unnamed third party with a 3 MW solar array has agreed to do real-time comparative testing on their PV sub-arrays. The goal will be to increase PV production while simultaneously removing the heat stress.
In December, Enertopia acquired USPTO patent #6,024,086, “Solar energy collector having oval absorption tubes.” At the time it said it believed the patent could provide a “novel approach to using waste heat from various sources.”
