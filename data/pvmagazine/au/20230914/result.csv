Moreover, the rebate primarily benefits the mining industry and makes no contribution to road infrastructure financing, as has commonly been misrepresented.
Introducing a cap on the federal diesel Fuel Tax Credit Scheme subsidy for the mining sector at $50 million annually per consolidated group, as suggested by the report’s authors, would mean that only eight mining firms would be impacted – exactly those companies that have the resources and means to transition their fleets of mining vehicles to zero-emission vehicles produced in Australia.
Australian fossil fuel exports are declining while critical minerals for producing and storing renewable energy are increasing exponentially. With few players in the mining industry making efforts to reduce emissions, the growth in the mining industry, driven by the world’s thirst for critical raw materials such as lithium, is clearly illustrated with a corresponding growth of emissions from that industry.

The Climate Energy Finance (CEF) report lays bare how Australia is seriously lagging behind its international counterparts, hampered by outdated legislation from a time when fossil fuels were king.
The diesel Fuel Tax Credit Scheme comes from a time when fossil fuels represented lucrative future industries in Australia. The scheme was introduced in the 1950s to finance investment in roadways as motorised transport saw exponential growth. However, the subsidy has contributed nothing to roadways investment since 1992.
But the strength of lobbies in fossil fuel industries has a legacy. The CEF report points out that Allianz Economic Research identified Australia, alongside Venezuela, the Middle East and North Africa, as regions with exceptionally high fossil fuel subsidies. This fact has been obfuscated in Australia by fudging definitions of subsidies.
Tax rebates are acknowledged as subsidies the world over and are being implemented in industrial policy for ‘carrot and stick’ incentives in industrial policies internationally, with measurable effects.
Australia currently produces more lithium than any other country in the world. Australia also has optimal conditions for producing renewable energy – ideal for creating new industries in a world increasingly fraught by energy scarcity. The mining industry has an exceptionally high and growing demand for mining vehicles and equipment. That means, for manufacturing these products onshore, the domestic market already has the demand to create a thriving low and zero-emission mining vehicle manufacturing industry.
The CEF report finds that a diesel rebate cap would save $14 billion to 2030 and kickstart onshoring mining EV industry in Australia. The thinktank proposes 100% of the tax revenue gained from a diesel subsidy cap be directed into a special purpose fund within the federal National Reconstruction Fund.
While manufacturing is a clear win for economic stability and growth, the question for Australia is what exactly it should manufacture with its mineral resources. In June this year, pv magazine looked into how much Australia can realistically achieve with its critical minerals. The CEF report advocates for an electric vehicle battery montage industry in Australia and vehicle and equipment manufacturing for zero emission machinery and vehicles.
Here, the report identifies fairly immediate investment opportunities for emerging Australian industries. “Electric vehicle battery pack assembly for mining equipment provides a consistent demand base for developing Australia’s first mobility-oriented battery industry. This is a stepping stone to onshoring Australia’s heavy road transport electrified powertrain industry,” the report points out.
According to the CEF report, the electrification of Heavy Mining Equipment (HME), such as excavators and dozers, also provides a significant boost to the annual battery demands of the mining industry as it transitions to net zero. “The electrification of rail systems, both in urban areas and extended networks connecting mining to ports in the Pilbara, New South Wales and Queensland, provide further baseline demand for onshoring an Australian battery industry,” the report reads.
Not only is there a demand for mining vehicles in Australia, but there is more demand than anywhere else in the world. This in turn, drives demand for Australia’s abundant renewable energy sources as transportation sectors become increasingly electrified. As the report points out, “Electrifying Australia’s non-road diesel fleet across remote regions will require a significant uptick in renewable energy generation and transmission.”

The report gets quite specific about its recommendations for investment, suggesting that the fossil fuel subsidy cap, affecting only the largest and wealthiest mining industry players, would allow the mining haulage electric vehicle (EV) industry to be, “turbocharged with $14 billion of tax funding recouped via our proposed cap on the FTC [subsidy] Scheme to incentivise the world’s most advanced battery and haulage vehicle manufacturers – Liebherr, Komatsu and Caterpillar – to leverage Australia’s world leading mining sector.”
That said, Australian companies have also garnered international attention for zero-emission mining vehicles. Although not filling the gap for extra large mining vehicles, two Australian manufacturing and technology companies Ampcontrol and PPK Mining Equipment aim to deliver a range of battery-electric vehicle solutions for underground mining applications. The two are installing Ampcontrol’s electric drive systems into PPK personnel carriers. Australian fast-charger specialist Tritium has also redesigned a DC fast charger for mining operations.
“As a consequence of the absence of emissions standards, the particulate matter pollution of the approximate 700,000 non-road diesel engines in Australia is almost double that of the 20.1 million registered on-road vehicles across all types in Australia,” notes the CEF report. These negative statistics also give an idea of the enormous potential for growth in electric mining vehicles, not to mention their significant impact for reducing overall emissions in Australia.
Internationally, governments are subsidising low- and zero-emission technologies, spurning an international competition for talent and manufacturing capacity. The CEF report highlights this environment that has accelerated significantly in the last couple of years with US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while Europe, among others, has implemented policies that similarly accelerate low and zero-emission technologies in industry. 
The ‘Fuel Tax Credit Scheme and Heavy Haulage Electric Vehicle Manufacturing in Australia’ is a carefully researched and detailed report presenting a moderate proposal that would leverage just a portion of the diesel Fuel Tax Scheme. Irrespective of how the funds freed up by means of a cap should or could be spent, the report highlights Australia’s potential to further lead in low and zero-emission mining vehicles and equipment that represents a globally competitive market lead, and exposes an outdated bit of legislation that is urgently in need of change.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/14/overcapacity-hammering-solar-stocks/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,CHINA,EUROPE,UNITED STATES,WORLD",SERGIO MATALUCCI,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023",Overcapacity hammering solar stocks,"From pv magazine Global
Most solar module producers and inverter manufacturers have taken a significant beating on stock exchanges over the last few months, well before module capacity expansion announcements. Jenny Chase, solar analyst at BloombergNEF, said that there is an oversupply across the entire value chain.
“Module and polysilicon prices crashed,” Chase told pv magazine. “There is a lot of inventory of modules in different markets. That means that, although installations are still booming and there is no sign of slowing down, the prospects for individual companies are not generally good, as they are selling more at a lower profit.”
Polysilicon prices spiked to more than USD 30/kg ($47/kg) throughout most of 2022. Since the start of this year, they have fallen from USD 30.50 to just around USD 9 today.
Chase said that supply has finally caught up with demand. She said polysilicon prices have had a significant impact on polysilicon makers.
“New Chinese factories have come online and produce a lot of material. There is just enough of that,” she said. “It also has knock-on effects because it lowers the barriers to entry across the value chain, with additional competition from new entrants. It also means that any company with inventory, which is basically all of them, sees a reduced value of what they have in stock.”
Chase said that module prices were expected to decrease, but not to this extent. Module prices dropped from USD 0.22 –0.24 at the beginning of the year to USD 0.15 today.
Rebecca McManus, renewables lead at Aurora Energy Research, agrees on the significant role played by the decline in polysilicon prices. She noted ongoing manufacturing capacity expansion in China, and plans to expand manufacturing capacity in Europe and North America.
“The rapid expansion of production capacity by Chinese manufacturers has outpaced the growth in demand,” McManus told pv magazine. “This is particularly relevant as prices there are normally two-thirds of the production prices in Europe.”
Similar European announcements are broadening the gap between supply and demand.
“There has been a big push for a more European-led manufacturing of the solar modules. Instead of importing from China, European countries want to produce 30 GW by 2025,” said McManus, noting that EU subsidy reforms are a crucial pillar of this EU strategy.
However, there is potentially another element to the EU plans.
“The new European policies could penalise developers not sourcing from Europe, but from China,” said McManus. “There is a geopolitical risk connected to that.”
The United States is a somewhat similar case, although with some differences. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides operating expenses [OPEX] support for local manufacturing capacity, while EU support is mostly capex-based.
“The IRA is incentivising capacity manufacturing locally in the US, setting up funding for that,” said McManus. “The US has a large budget for encouraging local manufacturing.”
A second geopolitical risk is related to the supply chains, with China controlling most polysilicon production. Possible tensions could take a toll on European module manufacturers that rely on polysilicon imports from China.
On the other hand, geopolitical risks don’t simply have a bearish effect on stock prices. In some cases, they are pushing up the stock prices of American companies. While several US-based companies have seen the value of their stocks increase by up to 35%, Chinese players have seen decreases of up to 40% to 45%.
“First Solar is an index of US-China trade tensions at the moment. First Solar is expanding because the US has a trade war going on with China and it is trying to restore manufacturing,” said Chase. “Every time there is an intensification of the trade war First Solar is up.”
Other US solar companies are suffering, though – especially in the inverter and microinverter business.
“Some of that could be just that there are other microinverters coming into the market,” explained Chase. “When stock prices change, it does not necessarily mean that there is something bad that has happened to the company, but that the company is not doing as well as the investors expect they would.”
Nonetheless, European manufacturers are considering scaling up operations in the United States.
“Meyer Burger is reallocating the equipment it ordered for Europe to the Colorado factory. Basically, it has bet on the American market,” said Chase, adding that the company reported disappointing results due to the crash of Chinese module prices.
The idea is that Europe should pour more money into domestic manufacturing, especially if it anticipates an escalation of geopolitical tensions.
“US wants to keep the Chinese modules out. Europe has the more realistic goal of having some supply chain that is not Chinese, and ideally some in Europe, in case geopolitical tensions ramp up, so we don’t have a situation where the West is digging up things to burn, while China is running on solar and wind,” said Chase.
She said she feels more certain that European manufacturers will be getting major capex grants than she was six months ago. Still, doubts remain. “How much is that going to help if your OPEX is higher than the selling price of modules?”
McManus noted that technological developments can have a negative effect on stocks.
“As the technology is maturing, the actual installation costs increase. But there is another element: the size of the installation is changing,” said McManus. “The lifetime of the inverters will have an effect too. Previously, the usual lifetime for inverters was 12 to 15 years, now 25 to 30 years. There is also a similarity for modules. They will last longer and will be more efficient.”
But not everybody agrees.
“I don’t think that most companies tracking stock market investments care much about higher efficiency,” said Chase. “Although they want to invest in companies that have good manufacturing, which generally means being able to increase efficiency without increasing costs.”
The two analysts agree that stock prices for module and inverter manufacturers will reflect the capacity of companies to embrace, if not anticipate, technological advancements in the highly competitive sector, potentially leading to bankruptcies in the coming months, despite the installation boom.
“You can have a very highly successful solar sector, with many companies going bankrupt,” concluded Chase. “I think we should expect quite a lot of bankruptcies and some exits.”

Zen Energy was founded almost two decades ago, and in 2015 the company’s board gained economist and energy expert Ross Garnaut. The company merged with Sanjeev Gupta’s SIMEC Energy in 2017, although the arrangement was short lived. The name of Garnaut however, has remained, with an executive lineup that now also includes Anthony Garnaut as the chief executive, Glenn Garnaut, as the chief risk officer.
In June just passed, the Queensland government granted $7 million to the Barcaldine Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) where Sunshot and its sister company Zen Energy are responsible for supplying renewable energy to tenants with a feasibility study outlining plans for 80 MW of wind and 90 MW of solar energy to be developed as demand increases and the industrial park grows.
Just the month before, Zen Energy penned a long-term deal with Greek resources and renewables company Mytilineos to purchase power from its Wagga Wagga South Solar Farm in New South Wales.
While the beginning of this year saw Zen Energy announce plans to develop its first utility-scale battery energy storage system after acquiring the 111 MW/270 MWh Templers Battery project in South Australia from UK-based developer Renewable Energy Systems Group.
Zen Energy contracts electricity from 20 solar and wind farms across Australia. It has installed 35,000 renewable energy systems and counts the South Australian government and CSIRO’s NSW sites among its clients.

Looking at the Sunwiz graphs breaking down large-scale certificates (LGCs) registered in each state, the graphs reveal the segment is utterly flat in most regions.
“Look at how much flatness there is. It’s only really Queensland that is going up right now,” Sunwiz’s Warwick Johnston tells pv magazine Australia.
In the last three years, both Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) have pulled way in front of the other states. Nonetheless, even NSW has had an incredibly flat 2023.
These figures encompass both utility-scale renewable generation projects as well as larger commercial and industrial installations, Johnston notes. “There will inevitably be more businesses putting solar on in the coming six months, and so the pressure that has built up will get released in that [C&I] segment.”
“But such a stall that has occurred at the level of grid-scale solar, we don’t see it being resolved – not in any fast, quick and soon way,” Johnston says.
“The energy transition in Australia is at risk of losing its social license if we continue to go so slowly because people will face high electricity prices if coal isn’t replaced with renewables,” the Sunwiz MD added.
“There’s a lot of barriers there that absolutely have to be addressed so we can get cheap, bulk energy. But we need that cheap bulk energy now and in the coming two, three years.”
“If we continue to remove subsidies from small-scale, and while we’re waiting around sitting on our hands for the problems to be solved in large-scale, isn’t that a pretty risky thing to be doing? Why are we reducing subsidies from the only thing that’s working right now?”
Here Johnston is referring to the gradual winding back of Australia’s small-scale certificate scheme, which will end completely in 2030.
Johnston suggests one way to get things flowing better would be to make commercial solar up to 1 MW eligible for STCs.
In his eyes, “not enough” is happening in the regulatory space to start solving the issues of grid scale solar, including approval delays, grid connection and transmission

H2FLY has completed what it calls “the world’s first piloted flight of a liquid hydrogen-powered electric aircraft.” The flight near Maribor, Slovenia, is part of a test campaign. The Stuttgart-based company’s HY4 demonstrator aircraft is a piloted plane with an electric fuel cell propulsion system powered by cryogenically stored liquid hydrogen. “Results of the test flights indicate that using liquid hydrogen in place of gaseous hydrogen will double the maximum range of the HY4 aircraft from 750 km to 1,500 km,” said H2FLY. It now wants to scale up its tech for regional aircraft. The test campaign also involves Air Liquide, Pipistrel Vertical Solutions, the German Aerospace Center, EKPO Fuel Cell Technologies, and Fundación Ayesa.
Solaris has secured several hydrogen bus orders in Italy. TPER, Bologna’s municipal public transport operator, will purchase 130 Urbino12 hydrogen buses, with an option to extend the order by an additional 140 vehicles. The 70 kW fuel cell will derive hydrogen from five composite tanks on the bus roof. The full tanks can hold 37.5 kg of hydrogen. The first batch of 37 vehicles will be delivered in 2024, and the rest in the 2025-26 period. Venice’s transport operator, Azienda Veneziana della Mobilità, has also ordered 90 hydrogen Solaris buses, with 75 of them being the 12-meter Urbino12 version. “These vehicles will be delivered to Venice gradually, starting from November 2025, and the deliveries will be completed in the first weeks of 2026,” said Solaris.
Tanaka has signed a technical assistance deal with Chengdu Guangming to bring its fuel cell electrode catalyst manufacturing technologies to China. The Japanese precious metals producer will install production equipment at the Ya’an Guangming Paite Precious Metal plant and intends to begin full-scale production in summer 2024. The companies aim to launch fuel cell electrode catalyst production for the Chinese market by the end of 2025. Tanaka is manufacturing electrode catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEFCs) and polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (PEWE) using platinum and iridium.
UHL has set up a joint venture with PWRH2 in Shenzhen, China, to sell hydrogen generators in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe, and North America. UHL executed the deal through one company of its group, which now owns 35% of the Chinese production company. The Australia-based hydrogen conglomerate said it will target customers in the United Kingdom, North American, the Asia-Pacific, and Europe, given the advanced hydrogen infrastructure in these markets. It said that expanding its presence will be instrumental in achieving its planned stock listing in the fourth quarter of 2023.
NGEL, a wholly owned subsidiary of India’s NTPC, has signed a deal with Nayara Energy to explore opportunities in the green hydrogen segment. NTPC is India’s largest power utility, with a total installed capacity of more than 73 GW.

Zonal Renewables has announced plans to construct a 100 MW floating solar power farm in Cadiz city, located in the province of Negros Occidental, Philippines. The farm will be built on a 90-hectare fish pond, reported the Philippine News Agency.
The news outlet did not list the project’s cost or its construction and commissioning target dates. However, it mentioned that the array has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 1,250 tons per year.
“Signing of the agreement comes at a perfect time, considering that the outlook for new renewable energy generation projects in Negros Occidental is quite encouraging,” said Zonal Renewables President Jabez Alvarez. “That is due to the soon-to-be completed additional transmission capabilities by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines.”
In August, ACEN – a subsidiary of Ayala Group – announced plans to develop 1 GW of floating solar on Laguna Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines. The company has submitted contracts to the Department of Energy for eight blocks of 100 hectares each in the southern and eastern sections of the lake.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/09/14/adding-rooftop-solar-to-social-housing-tenants-brings-equality-savings/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",TRISTAN RAYNER,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2023","Adding rooftop solar to social housing tenants brings equality, savings","Social housing stock has considerable rooftop solar potential, representing an opportunity for governments to support low-income households.
New modelling conducted by the University of New South Wales and the Australian PV Institute, and championed by solar and renewable advocates Solar Citizens, showed households would save an average of $860 a year if social and community housing stock in New South Wales were fitted with solar panels.
Fitting the 150,000 or so households in NSW would cost an estimated $532 million over five years, and help secure the state’s electricity supply. The investment, according to modelling, would be matched by bill savings within 4.2 years, and less for separate house and semi-detached properties. The installations would then continue to generate power for the two decade lifecycle of a typical solar installation.
“This is the low-hanging fruit … the Government can decide to roll-out solar for social housing from tomorrow as they own much of the stock themselves, and have willing partners in the not-for-profit community housing sector,” Solar Citizens national director Heidi Lee Douglas said in a statement.
The NSW government has yet to commit to a federal government scheme to upgrade social housing, which first requires states to join. Both Queensland and Victoria have already joined.
n NSW alone, UNSW modelling shows that the effort could produce as much as 1.1 per cent of the total annual generation within the National Electricity Market. So far, the NSW Land and Housing Corporation has installed solar on 7% of its dwellings, with a current aim of reaching 30%.
Equality
The issue of solar installations on households of is also proving to be one of equality. A report in Applied Energy published last month focused on Ireland found that latecomers to rooftop solar may struggle to access the grid. In Ireland, the grid could only serve some 5% of 1.6 million households based on an average 6 kW installation, without storage or connected EVs.
In effect, researchers found a risk of the rich effectively getting richer, given well-off households are generally first to install solar PV, access the grid without limits under a first-come-first-served approach, and benefit from subsidies as well. Latecomers, presumed to be less well off, may then be blocked from the grid as small-scale distributed generation installations eventually become cheaper and more readily available. Those in social housing are presented with limited opportunities for their own solar installations, and therefore rely on government support.
Previously, many other states countries have explored social housing and solar, and solar plus storage opportunity. 3,000 social housing properties in South Australia were connected via a Tesla-operated and Arena supported VPP. Recently,  Brazil announced 2 GW solar plan for social housing program as well.
