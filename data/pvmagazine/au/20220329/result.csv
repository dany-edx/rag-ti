The standing committee led by the (now outgoing) Liberal Concetta Fierravanti-Wells found the agency, as the name suggests, exists to fund renewable energy projects exclusively. 
This is the second time Taylor’s proposed changes have been blocked, with the senate knocking them back in June last year after Labor, the Greens and independent senators Rex Patrick, Stirling Griff and Jacqui Lambie all voted against them.

“It’s a wonderful win for the renewable energy industry,” Wayne Smith, the Smart Energy Council’s government relations manager said.
With the federal budget set to be released tonight, Smith questioned what impact the ruling could have. His colleague, Smart Energy Council CEO John Grimes, claimed the Morrison government has “acted as if” the changes were law, announcing a list of fossil and carbon capture projects it would fund via ARENA. “Presumably those things are not going to happen,” he said.
The Morrison government has said it will continue to try to pass the changes to expand ARENA’s funding scope.
Tellingly, thinktank the Australia Institute released analysis on the same day which found the Morrison government had last year increased its already enormous subsidies for fossil fuels.

In total, Australian taxpayers forked out $11.6 billion in fossil fuel subsidies in 2021-22, the equivalent to $22,139 per minute. Of this, $10.5 billion came from the federal government, over 90%. 
Those subsidies went up 12% in 2021-2022, compared with the previous year, amounting to an additional $1.3 billion following the Black Summer bushfires. Fossil fuels subsidies now amount to more than 56 times the budget of the National Recovery and Resilience Agency.
The total value of future fossil fuel subsidies already committed in federal, state and territory budgets is $55.3 billion – more than 10 times the balance of Australia’s Emergency Response Fund, which was $4.8 billion in December 2021.

The largest subsidy came via the federal Fuel Tax Credits Scheme.
“It is perverse that Australian governments continue to subsidise fossil fuel production and consumption while communities across the country are bearing the costs of disasters exacerbated by fossil fuel use,” Rod Campbell, Research Director at the Australia Institute, said.

On Monday, NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister Matt Kean said the “overwhelming” response to its calls for expressions of interest included private sector plans to develop up to 5,900MW of electrolyser capacity, more than eight times the 700MW target.
This equates to more than $4 billion of investment potential.
The NSW government has committed $70 million to accelerate the development of hydrogen hubs, starting with the Hunter and Illawarra, though it is worth noting that its approach relies not so much on direct subsidies for hydrogen projects but rather on creating an ideal environment for business.

This approach can be seen through the state’s hydrogen strategy released last October. In it, Kean and his government focus on bolstering business and providing up to $3 billion in support for the hydrogen industry by waiving government charges for green hydrogen production and creating a favourable regulatory system.
“The market has spoken. This is an overwhelming level of commercial interest and it shows our policies are sending the right signals to energy investors, making NSW the go to state for energy investment,” Kean said of the hydrogen hub news.
It comes off the back of more than $100 billion in investment interest in the state’s Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), representing almost 40GW of project potential – which again exceeded expectations.

While the renewable investment opportunity in Australia overall remains somewhat marred by the Morrison government’s continued support for and subsidisation of fossil fuels industries, NSW, it seems, has managed to capture confidence.
Specifically, 21 individual projects have been proposed for the two hydrogen hubs, enough to produce almost 268,000 tonnes of green hydrogen each year.
“Hydrogen Hubs will provide huge economic benefits for the Hunter and Illawarra, helping to secure jobs of the future,” acting NSW Premier Paul Toole said.
“It also represents a huge export potential for our state, with the international market for green hydrogen expected to meet 24% of the global energy demand by 2050, estimated to be worth $900 billion.”

The studies will support the company’s referral submission to the territory’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), which will allow the project to formally move forward with its pre-feasibility work.
The Tiwi Islands project is targeting an annual green hydrogen production of 100,000 tonnes, which will be exported to the Asia-Pacific, with a particular focus on Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China. The project will use the company’s own fleet of hydrogen-powered and compressed hydrogen carrying ships currently being developed.
The company is targeting an investment decision on the Tiwi project by the end of next year, 2023, with first production in 2026.
GEV’s proposed project is located on the traditional lands of the Munupi people
Among the permissions granted is an increase in the land available to include in its referral submission. GEV now has scope to include solar generation based on ~2,580 hectares, or 25.8 square kilometres (km2), up from 1,800 hectares – adding almost a third of additional space.
It will also assess an additional 40 hectares adjacent to the existing Port Melville facilities for hydrogen production and compression, with a total of 72 hectares now under consideration near the port.
Connecting the solar farm to the hydrogen production facilities will be a new transmission line which is expected to follow an existing road to minimise environmental impacts. The company is now assessing ~120 hectares (1.2km2) of land for this transmission line.
The approvals from the Munupi Landowners and Tiwi Plantation Corporation Board will also allow GEV’s consultants to be onsite for environmental surveys, with further engineering surveys and studies to follow later in the year as part of the project’s pre-feasibility.
It has also been granted permission to begin solar monitoring in the September quarter for a period of 12 months, based on agreed sites for clearing and installation. Further meetings and permissions will be required at various stages for the project as and when future activities on Munupi land are required, the company said.
To advance the design of the solar farm and transmission line, GEV has hired CE Partners, about whom there is little information online. GEV said the Melbourne firm will be covering construction, operation, and generation modelling of both the solar farm and transmission line.
Alongside the onsite environmental and engineering surveys and solar monitoring, GEV and its consultants will begin detailed engineering and support the target of financial close by the second half of 2023.
On the nearer term horizon, the company will lodge its submission referral to the territory’s EPA in the June quarter and expects its decision to follow in the September quarter.
The company will also pursue potential offtake agreements in the meantime, and will be participating in the Austrade’s Team Australia Stand at the World Hydrogen Summit, Rotterdam, in May.

Battery-powered vehicles and battery energy storage systems at every scale are largely using lithium-ion chemistry, but high costs and concerns with thermal events have driven US labs to investigate other low-cost, safe alternatives. One such alternative is the sodium-ion battery.
When cycled at a high voltage around 4.5V, sodium-ion batteries can significantly increase their energy density. However, rapid degradation in charge-discharge cycles have barred sodium-ion batteries from reaching commercialisation.
Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory discovered an effect in the creation of the cathode material that may lead to improvements in battery resiliency. It was found that during the rapid cooling process in the creation of the cathode, a “structural earthquake” occurs, which disrupts the atomic makeup of the material. During rapid cooling in cathode synthesis, the particle surface became rough, and large areas showed strain on the material. The effect was also found when cycling the cathode at high temperatures above 130 degrees Fahrenheit or when performing fast-charging of one hour versus a ten-hour charge cycle.
With the knowledge of this structure-damaging event, cathode makers can now adjust synthesis conditions to create a purer cathode that is better able to pair the anode material. Earlier research by the team also led to an improved anode, and the team expects pairing the two will have dramatic effects.
“Now, we should be able to match our improved cathode with the anode to attain a 20% – 40% increase in performance,” said Guiliang Xu, assistant chemist in Argonne’s chemical sciences and engineering division.  “Also important, such batteries will maintain that performance with long-term cycling at high voltage.”
The results were published in Nature Communications. The Argonne team said the findings could result in a longer range and more affordable electric vehicles, and low-cost energy storage for the grid.
“Seeing is believing,” said Yuzi Liu, a CNM nanoscientist.  “With Argonne’s world-class scientific facilities, we do not have to guess what is happening during the synthesis.”

Japanese automaker Toyota Motor has developed a hydrogen storage module that uses its resin high-pressure hydrogen tank technology for fuel cell vehicles.
The company said the storage module will enable the use of the tank to store hydrogen in applications other than automobiles.
“The 70 megapascals (MPa) resin high-pressure hydrogen tank developed for automobiles is now the subject of numerous requests from those who would like to use it in railways, shipping, and port cargo handling, as well as fuel cell generators,” it said. “Toyota developed this hydrogen storage module as a way to answer these demands and expand the use of hydrogen.”
It also added that the resin high-pressure hydrogen was already tested in its Mirai fuel cell vehicle and safety devices such as hydrogen detectors and automatic shut-off switches. Depending on the size, these tanks have a storage capacity of 2.7 kg to 18.7 kg and a tank mass ranging from 43.0 kg to 243.8 kg
The module unit, according to the manufacturer, embeds safety-assured tanks and is equipped with several safety devices that automatically monitor the module operation status.
“As storing and transporting hydrogen more safely and efficiently can be done through high-capacity hydrogen loads, it is possible to use hydrogen-based energy in a range of locations where hydrogen filling is difficult, such as ports or mountain areas,” it explained. “Toyota will be working on connecting with new business partners and carrying out verification testing with the idea of expanding hydrogen use even further.”
Toyota demonstrated its first hydrogen tank for automobiles in 2001 and is one of the most active carmakers now developing technologies for fuel cell vehicles. It has produced the vehicle-mounted 70 MPa tanks since 2008, and more than 20,000 were produced for the first generation of Mirai vehicles.
