https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/12/south-australias-road-to-100-renewables-is-paved-with-infrastructure-challenges/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",,"JANUARY 12, 2021",South Australia’s road to 100% renewables is paved with infrastructure challenges,"The road to 100% renewables in South Australia is still very long and a lot needs to be done to achieve this goal. The challenge is not a PV or wind technical challenge. It is an infrastructure challenge. Quite simply, Australia does not have a very well developed electricity grid.
Currently, even if the state of South Australia produces at any time 100% or more of its electricity by wind + PV, it still needs to keep about 200 MW of gas-powered generation to maintain the grid voltage. The excess power is exported to other states, mostly Victoria at the moment.
Note that, on the record setting Dec. 27, 2020, the utility-scale solar PV plants (dark yellow on the graph below) were derated and the generated power curtailed because renewables were much greater than the demand. On this particular day, over 24 hours, renewables could have represented more than 110%  than the total demand of electricity if the utility-scale PV generators had not been derated.

When solar and wind disappear, the different gas-powered generators (steam, turbines, combined cycle and reciprocating) take over. If wind and solar disappear abruptly, batteries are able to provide very rapidly the power demand, but enough spinning capacity must be kept in reserve.
Forecasting models (for example Solcast) allow to predict these events with very good precision and to secure enough reserved spinning capacity.  Interconnection with the other states (Victoria currently and NSW very soon) allows to import the needed power if necessary.

During the night of Saturday, Jan. 2, 2021 in the early morning before sunrise, the wind died, and gas-powered plants had to be ramped up to 500 MW. The interstate power import (in violet) was also rapidly ramped up to about 600 MW.
To improve the situation in the future and achieve 100% renewables 365 days of the year, South Australia requires some additional infrastructure development. These include:
– more PV and wind generator, which can be curtailed or their produced energy can be stored or exported to other states;
– more interstate interconnection;
– more dispatchable loads, for example hydrogen generators (precursor for other synthetic fuels, like ammonia), desalination plants, EV charging stations and V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) inverters;
– more hydroelectric power plants;
– more energy storage, like batteries including V2G-connected electric vehicles, vanadium redox flow batteries and pumped-hydro;
– promoting direct or indirect electrification of all energy sectors, particularly the transportation sector,
– and HVDC transmission lines (east-west for short-term power shift and north-south for seasonal power shift).
The wrong things to do for South Australia would be to establish barriers for the deployment of renewables and the electrification of the transportation sector – particularly EVs, which can provide a significant capacity of energy storage.
As encouraging as South Australia’s progress has been, things in the state are not yet perfect. We have a long way to go. But the number of consecutive hours with 100% renewables is increasing.  We just had about 36 hours of 100% renewables from Monday Jan. 4 at 6 am to Tuesday Jan. 5 at 6pm.
Renewables covered 71.8% of electricity generation in Dec. and 59% over the whole of 2020. The penetration of renewables in South Australia is increasing at a rate of 4.5% absolute per year. It should reach 63.5% in 2021 and 100% by 2030 if the required infrastructure is put in place.

While the growth was mostly led by automotive lending, one of the Plenti Group’s two other specialty areas, its renewable energy loans also grew significantly.
“Renewable energy was up 19% on [Q3 FY20], with a solid recovery in Victorian volumes post easing of lockdown restrictions,” a statement released on Tuesday said.
In December, Plenti also established a new $100 million warehouse funding facility which will afford the company to expand its rooftop solar and storage projects loan offerings. The company says the new faculty will reduce its funding costs and improve the unit economics of the renewable energy loans it funds.
Positioning themselves as a reputable green loan lender, Plenti’s stand in the world of green financiers itself grew last year after the company was able to secure itself as a funding partner for both the New South Wales and South Australian governments. Plenti will work with the NSW on its Empowering Homes Program, which provides zero interest loans of up to $14,000 for households to install rooftop solar and battery storage. The company is also the delivery partner for the South Australian government’s $100 million battery scheme.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/12/neoen-plans-whopping-500-mw-big-battery-to-provide-for-nsws-ambitious-vision/,"UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,NEW SOUTH WALES",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Neoen plans whopping 500 MW big battery to provide for NSW’s ambitious vision,"The project, which Neoen is calling the ‘Great Western Battery,’ would be Australia’s largest battery storage project by a long shot. The French renewables developer claims the project “would operate unlike any other device currently connected to the NSW network, and would provide a range of services.”
Revealed by planning documents filed on December 15, 2020, Neoen is seeking consent to construct, operate and maintain a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) of 500 MW and up to 100 MWh at 173 Brays Lane, Wallerawang, New South Wales. It is also seeking to build a new transmission line that would connect the big battery to Wallerawang’s existing TransGrid 330 kV substation.
Neoen estimates the project will cost approximately $300 to $400 million.
Positioning itself to play a key role in the 12 GW of new renewable energy generation capacity planned by the state government for this decade, Neoen says the big battery is the key to unlocking future investment in, and uptake of, renewable energy in the state, solving existing grid limitations.
Neoen currently operates the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, which was the world’s largest lithium-ion battery when it was installed in 2017. Recently expanded, Hornsdale Power Reserve, also known as the Tesla Big Battery, has a capacity of 150 MW / 194 MWh. The Great Western Battery is planned to have at least triple the capacity.
In the submitted scoping study, prepared with the support of consultancy AECOM, Neoen says one of the project’s main project is to improve the resilience and sustainability NSW grid. “The large-scale BESS would reduce the possibility of load-shedding and blackout events in the State, especially considering the multiple existing coal fired power plants that are planned to retire in the next decade,” the study says.
AECOM / Neoen Australia
The proposed site, which about 110km west of Sydney, sits between the now decommissioned Wallerawang coal power station, the Springvale colliery, the Lidsdale coal loading facility and Wallerawang ash repository.
Neoen plans to connect its big battery to the 330kV substation which had previously served the coal power station, repurposing the infrastructure located about 1.25km from the proposed site.
The Great Western Battery is anticipated to take about one year to construct, requiring a peak of 150 to 200 workers. If, as anticipated, construction is able to begin by 2022, the big battery could be operational by 2023.
The plan tops off a huge year for Neoen. In 2020, the company was awarded a contract for a 300 MW / 450 MWh Victoria Big Battery to be constructed on the outskirts of Geelong as well as securing a 14-year contract with the Australian Capital Territory.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/12/one-stop-agrees-to-extensive-remediation-plan-after-49400-stcs-improperly-created/,"RESIDENTIAL PV,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,SOUTH AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"JANUARY 12, 2021","One Stop agrees to extensive remediation program after 49,400 STCs improperly created","The improper certificate creation stemmed from 379 rooftop PV systems installed in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia between June 28, 2017 and Feb. 3, 2020.
It is believed these 379 solar PV system installations were not carried out or supervised by CEC-accredited installers, and therefore the 49,400 small-scale technology certificates (STCs) allocated to them were deemed improper. One Stop’s compliance procedures did not identify the non-compliant installations at the time, with the breach discovered by the Clean Energy Regulator in 2020.
One Stop Warehouse Finance’s director, Hongwei Zhang, has since signed an Enforceable Undertaking with the regulator, legally binding the company to carry out a compliance program for two years at its own expense – including the reinspection and ratification the 379 system sites. It has also agreed surrender of the certificates for sites that cannot be inspected.
The regulator reports that the false information was discovered after employing new data sharing methods. “The agency has recently utilised data analytics and information sharing arrangements with other government agencies, which established that a number of installers had provided false information to registered agents, including One Stop Warehouse,” a spokesperson for the Clean Energy Regular told pv magazine Australia.
Approximately half of the rooftop arrays linked to the compliance action occurred were installed in New South Wales and mostly carried out in 2019. That year, the state saw about 170 non-compliant rooftop systems installed, which lead to the generation of over 20,000 improper certificates. NSW’s string of wrongly signed-off installations continued into 2020, in which another 4,343 STCs were created from 28 installations.
Victoria and Queensland were the only other two states with installations and certificates based on false information uncovered in 2020 – with only had four and three non-compliant installations respectively.
In 2017, however, when the issue started occurring, Victoria had 29 installations linked to false information, Western Australia recorded two and Queensland one. There were none found in NSW that year.
In total from 2017 to 2020, Victoria was linked to around 73 non-compliant installations, resulting in the creation of over 11,500 improper certificates. Queensland saw about 55 installations and around 7,500 improper STCs. Western Australia had 28 non-compliant installations while South Australia had 10, with the majority taking place in 2018 for both states, resulting in 3,413 and 1,150 improper certificates respectively.
NSW was far-and-away the state in which the improper installs occurred, with over 200 installations generating more than 25,700 STCs based on improper information.
Signed on August 26, 2020, the Enforceable Undertaking between One Stop Warehouse Finance and CER outlines that One Stop “inadvertently” improperly created certificates after being provided false information by third party installers and retailers.
“One Stop was unaware that the information provided to it by a third party was false, and its compliance procedures did not identify, at the time the certificates were created, that the information provided to it contained false installer declarations,” the document reads.
To remediate that failure, One Stop has agreed to a comprehensive compliance program to be carried out at its expense over the next two years. As part of that program, One Stop was required to appoint a manager responsible for implementing the compliance program by Sept. 30, 2020.
On top of reinspecting the 379 solar installation sites, One Stop was required to upgrade its information recording methods and records, as well as employee training programs. It has also agreed to: “documented procedures to research the capability and trustworthiness of industry partners and contractors.”
The company has also agreed to arrange a review of its compliance program with a “suitable qualified, independent compliance professional to be agreed with the Regulator.” The first compliance review is to be completed before Feb. 1 2022, while the second and final review is to be completed by1 February 2023.
The Regular said One Stop has cooperated with it to come to an “agreeable outcome.”

The solar farm will install PV panels on single access trackers as well as permanent operation facilities. Provisional plans for a “water cooled cube-type unit” battery are included in the approved application, though the decision to install a battery is expected to be finalised at a later date and will be subject to council approval.
With a generation capacity of 100 MW, the solar farm will be placed “immediately adjacent” to Ergon Energy’s Isis substation, connecting via a new 132kV transmission line. “This reduces transmission losses between the solar farm and the substation given the short length (approx. 800m) of overhead transmission line required to be constructed to connect the project to the substation,” the application reads.
“The project has been scaled based on discussion with Ergon (owner of the substation) and to ensure the project is optimised to lower the cost of delivering renewable energy to the grid and the community,” the application adds.
Bundaberg Regional Council
The proposed site is only a few kilometres from the Childers Solar Farm, which began operations in 2019. Despite being light on large-scale solar projects, Bundaberg has been deemed Australia’s “rooftop solar capital” after a topping the Clean Energy Council’s list of the nation’s most solar-friendly suburbs. As SolarQuotes notes, Bundaberg has about 46 solar panel systems per 100 dwellings, well above the national average of 28 – affording the region a capacity of about 963 watts per person – nearly double the national average of 544 watts.
Bundaberg was also approved to be home to Australia’s first “hydrogen hub” last year. Given the green light in September, Bundaberg is the preferred site for a $300 million large-scale green hydrogen plant which will produce green fuel and assemble zero waste vehicles.
Lodged in August of last year, Bundaberg Regional Council Development Group Manager, Michael Ellery, noted the development would be one of the biggest solar farms to pass the Council’s desk for approval. “It will easily service over 20,000 households,” Ellery told local news outlet, Bundabergnow.
The Banksia Solar Farm is will have a lifespan of 40 years, after which site will be returned to agricultural land. The proposed site spans two properties, both of which are freehold tenure, in
what’s classed as a Rural Zone – meaning the proposal is subject to Code Assessment.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/01/12/fortescue-and-south-koreas-posco-agree-to-green-hydrogen-future/,"HYDROGEN,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,JAPAN,SOUTH KOREA,WORLD",BLAKE MATICH,"JANUARY 12, 2021",Fortescue and South Korea’s Posco agree to green hydrogen future,"Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) and South Korean steelmaker Posco have agreed to a partnership that will see the FMG supply Posco with iron ore and green hydrogen. 
At a meeting in Seoul on December 14th, 2020, Posco CEO Jeong-Woo Choi and FMG Chairman Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest discussed the potential of a cooperative green hydrogen business. 
FMG has already set a carbon neutrality target of 2040. But, what is more, Forrest and his executives have been jet setting around the world in recent months securing deals, such as this one with Posco, in the pursuance of its ambitious plans to build one of the biggest renewable energy portfolios in the world, delivering more than 235 GW of renewable capacity (that is five times the current capacity of Australia’s National Energy Market). 
“FMG is a long-term contract supplier that has been stably supplying iron ore to Posco,” said Choi. “If competitive green hydrogen can be produced with cooperation between the two companies and is introduced to Korea, the era of green hydrogen in Korea will be accelerated.” 
Part of the deal will see FMG use Posco’s premium steel materials, PosMAC, for all the solar and wind generation behind the green hydrogen FMG produces. As it stands then, Posco will import FMG’s iron ore to make the steel. The steel will then be supplied back to FMG’s solar developments to generate green hydrogen in Western Australia (WA). 
Posco has set itself a carbon neutrality goal of 2050, a target which the company is establishing a green hydrogen business to tackle. 
“Green hydrogen and ammonia are important factors in reducing carbon emissions as the world is in the transition to clean energy,” said Forrest. “I hope that with Posco’s participation in the first green hydrogen project conducted by FMG, both companies can grow together.” 
Twiggy’s green energy journey 
The partnership with Posco is one of many deals ‘Twiggy’ Forrest and his executives have secured in recent months. Forrest himself has been putting serious miles on the engine of the FMG private jet in a world tour to set the stage for the company’s renewable energy business, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). 
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Forrest returned to WA last week after “his four-month mystery world tour.” After undertaking a “formal supervised 14-day quarantine period in New South Wales” Forrest received an exemption from the WA Government to return to the state without an additional quarantine. 
At the FMG Annual General Meeting (AGM) in November, it was revealed that Forrest intended to visit up to 47 countries on his search for renewable energy projects and mineral resources for FFI. 
Although much of the adventure has been kept secret, it is known that Forrest began his journey in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia where national leaders signed non-binding agreements with FFI for multi-billion dollar renewable projects. Next stop, Afghanistan, then onto Japan where Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Iwatani Corporation signed an MOU with FFI to investigate the potential for a liquid hydrogen supply-chain. Presumably, Forrest’s next stop was to meet with Choi and Posco in Seoul. 
It is also believed Forrest or his executives have been on scouting missions throughout Europe, the US, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, the Congo, Kenya and Ethiopia. 
FMG’s share price has more than doubled in the last year, making it Australia’s fourth-biggest listed company. Of course, much of this surge has to do with the rising iron ore price during the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is clear that Forrest himself is not sitting back and enjoying his mining billions. The magnate is on a mission to transform his empire into a global green force.

The development of the microgrid was aided by a $2.5 million grant from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), and a $3.7 million debt financing agreement on top of $1.3 million in the company’s equity for the project.
This is not the first time the minigrid has been interrupted in its generation as its construction was said to have suffered delays in final commissioning as a result of parallel infrastructure upgrades at the naval base.
In a statement to the ASX, Carnegie said the Department of Defence (Defence) is making significant electrical upgrades as part of the HMAS Stirling Redevelopment Stage 3A Project. These upgrades necessitated the connection point for the 2MW solar array and 2MW/0.5 MWh battery system to be refurbished

“Once the relevant construction and programming was completed by Defence’s contractors,” said the statement, “Carnegie was able to reconnect and test the new connection. With this testing complete, Carnegie has now been approved to recommence normal operations of the Garden Island Microgrid.
The microgrid includes the option for wave energy to be incorporated into the microgrid, along with a desalination plant already in operation onsite.

An international research team has developed a new energy management strategy to help manage oversupply in remote solar microgrids that rely on hydrogen fuel cells for backup power generation.
They demonstrated the model through the Transient System simulation program (TRNSYS) software on a PV system that was linked to a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. It provides electricity to the system when the load power exceeds the power generated by the PV plant. The 21.4 kW solar array has an annual power yield of 127.3 kW h/m2 under standard conditions.
“The total area of the PV power plant is approximately 205.3 m2, and the PV model of 100 Wp and a 1 m2 area is chosen,” the academics said. “The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is applied to the PV array to harvest the maximum PV power.”
The electrolyzer was designed with a capacity of 5 kW, which would be enough to absorb electricity generated by the solar plant and produce hydrogen for the fuel cell at times of intermittent PV power, the research group said.
‘”The electrolyzer efficiency in this model was 90%,” they explained. “The voltage of a single cell was 1.64 V for the 220-V stack voltage, which requires a total of 134 cells.”
This combination is able to produce hydrogen at seven bars and with high density. The hydrogen tank was sized at 22 cubic meters to store all the hydrogen production at 150 bars. The fuel cell was sized at the peak load power rate of 3 kW for on-peak loads.
The researchers conducted the simulations on a system in Beijing over a period of 12 months. Their project showed that the fuel cell operated at full capacity between March and September, when the PV system had higher energy production. The academics said the proposed system configuration and sizing ensured that the annual amount of hydrogen that was consumed would be the same as the annual amount that was produced.
“The results verify that the system was sized correctly,” the researchers said. “The overall system efficiency was estimated to be 47.9%, which was higher than that obtained in previous studies with the same configuration.”
They described the energy management system in “Efficient photovoltaics-integrated hydrogen fuel cell-based hybrid system: Energy management and optimal configuration,” which was recently published in the Journal of Sustainable Energy.
