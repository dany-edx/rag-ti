The 40 MWh battery energy storage system is expected to be the largest installed onboard a ship – four times bigger than the current largest installation.
The catamaran, designed to carry both passengers and freight, is being built for South American customer Buquebus and will operate between Argentina and Uruguay. The vessel will be capable of carrying up to 2,100 passengers and 225 cars at up to 25 knots.
Incat Managing Director Craig Clifford said the vessel will be driven by two electric drives mounted in pods beneath the hull with the batteries to power a series of electric motors that will drive “an extremely efficient, completely integrated” propulsion and water jet package.
“This ship will have leading edge technology in terms of zero emissions propulsion and storage systems,” he said. “Once in operation the shore-side charging systems will have 50% more capacity than any current installation world-wide.”

Technology group Wartsila has been nominated to provide the electric propulsion and waterjet system that will power the vessel. The Finnish company will also provide the energy management, power conversion and DC shore-charging systems for the project.
Wartsila has named Norwegian maritime energy storage systems specialist Corvus Energy to supply the battery systems.
Corvus Commercial Director Europe Halvard Hauso said with more than 40 MWh of energy storage, the battery modules and energy storage system package is four times larger than on any electric or hybrid ship currently operating.
“This vessel will be the largest of its type with the highest ESS capacity and it will also have the longest zero-emission journey, at the highest speed, and it will be charged with the world’s highest capacity chargers,” he said.

The battery systems are scheduled for delivery in the latter part of 2024 with the vessel to be delivered in 2025.
Clifford said the build has attracted global attention and that the interest is expected to magnify as the maritime industry’s decarbonisation journey gathers momentum.
“The feedback from overseas has been extraordinarily positive,” he said. “I expect that we are going to see many more battery electric ships built.”
Incat said it has already started working toward the construction of a second but smaller battery-electric vehicle and passenger ferry.

The new Regional Microgrids Program also incorporates ARENA’s existing $50 million Regional Australia Microgrid Pilots Program, taking the total funding pool to $125 million across both streams.
ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said the First Nations stream of the funding will underwrite the deployment of local microgrid projects to better meet the electricity supply needs of remote indigenous communities.
Miller said electricity provision in remote and regional communities is often heavily reliant on diesel which is unreliable, expensive and emissions intensive.
“It’s vital we make sure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote communities are able to participate in the electricity transition and share in the benefits of Australia’s renewable future,” he said.
“Remote communities relying on fossil fuels like diesel have unique challenges in transitioning to renewables and this new funding will help overcome barriers to broader deployment of microgrid solutions.”
ARENA said microgrid projects under the First Nations stream will be developed in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, including First Nations renewable energy experts, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups, and state and territory governments.
Both streams of the program will aim to resolve remaining hurdles to final investment and full deployment of microgrid solutions.
Funding applications are now being accepted with the program to run until December 2025 or until funds are exhausted.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/25/analyst-suggests-rule-change-could-reduce-battery-funding/,"ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 25, 2023",Analyst suggests rule change could reduce battery funding,"The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is proposing a rule change that would require batteries with a capacity of 5 MW or greater to contribute to the market by providing primary frequency response (PFR) services when discharging and charging.
Batteries currently only provide PFR services if they’re dispatched above zero in the energy market. The proposed rule changes, which would impact all batteries enabled for frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), could require batteries to cycle up and down at all times.
PFR services have historically been provided by generators such as coal and gas plants and AEMO said the new rules are necessary to stabilise the power grid as thermal generators continue to exit and the system increasingly relies on weather-driven power generation sources such as wind and solar, as well as batteries.
There are however concerns the rules could have the opposite effect and harm economic efficiency of batteries and system reliability.
Cornwall Insight Managing Consultant said Oliver Skelding said analysis suggests the proposed rule change could create more market uncertainty for batteries and risks further delaying the clean energy transition.
“This rule change could have unintended consequences for the electricity market,” he said. “Batteries are already facing challenges in finding financing. The introduction of a mandatory obligation to provide PFR when enabled for contingency FCAS could make it even harder.”
Skelding said batteries are currently able to discharge their energy at economically optimal times, often when electricity prices are high. Under the new rules, batteries could end up being forced to discharge energy at less profitable times, such as in the middle of the day, to compensate for small changes in frequency, lowering their revenue.
There may also be implications for the contingency FCAS markets as battery operators decide to reduce support in these markets to conserve energy for the evening peak, Skelding said.
There are also concerns about the implications that increased cycling of batteries could have on battery warranties and battery degradation over time.
“If the implementation of the new rule ultimately leads to fewer batteries or cuts their lifespan, the grid will be worse off than it was before the change,” Skelding said.
The Australian Energy Market Commission is currently accepting stakeholder submission on the proposed rule change. The consultation process is scheduled to close on 31 August 2023.
Skelding acknowledged that the increase in intermittent renewable generation in the grid dictates that there will need to be more PFR contingencies put in place but suggested there may be more palatable alternatives available.
“Given the preference for using price signals to meet contingency FCAS requirements, it would seem most prudent to do the same for PFR and elicit a market-based response from the technologies that are best placed to provide that service,” he said.
“The AEMO has some big decisions to make as we transition towards a greener future, and we await the results of the consultation to see the direction it intends to take.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/25/csiro-startup-pursues-hydrogen-tech-for-heavy-industry/,"HYDROGEN,RESEARCH,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 25, 2023",CSIRO startup pursues hydrogen tech for heavy industry,"The CSIRO and Sydney-headquartered RFC Ambrian have co-founded Hadean Energy to advance the development of the CSIRO’s tubular solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) technology which it said promises to significantly reduce hydrogen production costs and in doing so help to decarbonise heavy industry.
The International Energy Agency estimates demand for hydrogen will increase 138% by 2030, but high production costs and energy inputs are key challenges for producing green hydrogen.
The CSIRO said its SOE technology, which relies on ceramic tubes with electrodes on the inside and out, produces hydrogen by electrolysing water using a combination of heat and electricity. The agency said SOE requires less than 42 kWh of electricity to produce a kilogram of hydrogen while alkaline and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) alternatives require about 60 kWh/kg of hydrogen.
Sarb Giddey, lead scientist on hydrogen research at CSIRO, said the technology has the potential to produce hydrogen at a higher efficiency and lower cost, allowing industry to dramatically reduce emissions.
“It allows industrial waste heat to be integrated back into the industrial processes, which decreases the electrical energy required to produce hydrogen or syn-gas by up to 30%,” he said.
“It’s great news for industry, because integrating the hydrogen product back into industrial processes onsite also eliminates storage and transport costs while drastically reducing the use of fossil fuels in the industrial process.”

CSIRO said it will now establish a pilot scale demonstration plant at BlueScope’s Port Kembla Steelworks on the New South Wales south coast to trial the technology in an industrial environment.
RFC Ambrian Chief Investment Officer Stefan Skorut said the technology is well placed to address the existing industrial hydrogen market which is currently almost 100% derived from fossil fuels.
“While SOE is the most efficient method of electrolysis, green hydrogen and synthetic fuels will remain uneconomic unless we address the scalability and cost of electrolysers,” he said.
“CSIRO’s tubular SOE technology represents a step change improvement across these metrics.”
The trial with BlueScope will commence in April 2024. The CSIRO said findings from the trial will help to demonstrate the technology at a higher scale and confirm the technical robustness of the equipment. Hadean Energy will have exclusive rights over the SOE technology.

TotalEnergies will not fully integrate Total Eren into its renewables business. The transaction follows a strategic agreement between the two companies in 2017, which allowed TotalEnergies to take full control of Total Eren after a period of five years.
According to figures provided by the two companies, Total Eren is valued at $5.89 billion. The acquisition of the 70.8% stake represents a net investment of about $2.5 billion. The integration of Total Eren is expected to result in an approximately $270 million increase in the net operating income of TotalEnergies’ Integrated Power segment in 2024.
Total Eren currently operates 3.5 GW of assets globally and possesses a diverse portfolio of more than 10 GW of solar, wind, hydroelectric, and storage projects across 30 countries. This includes nearly 1.2 GW under construction or in advanced stages of development.
TotalEnergies will leverage Total Eren’s operational 2 GW assets in liberalized markets, notably in Australia, Portugal, Greece, and Brazil. In addition, TotalEnergies said it will capitalise on Total Eren’s expertise to develop projects in countries like India, Argentina, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.
Total Eren has also initiated green hydrogen production projects in Australia, North Africa, and Latin America. These projects will continue under a new partnership, led by an entity known as TEH2 (80% owned by TotalEnergies and 20% by the Eren group).

It will install 35 MW of capacity in cooperation with the ABCD-Horizon consortium, which includes Swiss energy company Aventron, BG Consulting Engineers, and Cargo Sous Terrain.
Dhp Technology said its systems will use proprietary technology to retract and extend solar panels based on weather conditions, so they can be retracted based on hail storm forecasts.
“Thanks to the lightweight construction and the patented folding mechanism, wide distances between supports and great heights of up to 6 meters above the ground are possible,” the company said. “This keeps the traffic routes free for large vehicles and goods.”
The structure houses lightweight, glass-free solar panels with folding capabilities, interconnected by cables and built with stainless steel and special plastic, with a rust-resistant coating. The company said the modules maintain performance consistency and experience no mechanical stress during extension and retraction, matching conventional panel performance.
The 45 arrays will primarily supply electricity to EV charging stations, while excess power will be sold to Averton and three other Swiss energy suppliers: Primeo Energie, Stadtwerke Winterthur, and Energie Wasser Bern. Construction will start in early 2024, with all projects to be finalized by 2027, according to the consortium.
