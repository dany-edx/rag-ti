Consultations on Australia’s National Electric Vehicle Strategy began last September. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, then promised the strategy would make Australia a globally competitive market for electric vehicles. Households and businesses would have access to the best modern transport technology at affordable prices.
But does the strategy live up to these expectations? Is it ambitious enough to meet our emission-reduction targets and international commitments? And how far does it go to align Australia with world-best practice for the transition to electric vehicles?
In short, the strategy represents a step in the right direction but falls short of introducing meaningful new measures to speed up this transition, at a time when urgent interventions are needed.
Great to see Australia finally has a national electric vehicle strategy, after years of lagging behind. Plenty still to be done and more details needed, but this is a positive step for reducing our transport emissions.#ElectricVehicles #EVs https://t.co/tPDvovti39

Transport is Australia’s third-largest – and fastest-growing – source of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars produce about half of all transport emissions.
One of the quickest ways to cut these emissions is to accelerate the current slow uptake of electric vehicles.
Although EV sales almost doubled between 2021 and 2022, they represented only 3.8% of all new vehicle sales in 2022. That’s well below the global average of 12-14%. And it’s way behind world leader Norway where 87% of cars sold now are electric.
An ambitious national strategy, backed by robust fuel-efficiency standards, is vital for decarbonising Australia’s road transport. It will also improve air quality and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and imported oil.
During consultations on the strategy, around 500 submissions were received, representing the views of more than 1,500 individuals and over 200 organisations.
A key feature of the strategy is a commitment to introduce Australia’s first fuel-efficiency standard for new cars. Frustratingly, though, the government has delayed finalising the standard until the end of 2023, pending yet further consultations with industry on its development.
Australia is the only country in the OECD without mandatory fuel-efficiency standards for road transport vehicles. They are needed urgently now as an important step to increase the supply of electrical vehicles to Australia.

Bowen on Wednesday said the government will not introduce any bans or stop companies selling any type of vehicle in Australia. Instead, they will be required to sell a “good proportion” of electric and fuel-efficient vehicles. But no targets were mentioned.
Aside from the planned fuel-efficiency standard, the strategy introduces one other important initiative related to recycling and reuse of electric vehicles and batteries.
The rest of the strategy falls short of providing any substantial policy directions or targets to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. Instead, it mainly confirms existing programs and policies, such as the electric car discount, and other already announced plans to upgrade charging infrastructure and the National Reconstruction Fund to boost local manufacturing.

The strategy does not provide new incentives to help Australians with the cost of buying an electric vehicle. There is also no mention of targeted subsidies or measures to ensure equity. Instead, the government said it will work with states and territories on nationally consistent principles to ensure demand stays strong.
The strategy also fails to acknowledge the need for a holistic strategy to decarbonise road transport. Other policy interventions are needed to lower emissions from transport, which cannot be achieved through vehicle electrification alone.
The strategy also falls short on measures to accelerate the adoption of electric trucks and heavy commercial vehicles. Freight transport networks and supply chains present particular challenges for reducing emissions. It is equally important to incentivise adoption by providing cheap loans and increasing supply of reliable, sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to diesel trucks.
Importantly, too, the strategy does not stop subsidies and incentives for fossil fuel vehicles.
A credible strategy would need to consider a so-called feebate system. Feebates involve placing a levy on purchases of vehicles with high emissions and using the revenues to provide rebates for purchases of vehicles with zero or low emissions to offset their higher prices. Examples include France’s Bonus Malus and New Zealand’s Clean Car Discount. If developed carefully, these systems can be a cost-neutral method of discouraging purchases of high-emission vehicles and encouraging purchases of electric vehicles.
 
In the past few weeks, the United States and the European Union have announced some very ambitious plans that make the Australian strategy look very modest.
The US has proposed strict new emissions limits that would require two-thirds of vehicles sold in the US to be electric by 2032. The proposal, if ratified, will represent the most aggressive vehicle emissions reduction plan in the US. It will deliver, on average, a 13% annual pollution cut.
The EU also had plans to ban the sale of internal combustion engine cars from 2035. In February, the European Parliament approved the ban, which was later revised to allow some combustion engines running on e-fuels to be sold beyond 2035. Still, this remains one of the world’s strongest measures to phase out fossil-fuel vehicles.
By placing road transport decarbonisation on the national agenda, the National Electric Vehicle Strategy represents a positive step. But it falls short of matching the ambitious plans of other developed nations.
The much-anticipated fuel-efficiency standard will be key to demonstrate Australia’s commitment to reducing transport emissions. The standard will need to be mandatory, rigorous and robust. Clear targets on electric vehicle sales and timelines for phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles are needed.
If the standard is not carefully designed, we will continue to let down future generations, and the planet.

Stage one involves the construction of a 460 MW battery energy storage system with a dispatch duration of two hours. Origin has secured planning approval from the NSW government to increase the overall capacity of the battery up to 700 MW and four hours dispatch duration.
“Approval of the Eraring battery is an important milestone for Origin and another significant step in our strategy to lead the energy transition and accelerate renewable energy and storage in our portfolio,” Origin Chief Executive Officer Frank Calabria said in a statement.
“We are pleased to make this significant capital investment in Origin’s first major battery project to support the growth in renewable energy that’s occurring across the NEM, together with the expansion of our own portfolio of renewable energy developments.”
It is anticipated the energy storage facility will come online in the final quarter of 2025, shortly after the last of the coal-fired generation units at the Eraring power station is scheduled to shut down.
Origin, one of Australia’s largest energy generators and retailers, announced last year that Eraring will be closed in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled, as the continuing influx of wind and solar power has made the plant uneconomic to run.

Origin’s head of energy supply and operations, Greg Jarvis, said the battery forms part of plans to replace Eraring’s capacity and when developed, it will play an important role in underpinning reliable electricity supply for customers in NSW.
“Eraring is a strategic site with high-quality connection infrastructure enabling us to deliver energy into major demand centres,” he said.
“Development of the Eraring battery is a key next step as we look to transform the Eraring site for the future, given our intention to exit coal-fired generation by as early as August 2025.”
Origin said agreements have been executed for the supply and construction of the battery, with Finnish group Wärtsilä to supply and build the first stage of the battery. Adelaide-headquartered contractor Enerven, a subsidiary of SA Power Networks, has been appointed to provide design and construction services.
The announcement comes as the last three generating units at Liddell power station, also in the Hunter Valley, are being powered down for the final time. Australia’s oldest coal-fired power plant is scheduled to be shut down completely on 28 April.

The project will comprise more than 930,000 PV panels mounted on single-axis trackers spread across a 1,250-hectare site about 10 kilometres north of Gulgong, approximately 115km east of Dubbo.
Construction proper of the project, located within the planned Central-West Orana Renewable Energy Zone, is scheduled to start next month with works to be completed by May 2025. It is expected the project will generate up to 400 jobs during construction.
Once complete, it is anticipated the facility will produce 1,000 GWh of renewable electricity each year, enough to power more than 185,000 homes.
The project also has development approval for a 200 MWh battery energy storage system that will allow it to be adapted to dispatch energy during peak hours and provide critical grid stability services.
ACEN has awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the Stubbo Solar Farm to the Australian arm of Canada-headquartered general contractor PCL Construction. A connection agreement has been signed with infrastructure service provider Lumea and a PV module supply contract has been executed but ACEN this week announced 14 new work packages have opened for EOI registration for the project.
PCL said the main work packages include civil works, ground pile and mechanical installations, electrical installations, construction of the operations and maintenance facilities, the supply of cables and electrical equipment, and fencing installation.
The tender process for the various scopes of works will continue into August 2023.
The Stubbo Solar Farm is ACEN’s second utility scale solar project in construction, with the 400 MW first stage of its planned 720 MW New England Solar Farm officially opened last month.
ACEN said it has more than 1 GW capacity in construction, and more than 8 GW capacity in the development pipeline, with its Australian projects forming part of its ambition to grow its renewable portfolio in the Asia Pacific region to 20 GW by 2030.

The funding will be used to build and operate a pilot plant in Sydney near Novalith’s existing research and development hub as the company moves toward the development of a commercial demonstration plant for its patented LiCAL extraction process which it said uses less water, smaller infrastructure, and is a lower cost than current industry standards.
Novalith’s technology uses the carbonic acid in carbonated water instead of strong acids or bases to extract the lithium from resource deposits, forming a lithium carbonate that is then concentrated to create battery grade lithium.
The conventional rock-based lithium extraction process works similarly but uses large amounts of chemicals including sulfuric acid and produces large amounts of waste.
Novalith founder and Chief Executive Officer Steven Vassiloudis said the LiCAL process has the potential to significantly decarbonise the lithium supply chain as well as unlock new lithium ore reserves and opportunities, “providing low-cost and environmentally sustainable lithium to a world that is rapidly racing towards an electric future.”
“To pave the way for a truly sustainable future in lithium-ion batteries and their uses, we have to decarbonise production,” he said. “We want to take this one step further and turn carbon waste into carbon value. We’re using CO2 and sequestering it as part of our process. Doing so, we can minimise across the board – less infrastructure, fewer chemicals, no toxic by-production, less water, and less cost.”
Novalith estimates its technology cuts process costs by up to 65%, cuts plant costs by 50% and reduces plant carbon footprints by 25% when compared with conventional processes. The company also said the process uses 90% less water than current approaches and allows faster access to lithium to help meet rapid electrification ambitions.

CEFC Chief Executive Officer Ian Learmonth said the approach could also allow for Australian-produced lithium ore to be processed closer to mine sites, offering an opportunity for Australia to become a major processing, manufacturing and trading hub for lithium resources as demand continues to grow.
The CEFC expects global demand for lithium-ion batteries to soar from 700 GWh required in 2022 to some 4.7 TWh in 2030 to help meet rapid electrification ambitions. To fuel this demand, the world needs to produce up to 2.7 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by the end of the decade, a four-fold increase since last year.
“Australia ranks amongst the largest lithium producers in the world, and it’s clear the world will need more lithium than it has now,” Learmonth said. “Novalith’s ambitious technology is changing lithium production to make it greener and more cost effective to power the batteries we need for the storage and electric vehicles that are transforming our energy future.”
US-based Grantham Environmental Trusts’ venture capital vehicle Neglected Climate Opportunities Fund, TDK Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK, and Sydney-headquartered venture capital firm Investible also participated in the latest funding round.

Green Akku, a German supplier of solar modules for balconies, is now offering ZaunPV (fencePV), a plug-in PV system that can be easily mounted on garden fences.
The company supplies a complete set with selected solar modules, inverters, and special brackets, at a retail price of €416.81 ($456.3), plus shipping costs. The zero tax rate for residential PV is applied to end customers, while distributors have to pay the usual 19% value-added tax rate, according to Green Akku.
The PV system can be attached vertically to fences. It generates a higher amount of solar power, even when the sun is low and in winter. With manual skills, the plug-and-play system can also be installed on other types of fences. The inverters can then be connected directly to home networks via a safety plug.
Green Akku says the “ZaunPV” systems are designed for installation on garden fences, without the need for permits. In addition, it offers all materials needed to mount the systems on fences.
Green Akku recommends attaching the modules to fences that are positioned in south or east-west directions. Solar power is mainly produced in the morning and evening, when it can also be used directly in homes. With a southern orientation, the PV systems produce large amounts of solar power, especially during the middle of the day.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/04/20/agrivoltaics-for-grape-farms/,"BLOCKCHAIN,COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,HONG KONG,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"APRIL 20, 2023",Agrivoltaics for grape farms,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists from the City University of Hong Kong have developed a novel system design for agrivoltaic projects in grape farms.
The researchers described their findings in “Integrated techno-economic and life cycle assessment of shared circular business model based blockchain-enabled dynamic grapevoltaic farm for major grape growing states in India,” which was recently published in Renewable Energy. They said the new system design facilitates rainwater harvesting, with the solar array tilting to follow the direction of the rain. The system then stores and reuses the collected water for irrigation purposes.
The researchers used a circular business model (CBM) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies to coordinate between PV system operators and grape farmers.
“The proposed system will work even without blockchain configuration,” researcher Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar told pv magazine. “But with blockchain configuration, agrivoltaics work more efficiently with perfect co-ordination considering all the uncertainties that arise between the solar power generation and grape farming in terms of co-location shareable uses such as water for crop irrigation and solar panel washing. This is only possible when the system is able to track real-time weather and operate automatically via smart contracts.”
The academics used a resilience performance, life cycle analysis, and techno-economic (RePLiCATE) approach to demonstrate the multifunctional viability of the system across several grape-producing states in India. They claimed that the country’s current regulations for power purchase agreements (PPAs) are not making agrivoltaics viable.
“Smart contracts help in automating the agreements and provide a link to the energy and grape trading marketplace,” they said.
For its 1-ha “grapevoltaic” farm model, the research team considered vine–yard planning, solar PV configurations for vineyards, crop water requirements considering evapotranspiration, rainwater water harvesting potential, and energy requirements for groundwater extraction. The modeling involved  1,458 growing plants in 27 rows and a 504 kW PV installation arranged in 14 rows. The system featured panels with outputs of 100 W each and dimensions of 1,197 mm × 535 mm There was spacing 0.13 meters of spacing between the modules.
The panels have a surface that allows the free flow of water. The water can be used to clean the panels themselves or provide irrigation via a drip system connected to a storage tank.
The scientists said that the total revenue generated by a 1-ha Grapevoltaic farm could vary, depending on electricity and grape yield productions, electricity prices, and grape market prices. They said the proposed system can reduce water consumption for farmers and PV operators. 
“Agrivoltaics, in general, are a good solution for grape production as grape plant is shade tolerant but is also more sensitive to weather events,” Nallapaneni said. “To avoid these we need such high technical systems that can link, for example, the grape farm to GrapeNet platform where trade regulations and grape certifications can be done in one click.”
