“We’ll be 100% operational by the Christmas break,” earthconnect’s Mitchell Stephens told pv magazine Australia. “We’re in the final phases of commissioning, and completing our final quality checks this week, to make sure everything is working exactly as it should be before it will be fully energised.”
Earthconnect said once the system has been commissioned, and the communication has been established and proven, it will be energising the system, and in turn entering revenue service.
The 10 MWdc system, which has been rolled out in two stages, has been installed atop the roof of Australian-owned manufacturer APP’s enormous particleboard production facility in Oberon, about 180 kilometres west of Sydney.
Stage one of the project, which was installed some two years ago, delivered a 2 MWdc solar system while the latest stage has boosted that generation capacity to 10 MWdc.
The extension comprises 21,000 385 W modules spread across approximately 45 kilometres of mounting rail, coupled with 53 110,000 TL inverters. The new install combines with the 6,000 solar modules and 28 50,000 TL inverters that formed the original system.

“The amount of roof we’ve covered with panels is nearly 7.8 hectares … it’s enormous,” Stephens said. “It’s pretty impressive to stand up there on the roof and look at it.”
The massive rooftop solar PV system is expected to generate 14 GWh of clean energy each year, helping reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 14,980 tonnes annually.
Stephens said the rooftop solar system shapes as a triumph for APP, providing clean energy and maximising the site’s attributes.
“There’s not many facilities as large as this in Australia so it’s definitely a win-win,” he said. “The client is saving a lot of money on energy using what would otherwise useless space to generate a lot of clean energy.”
The Oberon system adds to APP’s already impressive rooftop solar portfolio, which includes a 1.3 MW solar installation at its Charmhaven manufacturing facility and a combined 2.1 MW of solar energy generation at its Somersby plant.
APP, which incorporates the polytec and Structaflor brands, is continuing to build its renewable energy generation with earthconnect to install another 2.5 MW of roof-mount projects in the first half of 2022, providing the manufacturer with a combined rooftop solar PV portfolio of approximately 16.3 MWdc of solar production.
Earthconnect has labelled the APP system the largest rooftop system in Australia, and it is certainly impressive at more than three times the size of the 3 MW solar panel installation on the rooftop of Moorebank Logistics Park in Sydney and it dwarfs the 1.2 MW of solar being installed atop Ikea Adelaide’s expansive rooftop on its store adjacent to Adelaide Airport, in South Australia.
But the ongoing rollout of rooftop solar means it is likely to be soon overshadowed with Green energy fund CEP.Energy earlier this year unveiling plans to build a 24 MW rooftop solar farm and a grid-scale battery with capacity of up to 150 MW on the site of the former Holden car manufacturing plant at Elizabeth in South Australia.

The APP system is the largest individual project delivered by earthconnect, which has a portfolio of more than 44 MW of solar installs, including the 5 MW Lovedale Solar Farm near Cessnock in the NSW Hunter Valley region, an estimated 14 MW of commercial PV projects and more than 17 MW of residential installations.
Earthconnect said the project is on time and on budget despite the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, inclement weather and interruptions to the supply chain.
“The biggest challenge for use has been the pandemic,” Stephens said, revealing that the lockdowns had made coordinating staff difficult while workers had to endure freezing conditions during winter.
The well-documented issues around module supply also impacted the project but Stephens said it had just required “a bit of shuffling around and reoganising”.
“In terms of that, we did get through the project without any significant delays in delivery just because of the massive scale,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/24/korea-minerals-giant-scoops-up-9-gw-australian-renewables-portfolio/,"HYDROGEN,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"DECEMBER 24, 2021",Korea minerals giant scoops up 9 GW Australian renewables portfolio,"Ark Energy, a wholly owned Australian subsidiary of Korea Zinc announced it will acquire a 100% interest in utility-scale wind and solar energy developer Epuron in a move which will support its ambition to become a major domestic supplier and exporter of green hydrogen and accelerate Korea Zinc’s vision to become one of the world’s largest producers of green zinc.
Ark Energy said it would acquire 4.2 GW of early-stage wind and solar development projects located across the National Electricity Market (NEM) jurisdictions with a focus on Queensland, New South Wales (NSW) and Tasmania. It will also acquire 4.8 GW of projects in the investigation stage and continue to deliver about 5.8 GW of projects under existing Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) that Epuron has already struck with other counterparties
The deal will see Epuron’s team of renewables developers transfer to Ark Energy, along with a 50% stake in Fulcrum3D, a data company specialising in monitoring and forecasting renewable energy sources, and about 7 MW of fully contracted off-grid solar generation assets in the Northern Territory.
The companies did not disclose the acquisition price.
Ark Energy chairman and Korea Zinc vice chairman Yun Choi said the deal will contribute to the group’s long-term ambition to develop a new green energy export corridor from Australia to South Korea and fast track Korea Zinc’s shift to renewable energy.
“Ark Energy’s commitment to accelerate the energy transition requires us to significantly enhance our capability to develop and build out a large renewable energy portfolio,” he said.
“We will leverage our parent company’s strong balance sheet to expand Epuron’s existing business model and leverage the group’s internal demand from the production of green non-ferrous metals, and our own demand from green hydrogen production, to fast-track the build out of Epuron’s development portfolio.”

Korea Zinc has pledged to power its entire operations with 100% clean energy by 2050 and to that end, Ark Energy has already announced plans to develop a renewable hydrogen facility at its Sun Metals zinc refinery in Townsville.
The SunHQ hydrogen hub, which will be equipped with a 1 MW electrolyser, is expected to produce about 158 tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, powered by renewable energy from the 124 MW Sun Metals Solar Farm located next to the refinery.
The buyout of Eporon follows Ark Energy’s acquisition earlier this year of a 30% stake in Acciona Energy’s 923 MW MacIntryre Wind Farm in Queensland which is scheduled to be fully operational by 2024.
Established in 2003 by Andrew Durran and Martin Poole, Epuron has developed more than 3 GW of wind and solar capacity around the country with about 1 GW of that now operating or under construction.

Among its developments are the 90 MWp Clermont Solar Farm in Queensland, since sold to German-owned developer Wirsol, and the 132 MWp Nevertire Solar Farm in north-west NSW, which was purchased by Elliott Green Power in 2018.
Poole said the company has been part of a significantly changing energy market since its establishment over 18 years ago.
“With the energy transition accelerating, it is a hugely positive step for us to be joining a group with Ark Energy’s track record and shared vision to scale up investment in renewable energy production in Australia,” he said.
“We have made a significant contribution to Australia’s energy transition to date and look forward to doing even more over the next chapter with Ark Energy.”
Ark Energy’s acquisition of Epuron remains subject to standard regulatory approvals, including Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/24/carbon-air-batteries-vs-hydrogen-storage/,"ENERGY STORAGE,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,JAPAN",MARIJA MAISCH,"DECEMBER 24, 2021",Carbon-air batteries vs hydrogen storage,"From pv magazine Global
H2/H2O-power-to-gas-to-power systems that produce hydrogen by electrolysis and generate electricity from this hydrogen are promising large-scale electric energy storage systems for grids that are hosting ever greater share of intermittent renewables. On the flip side, such systems require complex thermal management and must be sufficiently large to improve the utilisation of waste heat for higher system efficiency.
With this in mind, researchers from Japan’s Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) are proposing an alternative system: a “carbon/air secondary battery” (CASB) that uses a carbon/carbon-dioxide redox reaction with potentially higher volumetric energy density and system efficiency than those of the hydrogen energy storage systems.
The CASB system is an electric energy storage system that consists of a solid-oxide fuel and electrolysis cell (SOFC/ECs) where carbon generated via electrolysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) is oxidised with air to produce energy. The SOFC/ECs can be supplied with compressed liquefied CO2 to make up the energy storage system.
“Similar to a battery, the CASB is charged using the energy generated by the renewable sources to reduce CO2 to C. During the subsequent discharge phase, the C is oxidised to generate energy,” explains Professor Manabu Ihara of Tokyo Tech.
The researchers tested both the energy density and charge-discharge efficiency of the system. While the energy density of the CASB is limited by the amount of carbon it can hold, they found that the CASB had a higher volumetric energy density compared to hydrogen storage systems.
In addition, for the first time, repetitive power generation (10 charge-discharge cycles) of the CASB system with Boudouard equilibrium was demonstrated without degradation. Specifically, during the charging phase, C was deposited on the electrode via the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and the reduction of CO via the Boudouard decomposition. During the discharge phase, the C was oxidised to CO and CO2 via the Boudouard gasification reaction and electrochemical oxidation respectively. The researchers found that the C utilisation for energy generation of the CASB depended on the equilibrium between the three different carbon species (C, CO2, CO), also known as the “Boudouard equilibrium.”
The CASB system was able to utilise most of the carbon deposited on the electrode for energy generation, achieving maximum Coulombic efficiency of 84%, indicating that most of the stored energy can be obtained during the discharge phase. Furthermore, it demonstrated charge-discharge efficiency of 38%, and power density of 80 mW cm−2 at 800° C and 100 mA cm−2.
“Compared to hydrogen storage systems, the CASB system is expected to have a smaller system size and higher system efficiency”, says Prof. Ihara. The findings were presented in the paper “Carbon/air secondary battery system and demonstration of its charge-discharge,” published in Journal of Power Sources.

This week, KKR, along with consortium partners the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board (Ontario Teachers’) and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), gave themselves an early Christmas present by completing the acquisition of all issued securities of Spark Infrastructure in an all-cash transaction of approximately $5.2 billion. 
Spark owns a 49% stake in Victorian distribution operators Powercor and Citipower along with a 49% stake in South Australia’s distribution network operator SA Power Networks, a 15% stake in NSW transmission operator Transgrid and in July announced plans to develop a 2.5 GW hybrid wind, solar PV and battery storage project in New South Wales while the 100 MW Bomen Solar Farm came online last year.
It was only regulations which stood in the way of the takeover after the company’s shareholders approved the $5.2 billion takeover with 99.51% of security holders voting in favour of the creditor scheme resolution.
A director on KKR’s Infrastructure team in Australia, Andrew Jennings, described Spark Infrastructure as “a world-class business that plays a critical role in Australian communities. Alongside Ontario Teachers’ and PSP Investments, we look forward to working with the management teams of Spark Infrastructure and its portfolio companies, to support the business’ objectives to improve grid stability and build secure, high-quality and cost-effective electricity infrastructure for customers across the country.”
Ontario Teachers’ managing director of infrastructure and natural resources for the Asia Pacific, Bruce Crane, said the investment aligns perfectly with support for the transition to a low-carbon economy. And PSP Investment’s senior director Sandiren Curthan noted: “As Australia transitions away from coal, Spark Infrastructure’s electricity transmission and distribution networks are well-positioned to enable the clean energy transition toward a low-carbon economy.”
Spark Infrastructure (ASX: SKI) was removed from the Official List of the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday, Dec 23, 2021.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/24/promising-sydney-startup-sundrive-fabricates-its-first-full-sized-panel/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"DECEMBER 24, 2021",Promising Sydney startup SunDrive fabricates its first full-sized panel,"Sydney-based solar startup SunDrive, which created the most efficient commercial-sized silicon solar cell in the world in September, has taken to social media to announce its latest feat – the successful fabrication of its first full-size solar panel. 
From a garage in Sydney’s south, SunDrive’s chief executive started the company with former flatmate David Hu in 2015 based on a solution developed while completing his PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), adding another chapter to UNSW’s storied solar history. 
The solution, reached by hundreds of experiments in trial and error, amounts to a major shakeup of the solar industry’s Chinese cell manufacturing supremacy, replaces traditional and expensive silver use in solar cells with the much more abundant and much cheaper copper. Copper is not as conductive as silver, nor as adhesive to the solar cell, but Allen’s solution rectifies this disparity as evidenced by its 25.54 world efficiency record confirmed by the German Institute for Solar Energy Research (ISFH). 
This week’s announcement that SunDrive has successfully fabricated its first full-size panel is another major milestone on the company’s journey from photovoltaic breakthrough to commercial success. 
“From our process engineers interconnecting every cell to our build team designing the tools to make all this possible, everyone has put in immense effort to making this a reality,” the company said in a post on LinkedIn. “We are now gearing up to fully automate our technology as we continue to grow our world class team.” 

The big “If” of SunDrive has always been whether it can mass produce its technology. If so, the Aussie startup could usher in the next great solar panel cost reduction while also lessening the industry’s dependence on silver, a precious metal of rapidly increasing price. 
Silver is central to today’s solar panels. It is estimated solar panel manufacturing accounts for approximately 20% of the world’s annual consumption, a figure which is only going to increase thanks to the next generation of high-efficiency cells which can require up to three times more silver than previous generations.

Allen has previously said SunDrive’s aim is to produce the cells locally, optimistic that they can compete with large solar manufacturers in Asia while protecting their intellectual property.
“The industry today is at a point where the land and labour costs are becoming less and less significant in the total cost of manufacturing … obviously it does mean that we need to at least match that similar level of automation and throughput, but we do see opportunity to do it in Australia,” he said.

On top of more than $2 million in grants from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), SunDrive has already attracted high-profile investors, including Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes’s Grok Ventures.
