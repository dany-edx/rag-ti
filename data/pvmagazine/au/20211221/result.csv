Not only does our status as rooftop solar leaders contribute to this, but also the fact of our geographic sparseness which has separated our major grids and created numerous remote ‘islands’.
It means that across Australia there’s opportunity to test a number of different ways to orchestrate distributed energy resources (DERs). Which is precisely what’s happening.
Project Symphony is the name of Western Australia’s virtual power plant (VPP) launched earlier this month. Funded by various government bodies, what’s different about this program is that it’s set up two new markets: one for the delivery of local network services and the other a ‘constrain to zero’ market.
The reason for these new markets is that while VPPs see retailers orchestrate assets, all they’re really looking at is the energy market spot price or the Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) price, Mears said. “That, of course, doesn’t take into account the physics of the distribution network,” he told pv magazine Australia.
“So [the Australian Energy Market Operator] AEMO and the networks have been looking for the best approach: how do you accomodate the constraints to keep the physics working well but still allow a level playing field, not constraining value for VPP operators?”

“The interesting thing about Western Australia is they’re looking to a market to try and price those things,” Mears said.
“Those local markets are new, they’re not in the [National Electricity Market] NEM. This is a new market that is being set up specifically for the [South West Interconnected System] SWIS by AEMO. That’s the main bit that’s the innovative part,” he added. 
SwitchDin was recently selected to deliver the VPP technology platform for Project Symphony. While these new markets won’t radically shift the way it deploys its technology, Mears said it is “driving some new developments” in terms of how the company optimises assets.
“So depending on where you live, it may be that you can enable your system to be orchestrated for opportunities in those markets,” he added.
On the east coast, a different approach is on the cards – that of the dynamic operating envelope. These essentially put an upper and lower limit on the flow of electricity into a customer’s site. 
The upper limit might be peak demand, for instance, and the lower limit peak export, Mears explained. These bounds or limits are set by the utility and can be adjusted moment to moment – making them far more versatile than, say, tariffs.
South Australia’s recently-created flexible export market is basically a dynamic operating envelope, Mears says, but one that exclusively uses the bottom bound (that of export). 
“We’re going to see in the future the upper bound, the demand bound, being adjusted as well. Especially, for example, with electric vehicle charging – which is going to bring a whole new challenge for peak demand.”
Behind the scenes enabling these new orchestration methods is, of course, software. Mears describes integration as the most “boring” bit of this, but also among the most vital. 
Not only does the software technology platform have to integrate with the DER, it also needs to integrate with the systems of the distribution network operator to be able to receive those measurements which allow the more advanced orchestration approach.
This integration ultimately enables better optimisation, which is in turn key to orchestrating “win-win scenarios” for both consumers and networks.

“If we know what this dynamic operating envelope is then we can actually change the way we optimise the system, we can take that into account, so we can reduce the potential negative impact of a tightening of those constraints, or we can take advantage of an opening of that constraint,” Mears said.
“That optimisation can work for the asset owner, so behind-the-meter, but it can also work for the VPP operator, so front-of-the-meter proposition into the market.”
SwitchDin is currently working on its optimisational forecasting, which it recently told pv magazine Australia it would be integrating into Simply Energy’s VPP, for which it is the technology partner. These new forecasting features, Mears said, will “absolutely” be part of Project Symphony too, as well as the Alice Springs Future Grid, on which SwitchDin is also partnering. 
“Alice Springs is an example of smaller scale setting. Of course, with a smaller grid, a microgrid like Alice Springs, it’s actually much more sensitive to the impact of uncontrolled solar and batteries and electric vehicles. So it’s really important managing networks in these settings to get ahead of those problems,” Mears said.
These three new VPP programs are “key deals” for SwitchDin, Mears said. The company currently has 42 team members in Australia, mostly based in Newcastle, but it is planning to double its staff by the end of next year.
This expansion, Mears said, is because the software company is “getting called into other markets” which are looking to Australia because of its DER management frontrunner status. A key market for the company will be the United States, for which electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a pain point.
SwitchDin is also looking to expand further into the commercial and industrial (C&I) market. “It’s a booming sector,” Mears said, noting the company will focus on a range of technologies there including community batteries, VPP services as well as broader energy management systems.

Both drawing from the same reports, the Chief Economist Resources and Energy Quarterly report and Resources and Energy Major Projects report, the Morrison government has dedicated an homage to fossil fuels, while the Queensland government has somewhat more prudently highlighted that its state has already earned and will continue to bring in billions of dollars from hydrogen, battery minerals and rare earths projects – which it describes as ‘new energy economy’ projects.
Driven by the world’s growing hunger for batteries and advanced technology, Queensland exported almost $8.6 billion worth of aluminium, bauxite, copper and zinc in the 12 months to October 2021, it said.

Federal resources minister Keith Pitt opted for quite a different path, with his official statement on the release veering into comical territory as he called fossil resources the “bedrock of the Australian economy” which will “continue to deliver for our nation in the years ahead”.
“Hundreds of new projects in the pipeline, including 60 new or expanded coal mines,” he boasted. “Coal is the star performer.”
With the first 15 paragraphs dedicated to this shining star (though some other fossil fuels do get a mention), minister Pitt only gestures towards the increased prospects for lithium, nickel and copper once towards the end of the statement, right before lumping hydrogen next to carbon capture and storage projects, as if the blue hydrogen was its only form.

The long-duration solution, according to the company, is cheaper to build than pumped hydro projects and does not require drastic landscape reshaping.
It has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with resources giant BHP which will focus on using its storage systems at BHP operations as well as “exploring opportunities for new applications relevant to BHP’s business.”
This seems to be referencing the exploration of using waste materials to produce the Energy Vault composite blocks, include mining tailings and coal combustion residuals (coal ash), of which BHP probably has large stores it’s eager to rid itself of. Also posited was the idea of including fibreglass from decommissioned wind turbine blades to make the blocks.
Energy Vault’s storage durations start from 2 hours and continuing to 12 hours or more. There is zero degradation in the storage capacity of the raised composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time, said Energy Vault.
For the startup, the agreement would provide a foot in the door into the Australian market.
In August, Energy Vault secured US$100 million (AU$140 million) in Series C funding for its EVx tower, a six-arm crane tower designed to be charged by grid-scale renewable energy. It lifts large bricks using electric motors, thereby creating gravitational energy. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the bricks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
Energy Vault first commercial-scale deployment of the energy storage system happened in 2020, with the company launching its EVx platform this April.
The company said the EVx tower features 80-85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.
The company said its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from 2 to 4 hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from 5 to 24 hours or more.

The company’s largest to date, Redflow hopeful the US$1.2 million (AU$1.7 million) installation will enable its products to break into the considerable U.S. market. 
The battery system is comprised of 12 x 160 kWh ‘Energy Pods’ which are clustered into four strings tied to four 125 kW Dynapower inverters. The company said each of the four battery strings have now been successfully charged and discharged and have passed critical acceptance testing criteria. 
Anaergia recovers value from waste at its bioenergy facility in San Bernardino, which already has its own 2 MW biogas-fuelled cogeneration microgrid. The Redflow system will help to reduce peak energy usage between 4-9pm and maximise the microgrid’s efficiency.
The final test of the entire system will be executed next month, January 2022, when Siemens will integrate the battery into the microgrid controller and the facility can absorb the entire 2 MWh load of the energy storage system.
“This is a very significant milestone for Redflow. As our biggest single deployment system to date, Anaergia will provide a high visibility MWh reference installation for our growth into the United States and other global markets,” Redflow’s CEO and Managing Director, Tim Harris, said.
“I am delighted that we have passed this important stage. We have already had enquiries from multiple customers and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies who have requested a site visit in early January,” he added.
Once Anaergia’s Rialto Bioenergy Facility is fully operational, it will be the biggest landfill diverted organic waste digester facility in North America, capable of converting 700 tonnes of organic waste from Los Angeles and Southern California daily, as well as 300 tonnes of biosolids into renewable natural gas and Class A fertiliser.

Chinese PV module manufacturer Jolywood has commissioned a 1.5 GW TOPCon solar cell factory in Taizhou City, in China’s Zhejiang province.
“With this new manufacturing facility, our TOPCon solar cell production capacity has now reached 3.6 GW,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine. The other 2.1 GW of capacity comes from another factory located in the Jiangsu province. “Our new production plant will produce cells based on larger wafers with a size of 182mm.”
The company said the factory will produce n-type bifacial cells with fully automated production equipment relying on 5G intelligent automated guided vehicles (AGV materials) and product transmission systems.
“It is a great honour to invite you to witness the bright moment of the n-type technology gradually being recognised by the mainstream photovoltaic market,” said Jolywood chairman, Lin Jianwei.
The solar manufacturer added, it wants to further expand its TOPCon cell capacity over the coming years. “We are planning to build another 16 GW factory in Taiyuan, Shanxi province,” the spokesperson stated.
Jolywood presented, in October, a 700 W TOPCon solar module at Intersolar in Munich, Germany. The JW-HD132N panel is based on 210mm wafers built with the company’s n-type TOPCon 2.0 cell technology, dubbed Niwa Max, which the manufacturer said reached efficiencies of up to 25.4% in the laboratory.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/21/solar-for-hydroponics/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,CHINA,QATAR",EMILIANO BELLINI,"DECEMBER 21, 2021",Solar for hydroponics,"From pv magazine Global
A Chinese-Qatari research group has assessed the potential of integrating PV power generation with hydroponic farms (SAHFs), which are a kind of horticultural crops that do not use soil and utilise mineral nutrient solutions in an aqueous solvent, usually in greenhouses or closed spaces.
“Hydroponic systems provide water-efficient food production but they are not an energy-efficient solution,” the scientists explained. “This is because they require electricity for heating and cooling, ventilation, irrigation, LED lighting, and other horticultural practices to maintain the hydroponic farm operations in controlled environments.”
The scientists investigated, in particular, how a multi-period, electricity-intensive hydroponic crop production system may be coupled to a PV system under different incentive policies such as feed-in tariff (FIT) programs, rebate schemes, net metering and improving electricity tariff (IET) mechanisms, which consist of simply raising electricity prices for consumers or reducing existing subsidies to the electricity price.
Their approach considered various factors impacting PV system efficiency, including environmental factors, the type of solar array, and the electricity demand from the SAHF. A series of experiments were conducted assuming SAHF operations in Qatar. This framework should provide SAHF developers with enough information to ascertain if a PV system should be installed and which type of solar modules should be used, as well as for identifying optimal sizing and capacity.
For the business case in Qatar, the scientists took into account a 1200 m2 hydroponic farm containing 60 growing trays with an area of 10 m2 each, and an overall 600 m2 are used for growing. The farm has an estimated cost of US$4,984 per tray, with the interest rate being assumed to be 2.5%. Electricity and water tariffs were assumed to be US$0.036/kWh and $0.0015/L, respectively. Four crops such as tomato, cucumber, lettuce and pepper, as well as six types of PV systems were considered. One-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis was used to identify the best project configuration under the four different incentive schemes.
The incentive threshold under the IET policy was found to be US$0.0425/kWh, while for feed-in tariffs and net metering the threshold was US$0.0063/kWh and $0.027/kWh, respectively. For the rebate scheme, a minimum rebate of 14.90% was considered necessary.
The scientists explained that the IET scheme is the most effective in pushing farmers to resort to solar, although it is the more expensive for them, while feed-in tariffs and rebates are indicated an ideal solution for solar hydroponics farms with limited size. “For the hydroponic farmers, once it is profitable to engage in solar energy generation and the right type of PV system is selected, the best strategy is to take full advantage of the available space to maximise the PV system capacity if the surplus electricity can be sold to the grid or other entities,” they emphasised. “The profit of the SAHF is more sensitive to the subsidy levels of the surplus FIT and IET than other policy parameters, while the outputs of the farm show insensitivity to all the subsidies.”
The proposed model was described in the paper “Decisions on design and planning of solar-assisted hydroponic farms under various subsidy schemes,” published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The research group comprises scientists from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China and the Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar.
