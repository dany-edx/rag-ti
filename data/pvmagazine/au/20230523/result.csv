To help expedite the process for renewables, Commonwealth and state energy ministers have agreed to provide the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) with an additional $3 million (USD 2 million).
Federal energy minister Chris Bowen said the additional resourcing would be made available to ensure Australia has “maximum capacity in the lead up to next summer.”
“There’s a lot of investment into our grid, a lot of good work occurring in renewable transmission, but some of it is encountering delays in being connected to the grid, receiving approvals to connect to the grid,” Bowen said.
“So we’ve agreed to increase resources jointly between the Commonwealth and the states for AEMO now to get that work done more quickly, particularly over coming months.”
Australia’s strict grid connection standards were introduced following the 2016 blackout in South Australia, where it was discovered weather-related disturbances on grid led wind farms to switch off – an unforeseen reaction that ultimately contributed to the blackout.
“The whole connection risk has become a topmost risk for developers and investors,” Rajesh Arora, the technical director of power and industrial at global infrastructure consultancy AECOM, previously told pv magazine.
AEMO has been working with the Clean Energy Council to streamline Australia’s grid connection process for new energy projects.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/23/enphases-third-generation-iq-battery-system-launches-in-australia/,"INVERTERS,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 23, 2023",Enphase’s third generation IQ battery system launches in Australia,"Microinverter giant Enphase is launching its third generation IQ Battery home energy storage system in Australia, having opened preorders in May for delivery expected in July.
The AC-coupled ‘plug and play’ system features the modular IQ Battery 5P with 5 kWh capacity, scalable to a total of 20 kWh of storage per phase. The battery units are integrated with six bi-directional dual IQ8 microinverters, which provide a combined output power of 3840 W.*
Enphase has tripled its battery’s peak power output and doubled its continuous power compared to the previous model, promising that each 5 kWh battery unit can deliver 3.84 kW of continuous power, 7.68 kW of peak power for three seconds, and 6.14 kW for 10 seconds. This, Enphase says, will allow homeowners to start heavy loads during an outage.
The battery also features a ‘Sunlight Jump Start’ feature, with the new IQ8 microinverters capable of restarting the system using only sunlight should a prolonged grid outage drain the battery. 
The system’s software can configured for self-consumption, savings, or full backup functionality, and also has a Storm Guard monitor, which uses data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to automatically charge the battery ahead of severe weather events potentially causing outages. 
The IQ Battery 5P comes with a standard 15 years warranty, which the company says makes it the longest on the market.*
Australia will be the first country outside of North America to get the third generation system. The home battery is currently being piloted by a select group of Australian installers, which seems to include Penrith Solar Centre, Energy SA, and G-Store.
It was also on display at this year’s Smart Energy Conference in Sydney, where rise of home storage was certainly the key takeaway from the exhibition.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/23/major-funds-for-state-owned-clean-energy-venture-education-and-innovation-in-victorias-new-budget/,"FINANCE,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"MAY 23, 2023","Major funds for state-owned clean energy venture, education and innovation in Victoria’s new budget","Victoria’s treasurer Tim Pallas has released the state’s new budget, delivering on the promise made in April to allocate $1 billion towards the freshly revived State Electricity Commission (SEC), which is aiming to re-establish government-owned energy and eventually operate 4.5 GW of renewable energy generation and storage projects in the state.
The Victorian Budget 2023/24 also includes substantial funding for clean energy education, with $50 million for a TAFE Clean Energy Fund, $116 million for six new Tech Schools and a Clean Energy Equipment Fund, as well as $19 million for work experience placements in the clean energy sector for 10,000 students.
“Since Victoria’s energy was privatised, we’ve experienced a chronic shortage of workers in trades,” the government’s announcement says. “Our SEC will help find and train the next generation of tradespeople: maintenance workers, lineys, electricians – but also welders, painters and mechanics.”
“We’ll invest $12 million to develop new VET [vocational education and training] qualifications, fund a business case for the SEC Centre of Training Excellence and deliver on the Victorian Energy Jobs Plan to map out the jobs needed and prepare the workforce to get those jobs done.”
The government is also investing $10 million in a Hydrogen Energy Worker Training Centre, $6 million for a Wind Worker Training Centre and $20 million to realise the state target of 75% – 80% emission reductions by 2035.
In terms of transmission, $20.6 million will go towards government entity VicGrid’s planning and community consultation. Given the recent commotion around the major VNI West project, additional community consultation appears vital.
On top of commonwealth funds and commitments, the Victorian government is putting $58.2 million towards installing 100 new neighbourhood batteries “at targeted locations across Victoria.” This funding, it says, will triple the number of homes with access to a battery and providing crucial extra storage capacity for local communities. The Victorian government also has an interest-free loan program for household batteries.
To support the state’s resources sector “and renewable energy agenda,” $23.2 million will go towards streamlining and reforming the approval processes for minerals projects, including the critical battery minerals sector which is surging particularly in Western Australia and Queensland.
The government has also provided $2 billion for its ‘Breakthrough Victoria’ initiative, which identifies five “future-focused” industries: the ‘clean economy,’ advanced manufacturing, agri-food, digital technologies, and health and life sciences. 
Looking at the budget, it seems advanced manufacturing largely refers to medical manufacturing. Despite its significant funds, the budget doesn’t include a huge amount of information on the Breakthrough Victoria initiative, which appears to be an avenue for the government to invest in clean technology innovations. What it does say is a further $21 million will go towards providing support for businesses wanting to access the Commonwealth’s $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund – of which renewables and low emissions technologies are a key focus.
The Victorian government has also allocated $15 million to its Industry R&D Infrastructure Fund which will incentivise private industry investment into research and development in the clean economy space. 
The commission is really the centrepiece of the government’s clean energy funding. On top of the $1 billion seed funding, Victoria’s government has provided $44 million to prepare SEC for ‘its presence,” presumably offices, in Morwell and Melbourne.
SEC will become an active energy market participant in Victoria, working with industry to invest in and speed up the delivery of renewable energy and accelerate the energy transition.
In April, Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio launched SEC’s Pioneer Investment Mandate which includes the project criteria and process for the commission’s first investment. The successful project resulting from this process is expected to be announced before the end of 2023.
It is anticipated the state will retain a 51% stake in its renewable energy projects alongside “like-minded entities,” such as industry super funds, the preferred investors for the remaining share.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/23/researchers-assess-degradation-in-pv-systems-older-than-15-years/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,GERMANY,POLAND,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"MAY 23, 2023",Researchers assess degradation in PV systems older than 15 years,"From pv magazine Global
Scientists at the Polish Academy of Sciences have studied PV installations older than 15 years and observed a decrease in energy productivity ranging from 1.9% to 2.9% over a 16-year period. They conducted their tests on two rooftop PV systems in Sinsheim, a town in southwestern Germany.
The first system, a 37.8 kW grid-connected array, consists of 252 glass-backsheet solar modules, each with an output of 150 W, provided by Suntech, a Chinese manufacturer. The second installation is an 18.48 kW PV system comprising 112 Suntech glass-backsheet modules with an output of 165 W. Both systems utilise inverters from Solarmax, a German manufacturer.
Based on their analysis using NREL’s HOMER software, the scientists reported that the PV installations generated a total of 958 MWh during the 2004-2021 period. They also observed that the larger system experienced some inverter failures in 2009 and 2010.
The research group discovered that the 18.48 kW system exhibited higher energy unit productivity compared to the 37.8 kW array, particularly in 2009 and 2014-2015. They determined that the annual degradation factor for the first system was 0.11%/year, while for the second system it was 0.20%/year.
Furthermore, the researchers found that the actual energy production per available irradiation was 0.817 for the 18.48 kW system and 0.826 for the 37.8 kW system. The measured specific yield divided by theoretical specific yield for the initial two years of operation was 96.8% and 95.8%, respectively.
Their analysis also indicated a power degradation rate of 1.9% in the largest system and 2.9% in the smaller system over the 16-year period. Additionally, the yearly power degradation rates were observed to be 0.11%/year for the 37.8 kW array and 0.20%/year for the 18.48 kW installation, which the researchers noted as significantly lower values compared to those reported in existing literature.
Thy described their findings in “Evaluation of degradation energy productivity of photovoltaic installations in long-term case study,” which was recently published in Applied Energy.
“The main strength of the proposed extended methodology is the elimination of the impact of weather conditions on the scale of annual differences,” they concluded.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/05/23/maxeon-raises-300-million-for-ibc-module-manufacturing-expansion/,"FINANCE,MANUFACTURING,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,UNITED STATES",MICHAEL SCHOECK,"MAY 23, 2023",Maxeon raises $300 million for IBC module manufacturing expansion,"From pv magazine USA
Maxeon Solar Technologies has priced a public offering of shares to raise USD 157.4 million ($237 million) in equity proceeds. It said it would use the funds for Maxeon 7 module production and general corporate purposes.
Maxeon is selling 7.48 million common shares of stock, including 1.87 million shares of historic investor TotalEnergies, at a price of USD 28 per share. At closing, the company anticipates receiving more than USD 157 million in gross proceeds. The offering was upsized by 10% from an initial announcement that Maxeon made of selling 6.8 common shares, according to a company statement. The add-on public offering was expected to close on May 19.
BofA Securities and Morgan Stanley served as joint book-running managers for Maxeon’s offering. Raymond James and Roth Capital Partners were co-managers for the offering. In an additional private placement transaction, TCL Zhonghuan Renewable Energy, a current 23.7% shareholder in Maxeon, will acquire 1.5 million shares in Maxeon stock for about USD 42 million.
TCL Zhonghuan is a Chinese semiconductor manufacturer primarily engaged in the solar market. In July 2020, Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor was acquired by TCL after the consumer electronics manufacturer won an auction to buy shares of its parent, state-owned Zhonghuan Electronic Information Group.
Maxeon is using the equity raise to fund the 500 MW capacity expansion of its cell manufacturing capacity for Maxeon 7 interdigitated back contact (IBC) panels, which is expected to increase its  manufacturing capacity of the next-generation panels by about 50%, the company said.  Maxeon 7 IBC panels are expected to be the world’s most efficient solar panels at approximately 24% module efficiency.
The IBC manufacturing expansion would utilise a previously closed Philippines warehouse with module assembly to occur at other existing Maxeon facilities. The Philippines facility will be designated as a “Fab5” facility and located near Maxeon’s existing Fab4 site, which currently hosts the Maxeon 7 pilot line.
Maxeon said Fab5 site production will ramp up in the second half of 2024. The company said new volume produced at Fab5 will be sold to the distributed generation (DG) markets, including expanding supply volume into a new U.S. residential channel market. Additional new Fab5 expansion capacity will allow more shipments to its European market and rebalance the mix of Maxeon and Performance line sales.
Total capital expenditures (capex) for Maxeon’s IBC expansion are USD 200 million, of which about USD 50 million is for site preparation and long-lead time items included in prior 2023 guidance. Including the USD 157.4 million and USD 42 million of add-on and private placement proceeds, the company’s 2023 capex budget remains at USD 150 million to USD 170 million, of which USD 100 million relates to the Fab5 ramp up.
Domestic content guidance
In US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Maxeon said the company’s management was reviewing the May 12 guidance from the Internal Revenue Service related to domestic content bonus incentives under the US Inflation Reduction Act.
For taxpayers using the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit (ITC), eligibility for the domestic content bonus would increase the credit by 10%, which in most cases is from 30% to 40% of the cost of a qualifying solar property. By power output, using the production tax credit (PTC) would increase by 10% as well as a result of domestic content eligibility.
“IRS guidance is supportive of our announced plans to deploy a multi-GW cell and module factory in the US to manufacture solar products for both the DG and utility-scale power plant markets,” said Maxeon said. “We are currently evaluating this guidance, which provides guidelines for how the solar products we will produce help our customers qualify for the domestic content bonus in the ITC and PTC and prescribes requirements for certain record-keeping and certification.”
Maxeon was spun off from SunPower in August of 2020, when both became separate entities. TotalEnergies owns a minority interest in Maxeon.
The company’s Performance line of solar modules leverage Maxeon’s shingled cell technology, originally developed by SunPower. The technology is protected by 83 granted patents. The 425 W modules use bifacial mono-PERC solar cells made on large-format eight-inch G12 wafers, and have an efficiency of 20.6%, according to Maxeon.
Maxeon is based in Singapore but lists shares on the Nasdaq Capital Markets exchange, where it currently trades at USD 28.66 per share today with a USD 1.3 billion market capitalisation. The company has 5,344 employees worldwide, of which based primarily in Mexico (39%), Malaysia (33%) and the Philippines (20%), according to its annual financial statement.
