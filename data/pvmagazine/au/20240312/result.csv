The CEIG, which represents more than 20 institutional investors with a combined generation portfolio of 16 GW and combined portfolio value of $38 billion (USD 25 billion), said government support has been required on 50% of current utility-scale battery projects, indicating the financing challenges that confront the sector, particularly for longer-duration batteries.
Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) projections estimate a demand of 19 GW of storage by 2030 and capacity growth in the next five years from the current 1.4 GW of batteries and 1.6 GW of pumped hydro is an estimated 57 GW by 2050.
The Energy storage financeability in Australia report, commissioned by CEIG in collaboration with Nexa Advisory and Baringa Partners, provides insights into Australia’s energy storage market and the imperative for action to deliver the required energy storage capacity.
CEIG Chief Executive Simon Corbell, former deputy chief minister of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), said efforts to meet energy storage needs for 2030 and beyond require collaboration between government, industry, and investors and the challenges need to address the sector’s ability to drive investment, innovation, and policy reform.
“The report unveils a significant financeability gap, particularly for energy storage solutions beyond two hours which are pivotal for ensuring grid reliability as we decarbonise the grid,” Corbell said, noting that the report highlights the need for targeted financial sector reform.
Other barriers to deployment outlined in the report include operational hurdles, such as complex planning processes and difficulties in securing agreements with transmission network service providers and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).
New markets for battery storage with support from the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) and AEMO and investment in long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies, supported by Federal and state funding are key strategic recommendations outlined in the CEIG report.
Nexa Advisory Chief Executive Stephanie Bashir said the report is an urgent call to action for federal and state governments, specifically energy ministers who should ensure fit-for-purpose approvals for storage.
“Governments need to facilitate private investment by giving certainty and removing regulatory roadblocks,” she said. “That will accelerate new markets and contracting of services for energy storage and ensure we can scale investment.”
Bashir said the data shows meeting Australia’s goals is possible, “but the time for discussion, debate and soundbites about intent is over.”
“We need to do this right now,” she said.
Ensuring transparency in Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) mechanism development through stakeholder involvement and guaranteeing revenue certainty for batteries through coal-fired power station closure certainty, are also among the recommendations outlined in the report.

1,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/12/uq-start-up-tips-all-in-one-om-system-to-save-solar-farms-millions/,"TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,2024-03-12,UQ start-up tips all-in-one O&M system to save solar farms millions,"A tech start-up from The University of Queensland (UQ) has developed a system that utilises machine-learning algorithms to analyse existing data and detect, locate and identify faulty and underperforming solar panels in real time, and to recommend targeted maintenance.
The Solaris AI system has been developed to detect, locate and identify any faults and underperformance issues in large-scale solar farms. It also tries to see if there are any trends or patterns which indicate likelihood of occurrence of the faults in the future.
Associate Professor Rahul Sharma from UQ’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science said the technology is able to monitor data that is already available at the solar farms, including the current and voltage data, and locate potential performance issues down to individual array and panel string levels.
“Using the data, Solaris AI’s algorithms are meant to sequentially extract information about the degradation across the farm, soiling levels across the farm or wiring faults across the farm and that information is then translated into actionable items for the on-site technicians, that is where the maintenance work needs to be prioritised,” he said.
“Solaris AI is an all-in-one solar farm operation and maintenance system.”
Sharma said the technology, which requires no specific hardware to be installed for it to work, could significantly reduce the amount of generation lost to underperformance, potentially saving solar farm operators an estimated $200 million annually.
“Underperformance in Australian solar farms cost the industry around $400 million (USD 261 million) a year,” he said.
“That’s a huge amount. We’re aiming for Solaris AI to reduce those losses by half, and potentially deliver an uplift in revenue of up to 8%.”
UQ said the Solaris AI system was tested in a pilot study on a small-scale solar farm before being trialled on a commercial solar farm.
Discussions are now underway to roll out the technology at Edify Energy and Gentari Solar Australia’s Hamilton solar farm at Collinsville in north Queensland and Genex Power’s Kidston solar farm in the state’s northwest.
Edify Energy Chief Executive Officer and founder John Cole said the technology offers a potential solution to the challenge of detecting faulty or underperforming solar panels at large-scale solar farms.
“The key to maintaining grid reliability and achieving success as a network operator is effective and efficient asset management,” he said.
“This technology has the potential to drive solutions to the world’s energy crisis.”
Solaris AI was founded by UQ’s commercialisation company UniQuest, spearheaded by investment from Uniseed as well as the UniQuest Investment Fund. The project also benefitted from a partnership with German electronics and connection technology company Wiedmueller, which supported the creation of early prototypes.

2,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/12/bp-increases-stake-in-26-gw-australian-renewable-energy-hub/,"FINANCE,HYDROGEN,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,2024-03-12,bp increases stake in 26 GW Australian Renewable Energy Hub,"Macquarie Group announced it has completed the sale of its 15% share in the estimated $55 billion (USD 36.4 billion) Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) to bp which has boosted its stake in the solar, wind and green hydrogen project planned for Western Australia’s north coast to 64%.
Robert Dunlop, head of Macquarie’s global resources team, confirmed the transaction on social media.
“After five productive years as an active shareholder, we are pleased to have completed the sale of our 15% interest to bp, who will continue to drive this project forward,” he said.
The sale gives bp a 64% share in the project after its initial acquisition of a 40.5% stake in 2022, which was later increased to almost 49% through share purchases from project founders InterContinental Energy and CWP Global.
Hong Kong-based green hydrogen developer InterContinental Energy and Australia-based CWP Global retain a 26% and 10% stake, respectively, in the project.
The AREH project proposes the deployment of a combined 26 GW of solar and wind near Port Hedland in WA’s northwest to power an estimated 14 GW of electrolysers, producing 1.6 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen or nine million tonnes of green ammonia annually for the local and export markets. The developers have also allocated at least 3 GW of generation capacity for Pilbara energy users themselves.
AREH has been in the planning stages since 2014 and was first announced in 2017 as the 6 GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub. It has continued to grow in scope since then and has secured state and federal government support, although it has faced some hurdles.
Despite the setbacks, bp has said it has made significant progress since taking control and is continuing to develop the project.
The company has previously indicated it is working towards a final investment decision on the multi-stage project in 2025 with the aim to start producing power at AREH by 2029, when the first phase of 4 GW of renewable power will get online. The two other stages of the project would be developed over the next decade.
The project is part of bp’s push away from fossil fuels to clean energy. It its 2023 strategy update, bp detailed plans to invest up to $98 billion in renewables, hydrogen, biofuels, and electric mobility to 2030 as part of its ambition to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner.

3,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/12/green-hydrogen-and-ultra-low-cost-solar-key-to-australias-superpower-vision/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,2024-03-12,Green hydrogen and ultra-low cost solar key to Australia’s superpower vision,"At the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) Board strategy day last year, I asked each of my Board members to predict what Australia’s emissions would be in 2050.
At the time, Australia’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions were approximately 500 Mt of CO2 equivalent, and my Board’s predictions for 2050 ranged from 250 Mt remaining (so only a 50% reduction on current emissions), all the way down to -70 Mt (that is, net negative).
I was shocked by the wide dispersion in views and I believe this highlights the uncertainty we face as to whether we’ll succeed in our goals, and the degree of optimism or pessimism inherent in each of us as to how we will navigate this complex transition.
With the science of climate change long settled and recent clear evidence of extreme temperatures, floods and droughts, it is critical that we act quickly and deliberately to reduce our use of fossil fuels and switch to cleaner, healthier and more sustainable renewable alternatives.
We have made incredible progress with the core renewable energy technologies of solar, wind, batteries and electric vehicles. Solar modules are both more efficient, and cheaper than ever. Electric vehicles (EVs) will, in the next few years, be more cost effective than equivalent internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles; and battery costs are on a rapid decline.
While we have achieved so much, in reality we are just at the beginning of the energy transition. Last year solar, wind and hydro were responsible for around 35% of our electricity generation, yet economy wide, these renewable technologies only made up 7.5% of final energy consumption. The fact is the vast majority of our energy still comes from coal, oil and gas.
We are just starting to tackle the hard to abate sectors like steel, aluminium, aviation, shipping and agriculture. To decarbonise our heavy industries, we will need new technologies, innovative policies and regulatory interventions, and broad community acceptance to shift these industries into a clean future.
To deliver a successful energy transition it is critical that we continue to develop, prove and then deploy new technologies.
And these new technologies need to be globally cost-effective and be inclusive of all Australians, especially First Nations communities on whose lands we are expecting much of the required infrastructure to be deployed.
ARENA plays a critical role in supporting the most prospective technologies to reach commercial maturity.
If we can deliver a successful energy transition, we can play our part in reducing global emissions – not just our domestic emissions but from the emissions that result when the commodities we export are processed overseas.
We can maintain a secure energy system, well-paying jobs, and export revenue on which our economy is so reliant.
And increase our prosperity by setting ourselves up as a renewable energy superpower – a leader in new energy technologies, the production of low-cost renewable energy, the mining and refining of critical energy minerals, and a place where new clean heavy industry takes place.
We know this won’t be easy or cheap.
And that we’re in a global competition for renewable energy projects, especially in hydrogen.
And so, it’s critical that as a country we have a solid strategy, that we are clear on what our role is in a net zero world, and that we are aligned and working well together at all levels of government and with the private sector.
I’d like to share with you ARENA’s unique and important role in Australia’s energy transition and in helping to deliver on the superpower vision.
So, what has ARENA achieved so far?
Since its establishment in 2012, ARENA has committed over $2.3 billion to around 670 projects throughout Australia.
We are perhaps best known for having established the large-scale solar industry in Australia, initially through the delivery of our nation’s first solar farms in Nyngan and Broken Hill, followed by the provision of $92 million in grant funding to 12 projects selected through a competitive process in our 2016 large-scale solar round.
As a result of these initiatives, Australia’s large-scale solar industry became commercially self-sustaining and ARENA grants are no longer required for traditional solar deployments.
We are seeing a similar pattern play out with large-scale batteries. ARENA first started supporting large-scale batteries in 2017. At that time grants of over 50% of the capital cost were required for projects to proceed.
In our latest large-scale battery round we awarded $176 million to 8 large batteries with grid forming capabilities. The grant amount was only 7% of the $2.5 billion capital cost and we’re confident that future projects will take place without the need for any grant support.
This is what success looks like for ARENA – when a technology starts being deployed by the private sector without the need for further ARENA involvement.
ARENA has also been instrumental in supporting some of our most important research initiatives through $127 million of committed funding to the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP), almost $50 million to the Australian Solar Thermal Institute (ASTRI), and significant funding to R&D programs in hydrogen production, zero emissions iron and steel, and in the pursuit of higher efficiency solar cells.
ARENA has also supported important work in the distributed energy space, electric vehicle charging networks, bioenergy, pumped hydro, new forms of storage, remote microgrids, alumina refining, green steel and green hydrogen.
Let’s turn now to where we are heading and some of the important areas we are focusing on.
I should first acknowledge the important changes to ARENA’s legislation that the Government secured in 2022, confirming ARENA’s role in supporting Australia’s emissions reduction commitments.
Around this time, ARENA set a bold new vision and strategy to support “global emissions reductions through technology innovation to the benefit of Australia.”
The key word in this new strategy is “global” – recognising that Australia has a massive opportunity to support other countries with their energy needs in a net zero world.
We have the potential to be a major global producer of zero emissions hydrogen, and derivates like ammonia and methanol; and low emissions metals like alumina and green iron.
There are two crucial technologies that stand out as particularly important in the superpower vision. The first is hydrogen, and the other is solar.
Hydrogen is particularly important because of its future role in steel making.
Steel making is responsible for around 8% of global emissions and Australian iron ore is implicated in around 40% of this. Put another way, the process of converting Australia’s iron ore into steel emits over 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 annually – that’s more than three times Australia’s domestic emissions from all sources.
ARENA has invested almost $300 million to date in around 50 hydrogen projects from early stage R&D through to first-of-a-kind commercial deployments.
ARENA is responsible for delivering the Government’s $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program. We received over 60 applications late last year, and following a thorough screening process we are now working with 6 selected projects ahead of their full application submissions which are expected later this year.
The green hydrogen industry is at a very early stage and significant grant funding is going to be required to deliver the first few projects and see costs come down. We’ve been clear that Hydrogen Headstart will likely only support 2-3 projects, and the industry is eagerly awaiting further direction and support to see Australia be a long-term reliable producer of this important decarbonisation commodity.
The other critical technology that ARENA is supporting is solar PV. On the surface, this may seem strange given that ARENA’s large-scale solar funding round in 2016 saw the industry established and self-sustaining.
The reality is there are really two types of solar PV. The current generation of solar PV that we are installing now on our roofs and on our lands generates green electrons at a levelised cost of around $60 / MWh. That’s highly competitive against coal and gas and will enable us to transition our electricity system to zero emissions renewable energy at a reasonable cost.
The problem is that transitioning our heaviest emitters off fossil fuels and making green hydrogen for our domestic and export needs will require much, much, cheaper electricity. We’ll need to get the cost of renewable electricity down below $20 / MWh to be globally competitive – this is two-thirds lower than today’s solar and wind costs.
ARENA has a significant focus on what we call “ultra-low cost solar” and we’ve set an ambitious target that we have labelled “Solar 30-30-30”. We are aiming to achieve module efficiencies of 30% (up from 22% today); and have large-scale solar fully installed at a cost of 30c per Watt, down from $1 per Watt today; and we plan to achieve this by 2030. Hence “30-30-30” – 30% efficiency, at 30c per Watt, by 2030.
If we can achieve this goal, we’ll have green electrons at a low enough cost to fully transition our heaviest emitters and we’ll be able to make millions of tonnes of low-cost green hydrogen every year to export as liquefied hydrogen, green ammonia, and green iron for export to Asia and Europe.
It’s not just about the availability and maturity of technology though. The superpower vision – enabled by ultra-low cost solar and green hydrogen – will require vast amounts of land to locate the many hundreds of gigawatts of solar and wind farms required to generate the underlying electricity.
To do this we need to spend the next few years planning the infrastructure and securing the equitable and respectful involvement of First Nations communities and landowners right across Australia.
Governments have a critical role to play here. Without the necessary land and social license, the superpower vision will not eventuate. We must work together to both improve the technologies and bring the whole of our society along with us so that everyone benefits.
To conclude, I’d like to return to the anecdote I mentioned at the start and share with you my prediction for what our emissions will be in 2050.
I am optimistic about the ability of humans to innovate and develop technological solutions to this wicked problem that we have created.
Just over 10 years ago I installed a solar PV system at my home in Sydney, and following a renovation I have just installed a new system that is four times larger, yet costs less than that original system.
In 2019 I bought an electric vehicle – it’s been the best car I’ve ever driven and after 4.5 years and almost 50,000 kms I am yet to have it serviced.
The new energy technology that we are developing is cleaner, better, more reliable, and increasingly cheaper than the old emissions intensive technology it is replacing.
The biggest challenge we face is one of coordination and alignment. We can’t be the best at everything, and other countries – notably China, the US and parts of the Middle East – are placing big bets to secure their role in the future net zero world.
If we can agree our future direction, develop our plans, and invest confidently over a sustained period then we’ll be on the track to net zero by 2050, or earlier, and we’ll set ourselves up to be a renewable energy superpower in a net zero world.

4,https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2024/03/12/vehicle-to-grid-tech-offers-potentially-lucrative-market-for-ev-fleet-owners/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY",EV FOLEY,2024-03-12,Vehicle-to-grid tech offers potentially lucrative market for EV fleet owners,"A new report from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) reveals that using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to provide Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) to the National Electricity Market (NEM) is a potentially lucrative way for fleet owners to monetise their electric vehicles (EVs).
The Insights from the Realising Electric Vehicle-to-Grid Services Project – Final Report comes after a two-year trial that explored the charging habits of EV drivers, the ability of EVs to provide grid ancillary services using V2G, and how EVs can provide a revenue stream for electric-fleet owners.
The Realising Electric Vehicle-to-Grid Services (REVS) project, launched in 2020, initially comprised 51 Nissan Leaf vehicles and 51 bidirectional Wallbox Quasar chargers across 11 buildings in Canberra. Data was however available for only 38 chargers, and discharge data was only available for 29 of them.
Sydney-headquartered research and advisory services Energeia was engaged to analyse the finding that included charger data, booking data, and the time stamps of grid events. This was then used to determine the economic value of using EVs in the FCAS market.
Energeia found that, based on 2022 data, the average EV could earn about $12,000 (USD 7,940) participating in the New South Wales (NSW) FCAS raise regulation market or about $2,600 in the NSW FCAS raise 60-second contingency market.
Similarly, the average vehicle could earn about $9,000 from participating in the NSW FCAS lower regulation market, or $2,000 from participating in the NSW FCAS lower 60-second contingency market.

Energeia said the results indicate that V2G could potentially be earning thousands of dollars per vehicle in the FCAS market, with the prospect for much higher profits if more powerful chargers were utilised.
“It is clear from the REVS trial data … that using V2G to provide FCAS to the grid has the potential to become a lucrative and cost-effective way for vehicle fleet owners to subsidise incorporation of EVs into their fleet,” it said.
Energeia said FCAS prices typically peaked in the late afternoon to early evening for the period observed, which aligned well with commercial vehicle availability.
“More than half of the discharging sessions started when the vehicle had an SOC of more than 90%, meaning that when FCAS were required, the vehicles were often fully charged,” the report says.
While some owners of EV fleets may be concerned that participation in the FCAS markets could result in drainage of vehicle batteries to a low level and have a significant impact on battery degradation, Energeia said this was not the case.
The total annual energy consumption of vehicles throughout the REVS trial was 18.4 MWh while the total energy exported from the EVs was 0.146 MWh, or 0.79% of total charging energy, highlighting how the trial vehicles were rarely called upon to provide FCAS services.
“The data shows little difference in starting and ending state of charge (SOC) during grid events, suggesting that contingency events require only a small amount of energy from these vehicles,” Energeia said in the report.
“This verifies that the number of FCAS events requiring energy to be drawn from EV batteries was minimal, suggesting low risk of premature battery degradation for EV owners participating in FCAS services.”
The REVS trial comprised a consortium of industry partners including Australian Capital Territory (ACT) electricity retailer ActewAGL, the Australian National University (ANU), JET Charge, Evoenergy, SG Fleet, the ACT government and Nissan.
Bjorn Sturmberg, Research Leader of ANU’s Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program, said V2G technology is available in a select number of mass market vehicles and chargers, and the maturity of the technology has already been demonstrated in overseas trials.
“EV batteries are large – roughly five times larger than household batteries, and when fully charged they typically store about as much energy as an average household uses over two to four days, so the national fleet of EV batteries could play a vital role in avoiding blackouts by jumping in to support the grid during disturbances, such as a fossil fuel generator trip,” he said.
The ANU is preparing a RoadMap for V2G, based on the REVS trial data.
ARENA Chief Executive Darren Miller said the agency would continue to focus on commercialising technologies than can aid the integration of EVs into the electricity system.
“Given its potential capability to provide similar services as household batteries, V2G has the opportunity to transform a vehicle into a revenue-generating device for consumers, through access to energy and network service markets and also to provide power solutions for the grid,” he said.

Gravity storage system provider Energy Vault’s first commercial EVx GESS has been connected to the grid in China.
Earlier this week, the company confirmed that the 25 MW/100 MWh EVx system, located in Rudong, China’s Jiangsu province, was connected in December 2023, enabling full commissioning by State Grid Corp. of China. The Rudong EVx project will be the world’s first commercial, utility-scale, non-pumped hydro gravity energy storage system once final provincial and state approvals are obtained for the start of commercial operations.
Work on the Rudong project began in 2022, when Energy Vault said it would build five storage projects in China using its EVx technology, with a combined storage capacity of 2 GWh. Commissioning began on the project, which is next to a wind power facility, in August 2023.
Energy Vault’s latest announcement coincides with reports of new EVx projects it is working on with its partners, CNTY and Atlas Renewable Energy. Construction began on a 17MW/68MWh EVx GESS deployment in China last year, alongside two previously announced projects in the country: a 50MW/200MWh EVx and a 25 MW/100 MWh EVx.
The update means CNTY and Atlas Renewable now have nine EVx GESS deployments underway in China, totalling 3.7 GWh.
