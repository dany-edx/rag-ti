The study, to be carried out by independent advisory firm GHD Advisory, is set to demonstrate whether Torrens Island, already the site of AGL’s in development $180 million grid-scale battery storage project to replace the existing gas plant, possesses the commercial and technical feasibility of establishing a renewable energy hub for domestic users and export markets. 
According to a statement from AGL, the consortium consists of: 
South Australia is a hub for hubs
AGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof described the feasibility study as being crucial in the establishment of a clean hydrogen industry in South Australia. 
“This is another big step forward in AGL’s vision for an industrial energy hub at the site of our Torrens Island Power Station and we are coming closer to repurpose the site,” Brokhof said.
South Australia is seeking to place itself as a key link in the future supply chain of green hydrogen globally. In addition to the South Australian Government’s own ambitions, Swiss multinational commodities trader Trafigura and its majority owned metals manufacturing business Nyrstar have unveiled plans to construct a $750 million hydrogen manufacturing facility at the Port Pirie smelter. 
The state’s nascent green hydrogen industry has also attracted financial support from the Japanese Government, which has awarded funding to the Marubeni Corporation. The Marubeni Corporation is planning to export the zero-emissions fuel produced using large-scale wind and solar energy in South Australia to the Indo-Pacific region.
And Japan’s biggest oil refiner Eneos, along with French renewables developer Neoen have announced they will undertake a joint study looking at the potential development of an international supply chain for an affordable and stable supply of green hydrogen produced from renewable energy in South Australia.
These projects, and AGL’s potential hub at Torrens Island, join a list of hydrogen projects in the state, including H2U’s Eyre Peninsula Gateway project, and Australia’s largest operating green hydrogen facility, AGIG’s 1.25 MW facility at Tonsley which is blending hydrogen into the existing gas network in nearby Mitchell Park.
We’ve signed a Memorandum of Understanding with industry partners to study the development of #GreenHydrogen at #TorrensIsland Power Station in #SA!
The project will explore a wide range of potential uses for #hydrogen #power which could serve local businesses & export markets.

“South Australia is emerging as a leader in the development of a hydrogen industry,” continued Brokhof, “led by a major investment in the sector by the State Government. AGL very much wants to be a key part of the future of hydrogen in this State.”
“This project also demonstrates the long-term investment AGL is making in the future of Torrens Island to transform the site to an integrated industrial energy hub.”
How feasible is it? 
Brokhof described Torrens Island as “perfectly positioned as a future energy hub” due to its strong grid connectivity, it’s access to South Australia’s growing renewables portfolio and firming technology, the proximity of potential green hydrogen using industry, a skilled workforce and connections to Port Adelaide for export ease.
“Whether it’s the early potential for co-firing hydrogen with our existing gas engines at Barker Inlet Power Station, the creation of 100% green gas networks for industry, or the development of low-carbon chemicals and future fuels right through to the production of green hydrogen for export, this feasibility study will explore it all,” added Brokhof. 
The feasibility study is set to be completed by the end of 2022, and considering the global interest in South Australia as a potential green hydrogen AGL’s established presence in the domestic market should put it on the front foot. 
Moreover, considering AGL already has a grid-scale battery in development on site, the company is well on its way to achieving the load profile required for green (or at least clean) hydrogen production.

The publicly owned utility said SPS had been deployed at locations throughout the Mid West and Great Southern regions with the latest installed near Shackleton, in the state’s Wheatbelt region about 200 kilometres east of Perth, after a bushfire tore through the area earlier this year.
SPS are renewable, self-sufficient power units that combine solar PV and lithium battery energy storage coupled with a diesel generator to enable back-up power. The modular units and scalable and range from less than 5kWh to 50kWh.
Western Power described WA as the “perfect place” for SPS systems with the units providing improved power reliability and quality for regional and remote customers, and a more cost-effective and safer alternative to traditional poles and wires.
“SPS is particularly beneficial for regional customers, where supply costs are high and power reliability is impacted by distance, terrain and severe weather events,” the utility said.
Western Power SPS project lead Margot Hammond welcomed the latest milestone but said “we’re only at the start, with 4,000 units to be rolled out before the end of the decade”, with a focus on properties where energy infrastructure is scheduled for significant maintenance.

Hammond said utilising SPS technology rather than replacing the traditional overhead infrastructure presents an opportunity to provide a more reliable service at a lower cost.
It’s expected that more than 50,000 power poles and 23,000 kilometres of conductor will be removed following the deployment of SPS units.
The program builds on a trial program of six SPS launched at farms in the Great Southern region of WA in 2016. Western Power said since those first units were installed, its estimated they’ve reduced the power outage time over five years from a likely 1,000 hours to just 72 hours with about 90% of the properties’ power supply met by solar PV – buffered by battery storage.
“It’s been a whirlwind few years,” Hammond said. “When you sit back and reflect on the journey, it really is amazing that these quite simple units pack as much punch as they do.
“It’s been a game changer for those regional customers that have often experienced outages due to the difficulties of supplying power along long, long lines where a lot can go wrong.
“And they get to tap into our abundant sunshine and power their properties with more renewable power.”

Hammond said the latest program milestone follows a recent Western Power customer research report that found high levels of satisfaction with SPS. Participating customers rated their overall satisfaction at 8.2 out of 10 (10 being excellent), while their satisfaction with poles and wires connection, pre-SPS, was lower at 6.7 out of 10.
Energy Minister Bill Johnston the survey results were a great outcome, with more than 75% of customers saying they were likely to recommend standalone power systems to others.
“The research also indicated renewable energy is important to rural customers, with a third of participating customers already using solar, and believing it was the way of the future,” he said.
The success of WA’s SPS program is expected to flow over to the eastern states with the Australian Energy Regulator beginning consultations to allow distributor-led units to become part of the national electricity system.
From August 1, distribution network service providers will be able to connect customers to SPS. Those connections will be allowed in instances where it may be cheaper, safer and more reliable than connection to the grid.

“The CEPU is calling on ElectraNet SA and the South Australian government to investigate and ensure that workers aren’t being treated like they’re disposable,” CEPU SA state secretary John Adley said in a statement.
“The current NEM energy crisis illustrates how crucial electricity infrastructure is to households and businesses. The vitally important job of rewiring the nation needs to be done efficiently and safely to deliver infrastructure that we can rely on.
“Downer needs to stop undermining the safety of its workers on this important infrastructure project and treat its workers with the respect they deserve.”
The CEPU said as well as forcing workers to share PPE, there are limited first-aid capabilities and communications on site, and increased exposure to silicosis due to constant presence of dirt and dust in accommodation.
“If Downer can’t provide proper safety standards … can they be trusted to properly build a power line?” Adley said.
While the CEPU said construction of the project has been halted, lead contractor Downer Group said in an emailed statement on Friday that work on the “project continues to operate as normal”.
“Downer is currently in negotiations with unions on a new Enterprise Agreement that will cover employees on the project,” a spokesperson said. “Downer remains committed to working towards a negotiated outcome. The safety of our people, contractors and communities is always Downer’s highest priority.”
Sydney-headquartered Downer commenced construction of the 270-kilometre Eyre Pennisula Link project, an upgrade to the existing electricity transmission network supplying the Eyre Peninsula, in May 2021 after being awarded a $245 million contract by South Australian network operator ElectraNet.
The project will provide a new double-circuit 132kV electricity transmission line from Cultana to Port Lincoln, via Yadnarie. The project will also pave the way for a future upgrade to the Cultana to Yadnarie section to 275kV and includes upgrades to substations at Cultana, Yadnarie, Port Lincoln Terminal, Wudinna and Middleback.
It was estimated the project would take about 18 months to complete, with ElectraNet saying the new line is expected to be energised by the end of 2022.

Kean met with NSW Governor Margaret Beazley late on Thursday to seek emergency powers giving him authority to direct coal and logistics companies to provide fuel to keep generators supplying energy for domestic use.
The move came after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) on Wednesday suspended the electricity wholesale spot market in the entire NEM until further notice. It is the first full suspension of the market since its inception in 1998.
Kean on Friday said it was unlikely that he would need to use the powers having received “very good news” from AEMO with the market operator indicating conditions in the state’s exhausted energy system were much better.
“AEMO have described the energy situation as much healthier and that’s good news,” he said.
“Generators that were offline have now come back online. We had a generator come online yesterday. That added 600 megawatts to the system that wasn’t there the night before”.
He said another generator was due to come online on Saturday, further bolstering reserve capacity.

Kean said the new powers would remain on stand-by in case there was an unexpected change to the situation, including issues with fuel security or logistical problems getting fuel to the site of generators.
“We want to make sure we’ve got everything in our tool kit to keep the system running and get through this period,” he said. “As I said, this morning’s update from AEMO gives me, and should give everyone, great confidence that we’re out of those difficult conditions that we saw earlier in the week.
“We’ll take advice from AEMO if we need to consider using them, but that’s not the advice … everything is looking much better than it was earlier in the week.”
Pressure on the grid is expected to ease from Friday and through the weekend, as more power units come back online.
AEMO said electricity reserves had improved but a number of generators were still offline and warned there were challenges due to fuel costs and sourcing issues.
Australian Energy Council (AEC) chief executive officer Sarah McNamara said on Friday coal plants were progressively coming back online and expected the market to soon stabilise.
“We are pleased to note that since Wednesday we have seen the return to service of some 1,900MW of coal plant previously under maintenance,” she said. “Generators are working around the clock to return more plant as soon as possible.
“After a period of re-stabilisation, the AEC expects the market to be able to successfully restart without the price cap in place.”

In his first major speech since being installed as Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Bowen will tell investors the new Albanese Government wants to unleash private investment in renewable energy projects and that he sees cutting emissions as a good investment opportunity.
“For too long, Australians had been led to believe that climate change posed a choice: The environment or the economy; the cities or the regions,” he will tell the summit, being hosted by the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), a collaboration of Australian and New Zealand investors.
“Good climate action can benefit us all because the truth is that good energy policy is key to good economic policy.
“The Albanese Government wants to unleash private investment. We want to give you the framework, the certainty and the partnership you need.
“More than that, as we get on with unleashing investment, we will show that the world’s climate emergency is indeed Australia’s jobs opportunity.
“Australia is under new management and Australia is open for business in the new global economy.”

Bowen’s address comes a day after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese committed Australia to a more ambitious greenhouse gas reduction target of 43% by the end of the decade, based on 2005 emissions levels.
Albanese said the nation’s new 2030 target will provide much-needed certainty for investors, claiming the Australia’s energy sector had been held up during the previous government’s nine years in power due to that administration’s failure to agree on a climate policy.
“What businesses have been crying out for is investment certainty,” Albanese said. “The certainty that they need to invest over a longer time frame than the political cycle of three years.”
The IGCC and its members, who manage more than $3.6 trillion in Australia and New Zealand, said the renewable energy sector represents an enormous investment opportunity, estimating the government’s adoption of stronger emissions reduction targets could unlock more than $130 billion in investment opportunities in “clean industries and new jobs” by 2030.
IGCC chief executive officer Rebecca Mikula-Wright said a lack of credible climate targets and policies has impeded investment in Australia but “investors stand ready to invest billions of dollars into climate positive solutions for Australia’s future”.
“It’s time to benefit from the enormous resources and transformational opportunities this country has,” she said. “Clear, stable and credible climate policy will enable Australia to be a global leader in the transition to a net zero economy.”

Jolywood‘s board has decided to scrap a plan to invest in Indonesia because the pandemic has complicated its efforts. The company cited a range of issues, from flights to logistics. Its original plan, announced in March 2021, was to invest in 1 GW of solar cell and 1.5 GW of PV module capacity in Indonesia. 
Hangzhou First Applied Material has announced plans to invest US$226 million (AU$324 million) in EVA film capacity expansion. The company, which is among the world’s largest manufacturers of EVA film for PV modules, plans to build a new EVA film production base in Vietnam. The plan still needs to be approved by several agencies and regulators in China, however. 
Qujing, a city in Yunnan province, has revealed plans to develop 18.3 GW of solar by 2024. More specifically, it aims to build 50 solar farms, with a total capacity of 4.83 GW, by the end of this year. It said it will install 4.91 GW in 2023 and 8.59 GW in 2024, when it aims to have generate 20 TWh of electricity per year from renewables.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/17/5-policy-decisions-from-recent-history-that-led-to-todays-energy-crisis/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"JUNE 17, 2022",5 policy decisions from recent history that led to today’s energy crisis,"Indeed, Liberal leader Peter Dutton is framing it as a recent catastrophe, saying it was caused by Labor “transitioning into renewables too quickly […] they are spooking the market.”
But this crisis hasn’t come out of nowhere.
We arrived here thanks to a series of policy decisions under previous governments – state and federal – that left Australia’s energy system ill-equipped to cope with the demands placed on it.
Here are five key policy moments that in part led to the power crisis engulfing Australia today.
The 1990s saw a trend towards privatisation of government-owned assets, on the logic that industry would run the assets more efficiently.
The Kennett government in Victoria had a strong policy to privatise generators and transmission assets, with South Australia and New South Wales also privatising energy assets.
However, the actual focus of industry is not to be efficient but to maximise shareholder profit (which may involve being more streamlined, but not necessarily). And so the the primary role of the energy sector to provide general benefits to Australian residents and businesses has been lost.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports began from the Gladstone LNG gas terminal in Queensland in 2015, during the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison era, connecting the eastern states’ domestic gas markets to the international price.
But the journey began long prior, with construction of this terminal beginning in 2010 (in the middle of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era). It involved years of strategy discussion, policy design and agreements.
These agreements, forged between industry and various state (especially the Beattie Queensland Labor government) and federal governments (going as far back as the Howard era), created an LNG export industry.
Unlike Western Australia, there was no domestic reserve for gas set up as part of the agreements. So on the east coast, we are now exposed to international gas prices.
Of course, in the lead up to creating the LNG export industry, federal governments perhaps could not have been expected to predict Russia’s invasion of Ukraine over a decade later, driving up gas prices.
But the decisions made around the Gladstone gas agreements allowed Australian gas to be shipped offshore and have led to extremely high gas prices domestically.

Under former prime minister Tony Abbott, the then-Coalition government removed the price on carbon created by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. This was arguably one of the most backward steps in the efforts to rein in Australia’s carbon emissions and did nothing to incentivise renewable energy production.
It also tried very hard to scrap the renewable energy target (RET) – eventually settling for just watering it down significantly.
The RET required energy retailers and large customers to ensure a share of their energy was derived from renewable sources.
An earlier form of the target was established in 2001 by the Howard Coalition government. The Rudd Labor government increased the target’s ambition in 2009.
In 2015 the Abbott Coalition government dramatically reduced the target, and it was easily met in 2019. Since then, there has been no additional hard incentive to build more renewables.
The reason renewables are still being built now is because they are cheaper than coal.
Investment would continue at a more rapid pace, except for problems renewable energy producers face in getting their power into the grid (more on that later).

In 2011, the Victorian Baillieu state government effectively put a stop to wind farm investment by creating a 2km exclusion zone around existing homes.
As researchers Lisa Caripis and Anne Kallies wrote in The Conversation in 2012, these laws: effectively give the owners of any dwelling within 2km of a proposed wind farm the power to decide whether or not the development should proceed.
This decision, combined with the reduced RET, really slowed down investment in renewables.
These laws were reformed in 2015 by the Andrews government in Victoria.
This is not so much a policy moment, but a lack of one.
Transmission infrastructure is the wires, poles and other bits of the system needed to get electricity from power producers to households and businesses.
Most major transmission projects in Australia connecting coal, gas and hydro projects to the grid have been built by governments and then later privatised. Under the current privatised system, getting new transmission lines built is a complex process.
Renewables generation projects are often built at smaller scales in remote locations and new transmission infrastructure is needed to connect them to the grid.
Many renewable energy projects currently cannot connect to the grid because transmission infrastructure can’t securely absorb the extra capacity.
Both federal and state governments have failed to enact policies encouraging investment in transmission projects that can serve renewables generation. This has set the system up for the failure we’re seeing today.
Of course, other policy decisions have also led to today’s crisis. For example, there’s been limited government policy encouraging the construction of batteries and pumped hydro in order to store renewable energy produced at times of lower demand.
The exception here is, of course, the tax payer funded Snowy 2.0 scheme, recently revealed to be running over time and over budget.
Without government intervention, it seems unlikely an orderly transition to renewables can be achieved.

The deals include utility-scale and distributed solar plants. The contracts are with independent power producers and customers in the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment.
The customers include Desh Energy, Sundrop Power, PDL-Greene Solar Power, Omera Solar, Walton Hi-tech PLC, Beximco Textile, and Edison Power.
Longi said Bangladesh is a typical South Asian country in that it enjoys up to 2,500 hours of sunshine per year.
“Despite the hot and humid environment in Bangladesh, Longi’s Hi-MO 5 modules can not only ensure product quality and performance in an all-round way, but also minimise land use and ensure the smooth operation of power station with the highest output to achieve maximal electricity production,” the company said.
In 2020, the company supplied PV modules for the 73 MW Mymensingh solar plant, which is about 120 km north of Dhaka. In 2021, it delivered solar panels for the 134.3 MW Mongla project.
In October 2021, Longi signed a deal with Beximco for a 280 MW ground-mounted PV array. The project is expected to be connected to the grid by the end of this year.
Qing Li, Longi’s Asia-Pacific vice president, said that the company will continue to accelerate the global energy transition with “innovative” solar products.
MM Ahsan Huda, country manager for Bangladesh at Longi Solar, claimed that the company is helping Bangladesh to achieve its green energy vision.
“We are also providing technical support to local developers, power producers, and C&I clients, alongside supplying PV modules,” said Huda.
