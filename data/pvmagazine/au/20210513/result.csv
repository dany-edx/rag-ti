A document published by the European Commission for the bloc’s Council of Ministers has identified various supply chain concerns related to the planned ramping up of green hydrogen production on the continent.
With the EU having already noted potential future shortages of solar panel and battery storage raw materials such as cobalt, lithium, aluminium, nickel, steel and copper; various basic materials needed for electrolysers, fuel cells and hydrogen storage have also been identified by the commission as potentially problematic.
The Strategic dependencies and capacities document published by the commission a week ago identified 30 raw materials which are sourced by the EU – and global rivals – from a limited number of countries. Of those, the commission identified 13 materials as critical to the deployment of green hydrogen production, with the EU aiming for 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyser capacity by 2024 and 40 GW this decade, from a base of less than 1 GW last year.
Most of the critical materials are catalysts, stated the commission study, with platinum, for example, accounting for around half the cost of a fuel cell stack. South Africa is the world’s primary source of platinum, noted the study, with Russia and Zimbabwe the next biggest suppliers. In terms of more processed materials needed for fuel cells, the EU is currently capable of producing only around 15-20% of them and is critically reliant on non-EU nations for four components: CFCs; certain polymers; carbon and cloth paper; and nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes.
The high-quality carbon fibre needed to construct compressed hydrogen tanks for storage and transport is almost entirely sourced by the EU from Asia as well, the commission said.
Solutions to the potential European supply chain dependencies – which are currently being highlighted in the medical industry by the Covid-19 crisis – include wider recycling of renewable hydrogen components, diversification of foreign supply, stockpiling by EU member states and reducing the rare metal content of such items. For instance, the platinum content of fuel cells has already been reduced and could be at least partially replaced with more commonly available palladium.
The document also noted the global semiconductor chip shortage which is starting to be highlighted as a problem by some solar manufacturers. With the Chinese, American, South Korean and Japanese governments already planning big investments to reduce their dependency on Taiwan for the world’s smallest, most advanced, 5nm chips, the EU is heavily reliant on U.S.-held design patents and on Asian nations for packaging, testing and the fabrication of such devices.
Europe, at present, is incapable of manufacturing chips smaller than 22nm and the commission said the stipulation at least 20% of its post-Covid Recovery and Resilience Fund be spent on projects for the digital transition could go a long way to addressing the problem. That 20% would equate to member states sharing €145 billion of digital transformation investment in the next two or three years.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/13/nsw-leads-nation-with-record-number-of-rooftop-solar-pv-installs/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES,QUEENSLAND,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 13, 2021",NSW leads nation with record number of rooftop solar PV installs,"Australia’s rapid uptake of rooftop solar PV continues unabated with the CSIRO distilling data provided by a handful of agencies, including the Clean Energy Regulator (CER), to reveal more than 362,000 rooftop solar PV installations were installed across the nation last year.
The national science agency said a record 365,740 solar PV installations were issued with small-scale renewable energy scheme certificates (STCs) in 2020 under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme.
The figure marked a 28% increase on 2019, when 283,991 installations were issued STCs, with the majority of installs were residential while a small proportion were commercial and industrial properties.
NSW topped the table with 108,922 rooftop solar PV installations in 2020 ahead of Queensland with 86,912. Victorian homeowners installed 71,798 systems while Western Australia (47,653) and South Australia (35,599) rounded out the top five.

The CSIRO’s analysis also revealed the postcodes where solar PV proved most popular and Victoria led the way with three out of the top five.
Homeowners in the 3064 postcode, which comprises the Melbourne suburbs of Craigieburn, Donnybrook, Mickleham and Roxburgh Park, installed 2,484 systems while residents in the 3029 postcode, covering the suburbs of Hoppers Crossing, Tarneit and Truganina, installed 2,345. The 3977 postcode area, encompassing Cranbourne, Sandhurst and Skye, installed 2.036.
The 2765 postcode area in Sydney was fourth on the list with 1,841 installations while Western Australia’s 6112 postcode, including the Perth suburbs of Armadale, Forrestdale and Bedfordale, installed 1,778 rooftop solar PV systems.
The best performing of the Queensland postcodes was 4553, including the Sunshine Coast suburbs of Caloundra, Currimundi and Moffat Beach, with 1,733 systems installed.

CSIRO senior experimental scientist Michael Ambrose, who was part of the team that produced the detailed figures, said the data reinforced that Australia has the highest uptake of solar globally with more than 2.68 million rooftop solar power systems installed in Australia as of December 31, 2020.
“The solar PV installation data shows how quickly PV systems have been taken up across Australia and the increasing size of the PV arrays,” he said.
“Australia is one of the sunniest places on the planet. We lead the world in PV capacity on a per capita basis at 591 watts per person which is almost eight times the worldwide average.”
CER executive general manager Mark Williamson said 3 GW of rooftop solar PV capacity had been installed nationally in 2020, a 40% increase on the 2.2 GW installed in 2019. All indications are for another bumper year in 2021 with another 3.5 to 4 GW of rooftop capacity expected.
Williamson said the growth has been driven by increasing system size, with the average rooftop solar PV system now between 8 and 8.5 kW, up from 6.6 kW
“Sustained low technology costs, increased work-from-home arrangements and a shift in household spending to home improvements during COVID-19 played a key role in the increase of rooftop solar PV systems under the SRES,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/13/solar-citizens-warns-controversial-sun-tax-shapes-as-threat-to-nem/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 13, 2021",Solar Citizens warns controversial ‘sun tax’ shapes as threat to NEM,"The results of a nationwide survey conducted by Queensland-based solar energy lobbyists Solar Citizens has raised concerns a draft determination put forward by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) could trigger an exodus of rooftop solar PV from the nation’s largest electricity grid.
The AEMC in March released its draft determination on how to integrate more small-scale solar and batteries into the NEM. Included in the draft is a proposal allowing for networks to levy a charge on solar PV owners for exporting their surplus electricity into the grid.
The proposed rule change, which has been labelled a ‘sun tax’, has sparked plenty of opposition with 95% of 1,300 people who took part in the Solar Citizens survey saying they were not in favour of the tax.
Solar Citizens said 63% of those surveyed said they would consider going off grid if the rule change is implemented, pointing to the possibility of a network ‘death spiral’.
Solar Citizens national director Ellen Roberts said a ‘death spiral’ is triggered when increasing numbers of solar PV owners exit the grid, resulting in higher network charges for remaining customers. The price hike can then lead to more households leaving the network, which causes the spiral to continue.
“The results of our survey indicate that solar households are upset about the proposed sun tax and are willing to take matters into their own hands,” Roberts said.
“It’s hardly surprising that solar owners are concerned. The big network companies are failing to manage grid voltage and now they want to pass the bill to everyday Australians.
“We know that grid voltages are too high even at night, so it’s time to stop blaming Australians who have made an investment in solar.”

The AEMC is looking to alleviate ‘traffic jams’ on the networkThe AEMC said the draft determination addresses the problem of ‘traffic jams’ on the network which are expected to get worse as more solar connects because the grid infrastructure was built when power only flowed one way.
“This is about creating tailored options, not blanket solutions,” AEMC chief executive Benn Barr said.
“We want to open the solar gateway so more Australians can join the 2.6 million small solar owners who have already led the way. But it’s important to do this fairly.
“We know there is a lot of interest in this issue. We’ve heard and understood the concern among some solar owners about whether they will be able to realise the value of their investment if the system changes.
“We want to reassure solar customers that we’re not proposing they should all start paying export charges. We expect networks to deliver pricing proposals in close consultation with consumers, which may include options where they don’t have to pay for exports.”
The AEMC estimates that households across the NEM will lose up to 8% of their export income under the new rules and Roberts said many solar PV owners are furious.
“Many of these homeowners and small business operators were encouraged by governments to install panels in the first place, doing so in good faith to slash their bills and do their bit for the environment,” she said.
“The last thing they expected was to be slugged with a new charge for producing cheap, clean energy.”

The AEMC’s draft determination has also attracted opposition from state governments with Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni among those to criticise the plan.
“Already we’ve seen the Queensland and Victorian governments indicate they don’t support slugging solar households, so now we need to see states like New South Wales and South Australia also step up,” Roberts said.
“It’s in the best interest of everyone for rooftop solar to keep thriving.”
Renewable energy generation accounted for 27.7% of Australia’s electricity supply in 2020, much of that attributable to rooftop solar PV which is responsible for 23.5% of that generation total.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/13/vast-solar-progresses-plans-for-600-million-solar-thermal-plant/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 13, 2021",Vast Solar progresses plans for $600 million solar thermal plant,"Sydney-based Vast Solar announced on Thursday the project is calling for expressions of interest from contractors across a range of workstreams as it looks to develop a 50 MW hybrid power plant in Mount Isa.
The proposed North West Queensland Hybrid Power Project (NWQHPP) will combine solar PV, a large-scale battery and gas engines with Vast Solar’s own concentrated solar thermal power technology, using mirrors and receiving towers to gather and store the sun’s energy.
“This is another significant milestone as we work through the feasibility study and get closer to turning soil on site,” Vast Solar CEO Craig Wood said.
“We are looking forward to hearing from a range of contractors who will be critical in bringing this project to life.
“Vast Solar has been engaging local contractors to deliver various services at the proposed project site since July 2020, and we look forward to continuing our commitment to providing local employment opportunities.
“(But) building the plant will require collaboration between local, regional and national experts from a range of fields, and will involve hundreds of workers.”
The call for expressions of interest comes after Vast Solar and Queensland Government-owned electricity generator Stanwell Energy earlier this year announced a joint development agreement to undertake a $10 million feasibility study for the NWQHPP.

The feasibility study, which will examine logistical details, planning requirements and financing, is one of several milestones to be reached before final investment decision and project approval.
It study is expected to be completed later this year, with approvals expected early in 2022, followed by two years of construction. Early generation could start in 2023 as part of a staggered construction program that brings some elements of the hybrid power plant into operations early.
Vast Solar said the NWQHPP will deliver dispatchable energy 24 hours a day. The company said the will produce 85% clean energy and use significantly less fuel than current generators.Mount Isa Mayor Danielle Slade has welcomed the project, saying it is “exactly the type of project our community needs”.
“Our local industries are crying out for affordable electricity and, coupled with the CopperString 2.0 project, this solar initiative will help to make that happen,” she said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/05/13/smart-energy-declares-government-missed-chance-to-recharge-home-battery-schemes/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 13, 2021",Smart Energy declares government missed chance to recharge home battery schemes,"Solar retailer Smart Energy has welcomed the Morrison Government’s allocation of $1.8 billion in the 2021-22 Budget for energy and emissions reduction initiatives, but has criticised the decision to ignore the rooftop solar PV sector with much of the funding dedicated to the government’s ‘gas-led recovery’.
Rooftop solar PV has been one of the great success stories for Australia’s renewable energy sector. Data provided by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) shows a record 378,451 systems totalling more than 3 GW of new small-scale capacity was installed across the country in 2021.
Renewable energy generation now accounts for 27.7% of Australia’s electricity supply and much of that is due to rooftop solar PV with the more than 2.5 million systems installed across Australia responsible for 23.5% of that generation total.
Despite the record rollout of rooftop solar, Smart Energy co-founder and director Beau Savage said the small-scale solar PV industry could still be improved and that it had been ignored in the Budget.
“Whenever more funding is put into trying to achieve the net zero target, I’m going to think it’s a good thing, but I would love to have seen a big push for home batteries,” he said.
While more than 378,000 rooftop solar PV systems were installed across the country last year, only 23,796 small-scale batteries with a combined capacity of 238 MWh were installed by Australian households in 2020.
Savage said many customers were holding off on installing batteries due to financial concerns with doubts about rebates featuring prominently in discussions.
“One of the big considerations for people when buying a battery, and solar, is how long is it going to take to get the money back,” he said.
“It’s never really been financially viable with ROI (return on investment) and more needs to be done to make it more appealing.”
Established in Byron Bay in Northern New South Wales in 2016, Smart Energy has emerged as one of Australia’s leading solar retailers with a focus on residential installs. In recent months the company has enjoyed strong growth with an average of 400 rooftop solar PV installs per month.
“Since the start of the year we have installed just over 10,000 kW,” Savage said.
“On average, we’ve done 400 solar installs per month but very few have batteries. We’re doing an average of about 20 a month.
“People are waiting until batteries are at the right price or there is some certainty with rebates before they put a battery in.”

Savage said he expects the Australian Energy Market Commission’s (AEMC) recently released draft determination proposing a rule change which will allow rooftop solar owners to be charged for exporting solar energy into the grid will generate increased interest in energy storage systems.
“Thinking of charging people to export power to the grid is absolutely ludicrous,” he said.
“Instead of doing that, why not just put some of this money into assisting the grid by helping people get batteries?
“The way these battery programs have been sold to us as the retailers, is that they will help support the grid so it would be nice to see some money in the budget go into that.
“The government needs to do some heavy work on that.”
Many states and territories currently offer battery rebates. In Victoria, solar battery rebates will maintain their current value of up to $4,174 until June 30, 2021 while residents in the Australian Capital Territory can access a rebate of up to $825 per kW.  South Australian residents can access rebates of up to $4000 for their solar battery while the NSW government does not provide a rebate, offering instead an interest-free loan program for those interested in purchasing solar batteries.
Meanwhile the criticism of the 2021-22 Budget continues with Global Compact Network Australia (GCNA) executive director Kylie Porter called on the government to match the ambitions of the likes of the United States and the United Kingdom and invest in renewable energy and emission reduction technologies.
“We recognise the challenges posed for both government and business in a swift and unplanned transition to clean energy,” Porter said in a statement.
“However, the focus of the budget allocation towards gas is not a long-term sustainable energy source.”
“As a country, Australia needs to continue to invest in renewable energy systems to ensure an inclusive and sustainable economy that provides clean and affordable energy for all households, including areas of lower socio-economic status.”
