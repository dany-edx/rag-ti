On November 16, all energy retailers with 10,000 customers or more will be required to follow suit, opening up access to granular data on how Australians use energy.
While the scheme is primarily about improving industry transparency, founder and CEO of data access company Biza, Stuart Low, is adamant the data has much broader potential.
First introduced in the banking sector in 2020 as a response to Australia’s Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, the federal government’s Consumer Data Right (CDR) scheme is now extending to energy retailing companies, before it expands to the telecommunications industry.
Basically, the scheme mandates data holders, in this case energy retailers, to share data in a standardised format with consumer consent.
“For a long time, corporations… have basically treated data as their asset to own and leverage and monetise, and the reality is that it’s not theirs, it’s the individuals,” Low tells pv magazine Australia. 
Before founding Biza.io, Low was the government’s engineering lead for the CDR scheme, helping to write the standards and, as he describes it, do “the sausage making.” For him, the scheme is about ensuring consumer data can be used to benefit actual consumers, rather than just benefiting the companies which hold it. 
Under the scheme, detailed data from customer’s bills, smart meters, as well as information about solar and battery systems can be accessed.
Specifically, meter information down to the fidelity supplied by the meter itself is available, Low says. “So if it’s five minutes or one minute, you can get raw data basically.”
For distributed energy resources (DER) information, Low says participants will be able to see if customers have solar or a battery, and what inverter they are using. Data on utilisation down to five minute granularity and site details also comes under the umbrella.
In terms of who can access this data, there are various mechanisms in place but it is essentially a matter of either becoming accredited in the CDR scheme or simply using an accredited third party.
The most obvious use case is for companies to use the data to implore customers to switch energy providers or install solar. To date, Low has found the data’s use – at least in the banking sector – fairly uninspiring. “To be honest, there’s been quite unimaginative use cases,” he says.
For him, the potential is far broader. “There opportunity here to essentially make better infrastructure investment decisions.”
“A company can pull all these data points in and essentially come up with either A) a very accurate assessment of what they can do locally. But the bigger story here is imagine if you could do that for a thousand households in a radius and say, ‘ok, we have a thousand households, we know this is the consumption, we’ve literally charted to a five minute basis what the expected consumption is.” So now we can look at deploying a localised battery, perhaps a solar farm, perhaps solar panels on roofs. We could make that large capital investment.”
Data like this, he says, could also be used by governments or groups to help make decisions around potential locations for communities batteries – especially with the government set to begin rolling out its subsidy scheme.
Choosing locations for things like community batteries, Low says, is a “very complex analytical problem, but also there is a straight up privacy problem as well.” Without the CDR, market operators are only entitled to offer up a rough picture. But if consumers chose to take part in the CDR scheme, it allows much higher fidelity assessments. It allows insights into how whole communities are using energy, and could track exactly when solar systems reach a critical mass in areas.
Another more ambitious scenario would be for banks to access this energy data and use it to do things like offer refinancing options where they bundle in electricity. That is, they could pay for solar systems and benefit from the certificates awarded across many mortgages, Low says. “Until now that was almost impossible.”
Low’s suggestions are just possible starting points and by no means the data’s limits. “This is what the CDR could do, if someone goes out and does it,” he says.

The CEC has indicated it will put in an application to continue as product lister, but will not seek to hold its position operating Australia’s solar installer accreditation scheme. 
Until recently, the Regulator seemed hesitant about whether it would even seek to take the product listing role away from the CEC, but results from its consultation process last year garnered overwhelming support for change. 
On its website, the Regulator published results from its industry survey on the question, illustrating 86% of respondents supported the move, while just 14% implicitly said the responsibility should stay with the Clean Energy Council.

The CEC has published and maintained lists of Australian Standards-compliant approved modules, inverters (and more recently, batteries) for more than a decade.
But as a consequence of recommendations from the Integrity Review of the Rooftop Solar PV Sector, the Clean Energy Regulator has been reconfiguring how Australia’s solar industry and its rebate program, the small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES), is governed. 
The application round for bodies interested in the product listing contract will last three months and is expected to officially open in May or June this year, the Regulator said.
It remains unclear exactly how expansive the listing role will be following the changes, with speakers from the Regulator at an information webinar last June hesitant to confirm whether the role would would involve actually choosing which equipment gained approval and running tests, or whether it would simply involve publishing and keeping these product lists up to date.
Until the Regulator makes its decision, the CEC will continue in its role.
The more consequential change looming for the solar industry concerns which body will oversee solar installer and designer accreditations.
Applications to take over that contract closed on the 15th of this month, with the Regulator expecting to notify applicants of the outcomes in May 2023 and publicly announce them in June 2023.
Again, the CEC has held this position for over a decade in Australia, but recently said it will not reapply for the contract.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/22/developer-x-elio-sells-to-brookfield-extending-funds-position-in-australia/,"FINANCE,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,SPAIN,UNITED STATES",BELLA PEACOCK,"MARCH 22, 2023",Developer X-Elio sells to Brookfield extending fund’s position in Australia,"Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) will sell its stake in X-Elio to its current partner Brookfield Renewables, the companies confirmed in a joint statement on March 21.
The investment funds have not disclosed the transaction details, which will see Brookfield go from owning 50% of X-Elio to 100% ownership. A Spanish newspaper, however, last month reported KKR was considering selling its stake, saying a deal would value the company at €2.5 billion ($4 billion).
KKR first invested in X-Elio in 2015, while Brookfield acquired its initial 50% stake in 2019.
X-Elio says by the end of 2023 it is expected to have 3 GW of assets in operation, under construction or ready-to-build across Spain, Australia, the US, Japan, Latin America and Italy. In addition, the company says it has over 10 GW of projects in its advanced near-term pipeline.
In Australia, X-Elio recently completed the 200 MW Blue Grass Solar Farm near Chinchilla in Queensland’s Western Downs region, and is currently seeking approval for its 90 MW Forest Glen solar farm in the Dubbo region of New South Wales (NSW). In March, the company also unveiled plans to build a 300 MW solar farm and battery system near Wagga Wagga in southwest NSW, known as the Maxwell Solar Farm.
At the time, Belinda Fan, X-Elio’s country manager in Australia, said X-Elio has “significant ambition to grow our investments in Australia” after having entered the market here in 2017.
Coming back to the sale, Ignacio Paz-Ares, Brookfield Renewable’s Head of European Renewable Power and Transition Investments, described X-Elio as a business “we know well” following its four years of involvement. “This transaction is very aligned with Brookfield’s strategy as a leading owner, operator and developer of renewables worldwide, driven by the incredible tailwinds for this sector.”
Brookfield in February returned to its takeover bid for Origin Energy, Australia’s second biggest energy generator and retailer, with bid-partner MidOcean Energy, managed by US investment giant EIG Partners. Its revised Origin offer is valued at roughly $18.2 billion (USD 12.5 billion) and has ben endorsed by Origin’s board – though the sale is still subject to review from Australia’s competition regulator.
Given Brookfield’s recent takeover of Victorian network, AusNet Services, this could prove a hurdle.
Brookfield is currently aiming to create the world’s largest fund for renewable investment, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund, which is headed up by Mark Carney, one of the world’s most influential climate change power brokers.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/22/shifting-behaviour-to-enable-a-renewable-future/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,EV,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,OPINION & ANALYSIS,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",,"MARCH 22, 2023",Shifting behaviour to enable a renewable future,"With the Labor government committed to clean energy, pledging $20 billion (USD 13 billion) to make the grid ready for clean energy, as well as consumer indicators showing a commitment to clean energy, such as the increase in demand for solar panels, the Australian landscape is primed and ready for the takeoff of renewable energy.
A limitation to expanding renewables further is the baseload of energy required to be ready to go at any moment. When solar panels aren’t generating energy overnight, or when wind turbines are slow, this is the time baseload fossil fuel sources power up to meet the demands of an energy network. This is a growing pain of the industry, part of the process that Australia needs to go through in order to fully convert to its renewable energy future.
However, instead of consuming electricity whenever and wherever we currently do, we can shift our behaviour towards energy consumption and help reduce our baseload of fossil fuel sourced electricity, in order to help the growth of renewables in the market. As we’ve seen over the past 12 months, price signals are an incredibly effective tool towards this.
In a renewable electricity market, volatile pricing is reflected based on the availability of supply provided by renewables. When the supply of electricity cannot match the demand, the price of energy increases. Inversely, when supply outstrips demand, the price of energy is lowered. 
Consumers can actually take advantage of these times of high and low pricing through the adoption of Time-of-Use tariffs. Electric vehicles (EVs) already work with chargers that sync to these tariffs and only charge the car overnight or during times of low pricing. Imagine your air conditioners (AC) doing the same thing, actively seeking these low prices to do the bulk of your home’s cooling or fill up your hot water tank.
This ability to load shift marks a significant solution for Australia, as heating and cooling takes up between 20% and 50% of energy use and cost in the country, depending on the climate zone. Solving this problem will help us achieve these net zero aims. Australians armed with smart meters and smart devices like ACs and EVs will start shifting their energy consumption towards times of cheaper and more available renewable energy in the grid.
Smart controllers and ACs are not new technologies. They’ve had 10 years of growth to learn user habits, perfect their efficiency and their design, but more importantly start building the steps for the future of home energy. Smart controlled ACs use times of lower priced energy to cool a home, or ‘charge up’ hot water and immersion tanks. In times of high energy prices when the supply can’t meet demand, a home can predict the expensive times and pre-cool beforehand, whilst making use of the stored hot water for the home to avoid buying expensive energy. This reduces energy costs without ever compromising on comfort.
Already around 37% of electricity in Australia comes from renewables. But security of supply cannot be guaranteed by these sources, which limits the potential for that percentage of renewables to grow. Whilst we can’t control when the sun shines or the wind blows, we can control the consumption in homes to match those times. We need to match the demand of energy to the supply that is available, in order to grow our energy network’s share of renewables.
The solution to this comes from Time-of-Use tariffs and smart controlled ACs, EV chargers, and other technologies which actively seek out to only use electricity when the price is low. By creating homes with dynamic heating and cooling that seeks and avoids the higher priced energy times, homes will become closer in sync with nature and the supply of renewables.
Renewables has hit records of 68.7% to Australia’s main grid for a brief period data from the Australian Energy Market Operator found. This shows what is possible.
The convergence of technologies like these mark the beginning of a major innovation towards the type of energy, and the way we consume energy in the home. The end result builds an energy system that not only marries its supply and demand, but paves the way for a more sustainable and renewable energy grid.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/22/pv-expo-2023-japanese-solars-struggle-for-space/,"EVENTS,HIGHLIGHTS,MARKETS,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN",MARK HUTCHINS,"MARCH 22, 2023",PV Expo 2023: Japanese solar’s struggle for space,"From pv magazine Global
Spread across three days, Japan’s Smart Energy Week again brought several thousand visitors to Tokyo Big Sight. Domestic companies were a relatively rare sight on the show floor, particularly in the PV Expo hall. But large crowds and a wealth of new innovations on display throughout the PV, battery, smart grid, and hydrogen exhibitions gave plenty to be optimistic about.
Solar and renewable energy in Japan have often been described as “in a transition period” for the past few years. Solar installations have remained at a steady 5 GW to 6 GW per year, while dwindling feed-in tariff rates and a shortage of suitable land for new large-scale PV installations have led many to ask what’s next for Japan.
The country is working towards a target of at least 36% to 38% renewables in its energy mix by 2030. An opening day presentation by Kazuya Inoue, director of climate change policy at Japan’s Ministry of Energy (MoE), noted that this would require at least a doubling of Japan’s cumulative solar capacity, and a significant uptick in installations during the second half of this decade. Inoue stated that the MoE is “committed to solar,” and its calculations show that renewable energy sources could meet at least 1.8 times Japan’s total electricity demand – meaning much is still not being exploited. And in response to this, MoE will make JPY 20 trillion ($151 billion) of funding available for various renewable energy, energy storage, and decarbonisation projects up to 2030.
With little suitable land left for large-scale PV, Japan’s PV policy is switching focus to rooftop and commercial PV models. Many companies in Japan have set decarbonisation targets for themselves and are looking to clean up their energy supply through solar PPAs. Tokyo based analysts RTS Corp. explained that high energy prices along with subsidies available for solar PPA installations make this a particularly attractive model at the moment.
RTS also said it expects to see Japan’s market for ground-mount solar installations shrink as residential PV grows. It noted that experimental schemes requiring solar on all new buildings are being tried out in the Tokyo and Kawasaki regions, and will likely be rolled out further in the near future.
Japan has also seen a few early installations combining solar and farmland, but opinions are divided as to whether this agrivoltaics approach will work as a solution to shortages of land for solar projects. According to RTS, agrivoltaics in Japan will likely see some growth in the years leading to 2030, but the Ministry of Agriculture is not well prepared, and widespread reform of land-use regulations will be needed for a real market to develop.
No more PERC?
China’s cell and module producers dominated much of the PV Expo hall, and were keen to demonstrate their latest products in a market traditionally keen on the latest technologies. Every one of these companies said plans are already well underway to stop producing PERC cells completely by the end of 2024, or even sooner.
And all of the replacements were on display this week, most are taking the simplest route of upgrading to TOPCon to reach higher efficiencies. Trina Solar and JinkoSolar were among companies confirming plans to stop producing PERC entirely. And DAS Solar, which operates 30 GW of TOPCon cell capacity and plans to expand to 40 GW this years, told pv magazine this “is only beginning for TOPCon,” with expectations to reach 26% production cell efficiency in 2024.
Others, however, are looking further into the future and at even higher performance levels that could be achieved with heterojunction and back contact technologies. Manufacturers Huasun and Risen demonstrated their latest heterojunction products, with the former aiming at average production cell efficiencies better than 25% and planning to expand its capacity to 40 GW by 2025.
Longi Solar also had it latest hybrid passivated back contact products on show, and Aiko Solar showed off its latest All-Back-Contact, which its rolling out products for the rooftop market this year and expects to be able to reduce costs sufficiently for the large-scale segment over the next few years, as well as achieving better than 27% module efficiency.
Electronics giant Sharp – seemingly the only Japanese company exhibiting any type of PV module at this year’s show – demonstrated its multi-junction gallium-arsenide based cell, which hits more than 30% efficiency. Currently at more than 100 times the cost of a typical silicon cell, there’s a long way to go before this will be attractive for powering anything other than space travel. Nonetheless, the company exhibited a Toyota car covered with these cells, adding up to an impressive 860 W of solar on the vehicle body, which the company says can power a journey of up to 50 km with no other charging.
Sharp also says it is working with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO) to bring the cost of these cells down to earth. They are developing a reusable substrate and larger-scale processes to cut more than one-third off the total costs, but don’t expect to see them on a rooftop anytime soon.

Japan, like many other markets with a growing share of renewable energy, has realised that it will need to do major work on its electricity networks in order to deliver all this clean energy when and where it’s needed. And the Smart-Grid expo was one place where well-known Japanese brands were more able to shine. Mitsubishi Electric had a range of software on show, demonstrating that it is able to manage large electricity networks by combining data from multiple small installations into a virtual power plant.
Sharp, as well as Chinese companies Growatt and Sungrow, also exhibited electric vehicle chargers and previewed vehicle-to- grid and vehicle-to-home approaches, where the car’s battery while plugged in is used to maximise consumption of solar electricity from a rooftop installation, or many are linked together to scale this up to a whole region. This is an approach these companies expect to gain a lot of traction in Japan over the coming years, on the residential side, in particular.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/03/22/india-exempts-some-solar-projects-from-domestic-content-requirements/,"POLICY,UTILITY SCALE PV,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"MARCH 22, 2023",India exempts some solar projects from domestic content requirements,"From pv magazine India
India’s Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) says solar projects commissioned by March 31, 2024, will not have to source PV modules from the Approved Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) list.
The MNRE move is a near-term positive for the developers and provides them the flexibility to source modules at the most cost-competitive rates, say ICRA analysts. 
The cost of imported modules, even after considering the impact of basic customs duty (BCD), remains competitive compared to modules sourced from domestic manufacturers using imported solar PV cells. This is following the sharper decline in module prices over the past six months compared to the decline seen in solar PV cell prices, according to ICRA analysts.
The prices of the mono PERC modules witnessed a moderation over the past five to six months, reducing from the peak level of 27-28 US cents per watt to about 23-24 cents per watt in December 2022 and further to 22 cents/watt in March 2023, says ICRA quoting the data from Infolink. Cell prices declined to 12.0-12.5 cents/watt in December 2022 from 16 cents/watt in September 2022, but increased to 14 cents/watt in March 2023.
For the domestic manufacturers to be competitive, the cell prices must remain below 12 cents/watt, assuming the prevailing module prices sustain without any further decline, say ICRA analysts.
The domestic module manufacturing capacity has seen a significant jump over the last two years; the module manufacturing capacity approved under the ALMM increased to 22.4 GW as of February 2023 from 11.5 GW in March 2022, comprising only domestic manufacturers. While this augurs well for the solar power sector, the lack of backward integration and limited capacity for cell manufacturing keeps the module manufacturers dependent on imports for sourcing solar PV cells. Also, the jump in module exports, given the higher realisations, has impeded the availability of modules in the domestic market.
ICRA analysts say the abeyance of ALMM requirement could adversely impact the order inflow for domestic manufacturers in the near term but the healthy demand from export markets is likely to partially offset this impact. The module exports witnessed a sharp increase in 10M FY2023 supported by increased demand from the US amid the restrictions imposed on module sourcing from China as well as the ramp-up in the domestic manufacturing capacities.
