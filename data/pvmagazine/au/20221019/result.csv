Among the companies to have been allocated spots are BP, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Green LOHC, Kinara Power, and Blue Diamond Australia – all of which have previously expressed interest in the concept.

Through its development agency DevelopmentWA, the Western Australian government owns a total of 6,400 hectares of undeveloped land in the area. It wants to turn 1,134 hectares of that into a “heavy industrial core,” with a 1,000 hectare deep water port and a 4,000 hectare “buffer zone.”
Exactly how much land each of these six companies have been allocated has not been disclosed, nor has its price tag. 
The government did say the move is part of a $47.5 million strategy to “activate” Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area and turn it into a globally competitive renewable hydrogen precinct.
The land allocation to these six companies is still subject to negotiations with DevelopmentWA. Given its location, the site is described by the government as having “world class wind and solar energy potential.”
Not much mention is made of the land’s Traditional Owners though, with DevelopmentWA noting it “owns all of the Oakajee SIA’s 6,400ha in freehold ownership.”

None of the six companies’ projects have yet gone through their scoping and feasibility studies. However, Fortescue Future Industries has already signalled it is considering exporting green ammonia from the site.
“The company is confident that the quality of wind and solar resources in the region could support a major renewable energy hub, including associated industries such as the manufacturing of key infrastructure equipment,” the company said in a statement.

The Western Australian government also announced $3 million for Western Power to undertake a feasibility study on electricity connection of the Oakajee SIA to the South West Interconnected System.
The Oakajee Strategic Industrial Area website lists other potential uses for the site include “export-orientated activities such as magnetite iron ore and downstream processing industries.” 
The Oakajee project is one of 13 similar such industrial visions across WA. The idea, DevelopmentWA says, is to provide “appropriate locations for investment in strategic, heavy industrial and downstream processing industries.”

A further $750 million has been allocated via the federal Clean Energy Finance Corp. (CEFC) to ensure the Victoria-New South Wales Interconnector, known as the VNI West KerangLink, is completed by 2028.

The first major tranche of the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation scheme is funding for the contentious Marinus Link, a major transmission line connecting Tasmania and Victoria via undersea cables through the Bass Strait. Of that, 80% will come from another concessional loan via CEFC, with the Victorian, Tasmanian and federal governments committing to an equal equity share for the remaining 20%, roughly 6.6% each.
The 1.5 GW Marinus Link between northwestern Tasmania and Victoria’s Gippsland would quadruple the electricity transmission capacity between Tasmania and the mainland. The project would likely cost around $4 billion, and its proposal has been sharply criticised by environmental groups.

Labor’s Rewiring the Nation scheme is the backbone of its plan to cut emissions by 43% by 2030, while also reaching above 80% renewable energy grid penetration.
Working on the premise that there is no shortage of interest in building large-scale renewable projects in Australia, the policy seeks to address the lack of transmission infrastructure capable of connecting more distributed renewable generators. To use the federal government’s favourite term, the policy seeks to “unlock” Australia’s renewable potential.
The Australian Financial Review reports the federal funding amounts to a $6 billion package of loans and equity, though it isn’t entirely clear where that exact figure comes from, though it must refer to the undisclosed amount the CEFC will put toward Marinus Link. 
That figure would also seem to include the “up to $1 billion of low-cost debt” which the Rewiring the Nation scheme will put toward developing Tasmania’s ‘Battery of the Nation’ pumped hydro projects in Tarraleah and Lake Cethana.

Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen described the news as “the biggest announcement of federal investment in energy since the original snowy scheme in the 1940s.”
It has been welcomed by industry, with the Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, describing it as a “game-changer for Australia’s clean energy transition.”
With Australia’s lack of transmission infrastructure “hampering” its efforts to get to net zero, Energy Networks Australia CEO Andrew Dillon said the funding and projects are “key steps toward a 21st century renewable energy grid.”

It is also noteworthy that neither the Victoria-NSW Interconnector nor the Tasmania-Victoria Marinus link transmission lines have passed the multi-stage Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission, conducted by the Australian Energy Regulator – a model which is itself under some criticism.
Both the Marinus Link and the VNI West KerangLink between Victoria and NSW have been deemed priorities for the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in its national electricity transition roadmap, known as the Integrated System Plan.
While the issue of new transmission lines across Australia is just heating up, this major federal funding package does mark an important consensus between the federal government and the state governments of Victoria and Tasmania.
With Victoria and New South Wales still heavily reliant on coal, and the majority of those plants expected to close in the next decade, the race to build transmission for green electrons is on – especially since getting transmission projects across the line tends to be both extremely touchy and expensive. According to AEMO, Australia will need to “efficiently” install more than 10,000 km of new transmission to meet its 2050 net-zero goal.

Tasmania finds itself in a different position, already running on virtually 100% clean hydro energy. The fact it has already reached the mainland’s end goal of a decarbonised electricity system means the island is now aiming to be an exporter of renewable energy. Tasmania is now targeting 200% renewable energy for 2040 – meaning it would essentially export as much clean energy as it uses. 
While the ‘Battery of the Nation’ clean energy export proposition has many proponents, the Marinus Link vision has drawn criticism from Tasmania’s most high-profile environment campaigners, who say it will threaten wildlife and involve a huge amount of land clearing. Among them are former Greens leaders Bob Brown and Christine Milne.
“Climate and biodiversity are two sides of the coin. Marinus will drive more Tasmanian threatened species toward extinction and it is notable that in the fast-tracking of this project not a word is being said about environmental impacts from a government that says it has a zero extinctions policy,” Milne said.
Finally, little is said in the joint federal and Victorian government announcement about where the funding for the “rapid development” of Victoria’s renewable energy zones and offshore will end up.
Victorian government/AEMO
No particular projects or zones have been outlined, though the governments do note the recent community consultation process for the offshore wind development zone off Gippsland. 
Victoria has six onshore renewable energy zones. Earlier this year, it announced its additional vision to deploy major offshore wind, setting a target for 4 GW of capacity by 2035 and 9 GW by 2040.

Longi, which has surpassed more than 7 GW of monocrystalline solar panel shipments to India, now aims to offer green hydrogen solutions.
The company is already in talks with developers in India to supply its electrolysers. It will also provide training and commissioning supervision to EPC partners for hydrogen projects.
“Longi considers hydrogen as a new pillar of our business. We have invested a lot in the green hydrogen business. And India is a promising market,” Lan Cheng, general manager-international, Longi Hydrogen, told pv magazine. “The nation has high decarbonisation and non-fossil fuel-based electricity generation target. It will continue to offer opportunities for global and local players in the long run.”
Longi continues to invest heavily in R&D and innovation. It has already unveiled alkaline water electrolysers. Its electrolysers can provide 1,000 Nm3/hour of hydrogen output. The company has already provided a 4,000 Nm3/hour hydrogen production system for the world’s largest green hydrogen project.
Longi aims to reach 1.5 GW of electrolyser manufacturing capacity by the end of 2022. It is expected to expand to 5 GW to 10 GW by 2025 to meet market demand.
The company also plans to introduce new solar modules by the end of this year.
“We believe any new product which is introduced to the market must sustain for a long period,” said Pradeep Kumar, managing director of Longi Solar India. “So we are working on a new product, which is going to beat almost all prevailing technologies in efficiency, degradation, and bifaciality factor.”
Longi introduced Hi-MO 5 bifacial and mono-facial modules to the Indian market in 2021, and  shipped 3.8 GW of PV modules last year, out of which 85% was bifacial. It has shipped 1.6 GW of modules from January to March in the current calendar year – the three months before the imposition of basic customs duty. More than 95% of these sales were bifacial.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/19/world-has-technical-potential-to-host-47-6-pwh-of-photovoltaic-thermal-panels/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,MARKETS,RESIDENTIAL PV,WORLD",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 19, 2022",World has technical potential to host 47.6 PWh of photovoltaic-thermal panels,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Central European University in Hungary have estimated the global potential of photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) energy production on rooftops between 2022 and 2060.
Their model predicts that PVT systems currently have the technical potential to produce around 47.6 PWh, with the contribution on the PV side being around 29.5 PWh (62%), and that of thermal production 18.1 PWh (38%).
The study uses a high-resolution, geospatial energy supply model to estimate the useable building rooftop areas across eleven world regions and calculates the corresponding global and regional production that should be provided by rooftop PV-T collectors during the 39-year period. The model builds on an existing model called BISE, which has three major types of inputs: meteorological, building-related and technological parameters. According to the authors, the strength of their algorithm is that “it requires only easily obtainable and reproducible input data for meteorological and technological measures.”
The scientists assumed the electric and thermal efficiency of the PV-T collectors to be of 21.6% and 63.3%, respectively, as well as a temperature coefficient of -0.35% C for the PV unit. They also assumed the PV panels to rely on monocrystalline cells and an antireflective tempered glass. The thermal modules were assumed to rely on a flat plate collector and a copper absorber. For both technologies, degradation rates and possible technology advancements were not considered.
The model estimated total rooftop area values to vary between 3 billion square meters in Europe and 70 billion square meters in centrally planned Asia, including China, in the first year of the simulation period. However, only one-third of the total rooftop area was considered suitable for the installation of PV-T collectors.
By 2060, the highest installable rooftop area is expected in centrally planned Asia, Latin America, and North America. The lowest area is projected for Sub Saharan Africa, at 4.75 billion billion square meters, and Europe, at 1.2 billion billion square meters.
Total PV-T energy production potential is expected to be highest in centrally planned Asia, North America, and Latin America, with 9.7 PWh, 6.0 PWh, and 4.5 PWh, respectively.
“The most restrained potentials, on the other hand, are expected in Europe (0.24 PWh) and Sub Saharan Africa (1.28 PWh) where either the geographical (climatic) or the utilisation potential of solar collectors may be reduced,” the scientists said.
Between 2022 and 2060, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are expected to see the greatest increase in PV-T energy production potential.
The scientists described their findings in “Estimating the global technical potential of building-integrated solar energy production using a high-resolution geospatial model”, which was recently published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.
“As the flexibility and the complexity of the BISE model allows and it could lead to even more robust estimations, our forthcoming studies will also prioritise simulations of solar potential undertaken at urban and neighbourhood scale and supported by very high-resolution LIDAR-based rooftop information,” they said.
