Solar and battery provider UPowr will be the first merchant to integrate with CommBank’s renewable finance line. UPowr is partnered with Energy Australia and Gentrack, Commbank says, noting that the company is currently involved in the NSW Rebate Swap for Solar program.
Meneguzzo also noted that Commbank will be expanding its offering to “new partners and new CBA customers over the coming year.”
The finance program itself is called InstalPay and, as the name suggests, it varies its repayment instalments between one to five years.
“CommBank customers who use InstalPay to pay for their UPowr products will be eligible for interest-free finance paid off in instalments, helping them potentially realise the benefits of lower energy bills from the first month,” Meneguzzo said.

Beleaguered rural communities are under pressure to deliver sustainable produce to market both in Australia and for export, in the most challenging conditions. To date, utility-scale PV has often been seen as the latest blackberry thorn in the side of farming. But could solar add its renewable-energy cred and physical shelter to enhance growing methods and conditions for pears and lambs alike?
It’s a new perspective on agrivoltaics, which has often been focused on the benefits to solar generation of growing dust-minimising, cell-cooling green crops under panels. This revised equation features more mutual back scratching.
“There’s no doubt that Australia is going to see more in the way of protective cropping and farming,” says Angela Avery, Research Director of Agriculture Resources Sciences in Victoria. “And I don’t just mean tomatoes growing in large glasshouses, It’s going to be much bigger and much more broadacre than that. The main driver will be the reliability of getting quality food in a sustainable way into supply chains that have quite strict requirements, and I think agrivoltaics has a really important role to play.”

At All-Energy Australia 2023, Avery was one of the panelists in a session titled Mapping developments in agri-solar. Luke Osborne, Managing Director of Stride Renewables, an advisory firm to renewable energy and would-be sustainable enterprises, chaired the session. 
From a multigenerational farming family near Bungendore in New South Wales, Osborne also has skin in the game (more later), and predicted that near future solar developments would have to produce an agri-solar strategy as part of their approval process. “It will be part of the conditions of consent, because people don’t want to see agricultural land sterilised [to make way for solar farms].” 
He says even though Australia won’t need a high percentage of its agricultural land for renewable generation – “even for solar to achieve a hydrogen-super-power future” – it is still extremely important to rural communities “that they see agricultural production continue.”
Call it agri-solar, agrivoltaics, mixed land use … it’s all the same, right? No. Panellists agreed that because the concept is so new, it will be important to clearly define it and what it means, and what the priorities are, to instill confidence in potential investors as well as the farming community.

“We’re working with Macquarie University, reviewing strategic areas around standards and partnerships, and definitions around what agrivoltaics are in Australia, because we’ve seen that clear definitions really supported the development of agrivoltaics in Germany,” says Avery.
Avery conducts research at Agriculture Victoria’s SmartFarms. 90% of Australia’s pears are grown in Victoria, with a concentration of orchards in the Goulburn Valley, where hail netting is becoming an increasingly common sight. Avery says that in May this year 470 hectares of perennial tree crops were under netting, and that coverage has since increased.
At Tatura, in the heart of pear-growing country, she is two years in to a study into the benefits of growing pears under solar arrays. Results so far have been mixed, but there are still plenty of levers to pull. The point at this stage is to be methodical over time — “with agriculture, it’s important to have three years of data, because of the seasonal differences,” she says.

The Tatura SmartFarm has 120 solar panels with half fixed at 5 degrees west and half at 45 degrees west over an established orchard growing a red-blush variety of pears. A control group of trees has no solar-panel protection. The scientists record a wide variety of data, related to crop yield, pear size, colour, quality, and energy yield.
By measuring sap flow and water content in the soil and air under the panels, “we’ve found that agrivoltaic systems certainly maximise water use and improve water efficiencies, particularly in terms of yield per unit of transpiration”, says Avery. That’s a big and important win as Australia heads into an El Nino weather period, during which drought is highly likely, and the cost of water will rise.
The pears under panels have also been largely protected from sunburn (which starts to affect fruit quality when temperatures exceed 30 degrees Celsius), and from the pelting of hailstorms experienced in the region, which can make fruit unsaleable. 
But other factors such as pear production have seen a decline under panels, with a 37% reduction in yield under the 45 degree west orientation, and 47% reduction under the panels at five degrees west. Many of the pears under panels have not received enough sunlight to inspire the rosy blush that so appeals to consumers.
But Avery is optimistic that system design and material adjustments can optimise conditions for the pears — she mentions using solar panel trackers to optimise for energy and pear production, the potential for translucent or transparent solar panels to allow more light through to crops below, and integrating pear trellising with solar pillars to reduce costs. 

“We have an NDA with the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany, to investigate some new materials coming in, and the opportunities for Australia,” she says. “We want to continue to measure and monitor microclimate and particularly different opportunities around soil and soil moisture under commercial solar farms. And we think the opportunity around digital twins linked to both energy and biophysical crop growth models will provide some real opportunities to design systems of the future.” Developing dwarf varieties and pears that blush under less intense sunlight are also possibilities.
Avery is also involved with setting up an experiment on the benefits of farming lambs under solar panels at Agriculture Victoria’s Hamilton SmartFarm: “We want to get empirical data around how these systems could potentially help lamb production and particularly lamb survival,” she says.
Enhanced lamb farming is the business Osborne has been working on at his cousin Dominic Osborne’s property near Bungendore on the NSW Southern Tablelands.

The proposed 350MWac PV installation and 300 MW / 600 MWh battery is known as Blind Creek Solar Farm and received planning approval as a NSW state significant project in July this year. It will now be development as a joint venture between developer Octopus Australia and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Blind Creek is in fact a reenvisioning of Infigen Energy’s 50 MW Capital Solar farm, for which land agreements had lapsed; among the changes made is it has been relocated to degraded farm country more removed from farm neighbours. 
The solar installation will co-exist with lamb production, a soil-carbon project, a green-waste humus compost facility and regenerative agriculture processes; and will be accompanied by works to improve the biodiversity and water-holding capacity of the catchment.
Critical to the project is the growing of pasture under the 600 hectares of solar panels. To maintain pasture in its most productive, green but reasonably close cropped phase, the sheep will be moved through different sections of the solar farm so that it never becomes over-grazed or overgrown — they’ll be deployed as living lawn mowers.

So far, the positives of this farmer-led multi-faceted project include being able to engage “with our community as locals,” says Osborne. His cousins Dominic and Jane, “come with trust embedded in what they do, and that’s so much more powerful than people from outside the community coming and telling people in rural areas how to live their lives.”
Importantly, Osborne as joint MD of Stride Renewables, and coming from a farming family, highlights some challenges for other agrivoltaic developers to consider:
1) Contracting
Solar farms are expensive — Blind Creek is expected to cost $450 million (USD 285 million) to develop. Osborne says one issue still to be resolved is “How do you make sure that the agricultural system doesn’t become the poor cousin, and is left out when you’re trying to get your project to financial closure with banks, EPC contractors and so forth?” Although, ultimately, he says, “solar panels are worth a lot more than the lambs.”
Stride’s approach was to create an “equity solar strategy,” setting out governing principles and responsibilities of each side — agriculture and renewable energy generation — of the business, because, he says, “Things do go wrong. We do have droughts, and other situations where one of these systems needs to take precedence over the other.”
2) Design
 Careful consideration of numerous factors is vital prior to design of the solar farm and construction. Osborne says, “It’s very difficult to retrofit any of this, even adding a fenceline into an existing solar array is almost impossible, so very careful thought about the whole of the agricultural production system is advisable before you put the capital down to build it.”
Blind Creek uses two panels in portrait on its trackers where most trackers in Australia are one one panel portrait. “Two-P means the tables are naturally higher off the ground, which gives you more space underneath them. And they’re naturally further apart, which also gives you more opportunity to bring agricultural equipment down between the tables,” says Osborne, who adds, “but they’re not typically used because there’s not a lot of trust in the industry for those systems which have higher wind loading and so forth.” 
Spacing between the tables will also be influenced by how much sunlight is needed at ground level for crops or pasture to grow well. 
3) Bushfire management
Any development application includes a bushfire management plan, which Osborne says, “usually calls for you to have the grass mown right down to the ground in bushfire season, which is inconsistent with agricultural systems. We’d like to develop a more flexible approach to bushfire risk management. It’s a live issue.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/01/active-natural-hydrogen-field-confirmed-in-sas-yorke-peninsula/,"HIGHLIGHTS,HYDROGEN,MARKETS,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",BELLA PEACOCK,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",‘Active natural hydrogen field’ confirmed in SA’s Yorke Peninsula,"Brisbane-based company Gold Hydrogen announced to the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX, the results of its first natural hydrogen exploration on South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula at a site known as the Ramsay well, saying it discovered “significant concentrations of hydrogen and helium.”
Until recently, natural or “gold” hydrogen has garnered little attention in Australia and abroad. A renewed interest blossomed in the last years, however, after a “chance rediscovery” of historical reports of two wells drilled in the 1930s where high purity hydrogen was detected, according to Australian energy consultancy, EnergyQuest.
The Ramsay well was one of these, and it was re-tested in October by Gold Hydrogen which was granted rights to explore approximately 9,500 km2 near Adelaide, specifically the southern part of the Yorke Peninsula through to Kangaroo Island.
Gold Hydrogen
The results have now returned, with Gold Hydrogen announcing that its testing and laboratory results measured air-corrected hydrogen at 73.3% at 240 metres below ground level, consistent with the 76% air-corrected concentration of hydrogen reported in the Ramsay Oil Bore 1 in 1931. 
“These measurements validate historical results, and confirm the presence of a hydrogen play at shallow depths in the Ramsay Project area,” it told the ASX.
“Relatively high concentration” helium was also detected in the well, which Gold Hydrogen’s Managing Director, Neil McDonald, said “could be a significant value-add to the project.”
Gold Hydrogen is aiming to be the the first company in Australia to produce, use and sell natural hydrogen which it described as an “inexhaustible source of green energy.” It has been labelled ‘inexhaustible’ because it is believed the chemical reaction that leads to underground natural hydrogen deposits continually regenerates, though technical and scientific knowledge of natural hydrogen reservoirs remains limited.
Gold Hydrogen is currently preparing to drill the Ramsay 2 well on the project, saying “the Ramsay 2 well is expected to spud in mid-November.”
“It is incredibly exciting that we have replicated the results of 100 years ago at 240m,” the Managing Director added. “With the additional find of helium… we view these results as being better than planned.”

The breakthrough led to a long bout of excitement around the company, and saw it attract financial support from some of Australia’s most prominent renewable investors.
Today, the federal government-backed Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has announced a further $11 million for SunDrive to expand its novel solar cell metallisation technology from prototype scale (that is, less than 1.5 MW of annual production) to commercial-scale capacity of more than 100 MW of metallised PV cell production annually. That is enough for around 15,000 household solar systems each year.

Little information on timelines is provided, but SunDrive did say it is aiming to employ around 100 people by the end of the year at their manufacturing facility at Kurnell in Sydney’s south. However, the eventual aim is to grow this to more than 500 staff as production increases in Australia.
Overall, SunDrive’s scale up is expected to cost a total of $33.6 million.

SunDrive’s chief executive Vince Allen started the company with former flatmate David Hu in 2015 based on a solution developed while completing his PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), adding another chapter to UNSW’s storied solar history.
SunDrive’s breakthrough rests on cell metallisation technology that uses copper instead of silver in solar cells. Copper is approximately 100 times cheaper and 1000 time more abundant than the silver currently being used in solar manufacturing, meaning the technology holds massive promise for pushing down solar prices, improving the environmental impacts of solar manufacturing, and helping to rapidly scale-up manufacturing globally.

“In addition to being more cost-effective and material abundant, SunDrive has also pushed the performance of its technology beyond that achievable with silver by creating the world’s most efficient commercial-sized solar cell,” ARENA noted in its announcement.
“By combining these benefits, SunDrive is aiming to produce one of the world’s most advanced solar modules at an installed price that is 20-30 per cent cheaper than other high efficiency solar modules on the market,” ARENA added.
In October 2022, SunDrive completed a $21 million funding round to help commercialise its technology. It has also previously been awarded a $3 million ARENA grant to demonstrate its copper metallisation technology at the currrent prototype scale of 1.5 MW per year.
In 2021, the company announced it had successfully fabricated its first full-size solar panel.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/11/01/transformer-shortages-new-bottleneck-of-the-energy-storage-supply-chain/,"ENERGY STORAGE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,WORLD",MARIJA MAISCH,"NOVEMBER 1, 2023",Transformer shortages: New bottleneck of the energy storage supply chain,"From pv magazine Global
While the BESS supply chain has stabilised in terms of prices and supply of raw materials, lead times for certain components, such as transformers, have greatly extended.
“While global battery supply eased in 2023, after experiencing tightness in supply the previous year, the limited supply of transformers has become the new bottleneck of the energy storage supply chain,” says Kevin Shang, a senior research analyst in Wood Mackenzie.
Transformers are critically important as they enable the BESS connection at all grid levels by stepping up the output voltage to the same level as the grid voltage. Presently, the global transformer market is observing shortages and subsequent increases in prices, mainly due to increased raw material demand, pandemic-related shortages and backlogs, labor constraints, shipping issues, and geopolitical tensions. In some parts of the world, the shortages are acute.
“We have seen a significantly tight supply of transformers in the US and European markets. The prices of transformers used to trend with metal prices. Nowadays, the prices of transformers are more driven up by demand and the industry will have to pay whatever is needed,” Shang tells pv magazine.
According to Shang, there is a minimum lead time of more than one year for transformers of all sizes. “This has a direct impact on system integrators as transformers are integral for grid connection,” Shang says.
In 2022, the global BESS integrator market grew increasingly competitive. According to WoodMac, the the top five global system integrators accounted for 62% of overall BESS shipments (MWh).
Leading vendor, Sungrow dominated the market with 16% of global market share rankings by shipment, followed by Fluence (14%) and Tesla (14%), Huawei (9%), and BYD (9%).
“A common feature behind the leading BESS integrators is that their global presence allows them to access a larger customer base and unlock additional revenue streams. In addition, many BESS integrators have been seeking to enhance the vertical integration of their supply chain,” Shang says.
BESS integrators are usually responsible for procuring individual components, assembling the system, providing a wrap on warranties, integrating the controls and energy management system, and often providing project design and engineering expertise. The are also providing operation, monitoring, and maintenance services.
As the energy storage market continues to expand so does the number of companies active in this space. In China, the BESS integrator market is becoming increasingly competitive, squeezed by both upstream and downstream supply chain participants.
“Possessing manufacturing capacity on key components, like cell, PCS, BMS and EMS, tends to be a necessity rather than a plus as bid requirements for energy storage projects become more detailed and stringent,” Shang says.
In such a surrounding, price has become the most significant distinction and key winning bid factor in the region.
“The price war among system integrators has started in China. We’ve observed an increasing number of players willing to sacrifice profits in exchange for market share, dragging down the profitability of the whole industry,” Shang says.
Consolidation seems imminent in the short and middle term. “We forecast that aggressive bid strategies with little margin will not be sustained. Intensifying market competition will make it difficult for companies with low profitability and no clear competitiveness to survive over the coming years,” Shang says.
According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, mainland China battery energy storage market grew by over 400% in 2022 and is exclusively supplied by local players. This has led to Chinese system integrators moving up on the global rankings. “Competition in international markets will intensify as these Chinese suppliers look to expand globally offering highly competitively priced products,” says S&P Global.
According to the number of installed projects completed as of July this year, S&P Global ranks Sungrow, Fluence and Tesla as the top three BESS integrators globally, followed by Wartsila and Hyperstrong.  Together, these five company have installed over a quarter of global BESS projects, S&P said.
The analysts have also highlighted oversupply as a key reason behind the intense competition in the BESS integrator market amid a large number of battery manufacturing announcements targeted exclusively at the energy storage industry.
“By offering easy-to-install direct current (DC) containers and looking to offer standardized alternating current (AC) solutions in the future, cell manufacturers will further add to the competition in the space,” S&P Global writes in its recently released article.
