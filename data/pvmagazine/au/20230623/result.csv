South Australia-based Yadlamalka said the Spencer Energy Project, developed at Bungama about 60 kilometres north of Port Augusta in the state’s Mid North region, is a “major first” for renewable energy in Australia.
Yadlamalka said the facility will demonstrate the potential for grid-connected vanadium flow batteries to provide energy to the wholesale market and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS).
“Australia’s rapid uptake of renewable energy in recent years has driven the need for investment in flexible energy storage technologies to manage the variable output from those generation sources,” the company said.
“The Spencer Energy Project is pioneering the development of grid-scale, medium-duration vanadium flow batteries to support the renewables transition …  it provides a glimpse into the future of electricity grids in Australia and around the world.”

The Spencer Energy Project utilises vanadium flow battery technology developed at the University of New South Wales in the 1980s to store and ‘time shift’ solar power produced when the sun is at its peak.
“This electricity can then be delivered when it is most needed, such as in the evening when grid loads are high from consumer demand, or when solar generation is no longer available,” Yadlamalka said. “By using vanadium flow batteries to complete this ‘time shift’, solar power becomes ‘dispatchable’, meaning it can be deployed to the grid when it is most valuable, at any time of day or night.”
Yadlamalka said the 8 MWh system, which comprises 41 Invinity VS3 flow batteries supplied by UK-based manufacturer Invinity Energy Systems, will unlock low-cost, low-emission energy for the Australian grid, producing approximately 10 GWh of ‘dispatchable’ solar power each year.
While the uptake of vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) is yet to become widespread, the technology is seen as a leading alternative to the lithium-ion battery technology which currently dominates stationary energy storage applications.
Invinity Chief Commercial Officer Matt Harper said a long lifespan and low environmental impact set flow batteries apart from other storage technologies.
“The major difference is that with a lithium-ion battery, every time you charge and discharge the battery you are one cycle closer to the end of life. Whereas, with our batteries we don’t see any degradation based on cycle life,” he said.
VFBs are also easily scalable with energy stored in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte.
“With our battery, if you want to go from a battery that will provide power for two hours, to one that will provide power for four hours, the only thing you are adding is that liquid electrolyte,” Harper said.

Energy Queensland said the battery, to be installed later this year at its depot at Berrinba in Brisbane’s south, will be used to test the viability of vanadium flow battery technology to provide the medium- and long-duration storage required for the state to meet its renewable energy commitments.
Queensland’s renewable energy targets – which rise to 80% by 2035 – call for an additional 22 GW of new wind and solar projects by 2035, supported by at least 12 GW of storage, firming and dispatchable technologies including grid-scale batteries.
Energy Queensland said it will also work with Vecco to assess the benefits and technical considerations for connecting more vanadium flow batteries to the grid as the state’s electricity system shifts from coal-fired generation to renewables.
Vecco Managing Director Tom Northcott said the technology will be critical to supporting the Queensland energy transition noting vanadium flow batteries, which store energy in a non-flammable, liquid electrolyte, have lower rates of degradation than the lithium-ion batteries that dominate the market, and are almost 100% recyclable.
“Vanadium flow batteries will play a significant role in the Queensland SuperGrid and we expect to see deployments of this proven technology accelerate as the local supply chain expands,” he said.

Vecco has contracted Sumitomo to supply the battery hardware for the Berrinba battery and the vanadium electrolyte will be produced at Vecco’s new $26 million (USD 17.58 million) vanadium electrolyte manufacturing facility in the north Queensland city of Townsville.
Northcott said the facility is the first commercial-scale vanadium battery electrolyte manufacturing plant in Australia and will produce high-grade vanadium electrolyte, opening up downstream manufacturing opportunities and creating a new link in the pit to grid battery supply chain.
“This facility commences operations this week making battery electrolyte for large-scale vanadium flow batteries, such as the battery we are delivering for Energex in partnership with Sumitomo,” he said. “Within two years, we will be mining vanadium, processing vanadium and manufacturing vanadium batteries in Queensland which will create over 500 regional jobs.”
The plant will initially be capable of producing nine megalitres of electrolyte per year, enough to support 175 MWh of energy storage capacity annually before scaling up to 350 MWh.
Vanadium used in production will initially be imported, but the new manufacturing facility will also support the development of Vecco’s Debella Critical Minerals Mine, located near Julia Creek, about 650 kilometres west of Townsville. The Debella project is expected to begin production in 2024 and is forecast to produce 5,500 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide and 2,000 tonnes of high purity alumina per year.

The project, acquired by the Queensland government earlier this year, would integrate the state’s isolated northwest into the National Electricity Market and pave the way for the development of renewable energy projects, including large-scale wind and solar, in the region while also opening up access to large deposits of minerals seen as key to the energy transition.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said the Copperstring project will unlock the full power of the north and is an important feature of the state government’s $62 billion Energy and Jobs Plan that calls for an additional 22 GW of new wind and solar projects by 2035.
“Copperstring 2032 will be connected to the Queensland SuperGrid, the nation’s largest energy grid, meaning that wherever energy is generated we can capture it, send it, store it, and use it wherever it is needed,” he said.
“As CopperString 2032 progresses we’re also set to see a number of high-quality renewables resources become available in the Hughenden region, a region that has the potential to become Australia’s largest renewable energy zone.”

Powerlink said the early works package awarded to the UGL and CPB Contractors joint venture (JV) will fast-track development of design standards for the Townsville to Hughenden section of the project, which includes an increased transmission capacity from 330 kV to 500 kV plus associated works.
Powerlink Chief Executive Paul Simshauser said the awarding of the package, which will cover detailed engineering design, field surveys, geotechnical surveys and geotechnical works, is a significant milestone and marked the first step towards the practical delivery of the project.
“This means the project can progress key engineering design, detailed investigation works and approvals so we can move into the construction phase to connect the North West Minerals Province to the national electricity grid,” he said.
“With joint venture partners UGL and CPB Contractors now on board, we will be fast-tracking development of the design standards for the expanded 500 kV transmission line from Townsville to Hughenden as well as associated works to progress the project towards construction commencing in 2024.”
As well as the expanded Townsville to Hughenden transmission line, the project also includes the construction and commissioning of a 330 kV transmission line from Hughenden to Cloncurry, a 220 kV transmission line linking Cloncurry to Mount Isa, and seven new substations.
The Queensland government allocated $1 billion for the project in the recent state budget, with $594 million of that committed to start construction over the coming financial year.
Powerlink said early works have already commenced with the project expected to be completed by 2029.
The $20 million early works package follows a previous early contractor involvement agreement awarded to the UGL and CPB Contractors JV in 2021 which included scoping, design, site investigations, pricing and progress of the design and construct contract.

The international research group led by Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales in Australia has published Version 62 of the “solar cell efficiency tables” in Progress in Photovoltaics. The scientists said they have added 21 new results to the new tables since December.
“The highlights are a large increase in small-area kesterite (CZTSSe) cell efficiency by the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) from 13.0% to 14.9%, with less dramatic increases in small-area organic PV cell efficiency to 19.2% by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and in small-area perovskite cell efficiency to 26.0% by the Institute of Semiconductors, CAS,” Green told pv magazine.
“Notable perovskite progress is also reported in the 2-terminal tandem cell area, with all-perovskite tandem cell efficiency increasing to 29.1% for a 0.05 cm2 device and 28.2% for a larger 1 cm2 device, with both devices fabricated by Nanjing University in collaboration with Renshine Solar,” he added.
Greener also stressed that new results are reported for perovskite/silicon tandem cells with 33.7%, for a 1-cm2 device fabricated by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and 28.6% efficiency for a much larger, full-sized 258-cm2 cell fabricated by Oxford PV.
“Good progress is also reported in the encapsulated module area, with a large increase for an organic PV module efficiency from 8.7% to 13.1% for a 57-cell module fabricated by Ways Technical Corporation in conjunction with Nanobit,” he explained. “Efficiency gain to 19.2% is also reported for a 39-cell perovskite module fabricated by UtmoLight and to 24.7% for a much larger 112-cell, 1.8m2 silicon module fabricated by Maxeon. Additionally, the first small CIGS module from Avancis with efficiency over 20% is reported. ”
In Version 61 of the tables, released in November the researchers added five new results. The group has seen major improvements in all cell categories since 1993, when the tables were first published.
The research group includes scientists from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the US Department of Energy, and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
