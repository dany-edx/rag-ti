“The inverter offers the ability to have a direct connection of solar and batteries in a three-phase grid connected inverter and can also continue charging batteries from solar PV even in the event of a grid outage, as well as a backup generator input,” Redflow announced.
The integration testing was completed at Redflow’s Integration and Testing facility in South Australia by Redflow Battery Management System Architect, Simon Hackett.

The Deye inverter demonstrated complete compatibility between Redflow’s ZBM3 zinc-bromine flow battery, the company said.
The Deye 10 kW and 12 kW 3-phase hybrid inverters are fully AS4777.2:2020 certified and CEC approved for the Australian market and integrate successfully with solar PV arrays, 48 Vdc battery storage, grid and generator connections in a single cost-effective, outdoor-capable, wall-mounted device, the company added.
“The Deye inverter simplifies the way customers connect to the grid and seamlessly integrates batteries and solar, which will be particularly beneficial for commercial and industrial customers,” Redflow CEO and Managing Director, Tim Harris said.
For larger storage systems, up to 10 Deye inverters can be clustered together in parallel to service large commercial site deployments.
Redflow will also offer the option to integrate the Deye hybrid inverter in to its new QuadPod energy storage solution; a 40 kWh pre-wired enclosure.

The new requirement is part of South Australia’s “Smarter Homes Program” and will give new solar installations the option of choosing a small, fixed export limit or having a system capable of communicating in real time with the operator’s instructions. Those instructions will be based on network conditions.
These dynamic export limits were tested last year by SA Power Networks and are a more sophisticated tool than, say, a remote switch off.
Basically, SA Power Networks will offer households the ability to export up to 10 kW per phase in exchange for remote control access to their system. This would give the households the ability to feed up to six-times more energy back into the grid, compared to the alternative which is a 1.5 kW fixed export power limit. Based on their trials, the network believes flexible exports will give households the opportunity to export up to 10 kW, 98% of the time.
Currently South Australian rooftop systems can export only 5 kW per phase, but as penetration grows that figure will drop in future.
South Australia, a global frontrunner in terms of renewable penetration, has been looking at such a mechanism for some time and had hoped to introduce the “Smarter Homes Program” in July of last year, but pushed that date back to December 2022, before settling on July 2023. 
The reason for the delay was that inverter manufacturers did not have software to actually enable flexible exports ready yet.
Until now, flexible export capacity has only been possible by adding hardware like SwitchDin’s Droplet device to the rooftop system. SolarEdge, however, have become the first manufacturer to develop certify a native Dynamic Export compliant system.
“SolarEdge’s smart inverters achieve this capability without the complexity and additional costs of adding third-party controllers,” the company said.
Their inverters will now have an inbuilt communication capability which will allow them to adapt to network conditions based on instructions from an operator like SA Power Networks. It is a capability other inverter manufacturers are no doubt keenly developing.

This was clearly a point of attraction for the ambitious startup, which is seeking to gain a marketshare for residential solar in both Europe and Australia, partially by forming deep partnerships with “key” manufacturers. So far, the two companies it has brought major stakes in – Solaray Energy and Natural Solar – have been Australia’s number one installers for Enphase microinverters and Tesla Powerwall batteries respectively. 
“We’ve already got two significant players – that’s not by chance,” Chris Williams, the founder of Natural Solar and now the CEO of 1Komma5’s APAC arm, told pv magazine Australia. 
While Williams could not reveal details of any further purchases, he said there were “definitely” more acquisitions in the pipeline. He previously told pv magazine the plan was to make six acquisitions in Australia, with the recent press release noting 1Komma5 would spend its $100 million budget in 2023.

Founders of Solaray Energy, Jonathan Fisk and Pete Thorne, will now have seats as directors in 1Komma5’s global group holding, Williams said. He noted the pair will be “integral” in delivering 1Komma5’s vision of taking a marketshare for residential solar in Australia.
The startup is seeking to realise this through a multi-prong strategy, which in the first part involves acquisitions to expand scale, install coverage and entrepreneurial prowess. Ultimately, the startup is seeking to leverage economies of scale to supercharge its procurement abilities, giving it greater access to products and technologies. It is also seeking better operational efficiencies through elements like centralised logistics and warehousing.
The additional prongs of 1Komma5’s approach include introducing Australia to its “Apple store of energy” concept and its Heartbeat energy management device – both of which are already operating in Europe. In fact, the overall approach effectively replicates an expansion strategy 1Komma5 has already been employing in Europe.

1Komma5 will open its first showroom in Sydney around the middle of this year, Q3, Williams said. There, it will showcase, like an Apple store, its range of solar, batteries, heat pumps, EV chargers as well as the Heartbeat platform.
Heartbeat is an internet of things (IoT) energy management device which controls major electrical appliances in the home. In Europe, the platform has saved some customers up to 100% in their electricity costs, according to the company.
Heartbeat will arrive on Australian shores by Q2 this year – though it will be operating somewhat differently here. In Europe, 1Komma5 is also an electricity retailer and uses its Heartbeat device to create a virtual power plant fleet, Williams says.

In Australia, the device will primarily be used to control and optimise household appliances’ power use behind the meter, though Williams notes 1Komma5 is currently looking to “strategically partner” with virtual power plant (VPP) operator.
Introducing this VPP load control element to Heartbeat will be vital to bringing down costs for consumers in Australia as it has in Europe.
The company says it will offer its Heartbeat device, valued at $2250, free to its first 1000 Australian solar and battery customers.
Having deep ties with manufacturers is vital to effectively deploying Heartbeat, as the byproduct of these relationships is that it drives better integration. As 1Komma5 notes in its recent media release, the Solaray Energy deal expands the global agreement it already had in place with Enphase – an agreement which has enabled Enphase’s microinverters to integrate “seamlessly” with the Heartbeat home manager.

Williams previously told pv magazine the Heartbeat device is “product agnostic” – but given that integration between brands is one of the biggest complications in creating energy “ecosystems,” strong relationships are vital. 
1Komma5 is hoping its sheer scale will give it considerable power when coming to the table with manufacturers and other technology suppliers. While it is still fresh in Australia, 1Komma5 has reached 30,000 installs per annum globally.
Only founded in 2021, 1Komma5 is led by executives with experience running companies like Tesla, Google, sonnen, Porsche, and Klarna. It is headed up by Philipp Schröder, formerly the managing director of Sonnen and Tesla’s country director in Germany. This management team has seen 1Komma5 attract capital funding from the likes of Porsche and other institutional investors.

1Komma5 has so far acquired 25 companies across Europe and operates in over 40 locations. It sees Australia as a key market due to its maturity. Moreover, it is a market Williams previously described as “ripe” for consolidation.
1Komma5 is now trying to execute this consolidation, with Williams saying the two acquisitions have already seen it massively grow its Australian coverage in the four months operating here.
“At the moment, the [1Komma5] group is really offering services and products to probably about 95% of the Australian population across those key regions.” Both long established companies in the Australian market, Natural Solar and Solaray do this via a combination of in-house installers and subcontractors.

Researchers from the Sunlab laboratory at the University of Ottawa have devised a new way to measure the energy yield of bifacial PV systems. The innovation is intended to complement the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) measuring standard introduced in 2019.
The new scaled rear irradiance (SRI) method purportedly improves IEC measurements by accommodating the effects of different ground covers’ spectral albedo in its calculation of the bifacial system’s rear-side irradiance.
To prove the concept, the scientists modelled the performance of a bifacial silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar module under the IEC bifacial illumination technique and the SRI method. They mounted the system on a horizontal single-axis tracker 1.22 meters from the ground in Boulder, Colorado, United States. The ground covers considered were soil, red brick, green grass, roof shingle, concrete, sand, dry grass, and snow.
Results show that for a rear irradiance of 200 W/square meters, the IEC measurement does not distinguish between the different ground covers, overestimating bifacial gain by between 14% and 1.4% for all ground covers except snow. The SRI method, on the other hand, shows a clear differentiation between the range of operating conditions.
“Implementation of this method into international standards for such panels can enable predictions of outdoor bifacial panel performance to within 2% absolute,” said researcher Erin Tonita.
The new method can also predict energy yield gains in locations other than Boulder with an error of less than 7%, according to the academics.
The innovation could be used to compare different bifacial technologies and enhance system performance via ground cover-specific design optimization, the authors said. They shared their findings in “A general illumination method to predict bifacial photovoltaic system performance,” which was recently published in Joule.

An interdisciplinary consortium led by Italy’s Eurac Research has launched a new research project, Symbiosyst,  to develop technological solutions and strategies to increase the competitiveness of agrivoltaics solutions across Europe, while minimising the impact on the landscape.
The consortium aims to develop standardised cost-effective PV modules, mounting structures, and O&M solutions that meet the needs of various crops across climates and landscapes. Planned innovations will include the use of functional coatings from Dutch tech specialist Physee in greenhouses. The coatings reportedly optimise the sunlight entering the greenhouse through spectral shifting by converting UV light into photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which improves crop growth.
The pilot project will also seek to adapt single horizontal axis tracker technology used in PV utility-scale systems to agrivoltaic applications. The tracker technology of Italian manufacturer Convert, a unit of US-based Valmont, will be used in three steel mono-axial tracker structures less than 2.10 meters high. The trackers will be made of weathering steel, a low-cost material that turns brown over time, lowering the visual impact of the structure.
Symbiosyst will also develop a SCADA control system paired with a tracker tilting control system, in order to reduce the use of cables. The project will demonstrate the technology by setting up agrivoltaic plant demonstrators. The solutions will be in-field studied in four agricultural scenarios differing in location, climate, size, and kinds of crops.
“Our role at Eurac Research will concern the development of methodologies to aid the early design of agri-PV plants, to look into sustainability aspects and to go beyond social acceptance,” said David Moser, project coordinator.
The other consortium members include Belgian research center Imec, Italian research energy ENEA, German module manufacturer Aleo Solar, and Spain’s Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.
