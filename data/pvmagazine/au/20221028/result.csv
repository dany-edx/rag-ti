https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/28/report-finds-sustainability-skills-gap-in-australian-financial-sector/,"FINANCE,MARKETS & POLICY,AUSTRALIA,HONG KONG,SINGAPORE,UNITED KINGDOM",BLAKE MATICH,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",Report finds sustainability skills gap in Australian financial sector,"The rapidly growing influx of money into climate-conscious development, known generally as green finance, has become big business in recent years. Moreover, financial regulators such as central banks are starting to scrutinise financial practices in order to achieve greater accountability in green finance. However, the ISF’s key conclusion from its survey was that there is currently a climate skills gap in the Australian financial sector, a gap that “is likely to grow unless urgent action is taken.”
According to one respondent: “The specialisation of skills/knowledge required for this area has moved very quickly and there are not enough people who have experience of both climate and the finance sector.”
To that end, the report’s authors say Australia “requires a sustainable finance learning ecosystem to support sustainable finance skills development.” That ecosystem can be fostered through the recommendation of establishing a “Sustainable Finance Skills Partnership, with an annual Australian Sustainable Finance Skills Report providing a mechanism to benchmark development on an annual basis.”

“If financial system participants are not sufficiently skilled or business practices are not updated, in areas such as insurance, lending and investment, it could lead to a worsening of the risks and impacts on the stability of the financial system,” says ISF Research Director Gordon Noble. “It could, at worst, impede the rapid, economy-wide decarbonisation and reallocation of capital needed to meet the Paris Climate Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. As overseas financial markets move to upskill, Australia risks being left behind”
The survey itself, titled “Advancing climate skills in the Australian financial system”, saw responses from 71 sustainable finance professionals working in asset management, banking, superannuation and other financial services like accounting. The results showed that over 75% of respondents said climate skills “are in moderate to high demand in their organisation.” But what are climate skills?
Climate skills 
Climate skills, also known as climate risk-related skills or sustainable finance skills, include proficiencies such as accounting, risk management and assessment of investment opportunities.
Among the “climate skills” identified by the respondents to be most important are reporting and disclosure, climate risk management, and scenario analysis.
63% of respondents said they need to upskill on these fronts, however more than 70% said barriers exist to upskilling, pointing to lack of time, lack of access to information, lack of relevant training resources and lack of relevant credentials.
What can be said for sure is that the respondents expect the demand for climate skills to grow over the next five years driven by stakeholder requirements.

This trend is visible around the world as financial centres like Singapore, London and Hong Kong look to push improve climate skills. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is supporting three sustainable finance centres, in the UK the Green Finance Education Charter has the support of the City of London and the UK government, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has supported the establishment of the Centre for Green and Sustainable Finance (GSF Centre) to “build capacity and enhance talent and data resources for the financial industry.”
ISF’s program lead for business, economy and governance, Alison Atherton, said “There is currently no structured system-wide mechanism to identity and monitor climate or sustainable finance skills and competency. An annual survey would provide valuable data on skills for financial system participants to identify and proactively respond to skills needs and gaps.”
Remedies
The ISF report’s suggestion of a Sustainable Finance Skills Partnership would bring together industry, government, regulators, universities, researchers and other professional finance training providers in a consortium for collaboration on sustainable finance skills.
On top of this, an Australian Sustainable Finance Skills Report would keep track of sector competencies over time.

He tells the story of how some years ago a customer challenged him saying, “You are selling me a product and offering me 25 years warranty, but your company is not even 25 years old, so how can you know the product will be around for that long? And also how can you guarantee your company will be with us for 25 years?” 
At the CEC All-Energy conference and exhibition in Melbourne this week, Trina Solar celebrated 25 years in business with a rooftop party overlooking the city.  Li was proud to remind 160 attendees that Trina could also toast having broken 25 world solar efficiency records, averaging one such milestone every year, since its inception. 
The latest record was claimed on August 24 when Trina Solar announced that its Vertex high-efficiency monocrystalline silicon module, based on 210mm high-efficiency n-type i-TOPCon cells, had achieved aperture module efficiency of 24.24%.
In a difficult global market challenged by supply chain issues, rising costs and constraints on resources, Li said he was also “quite proud” when he heard that the Warwick Johnston’s influential SunWiz report had “ranked Trina Sola as number one in Australia in terms of the shipment volumes of solar panels last year.” According to SunWiz, Trina currently holds the highest market share for solar panels in Australia.
The volume of installations and orders has been “the main reason,” says Li, “for us to increase the workforce here.” Trina recently doubled its sales, administrative, engineering and after-sales team in Australia from six to 12.
At All-Energy, in the shadow of Trina’s new enormous Vanguard 1P tracker which held aloft a carport-size solar panel, Li extolled the virtues of new modules introduced to Australia this week, including the Vertex DE19R, and Vertex N NEG19RC.20 for the small and large-scale utility segments.
“The R series in particular features our unique technology,” he says: Trina’s reshaping of solar cells from square shapes to a more rectangular form has increased the power output of these modules. At the same time, says Li, it “makes the solar panels slightly longer, but narrower, so they’re easier for installations and for carrying”. An additional bonus of the reconfiguration is that more panels can be packed into each shipping container at a time when transportation costs are at a premium.
“The main purpose nowadays,” says Li, goes beyond the power output of the panels. “It’s more about the LCOE savings at the system level. We’re moving to solutions-based ideas instead of purely module manufacturing.”
In the near future he says, Trina Storage will be added to Trina Solar and TrinaTracker in the Australian market, with energy storage solutions for both large scale and residential applications.

In the meantime the Atlas-like Vanguard 1P demonstrates Trina’s commitment to integrated solutions. The only panel manufacturer to also produce trackers, Trina has refined the integration and grown the range of trackers since it purchased Spanish tracker maker, Nclave two years ago.
Trina is claiming energy yield improvements of up to 15% from the deployment of Vanguard 1P trackers, which have been designed to perform in challenging conditions, including high winds. 
Controlling variables by providing complete solutions has also become an imperative on the manufacturing front, where Trina is seeking to manage global supply chain issues. Its new industrial park, currently under development in Xining, the capital of China’s Qinghai province will span virtually the whole PV manufacturing chain from poly silicon production to completed modules based on 210 and n-type technology.

The first phase of this industrial complex is expected to be completed by the end of next year, when it will begin delivering an annual 300,000 tonnes of high-purity silicon; 35 GW of mono silicon; 10 GW of wafer slices; 10 GW of cells and 10GW of modules to an global market seeking to accelerate decarbonisation with renewable energies.
Li says Trina Solar is involved in discussions with a number of green hydrogen project developers to provide reliable solar energy supply with record-breaking efficiency.

On Oct. 26, Energy Vault announced that it had won the contract to install a 250 MW/500 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) at the 330 MW Meadow Creek Solar Farm in Victoria.
Though still in its early stages of development, the Meadow Creek Solar Farm is set to be located outside the town of Wangaratta and could produce enough clean energy to power 110,000 regional homes.
The company’s short duration energy storage (SDES) solution is a lithium-ion based system designed for use cases requiring up to four hours of storage capacity.
Energy Vault is better known for its gravity EVx storage system is comparable to pumped hydro, using grid-scale renewable energy when supply is abundant to drive motors and raise 30-ton blocks on a six-arm crane tower, rather than water, up to a height. When power needs to be discharged back to the grid, the blocks are lowered, harvesting the kinetic energy.
However, in the case of the Meadow Creek Solar Farm a company statement suggests this battery will be a more typical BESS system, grid connected so that it can take advantage of Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS). The company said the battery “will provide the resiliency and flexibility of charge and discharge, essential to shoring up renewable energy supply across the network as Australia adopts the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Integrated System Plan.”
“We are delighted to be selected for this important project in Australia,” said Lucas Sadler, vice president of sales and business development for the APAC region for Energy Vault. “Over the past few months, the new Australian federal government has sent a strong mandate to the market to expedite the transition to renewable energy technologies supported by significant state government updates to their clean energy and emissions reduction targets. The Meadow Creek Solar Farm, Hybrid Solar PV and BESS Developments goals are well met with the market release of Energy Vault’s AC and DC block bespoke energy storage solutions for the Australian market.”
Meadow Creek Solar Farm’s development manager, Cameron Munro, said “Energy Vault’s high energy density design, the option to work with both central storage inverters or the new AC Block and the most advanced energy management software, that enables multiple use cases, optimal economic dispatching and predictive maintenance, bring flexibility and further options when working with our financial and technical partners (DNV and AusNet Services).”
Gravity storage
Energy Vault is best known as a gravity storage specialist. The company says there is zero degradation in the storage capacity of its technology’s composite blocks, which can remain in the raised position for unlimited periods of time. Its composite blocks are developed in cooperation with Mexico’s Cemex, using local soil at sites where it builds its storage systems, as well as other materials such as recycled coal ash, waste tailings from mining operations, and decommissioned wind turbine blades.
Energy Vault’s EVx tower features 80% to 85% round-trip efficiency and over 35 years of technical life. It has a scalable modular design up to multiple gigawatt-hours in storage capacity.
The company says its technology can economically serve both higher power/shorter duration applications with ancillary services from two to four hours and can also scale to serve longer-duration requirements from five to 24 hours or more.

With multiple regions looking to accelerate domestic manufacturing amid the geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities that have plagued the solar manufacturing sector as of late, a new study finds that a globalised solar PV supply chain has been instrumental in lowering module prices in the 2006-2020 period.
Researchers in the US have calculated that the globalised supply chain saved $103 billion (USD 67 billion) in solar panel production costs compared with a counterfactual scenario in which domestic manufacturers supplied an increasing proportion of installed capacities over the given period.
Specifically, their study looked at historically installed capacities as well as input material and sales price data for deploying solar panel modules in the US, Germany and China — the three largest solar-deploying countries. It found that the globalised solar supply chain has delivered savings of $37 billion for the U.S., $10.7 billion for Germany and $55.4 billion for China.
Had each of the three countries adopted strong nationalistic trade policies that limited cross-border learning over the same time period, solar panel prices in 2020 would have been significantly more expensive — 107% higher in the US, 83% higher in Germany, and 54% higher in China — according to the study “Quantifying the cost savings of global solar photovoltaic supply chains,” published in Nature.
The research team also looked at the cost implications of more protectionist trade policies going forward. They estimate that if strong nationalistic policies are implemented, solar panel prices will be approximately 20-25% higher in each country by 2030 compared to a future with globalised supply chains. Policies such as imposing import tariffs could complicate efforts to accelerate deployment of renewables like solar by raising the cost of production, the researchers said.
“Policies that cut off global value chains and restrict flows of people and capital will disrupt the global learning processes that have contributed precisely to solar’s success story,” said Michael Davidson, assistant professor at University of California San Diego and coauthor on the study. “Models demonstrating the feasibility of meeting ambitious clean energy targets rely upon continued cost declines which may not materialise if countries choose to go it alone.”
In light of the recently adopted Inflation Reduction Act in the US, the largest climate energy package in the country’s history, John Helveston, lead author of the study and assistant professor of engineering management and systems engineering at the George Washington University, said, “What our study contributes to this conversation is a reminder not to implement these policies in a protectionist manner. Supporting the US manufacturing base can and should be done in a way that encourages firms to trade with foreign partners to continue to accelerate cost reductions.”

At the same time, the Council’s costs for street lighting were slashed by $201,870.
With installations such as a 265 kW rooftop system atop the Andrew ‘Boy’ Charlton Aquatic Centre in Manly, and having added another 500 kW of solar in 2022 alone, Council’s total solar installation stands at 900 kW.

On top of that, the Council has reduced its overall corporate carbon emissions by around 20,000 tonnes through its PPA with Iberdrola’s Bodangora Wind Farm in regional New South Wales (NSW).
Wind and solar combined, the Council expects to save $2.4 million over seven years.

“By investing in solar and switching to renewable energy, we have reduced our emissions by around 80% and slashed our energy costs,” said Northern Beaches Mayor Michael Regan.
“It’s a win for the community with savings directed back into infrastructure upgrades and community projects right across the Northern Beaches,” Regan continued. “We are proud to be part of a future-minded community that champions sustainability and climate change action.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/28/cooling-down-solar-modules-by-increasing-space-between-panel-rows/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESEARCH,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,UTILITY SCALE PV,UNITED STATES",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",Cooling down solar modules by increasing space between panel rows,"From pv magazine Global. 
A research group led by the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has proposed a new approach to utilise connective heat transfer for solar module cooling in large-scale solar power plants.
Their modelling considers factors such as row spacing, panel height, and tilt angle. It also uses a length scale input to characterise the space through which air moves around or through the solar modules. In the standard models, by contrast, the length often used is a ratio of module dimensions, which ignores PV plant configuration.
“The convective heat transfer curve was generated through computational flow simulations and wind tunnel experiments that allowed for convective heat transfer to be described for a lacunarity length scale value that describes the spacing of the entire PV array through a single length unit,” the scientists said, claiming that using the lacunarity length scale leads to 1.5% more accurate power production.
Their techno-economic analysis considered 1 MW south-facing PV systems located in Phoenix, Arizona, with a fixed tilt angle of 30 degrees over different row spacings, or ground coverage ratio (GCR). The annual land lease cost was assumed at $0.054/m2. The row spacing of the PV plants was varied from two to 11 meters, corresponding to GCR values of 0.73 to 0.08.
“Increasing spacing could enable more varieties of crops and more types of agricultural equipment to be utilised in agrivoltaic systems,” said Jordan Macknick, who leads a different NREL research project focused on agrivoltaics. “That could potentially make these spaced-out solar systems more cost-effective and compatible with larger-scale agriculture.”
Through the modelling, the group ascertained that the optimal levelled cost of energy (LCOE) point was $0.29/kWh, with row spacing varying between 4.83 and 7.34 meters. With two-meter spacing, the LCOE was $0.33/kWh, and with 11 meters it was $0.36/kWh.
The group found that the greatest LCOE improvements were registered in climates with low average annual ambient temperatures and moderate to high average annual wind speeds across the US. They presented the modelling in the study “Technoeconomic Analysis of Changing PV Array Convective Cooling Through Changing Array Spacing,” recently published in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.
Other recent proposals for using convective solar module cooling include packing PV panels in close proximity, and taking wind direction and module inclination into account.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/10/28/vietnam-set-to-open-renewable-energy-market-to-ppas/,"MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,VIETNAM",BEATRIZ SANTOS,"OCTOBER 28, 2022",Vietnam set to open renewable energy market to PPAs,"From pv magazine Global. 
Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIOT) aims to open up Vietnam’s electricity market to bilateral PPAs through a pilot scheme that would, for the first time, enable renewable energy generators to directly sell electricity to private off-takers under virtual or synthetic deals.
Under current regulations, the state-owned energy company Electricity Vietnam (EVN) has a monopoly over the transmission, distribution, wholesale and retail of electricity and is the sole buyer in the market.
The scheme is yet to be launched, and “no clear date exists yet,” Moritz Sticher, senior advisor at Berlin-based consulting firm Apricum, told pv magazine. It was scheduled to run between 2022 and 2024, with expectations now pointing to the first quarter of 2023. The official program following the pilot scheme should then start in 2025.
The government has drafted several pieces of legislation since 2020 and several amendments have continued to drag the program on. In January, changes to the scheme’s tariff structure were introduced. “The off-taker would now buy at the retail price instead of spot market price plus PPA charges,” said Sticher. The national utility, Genco, would still be paid by EVN at wholesale price. The buyer and the generator would also enter into a forward contract for difference for future trading cycles.
“This mechanism now gives investors a fixed tariff and puts the risk of tariff fluctuation on the offtaker. The tariff change from wholesale to retail tariff for off-takers means around 2% more share to EVN and hence slightly reduced returns on the investor side (assuming the off-taker will aim for the same total tariff) and slightly less attractive for off-takers due to the change in electricity tariff risk,” Sticher explained.
The pending PPA program has hindered utility-scale project development in Vietnam, which has “little appetite for quick large-scale solar capacity additions,” according to Sticher. Constant uncertainty around renewable energy targets, ongoing curtailment issues, and stranded projects from the previous feed-in-tariff rounds have also allegedly contributed to that scenario.
Vietnam currently has around 18.47 GW of solar capacity installed, according to data from Apricum’s new “Solar power in ASEA” report. The National Power Development Plan VII reduced solar targets up to 2045 to 13.6 GW of utility-scale and 3.4 GW of rooftop solar. Offshore and onshore wind would compensate for the decrease in solar generation, as well as electricity imported from Laos, according to Apricum.
The commercial and industrial (C&I) segment is growing in the country, with Apricum forecasting 10,792 MWp of total installed capacity by the end of 2022, according to its central scenario. Most C&I projects are financed by independent power producers.
