Japan’s Mitsui owns 50% of the Waitsia gas field in the state’s mid-west alongside Beach Energy, a company backed by media moguel Kerry Stokes. The Waitsia project sparked controversy in August after it was exempted from the state’s ban on onshore gas exports at premier Mark McGowan’s behest. That’s another story, but suffice to say fossil fuel industries in Australia have friends in high places. 
Western Australia’s government, which is going big on hydrogen, has also given millions for hydrogen to be blended into gas networks. Atco, the gas distributor behind Western Australia’s blending program, is far from the only company-state pairing pursuing this pathway, with plans emerging across Australia, including Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria.
Behind each of these plans lays the supposition that hydrogen will simply, cleanly and neatly replace our current fuels. It will one day flood our gas pipelines and launder our dirty substances so they can again be sold to hungry, presumably unquestioning, markets. Think: our world, exactly as it is, only powered by hydrogen.
 Andrew Horvath, for one, isn’t convinced.
Horvath is the founder and global chairman of hydrogen technology company Star Scientific. He is also the only Australian selected to sit on the Sustainable Energy Council’s World Hydrogen Advisory Board. 
He flatly calls hydrogen gas blending “stupid”. Unlike most clean energy advocates though, he does believe gas will be part of the energy transition – less because it’s a lower carbon option and more because millions of Australian households already have it hooked up.
“Where [gas companies] cross the line is saying, ‘Hey let’s run a turbine and put 20% gas in it and that shows we are decarbonising.’ Well no, it doesn’t. It just shows you don’t know physics,” he told pv magazine Australia.
“The problem with that is hydrogen doesn’t burn the way other things do.” Hydrogen has a lower energy density than natural gas, so mixing it into pipelines means spending more to produce less, he says.

The Energy Transition Hub’s strategic advisory panel member, Scott Hamilton, is less barbed in his take on hydrogen gas blending, though he sees its prospects as very limited. “In the short term, if we can do things to help bring the tech [green hydrogen] in, then I’m pragmatic about that,” Hamilton told pv magazine Australia.
“What it’s really gearing us up for is the large scale production of hydrogen, renewable ammonia, green steel, and green aluminium… and that’s the money.”
Again unlike other clean energy voices, Horvath is skeptical the burgeoning hydrogen industry will be satisfied taking solar offcuts, running their electrolysers in the middle of the day when the dreaded duck rears its curvy head. Instead, he thinks it’s far more likely hydrogen producers will want to be generating round the clock – a promise clearly most deliverable by using the process of steam reforming.
But Horvath isn’t buying that either.  “I equate it to making hydrogen with a ball and chain around it, using gas,” he said. It simply isn’t good practice to make a multimillion dollar investment into something known to have a problem from day one, he says.
Scott Hamilton agrees, pointing out the elephant in the blue hydrogen room: “the huge amount of vested interest in propping up fossil fuels.” These vested interests run through many levels of Australian government and of them we must be “wary and conscious”.
International Energy Agency (IEA)
So what will the future look like? Well, Horvath is an advocate for reusing existing infrastructure (which is actually one of the pillars proponents of a like-for-like transition rest their case on). His version looks a bit different though, with his company positing quite a novel way of using hydrogen. 
Rather than burning it or generating electricity from it by using a fuel cell, Horvath thinks hydrogen should be used in conjunction with Star Scientific’s Hydrogen Energy Release Optimiser (HERO) technology which can be coated on any surface. When hydrogen meets the HERO technology it reacts to generate temperatures of around 700 degrees Celsius. This holds promise for infrastructure reuse because the technology, according to the company, can be easily layered on existing spinning mass turbines in traditional thermal systems.

Star Scientific is marketing its technology as something of a ‘demand activator’, which is to say Horvath’s longterm vision looks slightly different to the short term introduction of hydrogen into thermal systems to save stranded assets. 
Looking further into the future, Horvath believes energy systems will probably look more like a series of interconnected microgrids. Instead of Australia’s expansive and rather poorly connected network, he says the country’s energy systems will likely be decluttered and made up of many smaller nodes which will incorporate distributed energy resources like solar as well as having small turbines running on (unburned, reacting) hydrogen to provide baseload power.
Obviously companies and the powerful lobbies they employ aren’t going down without a fight, and Horvath doesn’t begrudge them of that. But they need to invest more money in understanding new technologies like hydrogen, Horvath says. Both Horvath and Hamilton believe big companies can and should be part of the clean energy transition, but that involvement must be predicated on knowing the future won’t look like the past.
The notion that future energy systems will just be tweaked versions of their current form is, for Horvath, a sign of small thinking. The introduction of the electricity grid, the world’s largest man-made machine, seismically changed society and completely overturned old systems. The clean energy transition, he expects, will too.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/06/carbon-negative-hydrogen-ammonia-hub-plan-part-unveiled-for-bundaberg/,"HYDROGEN,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",BELLA PEACOCK,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",‘Carbon negative’ hydrogen & ammonia hub plan partially unveiled for Bundaberg,"A new joint venture between Australian company Clean Holdings proprietary limited and Singapore-based CAC-H2 will see hydrogen and ammonia produced in the Queensland agricultural hub of Bundaberg. The plan is to produce enough of the green fuel for domestic use and export, with Clean Holdings’ chief executive Ken Mathews telling pv magazine Australia the longterm vision is to replicate the project’s model at multiple deep-water ports along the country’s east coast. 
The companies are aiming to attract more than $400 million worth of investment into the project, which at this stage will involve using agricultural waste as a feedstock (Bundaberg is one of Australia’s largest sugar cane growers) to be gasified and thereby produce hydrogen.
CAC-H2, which is delivering the gasification technology for the project, claims its method is carbon negative, since it generates hydrogen from materials which sequester carbon leaving it with a biochar byproduct which can then be reused in agriculture.
Importantly, Mathews says the Bundaberg project’s scope will shortly expand with the announcement of an additional partner and technological component. The details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks, if not days.

As part of the project, the companies are seeking to construct a deep-water wharf at the Bundaberg port specifically for large scale export of green hydrogen and its more condensed derivative, ammonia, to Japan and South Korea. The project expects to produce 30,000 metric tonnes of ammonia per year.
Mathews said his eye is on becoming one of the largest ammonia producers and exporters in Australia, with his company Clean Holdings part of a larger consortium with ties to Asia and vast ambitions.
If it felt like CAC-H2 just appeared from nowhere in the past month, that’s because it did. Well, kind of. The company is itself a joint venture, the coming together of Malaysian-based gasification and EPC company Renewables Plus and CannAcubed, the making of Singapore-based Australian Glenn Davies.
While CAC-H2 is officially based in Singapore, Arman Massoumi, its chief executive of energy, said the company was established with the sole aim of developing hydrogen projects in Australia. At the company’s helm is himself and Australian Glenn Davies.
CAC-H2 was only formalised shortly before the announcement of its first project in September. Partnering with Sweetman Renewables, the pair plan to produce hydrogen in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, in what is to be the country’s first biomass to hydrogen plant.
Though the application of CAC-H2’s technology is novel, the process itself is not. Gasification, including to make hydrogen, has been around for decades but has typically used fossil fuel feedstocks like coal. CAC-H2, on the other hand, is seeking to use waste biomass. 
Its gasification facilities can use any plant life as a feedstock and are modular by design, with Massoumi describing them as a “miniaturisation” of established facilities.

Crucially, Massoumi says, the company’s technology does not combust biomass (burning wood, of course, releases carbon dioxide), but rather gasifies it in the absence of oxygen.
“We get wood and gasify it, or we get corn cob or cannabis, whatever, you get a gas that is a fuel gas with 20% hydrogen in it. We are then separating the hydrogen from that gas… so you’re removing the part that is sought after,” Massoumi told pv magazine Australia.
Next to hydrogen, the units output nitrogen (50%) and carbon dioxide (20%). Massoumi said the company will likely release the nitrogen into the atmosphere because it has a low market value, while the CO2 will be emitted “into a greenhouse farm” or otherwise used or sequestered.
Despite these two greenhouse gas byproducts, Massoumi is adamant the company’s process is still carbon negative thanks to its biochar. Biochar is basically charcoal and contains much of the carbon its source plant sequestered. Biochar is an increasingly in-demand product for agriculture, used to build soil and help it retain water.
This valuable byproduct, according to Massoumi, means CAC-H2’s processes are “greener than green” with the executive saying for every tonne of biochar, the equivalent of 3.67 tonnes of carbon dioxide is sequestered. After the release of carbon dioxide and nitrogen during gasification, Massoumi says the final ‘carbon receipt’ of the company’s process is reduced to around 2.5 to 3 tonnes worth of sequestration, still placing it firmly in the black. (That is, so long as no one tries to burn the biochar.)
Hydrogen produced through gasification, Massoumi says, is also cheaper than that made through electrolysis. In fact, the company is confident it can reach Australia’s stretch goal of H2 for $2 before 2030.

 
“We consume one third of the electricity of electrolysis,” Massoumi says, adding that its feedstock of waste wood or agricultural waste is either free or the company is paid to take it. Adding to that, project can then sell the biochar it produces. “As a result, we are not only relying on one source,” Massoumi says.
This loop whereby the project takes the region’s abundant agricultural waste (most likely sugar cane) and produces hydrogen with a byproduct of biochar which then goes back into agricultural production is something its developers expect will make the proposition highly attractive.
Indeed, Bundaberg has already begun experimenting with biofuels and co-location, with its council championing the development of the town’s bioHub. Clean Holding’s Ken Mathews himself ended up in Bundaberg at the behest of the region’s local government in fact. “Bundaberg, we got involved there initially because the ex-mayor reached out to us,” Mathews told pv magazine Australia back in June. He said he was invited up to Bundaberg, shown around and encouraged to scale up the ambition of his project – which was actually fast tracked by Queensland’s Cooordinator General. “When we went, [the project] was going to be a small example, but it grew very rapidly,” he said. 
Bundaberg is keen to rival its neighbouring Gladstone, which has been tipped by the federal government to be the state’s hydrogen powerhouse.
Construction on the new hydrogen and ammonia facility is expected to commence “as soon as possible”, with the companies saying first hydrogen production could come as early as December 2022. pv magazine Australia will report on the evolving details of project as soon as they are made public.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/06/panasonic-launches-5-kw-fuel-cell-system-for-commercial-applications/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,HYDROGEN,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,JAPAN,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",Panasonic launches 5 kW fuel cell system for commercial applications,"From pv magazine Global
Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic has launched a 5 kW pure hydrogen fuel cell generator for commercial applications. It has previously installed the fuel cell in several pilot projects in Japan.
Dubbed H2 Kibou, the fuel cell system works with pure hydrogen at a density of more than 99.97%, and achieves electrical efficiency of 56%. “The higher electrical efficiency leads to the reduction in hydrogen use, therefore contributing to the reduction of total running cost,” the manufacturer said in a statement.
The system has dimensions of 834×417×1,766 mm and weighs 205 kg including the design panel. “The power output can be scaled up according to demand by connecting and controlling multiple generator units,” the company stated. “In addition, by taking advantage of its lightweight and compact housing, this generator can be flexibly adapted to various installation conditions, including the rooftop and in narrow spaces.”

The company also explained that, using a simple PC application, it is possible to bundle together up to ten units for a total capacity of 50 kW, and that these units can be further combined to create a MW-sized installation.  “By connecting a hot water storage unit (recommended product) with the product, heat generated from the fuel cell can be converted into hot water for use,” it also emphasised. “The generator has achieved total energy efficiency of 95% including the heat recovery, thereby allowing the effective use of energy without waste.”
The new product can be used with an operating temperature between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius, at altitudes not exceeding 500 m. During power outages, it is able to generate electricity and to use up to 2.5 kW of its capacity for at least 120 hours. “The product can be started in approximately one minute, which is useful for responding to peak cut control when a quick response from generators is required,” Panasonic highlighted.
The device was used by the Japanese conglomerate in a pilot hydrogen plant combined with photovoltaics and storage it built at its fuel cell factory in Kusatsu, Shiga Prefecture, in central Japan.
“Through this demonstration, Panasonic will accumulate know-how and establish a track record in energy management, including the operation of pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, and aim to commercialise the RE100 solution, which uses power generated in-house from renewable sources to supply 100% of the electricity required for business activities,” the company said at the time.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/10/06/solar-tile-with-14-2-efficiency-from-denmark/,"HIGHLIGHTS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,DENMARK,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"OCTOBER 6, 2021",Solar tile with 14.2% efficiency from Denmark,"From pv magazine Global
Danish start-up Dansk Solenergi ApS has developed a solar tile with a power output of 175 W and a power conversion efficiency of 14.2%.
The building-integrated PV product is built with 72 monocrystalline cells with a size of 125 x 125 mm. It measures 1,610 x 810 x 6 mm and weighs in at 13.6 kg. Its open-circuit voltage is 44.1 V and its short-circuit current is 5.3 A. The tile can be used in PV systems with a maximum voltage of 1,000 V. 
The product also comes with IP65 protection, a 25-year linear power output guarantee and a 12-year product guarantee. The operating temperature coefficient is -0.34% per degree Celsius.
According to Dansk Solenergy, the tile can be used on heritage buildings, new residential complexes, architectural projects, churches, and building facades. The tiles can be manufactured in different patterns and colours and be adapted to customer requirements.
“Our capacity is 40 MW per year — that means 85,000 square meters and production will increase next year,” a company’s spokesperson told pv magazine. “We are in talks with some big companies to invest and upscale our production capacity.”
The manufacturer is currently producing the tile with monocrystalline PERC cells, but it may switch to back-contact devices in the future. “The company’s patented colouring technology can be adapted to any production line,” the spokesperson added.
The company also claims its technology has many other applications in thermal devices, illumination and signboards. “This technology is totally safe for the environment. It’s not flammable,” the spokesperson stated. “The design of the building elements make it easy to install at a very competitive price for both new buildings and building renovation.”
