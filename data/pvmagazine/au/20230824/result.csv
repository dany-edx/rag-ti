Jacana Executive Manager, Commercial, Rebecca Tilbrook told an industry briefing that the addition of battery energy storage is necessary to smooth out intermittent output of solar energy and is expected to help alleviate the connection issues that have beset other large-scale solar farms built in the Territory in recent years.
Four solar farms with a combined generation capacity of almost 60 MW have been built in the NT in the past few years but are yet to commence full operations as the developers work to satisfy generator performance standards outlined by the Territory government-owned Power and Water Corporation.
Tilbrook said Jacana, the Territory’s largest energy retailer, is planning to “force” more renewables into the grid but “we want to do that in a way that supports stability.”
“We want it to be co-located with battery storage,” she said. “We believe that will help with that connection process.”
“The Darwin-Katherine Interconnected System is an isolated, relatively small system. We’ve created a technical scope which we believe will help achieve a more streamlined development and connection approach.”
Tilbrook said the EOI is the first step to procuring more large-scale solar closer to Darwin with the new solar farms and battery energy storage systems expected to be “connected and delivering energy by 2027.”
The successful proponents will be required to build, own and operate the new solar generation and firming assets with Jacana to ink an offtake agreement for the supply of electricity.
The project is expected contribute as much as 15% towards the NT government’s renewable energy target of 50% by 2030.
Jacana Chief Executive Officer Louisa Kinnear said the non-binding EOI process will allow the retailer to validate project feasibility and determine what the market appetite is to deliver large-scale solar with storage in the Territory.
“There has already been significant interest in the EOI from the renewables industry and we are looking forward to the proposals put forward to us over the coming weeks,” she said.
Submissions for the EOI process will close on 26 September 2023.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/24/chelion-unveils-scalable-battery-storage-solution/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MICROGRID,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 24, 2023",Chelion unveils scalable battery storage solution,"The Australian arm of China-headquartered Chelion Renewables Group has confirmed that the integrated components of its Matrix CAIO battery cabinet have been granted Clean Energy Council (CEC) approval for sale in Australia.
The Matrix CAIO, according to the company, has a 95% roundtrip efficiency and a flexible, modular design that allows customers to choose between a number of customisable options such as power conversion system (PCS) size, solar connectivity and back-up for all on or off-grid scenarios.
Chelion said the modular rack system can accommodate 90 kW of bi-directional AC-DC inverter capacity, or up to 120 kW of DC-DC PV inversion, or a combination of PCS, PV, and static transfer switch for a “truly hybrid system.”
“The CAIO can also be strung in parallel, with an external power conversion system for customers requiring up to 452 kWh of storage,” the company said.

The Matrix CAIO features an intelligent energy management system, fireproofing and HVAC temperature regulation. The IP65-rated cabinet measures 1,450 mm x 2,000 mm x 1,100 mm and weighs in at 700 kg and has been designed for easy deployment on an external slab to reduce installation costs.
Chelion said the CAIO offers scalability for various applications including peak shaving and load shifting for large commercial businesses, support for microgrids and community battery applications, contingency frequency control services, and supplying backup power.
Chelion Australia Chief Executive Officer Craig Nalder said the CAIO enables businesses and communities to embrace renewable energy sources, effectively reducing their operational expenses.
“These systems enable business owners to store excess solar energy during the day for use during peak hours or during power outages, ensuring emergency power supply and reduced reliance on the grid,” he said.
Chelion said the first Australian installations of the Matrix CAIO have already commenced in New South Wales.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/24/fortescue-powers-ahead-with-battery-electric-truck-testing/,"EV,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 24, 2023",Fortescue powers ahead with battery-electric truck testing,"Fortescue is testing a 240-tonne payload battery-electric haul truck developed in collaboration with German-Swiss multinational equipment manufacturer Liebherr as part of the miner’s decarbonisation strategy, which includes replacing its existing diesel-fuelled fleet with battery electric and green hydrogen powered haul trucks before 2030.
The converted MT4400 AC truck, nicknamed Roadrunner, uses a 1.4 MWh battery that has been developed by Fortescue’s Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE) team for the Liebherr trucks. The bespoke battery weighs 15 tonnes, measures 3.6 m long, 1.6 m wide and 2.4 m high, and is made up of eight sub-packs, each with 36 modules, all individually cooled and each with its own management system.
WAE Technologies Chief Executive Craig Wilson said the battery has to ability to fast-charge in 30 minutes and capacity to regenerate power as it drives downhill.
“This high-performance power system not only boasts the highest energy storage of its kind but will also be the first to offer 30-minute fast charging,” he said.
“This system is the first of many technologies that can help enable Fortescue to realise its industry leading 2030 net-zero target. Powered solely by renewable energy, it will help prevent enormous amounts of fossil fuel from being used in the mining industry, with the goal to not compromise the vehicle’s load capacity.”

Fortescue said the Roadrunner is expected to be joined by a 3 MW charger prototype – developed by WAE and a third party – by the end of the year.
The prototype truck is part of a deal that Fortescue struck with Swiss-based Liebherr in mid-2022 to have zero emission haul units fully operational at Fortescue mine sites by 2025.
Under the deal, Fortescue agreed to purchase a fleet of 120 haul trucks, a commitment that represents approximately 45% of the current haul truck fleet at Fortescue’s operations.
Fortescue is also testing the first of its hydrogen fuel cell trucks at the Christmas Creek mine.
Speaking at the World Mining Congress in Brisbane earlier this year, Fortescue Chief Executive Officer Fiona Hick said the company plans to have its first green hydrogen fuel cell haul truck prototype working alongside the Roadrunner later this year.
“Our goal is to have the first green haul truck operational at our sites in three years, in 2026,” she said. “We believe battery electric, green hydrogen and green ammonia will all be critical to our overall decarbonisation plan, and we are taking practical steps to apply the best solution to each different situation.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/24/city-of-sydney-to-investigate-electrification-of-all-new-builds/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,RESIDENTIAL PV,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 24, 2023",City of Sydney to investigate electrification of all new builds,"City of Sydney Council earlier this week voted to examine altering planning regulations to require all new businesses and homes, including apartments, within the council area to be fully electric, reducing the city’s dependency on fossil gas.
The motion, backed by eight out of 10 councillors, calls for council to investigate the opportunities and challenges associated with inserting new clauses into development rules that would require new homes and businesses to install only electric appliances like stoves, cooktops, heaters and hot water units.
Research commissioned by anti-fossil fuel advocacy group 350 Australia shows the ban on gas connections could cut carbon emissions across the city by 1.7 million tonnes over the typical 40-year life of a dwelling. The research, conducted by Strategy Policy Research, also suggests the move could save every new household that’s built in Sydney an average of $430 (USD 275) per year on energy bills over the same period.
The move by the City of Sydney comes after NSW Premier Chris Minns last month ruled out a statewide ban on gas in new homes, saying it would further complicate the challenges the state faces in its transition to renewable energy.
If the changes do go ahead, the City of Sydney will follow the Waverley, Canterbury-Bankstown, and Parramatta councils which recently passed new planning regulations that require some new buildings across the local government areas to be all-electric.
The shift to the electrification of new properties is also going traction at state level with the Australian Capital Territory having already introduced the change. Since the beginning of the year, the ACT government has required all new builds in the territory to be exclusively connected to electricity.
Victoria has also moved to ban gas connections, last month announcing that from 1 January 2024 planning permits for new homes and residential subdivisions will only allow connections to all-electric networks.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/24/siemens-to-open-us-utility-scale-solar-inverter-factory/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INVERTERS,RESIDENTIAL PV,UTILITY SCALE PV,WORLD",RYAN KENNEDY,"AUGUST 24, 2023",Siemens to open US utility-scale solar inverter factory,"Germany-based Siemens has revealed plans to add manufacturing capacity in the United States, with a new factory that will produce 800 MW of utility-scale string inverters per year from 2024. 
The facility, which will be operated by Siemens’ manufacturing partner, Sanmina, will produce Blueplanet string inverters. Siemens acquired Kaco’s inverter business in 2019. At the time of the acquisition, Kaco was already actively producing inverters at the site in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. 
Tax credits and demand-side incentives, like the domestic content bonus in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, are attracting record levels of clean energy manufacturing to the U.S, and the Siemens announcement adds to the growing domestic supply chain. Over the past four years, the German group has invested $4.63 billion (USD 3 billion) in U.S. manufacturing and other acquisitions. 
“Working with Sanmina to establish this new production line, Siemens is well positioned to address supply challenges our country is facing as we work to localize production for green and renewable infrastructure,” said Brian Dula, vice president of electrification and automation at Siemens Smart Infrastructure USA. 
Kaco Blueplanet inverters range from 110 kW to 165 kW and offer a more modular, transportable option for utility- scale projects than large, containerised central inverters. The inverters are made with a reliable silicon carbide design, are NEMA 4X enclosed, and are compatible with fused, cable-trunking systems, eliminating the need for string-combiner boxes. 
“Single-MPPT inverters are proving to be the preferred choice when it comes to ease of layout and flexibility in design. It is clear that in today’s inverter landscape there is no one multi-MPPT inverter which can provide a satisfactory design for all high-power modules,” said Siemens in a white paper for the inverter. “The Kaco single MPPT string inverter range offers a much easier and more flexible design through the use of DC combiners which is crucial when optimising your PV module layout.”
