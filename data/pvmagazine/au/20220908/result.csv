Redflow said the energy storage solution architecture was developed through the two companies’ joint engagement with a large US-listed corporate which is interested in deploying solar and flow-battery storage technology at one of its commercial campuses.
Redflow chief commercial officer Mark Higgins believes the co-developed solution, featuring the company’s 10 kWh zinc-bromine flow battery module which can be combined to provide commercial and utility scale battery solutions, will not only serve the large US-based corporate well but also meet the needs of a variety of customer segments across North America.
“The integrated solution we’ve developed in partnership with Empower Energies represents a unique, innovative, and stress-tested alternative to the status quo solar and lithium-ion solution,” he said.
“Our integrated offering provides a safer, rugged, more sustainable and cost competitive alternative to lithium-ion batteries and solar, and our batteries don’t materially degrade over their useful life, unlike lithium-ion.
“The uniquely safe zinc bromine chemistry has no risk of thermal runaway, making our solution better to deploy in urban and suburban environments where safety is a paramount consideration. Also, our hibernation mode enables our batteries to be used for back-up power and resilience deployments in a very cost-effective manner versus lithium.”

Patrick Corr, chief strategy officer at Empower which has completed more than 200 MW of clean energy projects in the US and has more than 800 MW of solar and storage projects currently in development, said its partnership with Redflow would provide a viable alternative to lithium-ion technology for North American customers.
“We’ve found that our integrated solar and flow battery solution is of particular interest to certain C&I customers looking for energy shifting, peak shaving and other daily cycling applications for their corporate campuses, reducing energy costs and enabling on-site carbon reduction safely,” he said.
The collaboration with Empower comes after Redflow earlier this year unveiled its third-generation zinc-bromine module energy storage offering.
Redflow said the new Gen3 battery represents a major advancement over the company’s Gen2.5 battery, incorporating a new stack design, updated electronics with increased functionality, a new tank design and cooling system.

The new product implements a single 10 kWh electrode stack while the design includes a bi-directional DC-DC converter built into the battery control module, allowing flexibility of energy flow of 0-60 volts. The individual modules measure 861mm x 747mm x 400Wmm and weigh in at 240kg with electrolyte. The scalable design means it can be adapted for a wide range of applications, from small commercial installations to multi-MWh storage systems.
“The launch of our Gen3 battery is a monumental milestone in Redflow’s growth strategy,” said Higgins, who is president of the company’s North American operations. “The combination of our new Energy Pod products with the Gen3 battery provides the platform for Redflow to capitalise on the demand for large-scale, medium to long-duration energy storage systems that we’re seeing emerge around the world.
“We see huge potential for Redflow’s technology in the US and other markets like Australia.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/08/labors-climate-change-bill-is-set-to-become-law-but-3-important-measures-are-missing/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022",Labor’s climate change bill is set to become law – but 3 important measures are missing,"The law would set a national emissions target for 2030 and define a process to ratchet it up over time, as well as enshrining the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The independent Climate Change Authority will recommend future targets. These are sound and useful elements and will serve Australia’s climate policymaking well.
Yet three important elements are not in the bill: a long-term roadmap, securing the future of the Climate Change Authority, and measures for a proper national conversation on our journey to net-zero emissions. And the 43% emissions reduction target should be considered only a starting point.
Image: Supplied
The bill mandates that Australia reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Labor took that target to the federal election and has been unwilling to negotiate on it since winning office.
Is a 43% reduction in Australia’s emissions adequate in the context of the Paris Agreement?
There is no single objective yardstick for which country should do how much towards a global goal. And the trajectory of global emissions after 2030 – as well as before – matters greatly for longer-term global warming.
But an assessment is nevertheless possible, and it suggests that strengthening the target, perhaps by a lot, would be appropriate.
Emissions reductions in this broad range are what’s needed globally to limit warming to 2℃ compared to pre-industrial levels.
But high-income, high-emitting countries – Australia prominent among them – are rightfully expected to reduce their carbon footprint more quickly than developing countries, or countries where the economy is already relatively low-carbon.
What’s more, the effort needed by Australia to meet the 43% target is less than that required by many other countries. This is due to reductions in emissions from the land use and forestry sector more than a decade ago, and because we have lots of opportunities to cut emissions easily.
Big further reductions can be made by accelerating the shift from coal to renewables, better energy efficiency, electrifying transport, and cleaner processes in industry and agriculture.
An Australian reduction of the present order is definitely incompatible with limiting global warming to 1.5℃ – the global aspiration for limiting climate change. And it would be a contortion to argue it’s somehow in line with “well below 2℃”, the Paris Agreement’s long-term goal.
All that said, a 43% emission reduction target improves a lot on the previous government’s target. And enshrining it in law sends an important message. It makes zero-emissions options much more investable, and signals internationally that Australia is back on climate change action.
Image: CSIRO
Attention will soon shift to Australia’s 2035 emissions target. The bill commits the Climate Change Authority to recommend that target, and new targets every five years from then on.
If the government of the day does not accept that advice, it will need to explain its dissent to parliament. That is good process.
But Australia also needs to plot a forward trajectory beyond the next five-year period, because the investments that matter most are made on longer timescales.
Such “roadmapping” would shed light on questions such as:
The Climate Change Authority may choose to do such an analysis, mapping out scenarios and possible trajectories. But such advice would have stronger standing if there was a legal requirement for it.

The bill puts the Climate Change Authority centre stage, but it doesn’t make sure it will always be properly equipped to do its job.
A future government might not like to hear a strong independent voice, and could quieten it by starving it. It’s happened before, following the Abbott government’s attempt to abolish the authority.
The Climate Change Authority needs to run a deeply inclusive and very extensive consultation process for future recommendations on the target. Not just roundtables and submissions to a website, but a really big effort to take the analysis to groups right across Australian society and take their views into account.
Let’s hope this and future governments will give their political backing for an inclusive process, and fund the authority to do so.
In any case, Australia needs a national long-term emissions reduction strategy. It should answer questions such as:
Such a strategy must be much more than just another report based on modelling with some stakeholder discussions along the way. What’s needed is a proper national conversation about how we tackle the transition to net-zero emissions.
Image: EDMS Australia
This would bring out all available information and the many different perspectives, opportunities and vulnerabilities. It requires people coming together to really understand the issues and, where possible, to forge agreement.
That conversation should involve all major groups: businesses and business associations, non-government organisations, unions, community leaders, youth groups and so forth. The research sector would provide data and analysis, and the media would make the debate a public one, in many formats and dimensions.
Governments at all levels would be involved – but they would not control the process.
Some political instincts run against such truly open processes. But they’re essential – and the climate change bill doesn’t directly provide for them.

The solar arrays, ranging in size from 25 kW up to 100 kW, will improve the energy efficiency of the pump stations with any surplus power to be fed back into the grid.
Each array will be connected into the existing TasNetworks electricity grid and Tasmanian Irrigation chief executive officer Andrew Kneebone said any revenue generated from that surplus power will be passed on to irrigators by way of reduced water costs.
“Farmers may on average save up to $5 per megalitre as we utilise the sun’s rays to power up to 13 of our irrigation pump stations,” he said.
“This is great news for Tasmanian farmers and another example of Tasmanian Irrigation’s commitment to delivering high-surety irrigation water as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.”
Kneebone said construction on the first of the solar arrays is due to commence in December, with the project expected to be completed by December 2023.
The government-backed project is a boost for PV in Tasmania which trails all other states and territories in the solar stakes. Tasmania has achieved its 100% renewable energy but that is thanks primarily to the island’s wind and hydro-electricity projects with solar still in its infancy in the state.
Figures provided by the government reveal that about 44,000 homes and businesses in Tasmania have solar systems, which is about 18% of the state’s households – well short of the more than 30% national penetration rate. The island state is also yet to welcome its first operational utility-scale solar farms but there has been a flurry of activity in the space in recent months.
Brisbane-based Line Hydrogen recently announced plans to establish a green hydrogen production facility at Bell Bay in Tasmania’s north, saying it plans to source the electricity for its plant from Climate Capital’s planned 5 MW solar farm in nearby George Town.
While both the solar farm and the hydrogen plant are still in the planning stages, Line Hydrogen says it expects to break ground on the project by mid-year and is targeting first production on January 31, 2023.
Another aspiring green hydrogen manufacturer, Countrywide Hydrogen, earlier this month said it has teamed with large-scale solar PV and battery energy storage specialist Wirsol Energy to explore solar-to-hydrogen co-development opportunities in the island state.

The rooftops belong to not-for-profit community housing developer BlueCHP and house low income families and Australians with disabilities.
A long time in the making, the solar systems are set to be energised by mid-October, offering tenants access to affordable green electricity as prices, and the cost of living generally, continues to surge.
The houses are part of the Community Solar Program pilot from partners BlueCHP and Solar Energy Enterprises. Their hope is once the pilot is complete, they’ll have a proven model they can use to deliver solar to low income households at scale.
Image: Solar Energy Enterprises
The core concept is investment funds will pay for the initial solar system installation and then recover those costs over time through a solar power purchasing agreement or PPA with the households.
The PPAs will be designed to offer tenants significantly cheaper electricity than they could buy from the grid, while still leaving enough of a profit margin to recover the initial investment.
“It’s the PPA element which makes this work at scale,” Solar Energy Enterprises’ CEO Adam Dragic tells pv magazine Australia.
Essentially, it is a very similar model to that already successfully deployed in solar’s C&I sector – which, like community and disability housing, caters primarily to customers on leases. The main difference is this endeavour will involve smaller deals across a far greater number of customers.
The pilot models over a period of eight years the investor will get a return of between 5% to 6% on the initial investment – enough, the partners hope, to attract capital for a much broader rollout of the scheme.
Image: Solar Energy Enterprises
With over 800 houses in BlueCHP’s portfolio, there is clear scope to scale, though BlueCHP CEO Charles Northcote has a bigger vision. “If you took the whole social housing market, there are likely over 400,000 properties so it provides a steppingstone for people to look at examples of ways we can do this as a pathway forward.”
“Other community housing companies have seen what we’re doing and are doing that now, so that’s starting,” Northcote adds.
“The longer term model of what we’re trying to do is use all the technology that will come from smart stuff on the grid.” The CEO wants to eventually integrate virtual energy sharing into the program, which is why he chose the portfolio of clustered of housing at Jordan Springs as the program’s starting location.
“There’s going to be more battery power, there’s going to be a whole raft. This is just the first major step on a pathway to go forward,” he says.
Discussions about the $1 million pilot began back in 2019, but its execution was delayed by a raft of things from Covid to floods, and cost significantly more than first expected. “But it gives us a good idea of what disruption can do, and what can happen and how we’re going to have to manage that,” Northcote says.
Image: Solar Energy Enterprises
While the concept rests on third party investors, Dragic says initial discussions with four fund providers were unable to deliver on the pilot’s budgeted plans. So to make project happen, “BlueCHP just said, ‘right, we’ll put the money in and invest on the project,’” Northcote adds.
In other words, BlueCHP has funded the pilot – though its planning future installations will get off the ground by other means.
The solar systems installed on the rooftops vary in size, with 2 kW and 6.6 kW systems on the 90 community houses. For the 64 disability homes, which generally house around five people as well as care staff on shifts, the systems range from 6.6 kW, 10 kW and 13 kW.
In terms of the PPAs, the current rate for the households is 15c/kWh. Solar Energy Enterprises is currently in the final stages of installing monitoring systems to accurately calculate the amount of solar each household uses for billing and to provide oversight on solar self consumption.The households will then receive two bills for their electricity – one from their chosen grid provider, and another in the form of a PPA for their solar usage.

So far, the disability homes have proven easier to coordinate in terms of finalising the PPAs since the 66 houses are managed by just six Supported Independent Living (SIL) providers. The houses are also staffed around the clock through the government’s National Disability Insurance Scheme, better known as the NDIS, meaning staff take care of the bills.
All of the disability homes have been onboarded to the pilot, but finalising the program for the individual community houses is proving more laborious. The two bill system here is probably less than ideal here, with Solar Energy Enterprises literally door knocking to explain the system.
“No one has attempted this, so the hurdles we have had to overcome are worthwhile to solve this for the long run” Dragic says.

For partner Northcote, who has a background in manufacturing, this process is just par for the course in figuring out the program. “We’ve got to learn,” he says.
“One of the things that gets forgotten is the education program and that’s probably the thing we will continually have to keep working with people on until the generations are used to it.”
While integrating energy management technology is still a while off for the program, he says such tools could help households best use and understand their rooftop energy.
As part of the pilot, two homes have also been fitted with Alpha ESS batteries, and the partners are hoping to install another 10 batteries. The aim here is to test what impacts added storage has for the households and the value difference of the comprehensive system.

Again, virtual power sharing in the program is still a ways off – but it is something Dragic is particularly excited about.
Virtual energy sharing is basically where solar energy generated on rooftops can be passed between interlinked houses based on their moment to moment demands. In other words, it allows neighbours to share their solar and boost the amount of energy they can access. So, for instance, one house, running their washing machine and oven at 12pm could have their full load covered by their neighbour who, putting on their oven at 3pm, could enjoy the same.
While this type of technology holds much potential, finding ways to use the electricity network’s infrastructure without paying grid charges remains a hurdle today.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/08/signals-are-green-for-new-investment-in-australias-transition-to-renewables-and-storage/,"OPINION & ANALYSIS,AUSTRALIA",,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022",Signals are green for new investment in Australia’s transition to renewables and storage,"With so much happening, there is no shortage of commentary and unprecedented attention on power markets. And, for those with patience and tenacity, there will also be plenty of commercial opportunities.
The spotlight was firmly on the energy sector in the lead-up to Australia’s May federal election, with Labor’s policies including Powering Australia and $20 billion Rewiring the Nation; a national electric vehicle strategy; amendments to the safeguard mechanism to incentivise greater emissions reductions; commitments to community battery storage systems and solar banks; and enthusiasm for green hydrogen and green metals.
With Labor elected alongside a record number of Greens and nine ‘teal’ independents, the events of May reflected a mandate from the Australian public for greater ambition and expenditure on renewable energy and climate policy as Australia moves towards net zero.
In June, there was a profound disruption in the National Electricity Market (NEM) due to the Russo-Ukrainian War, coal plant outages and flood-related impacts on coal logistics. Additionally, cold weather and soaring gas prices led power prices to spike to three to five times higher than they stood in Q1 of 2022.
On 15 June, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) took the unprecedented step of suspending electricity wholesale trading and activating the $300/MWh administered price cap (APC) (which exists to protect consumers from surging electricity costs), throwing the urgent need for more transmission, storage and renewables into sharp relief.
Whilst under the APC, some participants withdrew their supply sparking claims of anti-competitive behaviour. In response to these, in late June the ACCC led an inquiry into electricity market trading, investigating whether participants were participating in market misconduct and manipulating the spot market.
Image: ACCC
Discordance in the energy market continued into July, with a rule change request submitted to the market rule-maker the Australian Energy Markets Commission (AEMC), seeking to double the NEM’s APC to $600/MWh to better reflect thermal fleet input costs. The request followed claims by coal and gas generators that the current APC (set in the 1990s) inadequately reflects their input costs and should be increased to prevent the supply withdrawal events in June from reoccurring. Having determined the rule change to be urgent, the AEMC is currently expected to release a final determination on the APC rule change request by the end of September. While the June ‘coal (not gas) crisis’ is over, demonstrable pressure will remain in the Australian power market while the war in Ukraine continues and the ageing coal and gas fleet continues to be marred by operational issues.
In early August, the passing of the Climate Change Bill through the Federal House of Representatives marked a momentous step toward enshrining in law national commitments to net zero by 2050 and 43% emissions reduction by 2030. The bill is currently expected to pass the Senate this week, having garnered the support of the Greens and several independents who amended the bill to explicitly state the 43% reduction is a floor (rather than a ceiling).
In mid-August, we saw federal and state energy ministers meet at the Energy Ministers Meeting (EMM) and agree on re-incorporating environmental and emissions reduction considerations into the National Electricity Objective (NEO). Once enacted, this landmark change will see electricity regulatory decisions, investments and rule-making decisions appraise climate impacts when the AEMC considers electricity rule changes and power infrastructure investments – removing the sometimes perverse outcomes under the current NEO and enabling further decarbonisation momentum for power markets.
A week later, the federal government released an industry consultation paper for their proposed reforms to the ‘safeguard mechanism’ (SM).
The Abbott government introduced the SM in 2016, requiring Australia’s 215 largest greenhouse gas emitters (who accounted for 28% of Australia’s total emissions in 2020-21), to keep their net emissions below an emissions limit or ‘baseline’ (with many concessions). The paper is the first step in another momentous reform process. It reflects the federal government’s commitment to strengthen the SM and ensure Australia meets its 2030 43% emissions reduction target and net zero commitments.
The consultation paper outlines a suite of proposed reforms to change how emissions baselines are set (including by removing the ‘headroom’ in the current SM design) and how baselines ratchet down over time. Indicative emission reduction rates for big emitters are expected to be between 3.5 and 6% per year to 2030. The consultation paper also considers introducing tradable credits for facilities that emit below their baseline and providing support to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed businesses (such as steelmakers and alumina refiners), including financial assistance and differentiated baseline ratchets.
The economy-wide consultation works to a tight deadline: submissions are due by the end of September, with a more detailed design released for feedback in December. The current aim is for the reforms to be legislated by March 2023 and come into effect from 1 July. This timeline exemplifies a real urgency by the federal government to transform the SM into an effective and credible emissions reduction tool, balanced to support big emitters to transition and decarbonise in an orderly yet demonstrative and prompt way. Of course, there are and will be a plethora of stakeholders in this consultation process, and many opinions and good ideas will be articulated before the final design is legislated … watch this space.
There’s little doubt of an increased national appetite for a rapid transmission, storage and renewables roll-out and a cleaner, greener energy future. But there’s still a massive task ahead. To achieve the widely accepted ‘step change’ scenario outlined in the AEMO’s most recent Integrated System Plan (ISP), the pace of new renewables, storage, and transmission developments will need to dial up to maximum – as will the level of investment.
Image: AEMO
There’s plenty of cause for energy infrastructure investors and developers to be optimistic in this opportunity-rich time and place. But can we be confident that energy markets are changing in the right way and at the right pace and scale? Given the interrelatedness of all energy system components, it’s easy to solve one problem and find another has been created.
In our view, change is never simple, but it must happen. The success of the energy transition will rest on three critical components:
And, all three builds need to happen quickly. To move at pace, the sector will need to:
All of these factors are needed for successful projects in the renewable energy revolution.
As the new energy picture takes shape, it will also remain important to keep a watching-brief on the implementation of new energy policies and the progress of long-awaited energy market reforms.
In New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland (and soon Tasmania), there is solid progress advancing Renewable Energy Zones (REZ), the transmission ‘highways’ connecting areas of good solar, wind and pumped hydro resources to the NEM. Tenders are underway to build the transmission infrastructure, and auctions will soon commence for generator access rights to connect and dispatch.
Another policy subject of particular interest and divided opinion is the need for a so-called ‘capacity mechanism’4 being assessed by the Energy Security Board (ESB). Currently proposed to be operational by July 2025, state and federal energy ministers also discussed the capacity mechanism at their mid-August EMM. Energy ministers have agreed to take ‘more active control’ of the NEM 2025 redesign process from the ESB, focusing more on coal closures and new technologies – however, what this means going forward is yet to be determined.
Wildly unpopular with many in the power market, a capacity mechanism creates a new revenue stream for ‘firm’ (non-intermittent) generators (coal, gas, hydro and batteries). These entities would be rewarded for having generation capacity/plant available (but not necessarily operating) during certain periods, theoretically ensuring that supply will be adequate to meet demand. Although similar mechanisms exist in other international markets that are transitioning to renewables, there is disagreement over how successful such a mechanism will be at improving supply security (refer to what happened in June with coal plant unreliability) while potentially extending the lives of thermal plants.
If a capacity mechanism does prevail, the devil will be in the detail of the design. To achieve net zero goals, while there is a circa 10-year transitional role for more flexible gas plant to play, it will be critical to ensure the lives of thermal generators are not prolonged unnecessarily and the exit of coal (and later gas) is orderly.
Arguably, the mechanism should only be applied to new-build firm plants and will only be successful for net-zero goals if it includes an emissions element, such that generators only receive a ratcheted capacity payment if they are below a certain emissions level.
Given the design difficulties of the capacity mechanism, consideration is also due to alternative options and technologies for providing firming capacity and improving energy security. Perhaps the most promising of these alternatives is what some are calling a Renewable Energy Storage Target (REST) – a target much like the Renewable Energy Target but designed to incentivise storage (and in particular deep/long duration storage) rather than generation.
If we are to reach Australia’s renewable targets, and ensure the energy grid is capable of handling the growth anticipated by the ISP, storage capacity will need to grow by 59 GW (20 times the current capacity) by 2050. Although we know storage is a challenge, it is currently the least advanced part of the renewables value chain.
Deep storage chemical batteries (of long-duration (12+ hours) are likely to be the quickest to deploy and easiest to site, but they are currently uneconomic and underdeveloped at this long-duration.
A REST could provide a form of subsidy to storage facilities, helping to overcome some cost-curve issues and incentivising the development of larger and deeper storage systems. The introduction of a REST would provide a subsidy and broader market for storage technologies, incentivise research and development into new storage innovations, and provide certainty around storage demand, supply and development. Contemporaneously, the value chains of the critical minerals which comprise chemical batteries also need to develop and accelerate.
Reshaping the energy market to deal with the deeply complex challenges of the rapid shift to renewables will take time, patience and collaboration across all parts of the sector. We eagerly await the outcomes of these and other energy market reforms, which will give investors greater clarity and confidence to make the most of the opportunities to help build a clean, affordable and reliable energy future for a more sustainable Australia.

The 34 MW Middlemount Solar Farm owned by Swiss investment firm SUSI Partners was second in the ratings with the central Queensland project returning a capacity factor of 26% in August. Genex Power’s 50 MW Kidston Solar Farm in the state’s north was third with a 25.1% capacity factor, just pipping Palisade Investment Partners’ 116 MW Ross River Solar Farm in northern Queensland.
Rystad analyst David Dixon said Queensland solar farms took up 11 of the top 15 places for the month with Bright Energy Investments’ 10 MW Greenough River 1 solar farm in Western Australia – which was the first utility scale PV project installed in Australia when completed in 2012 – ranked fifth to interrupt the sunshine state’s dominance.

Dixon said utility scale solar PV generation was up 20% year on year to 828 GWh, compared to 690 GWh in August 2021.
Australian utility PV and wind assets generated a combined 3,880 GWh in the month of August, up 22% from 3,193 GWh the same time last year.
Dixon said it was the highest month for wind generation on record, with wind assets across Australia generating 3,052 GWh of clean energy. The best performing utility wind assets for the month were ENGIE’s Willogoleche wind farm (51.3% CF) in South Australia, followed by Palisade Investment Partners/First State Super’s Snowtown Stage 2 South wind farm (51.2% CF) also in South Australia.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/09/08/how-to-get-to-100-emissions-free-electricity/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,HIGHLIGHTS,RESEARCH,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,UNITED STATES",JOHN FITZGERALD WEAVER,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2022",How to get to 100% emissions-free electricity,"From pv magazine USA
There are many paths to reach 100% emissions-free electricity. The US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has released “Examining Supply-Side Options to Achieve 100% Clean Electricity by 2035,” which looks at multiple scenarios.
NREL concludes that a 90% clean grid will have a low incremental cost, and that it can be built primarily with new wind, solar, storage, and transmission. However, the last 10% will present financial challenges, requiring research and new technologies.
The lab points to four “critical hurdles” to reach 100%:
Across all of their main scenarios, the lowest cost electricity mix is dominated by wind and solar, which provide most of the generation (60% to 80%). By the end of this decade, solar will require additions of 40 GWac to 90 GWac per year, and wind will require additions of 70 GW to 150 GW per year. By 2035, the United States will need to have added 2 TW of wind and solar combined.
Other accomplishments that must also happen by 2035 include the deployment of 5 GW to 8 GW of new hydropower, 3 GW to 5 GW of geothermal, and 120 GW to 350 GW of diurnal storage. Hitting these targets will require US$330 billion to US$740 billion in overall capital.
Another complex issue is that the models require between 1,400 and 10,100 miles of new high-capacity lines each year. NREL says this will triple the deployment volume rate being installed today.
Solar in the United States will need to massively increase deployment, with installation rates two to eight times that of the 15 GW of capacity that was added in 2020. These future annual installation volumes will be 25% to 110% of the entire capacity installed throughout the world in 2020.

Researchers from France-based Air Liquide working at the company’s Innovation Campus Tokyo analysed all materials that could be used for solid-state hydrogen (H2) storage – including adsorbents, metal hydrides, and chemicals – and considered all potential applications, according to market needs.
In “Nanomaterials for on-board solid-state hydrogen storage applications” – recently published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy – the scientists compared the advantages and challenges of physical-based and materials-based hydrogen storage techniques. They looked at compressed H2, liquid H2 or cold/cryo-compressed H2; metal hydrides, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and chemical H2.
They concluded that physical-based hydrogen storage systems have already reached commercial maturity. Such methods have been used in onboard vehicular applications, but the scientists also acknowledged the challenge posed by are still unable to overcome the current constraints in hydrogen supply chains.
They noted, for example, that carbon composite fibre tanks are still too expensive. They also acknowledged that liquid hydrogen storage is still too costly, even though it enables a higher volumetric density.
“Liquid hydrogen also suffers from unavoidable evaporation, known as boil-off, due to the low enthalpy of evaporation of hydrogen and the difficulties in efficiently managing heat ingress throughout the supply chain,” they explained. “In addition, during the hydrogen liquefaction process, the reaction of converting orthohydrogen to parahydrogen releases heat of around 527 kJ/kg.”
The scientists said that only a few materials-based techniques seem close to a breakthrough.
“Among adsorbent-based hydrogen storage materials, catalysed graphene-based materials and manganese hydride-based Kubas-type materials seem to be promising. These materials are able to absorb and desorb hydrogen at ambient temperature,” they said, noting that their gravimetric and volumetric density is still not competitive with current physical-based hydrogen storage systems.
The scientists also noted the strong potential of metal hydrides.
“Among metal hydride-based hydrogen storage materials, magnesium and magnesium-based hydrides have been considered as feasible materials to store hydrogen and have attracted huge attention during recent years,” they said. “This is mainly due to the great abundance of magnesium (Mg) in the Earth’s crust as well as the high hydrogen gravimetric and volumetric density of magnesium hydride (MgH2).”
The study provides a quick analysis of the technology-readiness level (TRL) of hydrogen storage for onboard applications. The TRL measures the maturity of technology components for a system and is based on a scale from one to nine, with nine representing mature, commercialised technologies.
