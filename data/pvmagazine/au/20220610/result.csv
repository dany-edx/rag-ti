The energy storage system, the first community battery on the Powercor network, is designed to “soak up” excess rooftop solar generation during peak generation times in and around the middle of the day, and then supply up to 170 nearby homes during the evening peak, providing more than two-and-a-half hours battery storage. The battery will be installed next to an existing electrical substation located in the suburb.
Powercor said work on the installation is scheduled to begin in the coming months with the battery expected to be operating by the end of 2022.
Powercor’s head of non-network solutions, Greg Hannan, said the battery will provide benefits for local customers by not only providing the community with access to local renewable energy, but also helping to manage potential problems of grid instability that can be exacerbated by changing voltage levels affected by rooftop solar exports.
“The battery will soak up excess solar being generated by households during the day and deliver it back to all customers when electricity demand is high,” he said. “It will provide benefits to up to 170 homes connected to this part of the network, whether they have solar or not.
“In this way, the battery also helps improve reliability in the area, reduce carbon emissions and paves the way for more households to connect and share locally generated solar with their neighbours in the future.”

Hannan said rooftop solar is booming in Tarneit and the surrounding suburbs with the 3029 postcode (Tarneit, Hoppers Crossing and Truganina), having the highest number of solar connections in the Powercor network with more than 16,532 small-scale systems installed in the area.
“The Tarneit and surrounding community is leading Victoria’s renewable energy boom with more than 40% of local homes connecting solar panels to our network,” he said.
It’s expected the new battery, which has secured $800,00 in funding under the Victorian Government’s Neighbourhood Battery Initiative, will enable an additional 129,600kWh of solar exports per annum in the area – enough for an additional 30 solar customers to export their excess energy back into the network.
Hannan said projects like the Tarneit community battery are helping to shape the future of the electricity network.
“By enabling access to more renewables in communities, our network is a crucial gateway to a clean energy future to support our customers and the environment,” he said.
Powercor’s announcement comes just days after the Yarra Energy Foundation switched on a 110kW/284kWh community battery in the inner Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North.
The Yarra Community Battery will soak up excess rooftop solar generated locally before sharing the renewable energy with a subnetwork of nearly 200 properties.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/10/nsw-announces-1-2-billion-investment-in-renewable-energy/,"FINANCE,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,TECHNOLOGY,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 10, 2022",NSW announces $1.2 billion investment in renewable energy,"New South Wales (NSW) Treasurer Matt Kean said on Friday the record $1.2 billion renewable energy infrastructure investment would form part of the government’s Transmission Acceleration Facility and underwrite the delivery of transmission projects seen as critical to the development of the state’s planned Renewable Energy Zones (REZs).
Kean said the funding, to be included in the budget to be handed down later this month, will be spent on a financing the construction of transmission infrastructure seen as critical for the development of a series of five REZs across NSW. The state government wants to see at least 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage projects developed before 2030 to fill the gap created by the impending withdrawal of coal generation with asset owners increasingly bringing forward retirement dates with the influx of wind and solar power making the plants uneconomic to run.
In February, Origin announced their application for Australia’s largest coal-burning power station, the 2,880MW Eraring power station at Lake Macquarie in the Hunter region, to retire in August 2025, seven years earlier than previously scheduled. AGL will shut the 1,680MW Liddell plant in April 2023 and has also brought forward the expected retirement date for the 2,640MW Bayswater coal-fired power plant, also in the Hunter, to “no later than” 2033.

Kean has previously conceded the early closures will cause problems for the grid if the capacity is not replaced but said there are currently more than 50 large-scale renewable energy projects progressing through the NSW planning system, which would deliver 16GW of renewable power into the grid.
However, many of these may never proceed without additional capacity across the state’s transmission network due to a lack of incentives and revenue certainty under the existing regulatory structure.
Kean said the Transmission Acceleration Facility will provide that revenue certainty for project developers and the government estimates it will drive at least $14 billion in private transmission infrastructure investment.
“The facility is a critical step to unlocking the new generation needed to improve competition, lower power prices and secure a brighter future for households and businesses,” he said.

The state’s first REZs are to be delivered in the Central West Orana and New England regions by the end of the decade. REZs will also be developed in the South-West, Hunter-Central Coast, and Illawarra regions.
“Renewable energy zones are modern-day power stations, providing cheap and clean power for the homes and business of NSW,” Kean said.
“This is the state’s largest ever investment in infrastructure for renewable energy and is expected to help create 2,700 direct construction jobs across the state.”
The Clean Energy Council said NSW government’s funding announcement is a significant acknowledgement of the importance of transmission in Australia’s clean energy future.

The council’s director of external affairs, Arron Wood, said industry has consistently identified transmission investment as one of the key barriers to accelerating the deployment of renewable energy in Australia.
“Getting transmission right is crucial in providing developers with the certainty they need to begin making the considerable investments in renewable energy and storage required to decarbonise our electricity system,” he said.
“Government backing of transmission will give renewable energy developers the confidence they need to get on with the job of building Australia’s clean energy future.”
Among the first projects to be financed by the Transmission Acceleration Facility will be the Waratah Super Battery, which the government said will be the largest standby network battery in the southern hemisphere.
The government said the 700MW/1400MWh battery, to be located on the Central Coast, will be operational by 2025 to release grid capacity to ensure Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong consumers can access more energy from existing electricity generation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/10/solar-highway-noise-barriers-to-be-deployed-across-north-america/,"MANUFACTURING,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,CANADA,NORTH AMERICA,UNITED STATES",RYAN KENNEDY,"JUNE 10, 2022",Solar highway noise barriers to be deployed across North America,"Mitrex, a buildings-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) provider based in Toronto, announced it is teaming up with noise barrier industry leaders Durisol and Silentium Group to create photovoltaic highway noise barriers.
The made-in-Canada barriers are designed to improve highway aesthetics, while offering a noise reduction coefficient of up to 0.7 and emissions-free electricity production. Both transparent and opaque options are available. Three design types include a retrofit option, a vertical unitized system, and an angled design for increased production and aesthetics.
The integrated PV has a capacity of up to 22W per square foot on a single face, and up to 37W per square foot in bifacial applications. On average, each kilometre would become a power plant generating over 1.2MW of electricity.
Rather than using conventional absorptive sound barriers dissipate the sound with low density porous materials such as concrete and foam, the PV noise barrier panels are designed with a proprietary acoustic interlayer that minimizes sound transfer.
Mitrex said the product has a low carbon backpack, and a negative carbon embodiment of –1000kg of C02 per square meter.
The three companies have partnered with the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario to establish product approval guidelines and create a pathway to retrofit the BIPV technology into existing highway noise barriers. As the guidelines are developed for the new technology, Durisol and Silentium Group have selected several existing highway barriers built for government entities to run pilot programs. The pilots will capture data and analyze the PV noise barriers performance.
“Partnerships like these allow us to decentralize energy and change the way we power our cities,” Mitrex cheif executive Danial Hadizadeh said. “We won’t stop here, we will continue to push the envelope to produce the next generation of solar-integrated products. Cooperating with companies in other fields is where we can truly make a difference, and it’s essential to developing better, more efficient products and allows us to bring this technology to North America and beyond.”
Mitrex has a wide set of BIPV products including building facades, roofs, railings, windows, and more. The company said it has a mission for every surface touched by the sun to become a renewable energy producer.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/06/10/prime-infra-plans-massive-3-5gw-solar-farm-for-philippines/,"ENERGY STORAGE,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,PHILIPPINES",DAVID CARROLL,"JUNE 10, 2022",Prime Infra plans massive 3.5GW solar farm for Philippines,"Investment firm Prime Infrastructure Holdings (Prime Infra), led by Filipino billionaire Enrique Razon, has announced it will build a 2.5-3.5GW solar farm tied to 4-4.5GWh of battery energy storage to help power the Philippines as the island nation steps ups it transition to renewable energy.
The project will be undertaken by Terra Solar, a joint venture between Razon’s Prime Infra and PV module manufacturer and project developer Solar Philippines.
The Manila-based Solar Philippines is the nation’s largest solar company with an estimated 400MW of operation projects and multi-megawatt pipeline projects under construction, including a 500MW solar farm being built in the province of Nueva Ecija, about 100 kilometres north of Manila. It also partnered with Prime Infra to develop a 150MW solar farm in Tarlac, about 70km west of Nueva Ecija.
No details about the cost or location of the new solar farm were provided, with Solar Philippines saying only that it would look to identify potential sites for the project on the island of Luzon.
Prime Infra chief executive officer Guillaume Lucci described the project as “a model of dependable renewable energy”, saying it would be transformational for the nation’s renewable energy landscape.
“We are delighted to move forward on this record-breaking project that highlights solar power’s important contribution to strengthening the country’s energy security,” he said.

Lucci said Prime Infra was looking to take advantage of a steep decline in solar installation costs over the past decade and improved battery energy storage system technology.
“It allows the company to build an economically critical and socially relevant infrastructure at a scale the world has never seen before,” he said.
Lucci said the project is backed by a long-term power purchase agreement with Manila Electric Company (Meralco). The Philippines’ biggest power retailer has inked a 20-year offtake agreement for 850MW of renewable energy per annum. The agreement stipulates 600MW will be available by 2026, with the additional 250MW to be delivered in 2027.
Figures released by Terra Solar said the 850MW supply will displace an annual consumption of approximately 1.4 million tons of coal or 930,000 litres of oil, reducing both carbon emissions and import dependency for the country from 2026 to 2046.
The Philippines gets about 57% of its electricity from coal but the nation has made a big push for renewable energy projects in recent years as it seeks to lessen its dependence on fossil fuels, in line with its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The government aims to increase the share of renewables in the power mix to 35% by 2030, from 21% in 2020, and to 50% by 2040. Renewables currently account for 29.1% of installed capacity.
Meralco, which distributes electricity in metropolitan Manila and nearby provinces, is aiming to have 1.5MW of renewable energy capacity by 2027.
Meralco is “embarking on a just, orderly and affordable transition to clean and earth-friendly energy,” chairman Manuel Pangilinan said in a statement.
