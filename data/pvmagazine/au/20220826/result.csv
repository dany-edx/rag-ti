Tasmania has already achieved 100% renewable energy generation thanks to the state’s wind and hydro-electricity projects, but has legislated targets of 150% by 2030 and 200% by 2040, with plans to export excess renewables to the Australian mainland.
Tasmania Premier and Minister for Energy and Renewables Guy Barnett said the proposed pipeline of renewable energy projects identified in the ROI process would deliver more than enough new generation capacity to get it there.
“This would be more than enough new generation to support achievement of our Tasmanian Renewable Energy Target,” he said. “Our 100% renewable energy status has driven interest in Tasmania from investors, keen to contribute to helping the environment. Tasmania can be the nation’s cleanest, smartest and most innovative state.”
The ROI, staged as part of the Renewable Energy Coordination Framework released by the government last year, sought to sound out the market for new renewable energy generation and storage projects of 10 MW or more, as well as for existing and new businesses seeking renewable electrical loads of 1 MW or more.
Barnett said the information from the ROI will be used to inform the build out of Tasmania’s first renewable energy zone (REZ) and “support the matching of new generation and load growth to achieve our renewable energy future”.
The information provided by industry will guide decisions about the optimal location and size of the state’s first REZ with details to be announced later this year.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has, as part of its Integrated System Plan, identified four regions for renewable energy zones including the North West REZ which encompasses the landing point for the proposed 1,500 MW Marinus Link which is set be the second energy interconnector between Tasmania and the Australian mainland.
The state government said the proposed North West REZ is also the location of Hydro Tasmania’s preferred Lake Cethana pumped hydro site and several existing and announced wind farms and a proposed solar farm project.
Other potential locations for renewable energy zones include in the state’s northeast, central highlands and an offshore zone off the northwest coast.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/26/uts-seeks-to-unlock-urban-roof-space-for-solar-farms/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,COMMUNITY,INSTALLATIONS,MARKETS & POLICY,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 26, 2022",UTS seeks to unlock urban roof space for solar farms,"The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) has negotiated a deal with commercial property giant Dexus to install a 1 MW rooftop solar system across the Lakes Business Park in the southern Sydney suburb of Botany where it leases space for its Tech Lab research facility.
UTS green infrastructure project manager Jonathan Prendergast said the university will install and own the 1 MW rooftop solar system after negotiating a 23-year rooftop licence with business park manager Dexus. The system will deliver clean electricity to the UTS Tech Lab with excess energy exported to the grid to meet local demand.
“Although UTS is a tenant in Botany, we’ve reached a long-term agreement with Dexus to cover all available roof space in the Dexus development with solar panels,” he said.
The system, which is nearing completion, will comprise 2,500 solar panels and once operational will generate about 1,400 MWh of renewable energy a year, enough to power the equivalent of 255 homes.
Prendergast said the rooftop project demonstrates an innovative way to develop and finance solar power at a time when the state urgently needs more energy generation capacity.
“All those times you’ve flown in or out of Sydney Airport, over the top of all those sprawling warehouse roofs, they are solar farms just waiting to happen,” he said. “Solar is now cost effective enough that it can be installed on Sydney rooftops as power stations, not just for reducing demand of the host.”
Australia is a world leader in the uptake of residential rooftop solar but Prendergast said it’s not possible in every situation and the Botany project shows how to maximise the potential of urban and industrial roof space.
“Our CBDs, for example, are full of high-rise buildings and limited roof space, with high energy demand. Often tenants find getting solar on their rooftops limited due to complex negotiations with the landlord or short-term leasing,” he said.
Dexus’ sustainability general manager Rob Sims said the property group was excited to support UTS in “transforming our Lord Street roof space into an urban power station”.
Sims said collaborating with customers on renewable energy is one of the ways the group, which manages an Australian property portfolio valued at $32.1 billion, is pursuing to unlock the potential of its roof space as it progresses the rollout of solar PV systems across its assets.
The Botany project is the latest renewable energy project for UTS which has been developing rooftop and offsite solar systems for nearly 10 years to help meet its goals of being a renewable-powered university.
The university has installed rooftop solar systems on buildings at its main campus in the inner-city suburb of Ultimo, and signed a power purchase agreements with the Singleton Solar Farm in the state’s Hunter Valley and the Orange Solar Farm in the Central Tablelands region.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/08/26/report-reveals-massive-renewable-energy-expansion-needed-to-hit-net-zero-target/,"MARKETS,RESEARCH,SUSTAINABILITY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 26, 2022",Report reveals massive renewable energy expansion needed to hit net zero target,"A multi-year study conducted by the Net Zero Australia (NZA) project has found the approval, financing and construction of renewable energy infrastructure will need to be rolled out at unprecedented speed and scale if the country is to deliver on the vision of a net-zero carbon economy.
With the federal government targeting 82% renewables across the energy grid and a 43% cut in emissions by 2030, the NZA project has outlined the scope, complexity and cost of the challenge that Australia faces as it seeks to achieve its climate and renewable energy targets.
A partnership led by representatives from the University of Melbourne, The University of Queensland, Princeton University in the United States and management consultancy Nous Group, the NZA project has analysed the pathways by which Australia can achieve net zero in both domestic and export emissions.
Simon Smart, project director from the University of Queensland, said the necessary transition would be both an immense challenge but also a once-in-a-generation nation building opportunity.
“This interim modelling shows that the scale and pace of what we need to build is unprecedented,” he said. “If we keep building the way we have done, it is likely we will go too slowly towards a net zero future – we need to think differently about the required infrastructure and technology.”
Interim findings from the multi-year study published on Thursday indicate large-scale and rooftop solar PV and wind will produce most or all domestic energy by 2050 and green hydrogen from solar is projected to be the largest clean energy export. The findings also reveal the required rate at which renewable energy capacity is to be added will be much higher than historical levels.

Richard Bolt, principal at Nous Group, said as fast and large as the transition will need to be, “it is practically achievable”.
“All our scenarios suggest that renewables will be the dominant energy source. An immense amount of new infrastructure will be needed, and must be built at a breath-taking speed,” he wrote in the Australian Financial Review. “Our use of land and sea will undergo extensive change. We will also have to convert to increasingly electric and efficient vehicles, appliances and industries at an unprecedented speed and scale.”
The modelling analysed six possible net-zero scenarios and consequences of reducing emissions by using renewables, carbon capture utilisation and storage, and replacing technologies that use fossil fuels with ones that use electricity, such as electric vehicles. Most place no limit on the rate at which renewables can be built but only one scenario (E+RE+) allows only renewables by 2050. The other scenarios anticipate natural gas and oil products will play a role with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) together with renewable energy technologies.

All of the scenarios predict progressive adoption of renewables. The E+ scenario, which models nearly full electrification of transport and buildings by 2050, no limit on renewables rollout, and a lower cap on CCUS, anticipates that by 2030 Australia will require about three times the total generation capacity of today’s national electricity market (NEM). The modelling suggests that by the end of the decade there will be 98 GW of solar PV capacity spread across 135 projects, along with 49 GW of onshore wind (79 projects) and 500 MW of offshore wind (1 project).
By 2040, this will increase to 654 GW of solar PV (782 projects), 130 GW of onshore wind (187 projects) and 41 GW of offshore wind (35 projects). In 2050, solar PV capacity will reach 1.9 TW across 2,242 projects. Onshore wind will total 132 GW (194 projects) while offshore wind will increase to 42 GW (36 projects). Electricity generation is about 40 times the current capacity of the NEM.
The total annual domestic energy system cost is expected to increase from just under $90 billion a year today to an estimated $150 billion a year by the late 2030s and stay at that level through the 2050s.

The modelling indicates between 1 to 1.3 million new workers will be needed to facilitate the roll out of renewables, with much of the activity to take place in Australia’s traditional resources regions.
“Our findings show there’s no two ways about it, to meet net zero by 2050, Australia must transform,” NZA steering committee chair and former Australian chief scientist Robin Batterham said. “Major and long-term investment is required in new renewable generation, electricity transmission, hydrogen supply chains, and more.”
Batterham also said there is major scope to build a new clean export industry as coal and gas exports decline with green hydrogen from solar projected to be the largest clean energy export. The report suggests the cost to export clean energy may rise, climbing from about $100 billion a year to an estimated $600 billion, but should be competitive in a decarbonising global economy.
“Clean energy exports are a major opportunity,” he said. “Global demand for clean energy is currently uncertain, but Australian exports should be competitive. We stand to gain large export revenues and a million new Australian jobs, if exported energy stays around today’s level.”
The NZA project said the next phase of work will further explore the impacts on land and sea usage, variations of the scenarios, and the benefits and drawbacks of actions that may be taken by governments, companies and communities to mobilise investment and public support. The final report is due to be released in 2023.

Toyota Motor North America announced it is partnering with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to construct, install, and test a 1 MW proton exchange membrane fuel cell power generation system at the NREL Flatirons campus in Arvada, Colorado.
The program is a 3-year, US$6.5 million (AU$9.3m) project funded by the Unite States Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office, part of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
The 1 MW system integrates multiple Toyota fuel cell modules to create a dispatchable stationary power system. In a previous partnership between the two, NREL demonstrated the use of an automotive fuel cell system to provide carbon-free power for a data centre. This new test system is about 15 times the size of the previous test and is capable of both direct current and alternating current power output.
Toyota has been developing fuel cell technologies for over 25 years, largely in the light duty electric vehicle space. Toyota will provide the fuel cell modules and is partnering with systems integrator Telios for the design, balance-of-plant, and build of the system for delivery to NREL. Toyota developed a control system to manage operation of the modules and maximise efficiency and system life. Toyota said the system’s simplified design makes it a suitable candidate to be a drop-in replacement for conventional generators.
“Achieving carbon neutrality requires all of us to explore new applications of zero-emission technology, including how that technology will integrate with other systems, which the project with NREL will identify,” said Christopher Yang, group vice president, business development, fuel cell solutions, Toyota. “The application of our modules in deployments of this magnitude shows the scalability of Toyota’s fuel cell technology, whether it is a single fuel cell module for one passenger vehicle or multiple systems combined to power heavy-duty equipment.”
NREL will stress-test and push the operational boundaries of the system to identify performance limitations and degradation. The research project will also include an assessment of system performance when integrated with energy storage and renewable energy generation systems like solar and wind.
“We will study the scaling of PEM fuel cell systems for stationary power generation to understand what the performance, durability and system integration challenges are,” said Daniel Leighton, an NREL research engineer and principal investigator on the project. “This fuel cell generator system also creates a new megawatt-scale fuel cell research capability at NREL.”
The fuel cell generator is part of NREL’s Advanced Research on Integrated Energy Systems (ARIES) at the Flatirons Campus. The system includes a 1.25 MW PEM electrolyser, 600-kg hydrogen storage system and 1 MW fuel cell generator. The fuel cell generator system will be installed this summer, and the full system will be commissioned later in 2022, said Toyota.

State-owned Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and National Hydroelectric Power Corp. (NHPC) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to set up a gigawatt-scale vertically integrated polysilicon-to-solar module manufacturing unit. 
“The MoU aims at leveraging the complementary strengths and capabilities of BEL and NHPC to cooperate and collaborate in conceptualisation, structuring, and implementation of the gigawatt-scale vertically integrated solar manufacturing unit. [It allows] optimum utilisation of resources, available assets, infrastructure and knowledge base of both the organisations [for the purpose],” stated BEL. 
BEL is India’s leading defence electronics manufacturer that has also established an infrastructure to manufacture mono-crystalline solar cells, mono-crystalline, and multi-crystalline solar modules. It has also installed solar plants across India and overseas.
NHPC, a hydropower producer, caters to clean energy development with its scope spanning concept to commissioning, operation and maintenance. In addition to hydropower, it has ventured into renewable energy projects, mainly solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, floating solar, battery energy storage systems, and hydrogen.
“The MoU is a step in creating the required infrastructure on economies of scale for indigenous manufacturing of polysilicon to solar modules to reduce dependency on imports under Make In India and Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) exploiting the favourable policies of Govt. of India and other State Governments,” stated BEL.
Solar panels manufactured from this facility will be deployed to set up the rooftop and utility-scale solar power plants to achieve India’s renewable energy target of 500 GW by 2030.
