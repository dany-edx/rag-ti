https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/05/safety-concerns-drive-solar-module-transport-solution/,"INSTALLATIONS,RESIDENTIAL PV,AUSTRALIA,QUEENSLAND",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 5, 2021",Safety concerns drive solar module transport solution,"Townsville-based solar installer Horan and Bird has designed a racking system that fits in a company van, negating the need to use trailers and providing a safe, secure and simple solution for transporting solar modules.
The racking system comprises an aluminium frame fitted with opposing channels into which the solar modules slide. A full-length latch is then dropped down from the top of the rack to secure the modules in place. The prototype can be adjusted to fit different size frames, has space for more than 20 modules and has been designed to fit inside a standard van.
Horan and Bird corporate services manager Nicola Howie told pv magazine the racking system had been designed and manufactured in house by the Horan and Bird team.
“We worked with an engineer but the boys in our operations team fully designed it and integrated it,” she said, adding safety had been the key driver behind the design.
“Land transport is our biggest risk in the industry. It’s not installing the solar panels, it is land transport,” she said.
“We’ve been installing solar for more than 10 years and we saw our biggest claims relating to trailers; shoulder claims, neck claims, back claims from lifting trailers with panels in them to connect to a van.
“Also, on the road. We do a lot of highway travel and the trailers are super unsafe. That’s why we went down the path of a fully integrated van.”
Howie said the company has fitted the racking system into only one van but plans to eventually upgrade the entire fleet of 10 vehicles.
“This is our first,” she said. “We wanted to integrate one and make sure it’s viable and it is. We are really happy with it and now we are in the process of transitioning the rest of the fleet.”

The unveiling of Horan and Bird’s racking system is timely after video footage emerged earlier this week showing a driver in Brisbane narrowly avoiding a serious incident after two solar modules flew out of a trailer in front of them.
The driver was filming while travelling along a major highway in Brisbane on Wednesday when the incident occurred.
Dashcam video uploaded to social media by Queensland Police shows two solar panels flying out of a trailer being towed behind a ute and smashing in front of the car. The driver of the ute remained oblivious.
Horan and Bird group manager and company founder John Horan said safety during transportation remains a major issue for the industry.
“Land transport is one of the most significant risks for a solar company and driving around with trailers on the back, especially on the highway is risky,” he said.
“Some people are saying this racking system may not be as efficient as getting a forklift and throwing a pallet into a trailer but to be honest, what is efficiency when it comes to safety?”
Horan and Bird, which has installed more than 26,000 solar systems equating to 150 MW of solar since 2009, said the new racking system also provides the added benefit of less rubbish on job sites.

It also protects the solar modules from damage during transportation, reducing the risk of stress-related microcracks at cell level which can affect both energy output and the system lifetime of a solar PV system. Microcracks also have the potential to produce hot spots.
“That is one of the reasons that we did it, but it is not the main reason,” Horan said.
“But it is an issue in the industry and is something we were conscious of.”
Horan said the racking system has already attracted “significant” interest from other installers.
“It’s unbelievable,” he said. “We didn’t design this to sell it but so many people want one. We cannot believe how many people want to do it themselves now.
“They know how dangerous it is, driving around with trailers and pallets, but we’re not a manufacturing company, we’re a solar company. Someone else can probably build them cheaper than us.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/05/steel-city-targets-green-hydrogen-future/,"HYDROGEN,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 5, 2021",Steel city targets green hydrogen future,"Wollongong is the latest of Australia’s industrial centres to join the march towards renewables with the council declaring the regional centre the perfect site for large-scale green hydrogen production.
The New South Wales Standing Committee on State Development is currently undertaking an inquiry into the development of the hydrogen industry in the state and the Wollongong City Council has unanimously endorsed a submission outlining the city’s advantages, calling for the development of a large-scale hydrogen hub in Port Kembla.
In its submission to the inquiry, council said Port Kembla is an ideal location for large-scale green hydrogen production, citing the availability of renewable energy and recycled water, access to customers, export markets and distribution infrastructure, and the existing industrialised precinct.
“Wollongong City Council is committed to a clean energy future,” Wollongong City Lord Mayor Gordon Bradbery said.
“Port Kembla’s major industrial seaport, our international trade links and partnerships with innovative industries and university organisations, makes Wollongong an ideal location to invest in hydrogen production.
“Council’s Our Wollongong 2028 goal aims to ensure that we work towards building an innovative and sustainable economy. To achieve this vision, we need to ensure our city is ready to transition to an environmentally sustainable future that values and invests in renewable energy industries.”
With industry eager to take advantage of opportunities after the State Government released its NSW Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap late last year, Port Kembla and the broader Wollongong region have already attracted the attention of several significant projects that will provide early-stage opportunities for the adoption of hydrogen and development of a regional industry to support the hydrogen supply chain.

Steel giant BlueScope has announced it will invest $20 million in a new BlueScope Renewable Manufacturing Zone (BRMZ) at Port Kembla while fledgling hybrid car manufacturer H2X has explored plans to establish an assembly plant in the region, potentially working with hydrogen producer Coregas which has operated the largest merchant hydrogen plant in Australia at Port Kembla since 1986.
Identified as a potential hydrogen export hub in the Federal Government’s National Hydrogen Strategy, Port Kembla was not included in the National Energy Resources Australia’s (NERA) $1.85 billion network of regional hydrogen technology clusters unveiled late last month.
Newcastle is the only location in NSW to be included in the network which comprises  13 regional centres across all of Australia’s states and territories.
Despite the setback, councillors are united in their support for a hydrogen industry in the Wollongong area.
“In the past, Wollongong was best known for our world-class steel making and coal mining industry. Today, the City of Wollongong has grown to become an important knowledge service centre, a globally connected trade hub and internationally recognised university city,” Bradbery said.
“As the regional capital of the Illawarra, Wollongong currently contributes $12.2billion, or 60%, to the Illawarra’s economy and by 2041, our city will be home to more than 265,000 residents. Our city will continue to grow, and clean energy is a potential target investment sector that could support the future of Wollongong.”
Council said the submission to the inquiry also supports its recently adopted target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and net zero emissions for council operations by 2030.
“We want to make sure that Wollongong is a healthy and sustainable city into the future,” Bradbery said.
“The inquiry gives us an opportunity to demonstrate our ambition to become a leader in clean energy production within Australia.
“As the steel industry explores options to decarbonise production, hydrogen could play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/05/unisa-works-to-ensure-renewable-energy-dream-doesnt-become-recycling-nightmare/,"BALANCE OF SYSTEMS,MANUFACTURING,AUSTRALIA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MARCH 5, 2021",UniSA works to ensure renewable energy dream doesn’t become recycling nightmare,"Australia continues to demonstrate its appetite for solar, with data provided by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) showing more than 2.66 million rooftop solar power systems had been installed across the nation by the end of 2020 with a collective capacity of more than 10 GW but that rate of uptake has given rise to concerns about recycling and minimising the impacts of end-of-life solar PV systems in Australia.
While solar modules are designed to last, with an average life span of 25 years, eventually they are going to become inefficient and need replacing and increasingly, industry experts are starting to ask what is going to be done with the solar modules when they are due to be decommissioned.
Professor Peter Majewski from the University of South Australia ((UniSA) said it is estimated more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter Australia’s waste stream by 2035.
The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has forecast that by 2025 NSW alone will generate between 3,000 and 10,000 tonnes of waste solar panels and battery storage systems each year and that will increase to between 40,000 and 71,000 tonnes per annum by 2035.
Majewski, who is leading research at UniSA’s Future Industries Institute (FII) to help establish a lifetime stewardship scheme for Australia’s PV industry, said it is imperative end-of-life strategies are put in place long before solar waste peaks.
“We have time to plan for this and ensure the processes are in place, but we have to start acting now, as the right practices may take some time to implement,” he said.
“There are good stewardship programs in place for products such as paint and tyres in Australia, and we would like to see a similar system in place for solar, where the disposal process is pre-planned as an integral part of the product lifecycle.”
The Federal Government has acknowledged the concern, offering a $2 million grant as part of the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund to develop and implement an industry-led product stewardship scheme for photovoltaic (PV) systems.
It is expected the scheme will encourage shared responsibility throughout the supply chain to manage the impacts of PV modules through their life cycle and support the development of an efficient and innovative domestic PV recycling industry.

While retired solar panels are relatively safe and stable, they are classified as e-waste, meaning they cannot be put into landfill in Victoria. With similar bans likely to follow in other states, the need for alternative solutions is clear.
One major challenge facing the solar industry is the low recycle value of PV panels, coupled with the high energy requirements of the currently available collection and recycling processes.
“There is only a little over $5 in recyclable materials in each panel at current market value,” Majewski said.
“The high volume of panels will eventually offset this low value to an extent but at the moment, we can’t expect market forces alone to drive recycling, and investment is needed to establish a waste management scheme and to improve the technology available for that process.”
The UniSA team is currently working on developing both policy and technological solutions to PV’s end-of-life problem, and Majewski believes the integration of both dimensions will be key to a successful stewardship scheme.
“Regulation around collection and recycling targets will be important to drive the process initially, but developing the best disposal techniques is essential, and this may even influence manufacturing techniques and what goes into the panels to start with,” he said.
End-of-life management for PV isn’t the only challenge facing the renewables industry, and a similar disposal problem exists in relation to the blades of wind turbines, which are large and notoriously difficult to recycle.
“These blades are the size of an airliner wing, and they have been built to withstand hurricane-force winds so they are a big challenge when they get to the end of their life,” Majewski said.
“As with solar panels, that disposal challenge requires planning and preparation, but approached the right way it doesn’t have to be an insurmountable problem, and we are beginning to look at strategies for how to deal with these blades as they come offline.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/03/05/is-australia-crawling-toward-electric-ferries/,"ENERGY STORAGE,EV,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,SUSTAINABILITY,TECHNOLOGY,TECHNOLOGY AND R&D,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",BLAKE MATICH,"MARCH 5, 2021",Is Australia Crawling toward electric ferries? ,"Australian billionaire Scott Farquhar, Co-Founder and CEO of tech-giant Atlassian and to avoid confusion no relation to Lord Farquaad, has sparked debate on Twitter about whether Sydney’s ferry fleet should go electric. Of course, whether anything on Twitter could be thought of as a “debate” is questionable, but whether the new Manly ferries should be electric is certainly an interesting question. After all, the NSW Government announced in November 2020 that it intended to retire most of the Freshwater-class ferries and replace them with the smaller Emerald-class. 
Would be great to see electric ferries on Sydney harbour as part of our plan to net zero emissions. Should the new Manly ferries be electric? https://t.co/cCgG3FsJLw
— Scott Farquhar (@scottfarkas) March 1, 2021

Farquhar’s suggestion was inspired by the launch of the world’s largest electric ferry, which was just entered into operation by Bastø Fosen in Norway. The 143m Turkey-built NB-42 Bastø Electric ferry, in operation between Horten and Moss across the Outer Oslofjord, boasts 7.2 MW (4.3 MWh) of Siemens batteries and can carry 200 cars/24 trucks as well as 600 passengers for 20 trips a day.
The ferry charges from what the charger manufacturer, Stemmann-Technik, calls a “tower solution”, basically, a pantograph. The rather neat charger is therefore protected against the elements and fitted into the docking area. 

According to Ayhan Özdemir, project coordinator for the Turkish shipbuilder Sefine, the vessel is so quiet that during its first sea trial they were surprised to realise that an electric vessel, “unlike other vessels, you can never understand whether it is sailing or not.”  
The Southern Hemisphere got its first electric commuter ferry in 2020, when Wellington Harbour, New Zealand, welcomed the East by West $4 million, 19 metre electric ferry, large enough to carry 135 commuters back and forth across Wellington Harbour. 
Australia is yet to follow its Antipodean neighbour’s lead, although Brisbane-based outfit H2X Marine did announce plans in November 2020 for a hydrogen ferry. 
Is Australia still crawling? 
Cleantech guru Michael Liebreich published a report with Michal Grabka and Piotr Pajda last year for the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in which it was estimated that the electrification of inland and coastal ferries in Latin America and the Caribbean alone represents a $6.8 billion opportunity between now and 2040. 
“Basically, if you can get e-ferries to work technically, based on range/space/weight/power supply, they will almost certainly save money over time,” said Liebreich when asked to comment on the global opportunity of e-ferries, with specific reference to North Sea passages such as the NB-42. “No reason why that would not be the case in the North Sea,” Liebreich continued, “though you might want to leave a bigger safety margin for bad weather.”
Of course, the Manly ferry, which operates in the protection of Sydney Harbour between Manly and Circular Quay, would not require such a safety margin. Of course, the Manly ferry can, as I have experienced myself many times, encounter big swells when it passes the entrance to Sydney Heads. However, it is very uncommon for such swells to cease ferry operations and therefore impact on savings. 
The Manly ferry is an icon of Sydney Harbour, a green and gold immortelle flashing across the sapphire blue notch of water at the heart of Sydney life. From the wharf at Manly Cove, tourists and locals take the slow ferry or the fast ferry down the middle-passage of the harbour, briefly encountering the swell funnelling in from the rim of the Pacific, around Bradley’s Head and turning tight around Bennelong Point for full on views of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, depending on which side of the ferry you’re on. 
The Manly Ferry is not a commute, it’s a journey in itself and one of the great pleasures of Sydney life. When we think of the ferry we think of those famous opening lyrics from Australian Crawl’s “Reckless”, and perhaps we should also now be thinking whether we are being reckless if the next fleet of ferries is not electric. We only ask they remain as wattle-beautiful as they have always been: 
“Meet me down by the jetty landing
Where the pontoons bump and spray
The others reading, standing
As the Manly Ferry cuts its way to Circular Quay”

Powercor’s Solar Hotspots Program aims to improve the export capacity of solar systems and reduce the tripping in areas of high rooftop solar penetration due to excesses of solar exportation that the network can’t facilitate. 
The program was part of a draft for the 2021-2025 regulatory period proposed by Powercor back in February 2019. The distributor, cognisant that the growth of rooftop solar was only going to accelerate, has therefore developed this program as a way to increase power network capacity in regions of high solar penetration. These “hotspot areas” are areas where “greater than one in three homes has a solar connected” said Mark Clarke, general manager electricity networks. 
Clarke noted that in the last 18 months alone, the rate of new applications for solar connections in Powercor has more than doubled, a rate for which Powercor credits the Victoria Solar Homes Program. 21% of Powercor’s customers are now generating a total of 580 MW of excess solar electricity back into the grid, and 5% of CitiPower customers contributing 50 MW. 
“We recognise the future of energy is being driven by customer choices” said Clarke, ” and we have a big role in enabling them.” 
The program will see field crews deployed to up to 30 hotspot locations a week between March and June 2021. Locations include Ballarat, Bendigo, Portland, and the western suburbs of Melbourne between Sunshine and Point Cook. And on the CitiPower network crews will be dispatched to over the next six months to the inner Melbourne suburbs such as Northcote, Fitzroy, Kew, Camberwell my old stomping grounds of Brunswick. 
According to Powercor’s head of customer connections, Daniel Bye, the work these field crews will perform involves balancing the voltage on powerlines and changing the settings on major transformers in zone substations. Powercor’s technical assessment aims for these works to enable at least 80% of new solar applications to export 5 kW. This 80% could translate to an estimated 50,000 current or potential solar customers able to export more solar to the grid.
“We do not prevent customers from installing rooftop solar” continued Clarke, “but we have a responsibility to all our customers to make sure any excess electricity is safely exported into the network.”  
To this point, Bye notes that it is very fundamental that Powercor customers “check with us prior to committing to any solar installation, to ensure they have the ability to export their excess generation.”
