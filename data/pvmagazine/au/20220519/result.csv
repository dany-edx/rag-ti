Singapore-based Sun Cable is seeking to develop a giant solar PV and battery complex on a 12,000-hectare site in the Northern Territory’s (NT) Barkly region. The project includes a 17-20GW solar farm and between 36GWh and 42GWh of energy storage.
The Territory government has already signed a Project Development Agreement (PDA) which allows it to work in partnership with Sun Cable to finalise land tenure and commercial arrangements for the AAPowerLink but it has now moved to provide the developers with even more certainty.
The government said the Solar Project (Australia-Asia Power Link) (Special Provisions) Bill 2022 will provide certainty that key commitments in the PDA will be met.
“The legislation will clarify and streamline existing processes, increase project certainty, and support Sun Cable to secure project financing,” it said, adding that while the legislation provides for the grant, or consent to the grant of tenure, it “does not remove the need for Sun Cable to reach agreement with other interested parties”.
Development Minister Eva Lawler said the AAPowerLink project will serve as a major economic driver for the Territory and put the region on the international map when it comes to renewables.
“The legislation provides certainty for the project and facilitates its implementation which will create over 1,750 jobs during construction and 350 ongoing positions as part of operations,” she said.
“The Australia-Asia PowerLink will transform the Territory into a renewable energy powerhouse and establish a new energy export industry for Australia, with positive flow-on benefits for businesses.”
Sun Cable said the passing of the legislation is another major milestone for the project which shapes as the world’s biggest solar and battery energy storage project.

“This is another significant milestone, facilitating Sun Cable’s AAPowerLink pathway as we work with the Northern Territory to realise the potential of this world-class solar asset, creating jobs, investment, large-scale green industry development and lower emissions,” the company said in a social media post.
Once operational, the AAPowerLink will supply power to Darwin and to Singapore via a 4,200-kilometre transmission network, including a 750km overhead transmission line from the solar farm to Darwin and a 3,800km submarine cable from Darwin to Singapore. The project is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to power more than 3 million homes a year.
The project, which is anticipated will provide 800MW of renewable energy capacity to the Darwin region from 2026 and up to 15% of Singapore’s electricity needs from 2027, has already secured key approvals with the Australian federal government awarding it Major Project Status while the Indonesian government has approved the submarine transmission cable route.
Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said the $30-plus billion project will deliver an economic and employment bonanza for the Top End.
“Sun Cable’s AAPowerLink will invest $8 billion in Australia, with the majority invested here in the Territory,” she said. “That means more local jobs, more opportunities for local businesses, and a strong and diversified economy.”
Sun Cable has said construction for the project will begin immediately after financial close in October 2023 with commercial operations to commence in 2027.
Construction of the key elements of the AAPowerLink project is expected to begin in early 2024 with the first power to be supplied to Darwin in 2026. The first supply of electricity to Singapore is expected in 2027 with full capacity expected by the end of 2028.

Yurika executive general manager Carly Irving said the system, the latest project delivered through a partnership between Yurika and the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC), which owns and manages more than $20 billion worth of retail and commercial properties across Australia and the United States, is one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
“This is a massive system – it has more than 12,000 panels that generate a whopping 4.93MW of energy,” Yurika executive general manager Carly Irving said.
“The technology will reduce Hyperdome’s carbon emissions by 6,050 tonnes of CO2 annually, which is the equivalent of removing 2,800 passenger vehicles from our roads each year.
Yurika’s partnership with QIC includes projects at major shopping centres at Robina, Toowoomba and Townsville in Queensland, and another in Melbourne. The centres are leveraging Yurika’s Smart Connected Solar technology which includes solar PV systems and 24/7 monitoring technology with the ability to add additional renewable options such as battery energy storage and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.

Irving said the commercial and industrial real estate market sector is actively investing in behind-the-meter generation technology, energy management and building automation to transform assets towards a more sustainable footprint.
“The five sites are the first phase of a long-term partnership with Queensland Investment Corporation, with the potential to support QIC with emerging opportunities in energy such as the evolution of their embedded networks, EV charging services, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) and the addition of technology such as batteries in the future,” she said.
“The Smart Connected Solar product offers business customers an opportunity to invest in the latest renewable smart technology which brings greater financial savings and improved carbon emissions.”
Irving said the solar networks across the five sites will deliver more than 15MW of solar power capacity and reduce carbon emissions by more than 17,000 metric tonnes per year, as well as “providing significant relief to the energy network in the surrounding communities”.
Queensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni was on hand to press the switch on the Hyperdome project and said it will help deliver on the state government’s renewable energy targets.
“Projects like this are driving Queensland towards our 50% renewable energy target by 2030,” he said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/19/190-million-mornington-big-battery-gets-aemo-green-light/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,VICTORIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 19, 2022",$190 million Mornington big battery gets AEMO green light,"Australian renewables developer Maoneng is proposing to build a standalone 240 MWp/480 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula where the company said it will serve to promote the reliability and security of the electricity grid.
Sydney-based Maoneng said on Thursday the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) had provided assessment approval to connect the standalone $190 million Mornington Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to AusNet’s existing Tyabb substation in the southern part of the Victorian grid.
The Mornington battery received development approval earlier this year and Maoneng said it is now on track for completion in early 2024. The project is expected to generate up to 160 full-time equivalent jobs during its 12-month construction phase.
Maoneng co-founder and chief executive officer Morris Zhou said the grid connection assessment approval was an important step forward for the project.
“The Mornington BESS is really coming together. We now have the assessment approval as well as the development approval for an asset that will support the Victorian government’s objective of improving regional electricity reliability,” he said.
“This project is progressing at a time when demand for renewable energy and associated storage capacity is increasing, and we are seeing a lot more interest in battery projects both in Australia and internationally – they are vital to the clean energy transition.”

The Mornington battery will be located on a 6.7-hectare site adjacent to AusNet’s existing Tyabb substation, about 70 kilometres east of Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula, where Maoneng said it will cater to fluctuations in demand sparked by seasonal tourism.
Maoneng said the standalone BESS will draw and store energy from the grid during off-peak periods and dispatch energy to the grid during peak periods, generating power for the equivalent of 40,000 average Australian homes.
Zhou said the Mornington BESS would be strategically important for the electricity grid in the region.
“A vital part of the Victorian government’s Renewable Energy Action Plan is the integration of energy storage. Our facility directly supports this strategy and will play a key role in local grid stability,” he said.
The Mornington BESS announcement follows the revelation by AEMO that in Q1 2022 grid-scale batteries were for the first time the largest providers of Frequency Control Ancillary Service (FCAS) in the National Electricity Market (NEM).

In its latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics (QED) report, AEMO said grid-scale batteries were the largest providers by fuel/technology type of FCAS in the first quarter, reaching a combined share of 31% across the NEM’s eight FCAS markets.
Other relatively new sources, including demand response and Virtual Power Plants (VPP), have also increased volumes at the expense of conventional generation providers.
Estimated battery revenues from energy market participation also increased to their highest quarterly level since Q1 2019.
AEMO’s latest Generation Information file shows that alongside 487MW of utility-scale solar and 210MW of wind capacity moving to the committed phase, there are 26.79GW of proposed battery storage systems, a significant increase on the 611MW of existing capacity in the NEM.
The Mornington BESS is part of Maoneng’s growing pipeline of operational and planned renewable energy projects. Its portfolio includes nearly 300MW of generation power from the Sunraysia Solar Farm in New South Wales (NSW) and the Mugga Lane Solar Park in the Australian Capital Territory. The company is also in the process of building more than 1.8GWh of utility-scale battery energy storage projects in Victoria, NSW and South Australia, including the recently announced Merriwa Energy Hub.
To be built in the Hunter region of NSW, the Merriwa project would be one of the largest renewable energy hubs in the country, comprising a 550MW solar farm and a 400MW/1,600MWh battery energy storage facility.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/19/amazon-announces-two-new-solar-farms-now-online-in-nsw/,"INSTALLATIONS,STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,UTILITY SCALE PV,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 19, 2022",Amazon announces two new solar farms now online in NSW,"Online retail giant Amazon announced on Wednesday that the 150MWac Suntop and the 110MWac Gunnedah solar farms developed in regional New South Wales (NSW) by Chinese PV heavyweight Canadian Solar are now up and running and delivering clean energy to the grid.
The Suntop Solar Farm, near Wellington in central northern NSW, and the Gunnedah Solar Farm, west of Tamworth in the state’s north-west, are expected to generate a combined 392,000MWh of renewable energy each year, equal to the annual electricity consumption of 63,000 Australian homes.
Canadian Solar said both solar farms are underwritten by long-term offtake agreements with Amazon, one of the largest multinational technology companies in the world.
Amazon announced in 2020 it had signed a deal to purchase a combined 262MW in clean energy capacity across three utility-scale renewable projects in Australia.
The United States-headquartered multinational signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to buy 105MW of output from the Suntop project. That came just months after Amazon signed a contract with Canadian Solar to buy 60MW of output from the Gunnedah facility.
Amazon also has a PPA in place to purchase renewable energy from the 96.6MW Hawkesdale Wind Farm being built by Global Power Generation in Victoria’s Western District.

The three projects are expected to generate a combined 717,000MWh of renewable energy annually for Amazon with the solar farms to contribute more than half of the amount.
Amazon, which only last month announced 37 new renewable energy projects around the world, including new rooftop solar installations at its buildings in Australia, said the launch of the two solar farms would help the company meet its renewable energy goals.
“Amazon’s commitment to protecting the planet, to operate our business in the most efficient way possible, and to limit our impact on the environment, has led us to be the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world in both 2020 and 2021,” the company said in a statement.
“This extends to all locations where we operate, and we are pleased to announce that our first Australian utility-scale renewable energy projects are now delivering clean energy to the Australian grid.
“The two solar farms in regional NSW are two of the 310 renewable energy projects across 19 countries helping Amazon stay on our path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our original goal of 2030.”
Once operational, Amazon expects the 310 projects will produce 42,000GWh of renewable energy annually.

Trina Solar’s energy storage unit officially launched the Trina Storage Elementa grid-scale energy storage system at the Smarter E event in Munich last week, featuring its proprietary lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells.
The 2.1 MWh DC All-New Elementa is a modular LFP battery cabinet with a plug-in concept to connect multiple units. The standardised design and factory-installed configuration purportedly reduces installation times by up to 70%. The system is designed to make on-site installation simpler, cutting capex by up to 8%, said the manufacturer.
Elementa has fully integrated battery management systems and thermal runaway and safety features such as a bi-directional liquid cooling system, gas sensors, and heat and smoke detectors. On the back of improved LFP battery cell performance, Elementa is able to provide up to 10,000 cycles, which according to Trina, is 25% more than the Tier 1 market average.
Elementa was first unveiled in October last year as part of Trina Storage’s debut at Intersolar Europe. Trina Solar’s storage division was founded in February last year. In the meantime, the business has already supplied its first project, 50 MW/56.2 MWh fully integrated battery storage system in Burwell, England, for energy infrastructure provider SMS plc to provide balancing services to the UK National Grid. The system was commissioned in February.
Unlike some other major PV manufacturers that have decided to step into the battery storage arena, Trina is producing all battery components from the bottom up. “We control the supply chain ourselves,” Ken Rush, Trina Storage’s head of product and engineering, told pv magazine.
Nonetheless, demand is ramping up so fast that Trina Storage is struggling to keep up. The business already has more than 100 customers throughout the world. As Rush told pv magazine, Trina Storage is sold out for the year and continues to scale up production as we speak.
Current order waiting times are around six to seven months and a “large portion” of Trina’s 3 GWh LFP capacity in China’s Jiangsu province, is in production and will be scaled up in the near future. The business has also set up an integration base that enables a customisable battery energy storage system design with an annual capacity of 5 GWh.
Rush said that the Elementa system is the first to feature Trina’s proprietary LFP battery cells. He said that “high-level pricing” stands at around $250/kWh, with project-dependent factors affecting final price tag. While massive in size, the Elementa can fit into a shipping container.

Flexibility is at the heart of the latest battery storage innovations coming from South Korean battery company LG Energy Solution. As seen at the Smarter E event in Munich last week, LG Chem’s energy storage and battery division has gone one step further in modularising its RESU Flex home battery system. It has also developed a new containerised, grid-scale energy storage solution that is delivered pre-assembled.
True to its name, the modular RESU Flex residential battery storage solution can be installed in various capacities, ranging from to 8.6 kWh to 17.2 kWh, with more than 30 different installation forms to maximise space efficiency. According to customer preferences, RESU Flex can be installed on any surface, indoor or outdoor, said the manufacturer.
Depending on the configuration, RESU Flex has a voltage range of 192 V to 531.2 V and can serve different energy usage patterns. The 8.6 kWh system, which features two battery modules and a battery protection unit, is primarily designed to support self-consumption, shaving peak hour loads and back-up critical loads in emergency. The three-battery module unit with 12.9 kWh capacity can cover energy-consuming devices, such as heat pumps and EVs, as well as provide back up to critical loads in emergency. The 17.2 kWh system is well-equipped for a wide range of applications from home to small C&I, as well as a whole home backup, depending on the functionality of the inverter.
The battery module measures 665.2 mm x 665.2 mm x 148.4 mmm and weighs in at 48.9 kg. All configurations come with a separate battery protection unit which weighs at 16.6 kg. The operating temperature range goes from -10 C to 50 C. The product also features an IP55 protection level.
In addition to single-phase inverters, RESU Flex is compatible with three-phase inverters made by Kostal, Fronius, SMA and GoodWe. As Jorg Jurgens, LGES director of energy storage systems EMEA, confirmed to pv magazine, RESU Flex is readily available for shipment. If ordered today, it would be delivered in just a couple of weeks, which is much faster than the time frames offered by most battery manufacturers. Current order waiting times are around five months in Germany, for example.
The new RESU Flex series will feature the NMC battery chemistry. The South Korean manufacturer has long been faithful to NMC, but it now plans to develop and release LFP-standard cells by October 2023 and LFP long cells by the fourth quarter of 2024. Jurgens told pv magazine that the transition will be a smooth one, as the LFP cells will be produced in the same format and sizes, so the systems will be able to use the same modules and racks as before.
The new battery cells will be made in Holland in the US state of Michigan, with double-digit gigawatt-scale production lines being added to the facility, Jurgens said. This aligns with an earlier announcement from LG Energy Solution that it is pouring in $1.7 billion to increase the production capacity for battery cells and packs at the Michigan plan, up fivefold from 5 GWh at present.
The switch to the safer nickel and cobalt-free battery chemistry follows LG Energy Solution’s forced recall of some of its battery energy storage systems in the United States and Australia due to potential fire-related risks. In March 2021, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a recall notice for batteries in LG Energy Solution’s lithium-ion RESU residential range, due to the potential risk of overheating and catching fire.
Only a couple of months later, LG Energy Solutions itself launched a free replacement program for certain models that were manufactured between April 2017 and September 2018. The replacement program, which was assessed to cost around $350 million, was announced after overheating incidents were reported.
Last August, LG Energy Solution Michigan launched a recall campaign for its RESU 10H batteries in the US market that affected about 10,000 storage systems. “The home batteries can overheat, poising a risk of fire and emission of harmful smoke,” the manufacturer said at the time. The recall was launched on the back of five reports of the lithium storage batteries smoking and catching on fire, resulting in property damage and one injury.
The first recall of its residential batteries in the United States took place only weeks after the manufacturer launched the new line of products in December 2020. It affected 1,815 RESU 10H units sold between January 2017 and March 2019. The reason behind the recall were reports of LG Chem RESU 10H fires resulting in minor property damage but no injuries.
Other innovations that LG Energy Solutions presented last week in Munich include the new container-based ESS solution is delivered fully assembled at the factory. It said this reduces the site installation time by 40% and cost by 30%. Compared to conventional 40-foot ISO systems, the modular and scalable containerised ESS solution reduces the installation area by 15%, saving costs incorporated with land. It is designed as more than a simple battery rack system, incorporating an active ventilation system, a fire suppression system and a HVAC system.
The company also showcased other high-performance, grid-based ESS products in its portfolio, including a high-voltage rack (1,400V) and the Transportable Rack 1300, a pre-engineered rack system optimised for indoor conditions.

Lightsource bp, a unit of BP, will build a 150 MW solar park on around 200 fishery ponds in Budai, Chiayi county, in southwestern Taiwan.
The company is co-developing the project with Germany’s Green Rock Energy. They plan to start construction on the facility in June 2023. Lightsource said the project will be one of the largest fishery solar farms in Taiwan and will be able to generate 210,000 MWh per year.
“Alongside providing locally generated renewable energy and creating new jobs, Lightsource bp’s fishery solar project has been designed to benefit the local environment and community,” the company said. “Throughout the process, Lightsource bp engaged environmental specialists as well as local fishermen to provide expertise and design a project with multiple benefits.”
It said that other benefits involve the addition of saltwater storage ponds to optimise the water management process for the fish farmers. However, it did not disclose any additional technical or financial details.
Lightsource said the project was made possible by the $1.8 billion credit and trade finance facility it secured last year. The credit facilities were provided by BNP Paribas and Société Générale, Santander, NatWest, Lloyds,Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Wells Fargo.
