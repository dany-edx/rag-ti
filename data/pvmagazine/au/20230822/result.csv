AGL Chief Operating Officer Markus Brokhof said the battery, eclipsed only by French renewables developer Neoen’s 300 MW/450 MWh Victoria Big Battery, will provide additional firming capacity and flexibility for the grid.
“South Australia has the largest penetration of rooftop solar in Australia,” he said, noting that more than 70% of the state’s electricity is supplied by renewables. “This battery will respond to the requirements of the SA grid in milliseconds providing additional capacity and frequency control services when the system requires it.”
Sized at one hour storage but with the potential to extend the duration to four hours (1,000 MWh) in the future, the battery will initially operate in grid-following mode before transitioning to grid-forming mode (virtual synchronous generation).
“The technology which makes up this battery is remarkable,” Brokhof said.

AGL Chief Executive Officer Damien Nicks said the Torrens Island project forms part of the company’s broader ambition to have up to 5 GW of new renewables and firming in place by the end of the decade.
“This is a significant milestone in AGL’s transition journey as we continue to accelerate the build out of up to 12 GW of renewable and firming capacity by 2035,” he said.
“On this very site in the past four years, we have announced the closure of a thermal power station, built a flexible peaking plant and commissioned the second largest battery in Australia. This is the energy transition in action.”
“This battery is the second largest battery in Australia. It will provide enough electricity to power approximately 75,000 South Australian homes for one hour.”
Among the company’s other energy storage projects is a 50 MW/100 MWh battery under construction at Broken Hill in New South Wales, and a 500 MW/2 GWh battery planned for the Liddell power station site on the state’s Central Coast.
It is also planning a 500 MW battery with four hours of dispatchable capacity next to the Tomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle, and a 200 MW/800 MWh battery to be built at the Loy Yang A power station site in Victoria.

The joint venture plans to develop solar farms in the Manawatu, Waikato and Hawke’s Bay regions, with the facilities delivering an expected capacity of 200 MW, 100 MW and 100 MW respectively.
Genesis General Manager of Commercial Development, Craig Brown, said the $555 million (NZD 600 million) investment will make the government-backed gen-tailer the largest solar generator in the country by some margin.
“This is really demonstrating our commitment to develop solar for the New Zealand market and to enable us to displace thermal generation and increase the renewable portions in our market,” he said.
“We’d like to think that we’re really well positioned to play a leading role in solar and ultimately that’s our goal.”
“From Genesis’ perspective the combination of solar plus wind, our existing hydro, geothermal and other renewable sources, will give Genesis and New Zealand the balance that it needs.”
Brown said while the projects remain subject to regulatory processes, Genesis is targeting financial investment decisions within the next 18 to 24 months with the first of the projects expected to be generating electricity by 2026.
The announcement comes after Genesis and FRV Australia earlier this year confirmed they would develop a 52 MW solar farm near Lauriston on NZ’s South Island.
Genesis said the Lauriston project remains on track with a final investment decision expected before the end of the year.
“Construction will commence shortly after with the first generation of electricity expected in late 2024,” it said.
The solar projects form part of the Genesis and FRV Australia joint venture which was formed in late 2021 to develop up to 500 MW of solar capacity over the next five years. This is expected to generate about 750 GWh per annum.
The solar program is part of Genesis’ Future-gen initiative which aims to displace 2,650 GWh of baseload thermal generation with new renewable power by 2030.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/22/cyberattack-highlights-energy-grid-security-concerns/,"ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,GRIDS & INTEGRATION,MARKETS,MARKETS & POLICY,POLICY,AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"AUGUST 22, 2023",Cyberattack highlights energy grid security concerns,"ASX-listed energy software provider Energy One has been targeted in a cyberattack with the company confirming that “certain corporate systems in Australia and the United Kingdom” were affected.
Energy One, which specialises in energy trading software for clients including major retailers and generators in Australia, Europe and the United States, said in a statement it “took immediate steps to limit the impact of the incident,” including disabling “some links between its corporate and customer-facing systems.”
The company said it had alerted the Australian Cyber Security Centre and U.K. authorities of the breach and “analysis is underway to identify which, if any, additional systems may have been affected by the cyberattack.”
The attack comes after the federal government-backed Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CSCRC) raised concerns that Australia’s use of foreign-made solar panel technology, notably inverters, has made the country susceptible to targeted cyberattacks that could undermine the stability of power grids.
In a new report, the CSCRC has highlighted that the cyber risk associated with solar inverters has increased as the popularity of smart home energy systems has boomed, with most inverters now web connected for monitoring and control purposes.
The CSCRC said as the number of homes with solar systems continues to increase, the risk associated with inverters continues to grow with the devices vulnerable to a range of cyber intrusions including “hacking, malware attacks, manipulation and disruption.”
“As internet-connected devices they collect and distribute valuable data and are attractive targets for malicious cyber actors,” the research body said. “In the case of photovoltaic inverters, which play an increasingly vital role in Australia’s power supply, the potential ramifications could be catastrophic.”
While individual attacks wouldn’t affect the grid more broadly, CSCRC Research Director Helge Janicke said a widespread attack could destabilise an entire power grid, leading to widespread blackouts.
“Conceivably such attacks could be so severe that they result in a ‘black start’ event, an effective restarting of a power grid,” he said. “It could take a week to recover from a black start because power plants would be incapable of turning back without reliance on an auxiliary power source.”
The CSCRC has recommended a raft of policy solutions, saying Australia needs to take a more hands-on approach to regulation of cyber security, especially as it relates to the security of critical infrastructure.
The CSCRC said is calling for cyber security impact assessments for all solar inverters sold in Australia and the introduction of mandatory cyber security ratings for solar inverters. It also declared that any inverters assessed as having serious cyber security vulnerabilities should be removed from sale and recalled from use, or appropriate security fixes should be applied if available.
“There is an opportunity to embed cyber security considerations into mandatory standards that solar inverters sold in Australia should be required to meet,” it said.

Alinta said the utility scale battery will create the opportunity for more renewable generation to be connected to the state’s main grid, known as the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), while maintaining power quality and continuity of supply.
“With the continued introduction of intermittent energy sources into the SWIS, such as domestic and utility scale solar, the need for fast-start, balancing capacity becomes more important,” the Chinese-owned company said in its application papers.
“The ability of large batteries to respond instantly to fluctuations on the grid is critical to the development and operation of increased renewable energy in the state.”
Alinta Energy Chief Development Officer Ken Woolley said the battery will connect to existing high-voltage infrastructure at the Wagerup power station and is scheduled to be commissioned during the “second half of 2024.”
“We’re excited about the contribution the Wagerup battery will make to stabilising the southwest WA grid, and providing back-up capacity when needed,” he said.
Work on the estimated $100 million (USD 64 million) project is to commence immediately with electrical design firm Shanghai Electric Power Design Institute (SEPD) and Australian solar and battery installer Sunterra appointed to deliver the battery.
Alinta’s announcement coincided with the release of a report from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) that flags the need for “significant and sustained investment in generation, storage and transmission to meet reliability standards in the SWIS.”
In its latest Wholesale Energy Market (WEM) Electricity Statement of Opportunity, AEMO predicts an increase in electricity use and peak demand levels in WA driven by electrification, electric vehicle (EV) uptake, and new energy-intensive industries including green hydrogen production.
The report, which takes into account 1,348 MW of generation from ‘probable’ new projects, suggests the state will have a shortfall of 945 MW by 2025-26. This is expected to increase to about 4 GW by 2032-33, a significant shift compared to the 2022 WEM ESOO outlook, where the additional capacity requirement was expected to reach 303 MW by 2031-32.
AEMO Executive General Manager Western Australia and Strategy, Kate Ryan, said “this year’s reliability outlook highlights the need for significant and sustained investment in additional capacity, fast-tracking the pipeline of generation, storage and demand-side projects, along with investment in transmission infrastructure, to meet reliability standards.
“The rapid energy transition is now fuelling very strong forecast growth in electricity demand,” she said. “At the same time, we’re transitioning to new, lower-emissions sources of supply and managing the phase out of coal-fired generation.”
“Increased capacity investment is needed for a robust and resilient power system capable of meeting future demand and facilitating the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.”
The release of the report prompted the state government to push back the retirement of the Muja coal-fired power station in Collie to ensure wider energy system security during the high demand period of the hot summer months.
Synergy’s Muja 6 plant was due to close in October 2024, but that will now be delayed until April 2025. The unit will be placed on reserve outage mode during that period to be available for significant peak demand events.
The state government said the delay will not impact the planned retirement of the state’s remaining coal-fired units by 2030, with Collie and Muja Power Stations scheduled to close in 2027 and 2029 respectively.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2023/08/22/meyer-burger-shifting-focus-to-us-market/,"FINANCE,MARKETS,MODULES & UPSTREAM MANUFACTURING,SWITZERLAND,UNITED STATES",SANDRA ENKHARDT,"AUGUST 22, 2023",Meyer Burger shifting focus to US market,"Meyer Burger Technology AG produced 302 MW of its heterojunction solar modules in Freiberg, Germany, during the first half of this year, surpassing its output for all of 2022. The company reported a 71% year-on-year jump in sales to $171.4 million (CHF 96.9 million). It said that it remains financially strong and is capable of proceeding with its production expansion plans.
However, the Swiss company is now shifting its strategic focus from Europe to the U.S. market. This transition became evident in July, when its announced plans to establish a 2 GW cell production facility in the U.S., alongside an existing module plant.
By combining U.S. module and cell manufacturing, Meyer Burger will benefit from the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit 45X system, a component of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This initiative could potentially provide up to $2.48 billion in cumulative funding from mid-2024 to the end of 2032.
Meyer Burger is capitalising on the favourable financial conditions in the U.S. market, but it is also actively tackling current market obstacles in Europe. The European market has experienced the entry of Chinese PV manufacturers, introducing 85 GW of solar modules in the first half of this year, frequently at prices below manufacturing costs.
This influx has significantly influenced market dynamics. During the first quarter, Meyer Burger effectively sustained its selling prices at almost consistent levels. However, in the second quarter, the company made price adjustments downwards in reaction to the broader decrease in solar module prices.
Global demand for solar modules is rising, including in Europe, but market conditions are not ideal, according to Meyer Burger.
