The northern New South Wales city of Armidale sits at the heart of the proposed New England Renewable Energy Zones, or REZ. Its local council on Monday announced it had struck a deal with the developers of a 225 MW solar farm, Oxley Solar Development Pty Ltd, which would see the company pay approximately $2.79 million once construction begins on the project, with the remaining $3.11 million to be paid over the next 20 years.

“They have also significantly scaled down the original footprint of the solar farm in response to local submissions and in an attempt to minimise their impact,” the Armidale Regional Council said of developer Oxley Solar Development.
The Armidale Regional Council’s Mayor Sam Coupland, elected in January, said he expects the deal will be the first of many.
“Historically wind and solar farms have contributed little in employment (outside construction phases) and almost nothing in community benefit contributions,” the Armidale Regional Council’s statement on the Oxley deal said. “Council is now very clear that developers can expect little support if they are not engaging meaningfully with locals, minimising the impact of their project and making appropriate financial contributions to the community.”
Armidale Council, along with Glen Innes Severn, Inverell Shire, Uralla Shire and Walcha Councils– all of which fall into the New England REZ – in March presented a list of demands for prospective REZ developers to the NSW government.

The first of which was a ‘Community Contribution Fee’ – exactly what it seems Oxley Solar Farm is paying. The payment, the council’s said in their ‘statement of expectations’, is to go to a common fund established and solely managed by the individual councils and should “be in the region of 1.5% of build cost of the project… or $800 per MW (AC) per year over the life of the project.”
The other demands of the consortium of councils include a project decommissioning bond and local engagement mandate – both deemed essential. The councils would also like to see projects ink local power purchasing agreements, source carbon offsets locally and build telecommunications infrastructure.
The formalisation of these council expectations is the culmination of long stirring disquiet in Australia’s regions.
Support for renewable energy zones in the regions appears far less unanimous than in the cities, to put it mildly. Pv magazine Australia has been following the phenomenon for some time and previously spoke to a farmer based in the New England region who described renewable project’s community consultation approaches as “divisive” and poorly formulated.
Moreover, she felt the decision making process was opaque and unfair, with regional communities expected to host the projects necessary for decarbonisation while city dwellers reaped the rewards.
“If we’re doing the bulk of the heavy lifting, we would like to see some evidence the people using the electricity as wisely as they can,” she said.
Her concerns echoed those of the communities rallying against transmission projects in Australia, as laid out in a recent report from the Victoria-based Energy Grid Alliance. For them, the grievance is not with new transmission but its flawed planning framework.

Similarly, in regional communities opposition appears not to stem from a problem with renewable energy itself, but rather how it is rolled out and who is making the decisions about where it goes.
Armidale’s recently elected mayor Sam Coupland appears to have a similarly cool view on incoming renewable projects. In a council meeting last week, the mayor forwarded two motions relating to the REZ, including one demanding the state plan housing for incoming construction workers and another for better assessment of the social and cumulative impacts of multiple renewable projects. 
“This is not sufficiently independent or robust to satisfy host communities,” the Armidale Council’s minutes on the meeting say.
Coming back to Oxley Solar Farm, the project is proposed for a site 14 kilometres south-east of Armidale on land currently being used for agriculture.
The Armidale Council have made clear the $5.9 million community contribution fee in no way secures the project’s future. Oxley Solar Farm still needs to address a number of issues raised in public submissions in order to obtain the necessary state government approvals, the council said. 
It is referring here to the 96 public submissions lodged in response to the solar farms Environmental Impacts and planning documents. Of those submissions, nearly every one from private residents – the vast majority – are objections.
“There is still a substantial part of the state government assessment process to undergo on this project and I would encourage our community to continue to actively participate in that process,” Mayor Coupland said.
“Council intends to review thoroughly how Oxley have responded to concerns raised by the local community and will provide feedback on that to the NSW government.”

Phillip Graham, founder and CEO of CleanPeak Energy, the company responsible for the precinct’s energy scheme, on Monday announced the “practical completion” of the precinct’s stage two solar expansion.
The 4.83 MW rooftop solar system is spread across the roof of Renewal SA, which manages the precinct on behalf of the state government, as well as the TAFE.

The install doubles the capacity of the 2.34 MW solar system already installed in Tonsley, specifically on the former car manufacturing plant and some of the TAFE’s rooftop, in 2019 to 2020.
CleanPeak Energy’s founder said the expanded system will now generate over 7,000 MWh of energy each year.
“Our next project at Tonsley is delivery of our 3.3 MWh battery which we expect will be online for summer,” Graham said on LinkedIn. 
The solar system expansion saw 80 pallets of solar panels, weighing up to 800kg each, airlifted onto the site’s roofline back in May. The 2,000 panels were then fitted to cover an area the size of 2.5 football fields.
Todd Perry, General Manager of Project Delivery and Property at Renewal SA, said the now completed system should see Tonsely fitted with 13,000 panels, 34 inverters and over 15,000 metres of electrical cables.
CleanPeak’s Graham has previously said the soon to be battery coupled system will allow the district to be supplied by 100% renewable energy.
Tonsley Innovation District today is home to the likes of Tesla, Siemens and has attracted project’s like the $14.5 million Hydrogen Park SA from Australian Gas Infrastructure Group, which is looking to blend hydrogen into its natural gas network. Flinders University has also set up a campus in the sprawling site.

Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen (LNVG) has started operating 14 hydrogen-powered trains, as part of its plans to gradually replace diesel locomotives on a 100 km stretch of track (60 km) in northwestern Germany. Alstom’s Coradia iLint trains are “now used on the world-premiere, 100% hydrogen train route, in passenger operation,” said the French industrial group. The train can run all day on one hydrogen tank, before being fuelled overnight at the Linde hydrogen filling station. The trains are outfitted with Cummins fuel cell systems. “Cummins will provide an additional 54 fuel cell systems to Alstom for an order of 27 Coradia iLint trains that will be delivered to the Frankfurt metropolitan area,” said the US company. They carried out trial runs for almost two years, in addition to Coradia iLint tests in Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden.
University of Connecticut researchers have developed a novel design for a tubular polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell with a replaceable inner electrode and electrolyte. The patent-pending concept design could have nearly twice the energy density of other tubular PEM fuel cells. Planar fuel cells use sandwich-like stacks of rectangular flow field plates made of graphite or metal, which account for about 80% of their weight and 40% of their cost. UConn’s design uses a single tube-shaped flow field that reduces its weight by half and requires fewer precious metals. The team said the novel design also addresses compression issues, uneven current distribution, problems with reactant gas transport, excess water removal, and fabrication challenges associated with the design of planar fuel cells. The concept is still in discovery and has I-Corps and Partnership for Innovation (PFI) funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF).
ABB and Hydrogen Optimised (HOI) have signed a new hydrogen-focused agreement. The deal includes an investment by ABB in Key DH Technologies, the parent company of HOI, to accelerate green hydrogen production. “The companies will leverage their respective capabilities and resources to rapidly commercialise HOI’s patented RuggedCell high-power water electrolysis technology,” wrote the Canadian company. HOI expects its high-power alkaline technology to be deployed in large-scale hydrogen plants in combination with ABB’s high-power rectifiers. The companies said they expect installations from hundreds of megawatts in size to multiple gigawatts. “Other technologies available now operate at low current, which limits the size of each installation – usually at or below 20 MW, and in many cases considerably less. It is the RuggedCell electrolyser’s high-power architecture that makes it possible to have single, large-scale installation of 100 MW and ultimately at gigawatt scale,” Hydrogen Optimized told pv magazine. The RuggedCell is iridium/platinum-free.
SPP-D said that its H2Pilot project in Blatná na Ostrove, Slovakia, shows that hydrogen can be safely distributed in existing gas grids. “From a technical point of view, the mixing device works reliably, dosing continuously and in the required volumes,” SPP-D’s press officer, Milan Vanga, told pv magazine. Chromatographic measurements performed on a weekly basis reportedly demonstrate the homogeneity of the distributed mixture, approximately 10% in all parts of the municipal network. “Inspection of the most risky appliances – 32 oldest and/or atmospheric boilers and 25 stoves – after a month of use with a 10% mixture showed positive results in all cases,” Vanga said, in reference to ignition, flame stability, and functionality. The gas distributor said that customers have not reported any relevant issues. SPP-D launched the project on June 15.
First Hydrogen has announced that its two hydrogen demonstrator vans have completed initial commissioning trials. This “step enables the vehicles to be tested in mixed road and driving conditions and to confirm performance ahead of First Hydrogen’s real-world operational trials with major fleet operators in early 2023,” said First Hydrogen.
Plug Power has signed a supply deal with Amazon to provide liquid green hydrogen starting in 2025. “Amazon and Plug have signed a deal for Plug to supply 10,950 tonnes per year of liquid green hydrogen to fuel Amazon operations,” wrote Plug Power. “Using Plug’s electrolysers, liquefaction capabilities and cryogenic tankers, Plug will deliver hydrogen to Amazon beginning Jan. 1, 2025.”
Namibian Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said last week that green hydrogen is set to become a core pillar in the country’s economic and developmental agenda. The government selected several green hydrogen pilot projects during a recent two-day conference. Four of them will receive NAD 500 million (AU$4.3 million) of German-backed funding. 
Germany has approved the co-financing of €223 million (AU$322m) for eight hydrogen projects around its biggest port, Hamburg. The German government has selected a total of 62 major industrial projects in Germany for federal and state funding.
Foton Mobility and Transit Systems have announced the arrival of the first two hydrogen fuel cell buses in Australia. Foton has manufactured and delivered more than 1,100 units, including 450 hydrogen buses used during the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. SinoHytec and Toyota jointly developed the fuel cell systems for the buses.

The China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association said the price of polysilicon reached CNY 312 (US$45.47/AU$65.8)/kg this week – the highest level ever recorded. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and China’s National Energy Administration have asked regional authorities to take action to halt price increases in the polysilicon industry. In a joint statement, the government agencies invited all regional authorities to coordinate their efforts to reduce prices. The notification encourages in-depth cooperation between polysilicon and wafer producers, wafer and cell producers, module and inverter manufacturers, and PV glass makers. It calls for the creation of strategic alliances, long-term agreements, and technical cooperation.
Longi recorded CNY 50.42 billion of revenue in the first up, with 43.64% year on year. Its net profit attributed to shareholders was CNY 6.48 billion, up 29.79% year on year. In the second quarter, the company posted revenue of CNY 31.82 billion and a net profit attributed to shareholders of CNY 3.82 billion. PV module shipment hit 18.02 GW in the first half, with just 320 MW for its own projects. Longi said it expects its total module shipments to reach the 50 GW to 60 GW range in 2022,  for a 30% share of the Chinese module market.
