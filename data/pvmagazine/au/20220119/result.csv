The Melbourne-based company said in an Australia stock exchange (ASX) announcement in late December that Tesla will take 8,000 tonnes of the 10,000 tonnes it plans to produce of natural graphite Active Anode Material (AAM) each year from the facility.
Following the news of the deal, Syrah Resources stock price rose sharply, increasing over 60%. 
As sales continue to grow rapidly in China, the U.S. and Europe (though not Australia), electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are urgently looking to secure raw materials needed to make batteries including graphite, nickel, lithium, and cobalt amid concerns global markets are deeply undersupplied.
International Graphite
Currently, China dominates the global supply of graphite anode materials, accounting for an estimated 70% to 85%. With the U.S. and Europe eager to diversify their supply chains, Australian companies are competing to emerge as viable alternatives with several companies developing battery-ready graphite material facilities, as well as mines themselves, both here and abroad. 
Syrah Resources’s Vidalia facility, located in Louisiana, processes graphite mined in Mozambique into anode material. The deal with Tesla will underpin Syrah Resources’s plan to expand the facility to reach a scale of 10kt/pa. The expansion is still awaiting a final investment decision, expected sometime this month.
With Tesla agreement conditional on a series of benchmarks being met in the coming years as the Vidalia facility develops, Syrah Resources has said it will continue to engage other target customers for mass production and additional long-term purchase commitments.

The company has told Fairfax media there’s no shortage of interest in this regard, suggesting additional expansion plans for both its Vidilia facility and Mozambique mine may be on the horizon.
South Australian company Renascor Resources is also in the graphite game, having last year raised $15 million from institutional investors fund its Siviour Battery Anode Material Project up to the construction phase. The company says the project is on track to become the world’s first integrated mine and purified spherical graphite operation outside of China.

Western Australian startup International Graphite is also working on building a graphite battery anode material hub in Collie, WA.
In October 2021, the company announced it had struck a deal to acquire Comet Resources’s Springdale graphite resource. The arrangement, it says, will enable it to create the state’s first vertically integrated graphite production facility, from mine to customer.

While Tesla remains the preeminent EV manufacturer in the U.S. and Europe, China is set to lead the industry’s growth. Its EV market grew by a whopping 158% in 2021 alone.
Australia is yet to experience such enthusiasm. According to a recent poll from the Australian Electric Vehicle Council, 54% of Australians would consider purchasing an EV as their next car though. So what’s keeping EV sales rate in new cars down at only 2%? Money.
While state governments, notably in New South Wales and Victoria, are introducing EV incentives, there remains little to no federal support. Coming back to the survey, it found 40% of Australians would be encouraged to purchase an EV if government subsidies were available to help offset initial costs.

The week-long run is even speculated to be record breaking for comparable grids around the world. 
Almost two thirds of the state’s power was sourced from wind, with rooftop solar accounting for almost 30% and solar farms around 6% during the period. 
South Australia is aiming to run completely on renewables by 2030, though it seems to be hitting that target with increasing regularity eight years early.

What the state really wants to do though is become a net exporter of green energy for Australia. In fact, it could already do so if transmission lines connecting South Australia to New South Wales and Victoria had more capacity.
The state is eagerly awaiting the realisation of Project EnergyConnect, a major interconnector linking it with NSW. The project is slated for commissioning in 2023 and will hopefully be completed by 2025. 
Just yesterday, one of the biggest renewable energy developers in Australia, French company Neoen, said it had started work on the first stage of what will be the state’s largest wind, solar and battery storage project, known as Goyder Renewables Zone.
This project, which is planning to install 1200 MW of wind, 600 MW of solar and 900 MW of battery storage capacity, can only be realised with the completion of Project Energy Connect, however.
Until new interconnectors are built, South Australia will likely be forced to continue curtailing its extensive renewable assets, just as it did during its shining week leading up to December 29.
In the past 30 days, rooftop solar accounted for an average of 24.7% of South Australia’s electricity demand; utility-scale solar farms came in at 7.4%, while wind averaged exactly 40%. In total, variable renewable energy provided an average of 72% of the state’s electricity.

Maoneng Philippines, seemingly the only regional arm of the Australian-based developer, on Tuesday confirmed the completion of a commercial and industrial (C&I) installation on the roof of the Wesleyan University.
The 202.4 KWp installation consisted on 440 Jinko modules mounted on just shy of 1000 square metres of rooftop at the university’s campus in Nueva Ecija.
Maoneng Philippines appears to have been established last year, in 2021, based on its website. Like its Australian owner, it provides Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) services, though the Philippine arm appears to focus squarely on providing solar systems for the C&I segment especially.
Maoneng Philippines
According to statistics released by the Department of Energy, the Philippines had an installed PV capacity of 1.06 GW at the end of June 2020.
The government of the Philippines plans to install 15 GW of renewables capacity by 2030.
Maoneng started out in Australia’s residential solar segment, but it is understood the company will increasingly focus on battery storage projects over the next few years. In November, the developer secured approval for its 225MWp / 450MWh Gould Creek Battery Energy Storage System project near Adelaide. In July, Maoneng made public its plan to build a 240 MWp/480 MWh big battery in Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, with a proposed location also adjacent to an existing substation.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/19/best-fire-safety-practices-for-rooftop-pv-system-installations/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,QUALITY,RESEARCH,RESIDENTIAL PV,MALAYSIA,WORLD",EMILIANO BELLINI,"JANUARY 19, 2022",Best fire safety practices for rooftop PV system installations,"From pv magazine Global
Researchers from the Universiti Putra Malaysia have defined a series of fire safety practices that solar installers should follow in the deployment of residential rooftop PV systems.
“Improper installation practices have been identified as a common factor contributing to PV fire hazards,” the research’s corresponding author, Mohd Zahirasri Mohd Tohir, told pv magazine. “This human error may be due to an unintentional action or indeed a deliberate violation of procedure. The first, mainly due to inexperienced installers or simply slippery actions by experienced workers. While the latter, due to time pressure and their ignorance of the consequences of fire safety. Regardless of the reason, both can be attributed to a lack of fire safety knowledge.”
According to Tohir, the annual fire incident frequency for PV installations is 0.029 fires per MW. “While the figure does not seem alarming, however, with the surge in global demand of PV systems as a green technology, if the issue is neglected and not curbed, the failure rate is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” he said. “That is why our work is seen as important in developing safe practices and knowledge sharing on fire safety management during PV system installation as a lack of understanding of the associated PV fire risks can lead to severe long-term consequences.”
The academics systematically reviewed the fire safety practices described in 40 PV installation guidelines that are publicly accessible. These include publications from PV manufacturers together and installation guidelines, as well as best practices handbooks. “It is worth mentioning that more than half of the selected installation guidelines reviewed are from the national agencies, regulatory bodies, and national associations and mostly are from the United States,” said the research team.
The proposed fire safety practices were categorised into 10 groups considering different factors: general practices to ensure the PV system is designed by qualified contractors only; site survey including size, shade management, accessway, tilt, orientation and location; roof structure and material; marking systems for all PV equipment including PV input and output, conduit, cabling, inverter, enclosures, combiner, box, and isolator switches; roof waterproofing and flashing; electrical cabling and grounding system; array mounting, ventilation and PV panels; combiner box and connectors; DC/AC inverter; and DC isolator and other protection devices.
“Prior to PV system installation, it is important to conduct a site evaluation to avoid the shading effect and determine the best orientation for maximum PV system output,” the scientists said. “Besides, good ventilation and airflow around the PV modules may prevent the phenomenon of a hot spot.” According to them, many fire accidents originated from DC isolators due to the water penetration into the enclosure caused by ignorant practices during installation. “However, the number of publications highlighting the installation of DC isolators, such as the dos and don’ts, is relatively small,” they also highlighted.
The best practices were presented in the paper Development of fire safety best practices for rooftops grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems installation using systematic review methodology, published in Sustainable Cities and Society.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/01/19/indian-battery-cell-production-scheme-gets-bids-for-130-gwh/,"DISTRIBUTED STORAGE,ENERGY STORAGE,MARKETS,INDIA",PV MAGAZINE,"JANUARY 19, 2022",Indian battery cell production scheme gets bids for 130 GWh,"From pv magazine India
An Indian Ministry of Heavy Industries tender to develop 50 GWh of advance-chemistry battery cell manufacturing units in India under its production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme has secured bids for 130 GWh of capacity.
Bids were received from a total of 10 companies, including Reliance New Energy Solar, Hyundai Global Motors, Ola Electric Mobility, Lucas-TVS, Mahindra & Mahindra, Amara Raja Batteries, Exide Industries, Rajesh Exports, Larsen & Toubro, and India Power.
Under the scheme, the selected bidders will have to set up manufacturing facilities within two years from the appointed date. The incentive will be disbursed thereafter over a period of five years on the sale of batteries manufactured in India.
The PLI scheme for battery storage is designed to ensure greater domestic value addition, while at the same time making sure that the levelised cost of battery manufacturing in India is globally competitive.
“This is great news and a major milestone for the Indian energy storage and e-mobility industry,” said Rahul Walawalkar, founder and president, India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA). “IESA was anticipating two to three bids of 15-20GWh, three bids of 10GWh+, and another three to four bids of 5GWH to 10GWh totalling 100GWh+ capacity to be bid in the ACC PLI.”
IESA estimates the annual demand for ACC batteries in India will grow from less than 10GWh currently to more than 50GWh by 2025 and over 150GWh by 2030. Thus, the ACC PLI scheme will be seen as the foundation stone on which India builds a global hub for R&D and the production of advanced energy storage technologies, Walawalkar said.
“ACC PLI program also will kick start investments in the supply chain as the program has a mandate of minimum 60% domestic value addition for receiving the government incentive,” said Debi Prasad Dash, executive director of the India Energy Storage Alliance.
India imports millions of dollars of battery storage equipment per year. If advanced battery storage technologies can be manufactured domestically, the country will be able to significantly reduce its reliance on imports and become a key supplier for advanced storage technologies.
