AVL managing director Vincent Algar said the non-exclusive MoU will allow VSUN to assist in the development of NCHE’s existing and future VRFB projects.
“In working together on VRFB projects, VSUN Energy and NHCE will have the opportunity to support the development of large projects through access to a company with strong funding capability,” he said.
“Jointly the companies aim to grow the Australian vanadium energy storage sector and do justice to this Australian-invented technology.”
VSUN has been pursuing the development of VRFBs for residential and commercial applications in Australia and the Asia Pacific region. The intent is to utilise high-purity vanadium pentoxide produced from AVL’s mining operation in Western Australia’s Murchison province and processing plant near Geraldton to supply the VRFB projects.
NHCE provided no specific details about its existing or proposed projects but said it is focused on the development of renewable energy and energy storage projects. It also said it is working with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) to optimise VRFB cell design.
NHCE managing director Tony Schultz said long-duration energy storage is in its infancy in the Australian market but has the potential to scale up quickly and the VRFB is a proven, commercialised product that can help complement the company’s use of pumped hydro energy storage.
“This technology is perfectly suited to long-duration stationary energy storage, has a number of advantages over alternative technologies and Australia has a unique opportunity given its invention of the technology in the 1980s, coupled with our large share of known vanadium resources,” he said in a statement.
NHCE, which is also part of a $270 million industry-backed clean energy research initiative being led by UNSW and the University of Newcastle, said it is interested in supply of vanadium electrolyte from AVL, product selection and project development support from VSUN, and the ability to position Australia as a centre of excellence and a key player in the global VRFB supply chain.
“We look forward to partnering with VSUN Energy to help accelerate the implementation of VRFBs at industrial scale into the Australian energy market, allowing the rapid uptake of renewable energy to continue,” Schultz said.

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/26/dan-murphys-drinks-in-success-of-rooftop-rollout/,"COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL PV,INSTALLATIONS,AUSTRALIA,WESTERN AUSTRALIA",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2022",Dan Murphy’s drinks in success of rooftop rollout,"Dan Murphy’s, a part of Woolworths spinoff Endeavour Group, has unveiled the latest addition to its national rooftop solar PV portfolio with a 74kW system installed atop its bottleshop in the Western Australia coastal town of Mandurah.
Dan Murphy’s national renewal operations manager Tyson Holbery said the roof of the Mandurah Dan Murphy’s outlet has been fitted with 164 solar panels with the PV system set to generate renewable energy which will be used to offset the store’s environmental footprint and reduce energy costs.
“The system is estimated to generate enough solar energy to offset 31% of the store’s annual power consumption and save approximately 80 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually,” he said.
Holbery said the Mandurah install is the latest in the company’s solar program with almost 20% of the 268 Dan Murphy’s Australian stores now fitted with solar PV. Collectively the rooftop systems have generated more than 8,000MWh of renewable energy, the equivalent of the average annual electricity use of more than 1,400 households. Holbery said the milestone had been achieved in just three years.
“What makes the switch of Mandurah Dan Murphy’s to solar power particularly exciting is that it marks the milestone of being the 50th Dan Murphy’s store across the country operated by solar energy,” he said.
Holbery said the rooftop solar rollout would continue in 2022 with Endeavour Group, the liquor retailer and pubs owner spun out by retail giant Woolworths in 2021, having committed to sourcing 100% renewable electricity by the end of the decade to power the Dan Murphy’s business and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
“We are making our stores more sustainable, and energy use is a big part of our efforts,” Holbery said. “Western Australia is a great market for solar returns and we are proud to have Mandurah Dan Murphy’s added to our solar energy fleet.”

https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2022/05/26/acen-commences-construction-of-new-england-big-battery/,"ENERGY STORAGE,UTILITY SCALE STORAGE,AUSTRALIA,NEW SOUTH WALES",DAVID CARROLL,"MAY 26, 2022",ACEN commences construction of New England big battery,"AC Energy Corporation (ACEN) Australia, a subsidiary of Philippines-based conglomerate Ayala Corporation, announced this week it had broken ground on the 50MW, one-hour battery energy storage system that the developer expects will play a critical role in addressing the intermittency of renewable energy as Australia transitions to a renewables-dominated grid.
The lithium-ion battery energy storage system (BESS) will be built alongside the 400MW first stage of the New England Solar Farm being constructed about six kilometres east of Uralla. The $768 million project is being developed within the proposed New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), which has been identified by the state government to host the development of up to 8GW of renewable generation capacity.
Combined with the solar farm, the battery storage system, which has scope to be scaled up to 200MW/400MWh in the future, will be one of Australia’s largest co-located solar and battery energy storage facilities.
ACEN Australia chief executive officer Anton Rohner said the BESS will improve system strength and grid reliability in the National Electricity Market, allowing more low-cost renewable energy to connect to the grid.
“Aside from supporting grid reliability, the battery will also allow for generation shifting, so that energy can be stored and then discharged into the grid when it is most needed,” he said.
“The New England battery can also be scaled up to 200MW with two hours of storage capacity in response to the needs of consumers and the grid.”
The New England solar project is being built in two stages, with Green Light Contractors (GLC), the Australian EPC arm of Spain-based company Elecnor, confirming work is well under way on the 400MW first stage and the 33/330 kilovolt (kV) substation being installed across the northern section of the site.
Construction of the first stage of the solar and storage project is expected to be completed in 2023. Once the entire 720MW project is complete, it is anticipated it will produce 1,800GWh of renewable electricity each year, enough to power more than 250,000 typical NSW homes.

The project was originally developed by UPC\AC Australia, a 50:50 joint venture (JV) between ACEN and Hong Kong-headquartered clean energy group UPC Renewables. It is now being driven by ACEN Australia after ACEN earlier this year increased its ownership in the JV to 80%, with the intent to be at 100% ownership by early 2023.
The acquisition triggered a rebranding of UPC\AC Renewables but ACEN president and chief executive officer Eric Francia said the approach would remain unchanged.
“While the UPC\AC Renewables name and brand is changing to ACEN Australia, our highly capable Australian team will remain in place, and our approach to building long-term relationships built on trust with our host communities, and other stakeholders remains the same,” he said.
Francia said the company was excited to be expanding its renewable energy portfolio and “contributing to Australia’s transition to a clean energy future”.
“ACEN has been a partner of UPC Renewables since 2018 and we are immensely proud of the work already achieved on the New England Solar project by the team,” he said.
ACEN Australia’s pipeline of projects includes the 400MW Stubbo Solar Farm and associated 200 MW/200 MWh battery energy storage project; a share in the Rise Renewables 250MW Baroota pumped hydro and 300MW Bridle Track solar projects in South Australia; the proposed 600MW Birriwa solar farm and battery project near Dunedoo in NSW; and the 160MW Axedale Solar Farm in central Victoria, which may also come to include a battery energy storage system.
The New England battery project is underpinned by $12.5 million grant from the state government’s Emerging Energy Program.

Back then Scaysbrook described the United States as “the most opportunity-rich market in the energy transition” with the UK running a very close second, whereas Australia was “really a bit of a non-event in terms of the scale and volume of investment opportunity, particularly for institutional investors”. 
However, following the historic 2022 Federal Election which saw Labor sweep to power with a trail of Teals and Greens, the major infrastructure investor believes the scene is set for a massive influx of institutional green capital into Australia. 
“This is now a very significant market opportunity by global standards, and what’s attractive about it is the sheer scale of it and the timeframe over which it has to be achieved,” Scaysbrook told AFR. 
“This is putting Australia back on the map in the eyes of global institutions looking at renewables and decarbonising industry,” continued Scaysbrook. 
In the last 12 to 18 months QIP has deployed more than $2 billion of equity into low-carbon infrastructure and renewables, mainly in the UK and the US as its Australian projects were delayed by the tardiness of the Morrison government, or simply deemed too risky because Australia’s states were having to do the hard work of emissions reduction without much federal support. 
QIP has about 20% of its portfolio in Australia, including two 30 MW plants producing biogas from sugar cane waste in Byron Bay; a specialist green energy retailer called Energy Locals that provides businesses with the tools to set up their own energy plan and is also partnered with Tesla in the SA VPP; Energy Trade, one of Australia’s largest behind-the-meter, community energy network businesses; and APAC Green Data, a developer of data centre campuses — so far one in Queensland and another in New South Wales — which deliver low-cost 24/7 renewable power to help customers meet their carbon-reduction targets.
Scaysbrook told AFR that after Saturday’s election a new opportunity for private capital has opened, an opportunity to help fund the investment needed to meet a “truly stunning” goal for renewables growth this decade. 
“Here in Australia, we do have a champion of hydrogen in Fortescue Future Industries … but they’re not the only ones that are out there in the world that are getting prepared to make very, very significant capital commitments to drive this forward,” he said. 
“In Australia we have what most other countries don’t have, that they relish, and this is large tracts of land that can be developed for solar and wind production. We have access to port facilities, we have relatively good shipping access to export markets. So we have a lot of the things that the rest of the world would love to have if they were trying to develop these green export industries.” 
Brave new world
Newly-elected prime minister Anthony Albanese has promised to make the nation a “renewable energy superpower” in the wake of Labor’s federal election victory at the weekend.
“We are the greatest country on earth. But we can have an even better future if we seize the opportunities that are right there in front of us. The opportunity to shape change, rather than be shaped by it,” he said.
“Together we can end the climate wars. Together we can take advantage of the opportunity for Australia to be a renewable energy superpower.”
Federal Labor has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 43% by 2030 based on 2005 emissions levels, boost renewables, boost demand for electric vehicles (EVs) through tax breaks and help build community-owned solar power and battery projects.
Labor’s Powering Australia Plan would see renewable capacity grow to 26GW, or 82% of all NEM generation by 2030. The plan also assumes that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up 89% of new car sales in Australia by the end of the decade.
Labor’s approach centres on a $20 billion government intervention to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy. The policy is designed to bring forward the construction of high-voltage infrastructure by lowering financial and planning barriers to unlock the commercial development of large-scale renewable energy resources.
The party’s Powering Australia Plan also includes $200 million to install 400 community batteries, $100 million for the development of shared ‘solar banks’, and a commitment to reduce the emissions of the Australian Public Service to net-zero by 2030.
Australia just took a big step toward becoming a global clean energy superpower. Let’s get back in the race! #ausvotes
— Kane Thornton (@kanethornton) May 21, 2022

Clean Energy Council (CEC) CEO Kane Thornton posted a letter to new Climate Change & Energy Minister Chris Bowen on Twitter this week, urging Bowen to make good on renewable energy pledges. “I hope you’re well rested,” said Thornton, “because there’s a lot to do, and not a minute to waste.” 
“Mind, you do not have to do everything,” Thornton continued. “State and territory governments responded to the policy vacuum and stepped up … If we get it right, we put Australia back on the path to becoming a global clean energy superpower and restore our rightful place as a glowing example of a modern and prosperous economy powered by reliable, low-cost, clean energy. Saturday showed the Australian public is with us, so let’s get to it.”

Canadian Solar has reversed plans to halt expansion of its wafer and cell production capacities this year. The Chinese-Canadian manufacturer and developer had said in its third-quarter update last year that no new wafer and cell production lines would be added this year.
The Ontario-headquartered company’s first-quarter update, however, saw Chairman and CEO Shawn Qu announce “an acceleration of our upstream capacity expansion plan for 2022.” The CSI Solar manufacturing business, due to be spun out with an initial public offering in China, will now aim to reach 20 GW of annual wafer production capacity this year, up from 11.5 GW currently, and 19.8 GW of cell output, up from 13.9 GW.
With the company’s 23.9 GW of annual module production capacity due to rise from the current 23.9 GW to 27.9 GW, in June, the target of reaching 32 GW this year remains unchanged. The effect of rising input costs – specifically polysilicon price inflation cited by CSI Solar President Yan Zhuang – was spelled out in the latest update.
First-quarter net income of US$9 million (AU$12 million) was down from US$26 million (AU$36 million) in the previous window, and US$23 million (AU$32 million) in the first three months of last year. Zhuang said Canadian Solar partially mitigated the rise by raising its own prices and also stockpiled inventories of raw material to hedge against inflation.
During the first quarter, “logistic[s] costs started to come down,” the CSI Solar chief said, with currencies “starting to move in our favour after two years of headwinds.” The company banked a currency gain of $3 million in January to March, up from $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of $7 million a year earlier.
Qu said currency gains and bigger sales would help the company to US$7 billion to $7.5 billion (AU$9.8 – $10.5 billion) of revenue this year. The quarterly figures were also helped by a Canadian tax refund which contributed to a three-month tax benefit of US$5 million. Total debt rose from US$2.5 billion at the end of 2021 to US$2.7 billion at the end of March.
Canadian Solar’s Global Energy project development business booked a first-quarter net loss of US$1 million, down from a US$14.7 million loss in the previous quarter and an US$85 million profit a year earlier. CSI Solar contributed a US$31.9 million quarterly profit, down from US$81.6 million, quarter over quarter, but up from a US$52.7 million loss a year earlier.
The manufacturer shipped 3.63 GW of panels in the first three months of the year. Canadian Solar expects to ship 4.9 GW to 5.1 GW of modules in the current window for 20 GW to 22 GW this year.
The company owns 800 MWp of solar generation capacity and wants 1.3 GWp in 2026. Global Energy has 1.1 GWp of projects under construction and another 4.2 GWp due to be built within four years, with an emphasis on Latin America.
North America is the focus of the company’s energy storage projects at present. The company expects revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion in the current quarter, at gross margin of 14.5% to 15.5%.
Canadian Solar expects to sell 2.1 GW to 2.6 GW of project capacity this year. It plans to install 1.8 GWh to 1.9 GWh of battery storage capacity.

The rise of Chinese companies in the field of fuel-cell transport technology has been highlighted in a report by UN agency the World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo).
The Geneva-based body said 69% of the patent applications related to hydrogen fuel cells came from China. That contrasted with the picture eight years earlier, when China was the fifth-largest source of innovative proposals in the field.
Companies in Japan hold the largest number of existing patents for transport-related fuel-cell tech, followed by businesses in the United States, South Korea, and Germany. But the authors of the Wipo report published last week suggested Chinese companies will overtake them, based on the number of patents emerging from the nation.
The study concerned patent numbers submitted between 2016 and 2020, a period which saw a 23.4% rise in patent applications for technology to generate electricity for transport from hydrogen and oxygen. Road transport was by far the largest application for the patents submitted, although there has been a rapid rise in innovation for specialist uses such as construction vehicles, forklifts, and airport tugs, Wipo stated.
Japan was the second-largest source of patents in 2020, the UN body added, with the 1,186 submissions from that nation amounting to 11.3% of the total. Some 6.2% of the year’s applications came from Germany, 5.6% were from South Korea, and the 403 filed in the United States added up to 3.8%. This means the rest of the world supplied 4.4%.
Companies submitted almost eight out of 10 of the patents filed in 2020, Wipo said, with the top 30 businesses accounting for 40% of the year’s patents. There was only one non-commercial originator among the top 30: the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an entity under the State Council of China.
